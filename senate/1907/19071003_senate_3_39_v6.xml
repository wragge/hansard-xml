                        <para>- As was suggested in the course of ' the debate yesterday, I arranged this morning to procure for the Senate particulars in connexion with the claims relating' to the lands for the rifle range, and they should be available this week. With regard to the claims for the lands in respect of the battery, which I may say is near the rifle range, these are to some extent bound up with the other claims, because they were settled at the same time. I shall be pleased to supply to honorable senators full particulars regarding them also. </para>

                    <para> We gave careful consideration to the. question whether it would be in order for documents of this character to be laid upon the table of each House of this Parliament. While recognising, and desiring to recognise, to the fullest possible extent any representations  which may be made by the Government or  :Parliament of a State, we could find no pre- !. cedent to justify us in tabling such a document: ' From time immemorial the practice has been to approach Parliament by means of a petition. Had this document been. framed in the form of a petition it would have been entirely unchallengeable so far as laying it upon the table was concerned. We thought that we would exceed the powers which properly appertain to our offices if we, on our own responsibility, were to table the document. We felt, moreover, that the question of the Tariff had been expressly taken out of the jurisdiction of the States Parliaments, and had passed into the exclusive control of the" Commonwealth. This Parliament represents the people of the various States, and its members are returned for the purpose of dealing with such questions as representatives qf the electors and States, and not as representatives of the States Parliaments. Of course, the rights of the members of this Parliament .received very full consideration at our hands. We considered that the proper course to take was to explain that we were unable to deal with the document unless it was forwarded in the form of a petition. We sent a reply, of the nature which I have indicated. </para>

                        <para>. - I think it desirable to make mention of one or two calculations which I have made with regard to this matter. For the information of the Senate, I may mention that there are 43,560 square feet in one acre. If we pay at the rate of 15s. per square foot for this land, at twenty-five years' purchase, it represents a freehold costing £816,750 per acre. If we base the calculation upon a thirty years' purchase - and that is not an unreasonable rate, because, at present in Sydney, for part of the Cooper Estate, you have to calculate on the basis of quite thirty years' ground rent to purchase the fee simple - and if we take the same rate of 15s. per foot, the cost of the freehold would run into , £980,100 per acre. I think that it is just as well we should recognise these facts. When I was speaking on Friday I made rather a stupid mistake in speaking . of land in St. Paul's Churchyard as being sold at , £1,000,000 "per foot" frontage. 'I should have said "per acre." , Well, the land for which we are negotiating would, if we were buying the freehold, cost pretty well £1,000,000 per acre. I may add that I do not think the site a bad one, but I am one of those who regret that the Commonwealth Government did not seek the co-operation of the States before entering into negotiations for the acquisition of the property. Therefore, I did not see my way to vote for the item yesterday afternoon. Probably the best site  from our point of view would be one in Trafalgar Square, but I recognise that it would be almost impossible to get land there even- for so high a price as we are proposing to give for this. </para>

                        <para>.- I think it must be admitted by the Government that, considering the somewhat loose manner in which this subject was brought before the Senate and the paucity of definite information in regard to it, they have been treated generously by honorable senators in agreeing to the item as they have done. I should have been pleased if in moving the third reading of the Bill the Vice-President of the Executive Council had intimated in some way what immediate steps the Government intend to take next to secure the co-operation of the States. </para>

                            <para>- I was out of the Chamber a little while last night, and may, therefore, have missed the Minister's explanation. The gist of the opposition to the proposal was simply that the States were not consulted, and that there was no assurance that they would join with us. Of course, if they do not, the whole thing will be a failure. For years I have advocated the grouping of Australian interests in the heart of the Empire. My feelings with regard to that matter were . intensified extremely when I happened to be in London for a month or two myself, and saw the way in which Australia was represented in that great city. I found that each of the States had its own little agency, some in one part of London and some in another, without any recognition of cognate interests or of unity of interest in any shape or form. I did not find that in' regard to Canada. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> pointed out last night, you find in London that Canada only is talked about when the British Empire is under discussion. You do not hear Australia mentioned. When people speak of the Dominion they do not mean Ontario, Manitoba, or Quebec, but they speak of Canada. It is desirable that we should have grouped representation as quickly as possible. While I sympathize to  some extent with the remarks made on this side of the Chamber, the desirableness of having the States grouped together should by no means be lost sight of. If we lose this opportunity it is possible that we may not secure another for a long time. I feel that if we waited until we got the whole of the States into line we might have to wait very long. 'In the meantime what is to happen? Are we to continue to drift as we have been doing, and do nothing to secure a proper recognition of our interests in London? </para>

At present each of the' States has its own agency, its own office, and its own separate expenses, which must be considerable. By coming together they will save money, they will make for unity of action, and certainly they will be able' to arrange for a far better display of Australian products and resources than they can do when scattered about that great city.

                    <para class="block">Canadian caravan when I was in England, and I can assure the Senate that I have seen on one stall at the Kerang Show, in the north of Victoria, four or five times the quantity of produce that I saw in the whole caravan. Some years ago, I myself gave a prize for the largest number of exhibits from any one 'farm; and from one farm alone the exhibits totalled several hundreds. I was very much disappointed when I saw the travelling Canadian exhibition, if honorable senators consider the position of the two countries, they will realize that there can be no comparison between them in regard to their capacity for production. Canada occupies a geographical area from about 45 degrees of latitude to 65 degrees, while we in Australia occupy ah area of from 10 degrees to 42 degrees. Consequently there is scarcely a product in the world that is not either found in Australia or can be produced here. Therefore, we can, if we like, make a much better display than the Canadians can. I think that these considerations justify the step that has been taken by the Government, and they justify those who voted for the acquisition of the Strand site on each occasion when, the matter has been before us. But just now I wish especially to ask the Government in all earnestness to lose no time in endeavouring to bring the States into line. I trust that they will proceed with this matter with tact and energy. </para>

                            <para>- As my honorable friend reminds me, some honorable senators opposite by their votes and their logical speeches rendered us valuable assistance. I only wish that my honorable friend could have induced some of those with whom he usually associates to vote with him. The objection taken to the item, I venture to say, was in no sense an objection to the early and effective representation of Australian interests in London. The whole ground of objection was one of procedure. The policy of the Government was to acquire an area of land sufficient for- our maximum requirements before we knew exactly what those requirements were. We, on this side of the Chamber, said that the Government should first ascertain what the requirements were, and then secure land suitable to. represent them. The whole position was as if the Government had said, " We desire to provide a coat for the Commonwealth,- and for each of the six States," and if, before knowing whether the whole of the States wanted coats, or whether they would accept them, they proceeded to manufacture enough cloth to make coats for the whole seven. Our argument was that the Government should have ascertained how many of these separate entities wanted' coats, and how many would accept them;, and having done that, they should have ordered the cloth. That illustration will' make clear the -view which honorable senators on this side of the Chamber pressed, I am sorry to say ineffectively. I have one other question to put. I am interested, as the Senate will be, to know whether the Government are in possession of arty further information bearing upon the negotiations with the London County Council. With the earlier stages of those negotiations the Vice-President of the Executive Council has already made us familiar. He has explained them as: carried up to the point where certain instructions were sent to Captain Collins. I do not ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to disclose the details of what has been going on. </para>

If they approached the Premier of Western Australia, saying, "You have an office in London, will you. bring your office into our building?" would the Premier of Western Australia be'regarded'"as. a business man - the Qualification that is so praised and admired by my honorable friends opposite - if he said "yes." when he did not know whether the building was going to be in the Strand, Westminster, or Timbuctoo? </para>

                            <para>- In some States there are Ministers in the Legislative Council, which represents only a section of the people. Are we to assume that the States Governments are going to take up an un- Australian attitude, that they will sav "No, it is more to the advantage of Australia that our offices should be scattered all over London in by-ways and lanes, where even our own citizens cannot find them?" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCoII</inline> and . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> told us that when they went to London they could not 'find the States, offices. Are we to assume, then, from the criticism  of honorable senators opposite that every State Premier in Australia is an unbusinesslike man, and does not recognise the advantage of having a central site? Are we to assume that all the States Premiers fail to recognise the advantages, which have been brought before us by honorable senators on <inline font-style="italic">both</inline> sides, of all the States offices being under the one roof? The arguments used appealed to me as being extremely unbusiness-like. Coming as they did from gentlemen who have deservedly such high reputations as business men. I could not help thinking that they were being used with the tongue in the cheek, and that those honorable senators were more carried away by their party feelings than led by their business instincts. </para>

When I see men who have a reputation as business men taking such pronouncedly stupid and unbusiness-like action, I begin to think that, after all, I shall have some claim to be recognised as a business man in the future. I believe that the States Premiers are just as patriotic as we are, and will recognise the advantage of making a common centre for Australia in London. I believe also that, having this central site, the Commonwealth will be able to offer them better terms than could any other landlord in London. It will be to the interests of the Commonwealth to do so, and, therefore, even on that low business ground- </para>

I do not see why there should be this wriggling and turning and twisting. I said on the second reading, that I believed that the Government had gone about the matter in a most unbusiness-like fashion, or that, if they had done their business in London in a proper way they had certainly not done so in their method of submitting the matter to Parliament. With regard to the other matter, about consulting the States, while I believe that the States ought to have been consulted, and that it would have been prudent on the part of the Commonwealth to ascertain the minds of the States Premiers on the subject, and find out whether they would be willing to co-operate with the Commonwealth, still I do not allow that consideration to weigh very much with me. One House of the Australian Parliament has authorized the Government to go on with the proposal to take this lease, and, I presume, to erect this building. I expect that the other House of the Parliament will very soon add its authority, so that the Australian Government and Australian Parliament will have decided to lease land and erect an edifice representative of Australia in London. That being the case, I do not see how the States Premiers, unless they are going to be exceedingly disloyal to Australia, and also to their own constituents, to whom they are responsible, can avoid coming in with the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- We agree up to that point. We know that there is a very great deal of jealousy existing at the present moment between the States and Federal authorities. I think it is inevitable that as the Federation grows the States will shrink in importance until ultimately the only entity so far as the outside world is concerned will be Australia, and the States as individual portions of the Commonwealth will disappear almost as completely as the States of the United States or the Provinces of the Dominion of Canada have disappeared. </para>

                            <para>- Commonwealth legislation up to the present has been excellent, and I have no fault to find with it. Notwithstanding the disloyal utterances of certain States Premiers  and members of States Parliaments, and of municipal and shire, councils,I see no evidence that the legislation of . the Commonwealth Parliament is likely to be injurious to Australia as a whole. I think the lesson of loyalty to the Federation should be continually preached to our States Premiers- and Parliaments. </para>

I do not even forget that the individual electors of the Commonwealth are the parents of the Commonwealth, and that they have more power and are more directly represented in the Commonwealth Parliament, than in any other Parliament in Australia. Indeed this is the only Parliament in which the people as a whole can speak with undivided voice. In every other Parliament in Australia a parasitic influence is at work. In this Parliament nothing of the kind exists. This is the only Parliament in Australia in which the free voice of the people can be heard, and can make itself effective. So that the sooner the talk about interfering with States, rights is done away with, the better it will be for everybody. </para>

I do not, know . that 'what was meant was that there -were two' extensions of time, pr that there was an option' and : one extension of the option. But we know that negotiations in connexion with this matter -were. begun at the latter end of May, and we have the word of the -Acting -Prime Minister, in his place in Parliament, for. the statement that the extension of time would expire on the 26th September. This represents a period inall of 'four months - from the 26th. Mayi' when the negotiations were commenced, to the 26th September, when the extension of time- referred to- terminated. We know that the acting head of . the Government has' repeatedly used the term " option " in his' communications to representatives of the press regarding this matter. That is what some honorable senators myself included, take exception to. The Government had an option, or some agreement or promise, for an option. It might not have . been a. binding option. There might not have been any money paid for it: I have stated., in my place here that I should be, willing to vote£1,000 to secure a legitimate, option, . so that negotiations might be entered into. That would be a business arrangement. I do not know; whether

                            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says, options, in such . transactions are not paid for. But in transactions concerning property of large value, it is customary to pay something for an option. If the Government had paid a sum of money to secure a  binding  option in this matter, I should have been the last to find fault with them. If they had a binding option for this property, they might have done what honorable senators on this side claim they should have done, namely, entered into negotiations with those whom they desire to have for their tenants. If the proposed building is to be one of six stories, and we. are to have it occupied bv seven tenants, there may be some difficulty in arranging the matter. Possibly the States Governments are to be given a floor each, and the Commonwealth Government will occupy the cellar. This is  a  detail, but it ought , to be looked into. What State Government would care to have their offices skied 'up under the roof, like a half-discarded picture at an  art  exhibition? If the proposal suggested be carried out, some State Government will have to take offices under the roof, and some, apparently, will have to be content with the basement. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> prefaced his remarks by admitting that' he was, not acquainted with business customs, and then proceeded to castigate business men for unbusiness-like habits h.e displayed  a  splendid temerity. The honorable senator was vigorous in his denunciation of honorable senators on this side, who. have spent  a  lifetime in business transactions with business men., and who, by all rule, should have some  knowledge  of what constitutes a business proposal. I should not be prepared to attack the conduct of a class of transaction with which I was wholly unacquainted, and I certainly should not attempt to castigate members of the Senate, for not handling properly a matter of which I possessed no . knowledge and no capacity to. criticise. There  is  one matter which was referred to last night  that  I  wish to  mention. I wish to say something- about ammunition waggons, and perhaps a change from Strand palaces to ammunition waggons  for  a moment may be  a relief  to those who are suffering from the " tired feeling ' ' on the subject of the Strand transaction. Through the courtesy of the Secretary for the Defence Department, I; obtained just now copies of correspondence that passed between the Department and myself on the subject of ammunition waggons. It is not necessary that I should quote the correspondence at length. I wrote to the Minister of Defence, on the 26th March last, and I may read the last sentence of the letter. I wrote - </para>

                    <para>Two days later, I received a wire from the Minister to say that there was only one pattern waggon in the Commonwealth, and that he would communicate with me in a few days as Che officers were at camp. That telegram. was dated 28th March, but. I did not get my promised reply until the- 19th April, or fully four weeks after the tenders for this£20,000 worth of waggons had closed. I never heard before of the clerical staff of the Defence Department being away at camp. It is not usual I think for the Secretary for the Defence Department and the clerks to go into camp. It is an almost unheard ot thing, and I fancy there must have been some mistake. </para>

                    <para>SenatorColonel NEILD. - I cannot tell the honorable senator; but, on the- 19th April, a letter was addressed to me by the Acting Secretary for Defence, in which I was informed that there was only one sample waggon and limber in the Commonwealth, and to have sent the same round to all the. States, in turn would have occupied some time, and involved considerable expense. That was a bit of departmental bluff, because I had not made such a request. It stand's to reason that this class of waggon, which costs between£750 and £800, could only be built in very few establishments in the Commonwealth. With the greatest respect I doubt if there would have- been many tenderers except from one or two of the leading States. It was a large transaction. It is possible to build a railway carriage at the cost of one of these waggons. That there would have been many tenderers seems tome exceedingly improbable, but I did not ask for the sample waggon to be sent round to all the States: It would have been a different thing if such an application had  come in from all the States. The point I desire to make is that in New South Wales there were competent persons to tender, and that they wanted to be put on the same terms in making their tenders as were the folks in Victoria. Surely that was not an unreasonable request ! . I think that some step ought to have been taken to give to competent tenderers in such States as they may exist in the same opportunities as were given to practically' one firm in Victoria, which obtained a £20,000 contract virtually without -competition. The firm are to be allowed from March, when the tenders closed, until the end df next June - a year and three months - in which to build the waggons. That, I think, is an unheard pf thing. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose that they have secured a reliable priesthood to pray for peace until the waggons are made. Why was the Commonwealth put to the expense of paying for the guns years before the waggons were provided? The guns are absolutely useless without waggons, and therefore the taxpayers have been burdened with useless artillery, while a particular firm, without competition, is attempting, in the course of fifteen months, to build the waggons in which to carry the ammunition. That is a position of affairs which is not creditable to those responsible for its existence. I do not know exactly which official is responsible for the matter in its original form, but clearly the members of the Military Board and the Minister must have some responsibility. Though the Minister does not sit in this Chamber, two of his colleagues do, and they must be prepared to shoulder a reasonable share of his responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- At the other end of the world there have been occasions when men have been court-martialled for less. If a war suddenly breaks out, what are we to do? Are we to wait for nine months while the contractor dawdles with the building of waggons which are  eminently  necessary for the defence of the Commonwealth? It is most painful and humiliating that the Commonwealth cannot get a few wooden waggons built in less than a year and a quarter. It is not needful that I should read any more of the correspondence. I have shown that the matter was pressed upon the Ministry by a member of .the Legislature, and that they apparently had no proper consideration for the interests of the Commonwealth in the matter of defence, otherwise the contract would have been let in a different manner. It would have been quite proper to divide the work between two firms of competent carriage builders in Melbourne, or Adelaide, or Brisbane, or Sydney. </para>

                        SYMON (South Australia) [3.35]. - I wish to refer very briefly to the item for the acquisition of a site in London. It is high time that the Commonwealth had a habitation as well as a name in London. Its present offices are in, certainly, a great street, but a most inconvenient part. Unless one makes a search for the particular .block it is very difficult to find the offices, and when he finds them there is no effective advertisement, so far as the building is concerned, to call attention to the fact that there is such a great continent as Australia. Then there is no other place in London where there is anything in the nature of an advertisement for Australia. The offices of the Agents-General, are in different places. The. South Australian offices are in the city : the other offices are scattered about in Queen, Victoria Street, Westminster, and so on- I am bound to say that neither has an attempt been made nor has any success been attained in stamping Australia upon the notice of the people of London, or, for the matter of that, of England. While we complain, and perhaps not unjustly, of a want of knowledge of Australia. and its resources in all parts of the old country, we are absolutely to blame for that fact. Where the Commonwealth offices should be established is a question of considerable importance. 'There are two localities - at either end of London, so to speak - each of which has its own recommendations and advantages. If the offices are to be merely a centre for immediate business transactions in connexion with banks, inscription of stork, and so on, I suppose that a site in what is known as the city proper should be chosen; but there would be great difficulty, and probably enormous expense, in securing a suitable site in that part. On the other hand, if* it were merely required' for something ambassadorial, the neighbourhood of Queen Victoria Street or Westminster generally would afford a very suitable locality. But, considering that in respect of both of those positions there are disadvantages, including the probable very large expense, I ' think that the locality chosen is one of the best in which a site could be secured. Some years ago it probably would not have offered the same recommendations as it does now, because the Strand then was not exactly : the place where we would then have put such a building as is contemplated, in order to house the Commonwealth, if not also the States, and to bring about an advertising success. The Strand was not like the city. It was an enormous business thoroughfare, consisting largely of retail houses and so on. I think that it would have offered many disadvantages then. It is in the locality of the Strand that all the cafes, theatres, and music halls are to be found, and these mav not be quite the surroundings in which we would like to place the unsophisticated representative of Australia. But of recent years there has been a very great alteration in the Strand. . The selected site is opposite Somerset House. It is near the Law Courts, which is a distinct advantage, and also near the site of - the London establishment of the- great Dominion of , Canada. If it can be secured on reasonable terms, the Commonwealth cannot do very much better. At the same time, the Government have not dealt with the question as they ought to have done. It would not have been very satisfactory to have rejected this item, because the whole matter would then have been thrown into' confusion. Whilst it might have been a very good way of expressing disappointment with the method which the Government has adopted, the rejection of the item would simply have meant that the whole thing would have gone bv the board, and that possibly we should have been without an opportunity of dealing with the question. This is a very large transaction. It will involve, I suppose, outgoings amounting to £14,000 or £15,000 a year. It would, have been more business-like and very much better if, before entering into negotiations, the Government had endeavoured to settle the question of what area they would require, and how they could utilize it. When a man wants to build a house or business premises, and desires to secure a piece of land for the purpose, he first determines what his requirements will be, so that he mav not buy more land than he will absolutely require. From that point of view, I think that the Government ought to have formulated a scheme and endeavoured to arrange with the States for the consolidation of their London offices in one building.

                            <para>- Take the position- of South Australia. She would say, " We have our own offices in the centre of the city near the Bank of England and all the other financial houses, where for many years we have inscribed our own stock, paid the interest thereon, and thereby saved much money." We all know that there is a jealousy - to some extent a perfectly proper jealousy - on the part of each State in regard to the control of its own business affairs. It will take some time before that feeling is broken down. It would have been a wiser thing if the Government had made some effort, before they decided to negotiate for any particular area, to ascertain how that area was likely to be occupied. They might have failed in inducing the States to come in. I do not say that they would have failed, because, from the point of view of economy, I think the States would be foolish if they did not conduct all their London operations under the Commonwealth roof. But as a pure matter of business we should have been in a better position to negotiate with the States before having a large and costly piece of land on our hands, than we shall be when we have it, and when the States know that we are dependent upon their becoming tenants. Therefore, it would have been wiser if the Government had negotiated with the States and arrived a.t some definite understanding with them. I think they have been a little precipitate in entering upon negotiations for this very considerable area; because it is considerable from a London point of view. It is not much from the aspect of our wide lands in . Australia, but it is a great deal of land in the centre of London. The Government would have been in a better position to know exactly what area they required and what outlay they should incur if they had formulated a scheme. They have not done so, I am sorry to say. But the fact that they have omitted to do that does not seem to me to- be a- sufficient reason for throwing the whole thing back and breaking off negotiations for what, irrespective . of area, is a most eligible site in an eligible locality. If we are landed with more land than we absolutely require for the purposes we may . eventually have to provide for- </para>

                            <para>- We are only speculating in the matter altogether. There is no certainty about it one way or the other. The thing would have been in a much more satisfactory position had we known how the land would be utilized before we absolutely closed - if we do close - with the . opportunity to take the land. At any rate, I feel so strongly that the site is a desirable one that, even at the risk of our being placed in a position of some difficulty - which I hope will not occur - in relation to the utilization of it in the way we desire, by getting the States to come under our roof, I cannot see that the Commonwealth will be better off by not allowing the negotiations to proceed. </para>

                        <para>. - So far as concerns the Strand site for the Commonwealth offices, I consider that on the second reading of this Bill, the Senate, by a fair majority, absolutely put its seal upon the proposals of the Government. I wish to bring under the notice of the Ministry a matter which I can probably connect with the item for additional plant required for printing postage stamps and postal notes in South Australia. I wish to draw attention to a new procedure in relation to money orders. If a person wishes to send money by telegram to an agent in another State, he sends a telegram stating that 'the money has been forwarded, and another, telegram for which he is charged, is. sent to the postmaster of the place where it is to be paid. Under a new instruction from the central office, the Postal authorities, before they will pay over the money, demand that the telegram received by the person to whom it is to be paid shall be given up. But the difficulty is that the instructions given to the agent may be contained in the telegram, and if he hands it over to the postal authorities, he has absolutely nothing to show that he has invested the money as instructed by his principal. The present procedure is entirely new, at all events so far as South Australia is concerned. I cannot see that it benefits the Department. . It has been brought into operation without Parliament being informed. It took me a considerable time last week to' hunt up the statutory rules connected with the Post-Office, which have been laid upon the table of the Senate, but I found that they contained nothing with reference to the p'oint. </para>

                            <para>- No. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> did a good service some time ago in getting a resolution passed requiring that statutory rules should be printed and circulated amongst members of Parliament But the instruction under which the practice of which I complain is pursued is not contained in a statutory rule. I experienced considerable difficulty in finding out what the statutory rules were. In the first place, there is no file which honorable senators can consult. The rules are kept by a clerk in one of the offices at the top of Parliament House. </para>

                            <para>- Statutory rules are laid upon the table, but it is exceedingly difficult afterwards to ascertain what they are. When I found that there was no statutory rule on this point, I repaired to the Post Office to find out how it was that the new practice had been brought into force. Then I was informed that if had been done under an instruction given, to postmasters by the central office. It appears therefore, that an alteration of considerable importance to business people has taken place, and yet Parliament has had no opportunity of 'expressing an opinion regarding it. I wish to ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General whether he will see to it that the instruction given to postmasters is formulated in a statutory rule, so as to afford an opportunity to honorable senators of expressing an opinion about it . The matter was brought under my notice in this way: A business man in Sydney' telegraphed to his agent in Adelaide to do certain things. He said,"Buy -so-and-so;deposit wired - mentioning a certain amount. There was an instruction. The agent in Adelaide went to the Post Office and said, " I have received a telegram informing me that a sum of money has been telegraphed to me." He showed the telegram, and was told, "We cannot pay you this money until you hand over your advice to us." The man refused to give it us because it contained instructions from his principal. Consequently he could not get the money.'I believe that the same instruction has been given to every money order office in the Commonwealth. Surely it should be sufficient for a man who receives a telegram of that kind to show it, and to give reasonable evidence of identification. When I brought this matter under the Postal authorities,I was informed that the telegram could be produced if there Was any dispute. But there is a regulation which provides that only the sender of a telegram can demand to see it: the receiver cannot. The present practice is hampering business to a considerable extent. Is it absolutely necessary to make a rule that a telegram sent to an agent must be given up before money is paid? If so, that instruction ought to be formulated as a statutory rule, and laid upon the table of the Senate, so that we may have an opportunity of expressing an opinion regarding it. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators may not be aware that the carrying of this amendment would restore the Bill to the form in which it was introduced by the Government. I mention that because some honorable senators pay considerable attention to the fact of a Bill having been introduced in a certain form. They seem inclined to adhere to it, and object to any alteration. The fact that I am not moving anything hostile to what the Government, acting on the advice of their experts, have done, may have some weight with them. The Committee ought to carefully consider the question of whether if they are going to agree to this bounty they should not restore it to its original shape. I have read the debate that took place in another place, and the only reason given for the alteration was that to give a bounty on leaf for plug tobacco would be to make a present of it to the Combine. </para>

                        <para>- That is an argument in favour of striking the bounty out altogether. If the Combine is powerful in plug tobacco, there is a factor which will make it more powerful as regards cigar tobacco. Competing manufacturers of plug tobacco can get all the machinery which the Combine can get, so long as they have the capital. But in the case of cigar making, the Combine are the agents for the patent rights of a machine which nobody else in the Commonwealth can acquire, and which is an, overwhelming competitor as against hand labour. Hand labour is many times more expensive than the use of that machine. Consequently, if the argument used" in another place as a reason for making the alteration is worth anything, it applies more to cigar leaf than, to plug tobacco leaf. There is another and more powerful reason in favour of my amendment. If there is one country in the world, whose conditions are like our own, and which has succeeded  in growing tobacco leaf, it is America. America is the great producer of the world in tobacco leaf, and yet America cannot successfully grow cigar leaf. The <inline font-style="italic">Statesman' s year-Book</inline> for  j  907 shows, on page 437, that _ the raw material used in the United States factories for cigars and cigarettes alone was valued at $81,000,000 in round figures and that the total production of leaf in the United States for that year was worth $68,000,000. They do not produce as much leaf of all kinds in the United States as was used in the cigar and cigarette factories in that country' alone. That is leaving plug tobacco out of consideration altogether. As a matter of fact, almost the whole of the leaf produced in the United States, so far as it was used locally, was used for plug tobacco, and almost the whole of the leaf used iii the United States for cigar making was imported. Those figures show a deficit in production of- $12,900,000 worth of leaf. The same <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book,</inline> on page 449, shows that the imports of tobacco leaf from Cuba into the United States were valued at $26,590,706. The exports from Cuba of cigar leaf were 27,900,000 lbs, or roughly 28,000,000 lbs. We can assume that the great proportion of that quantity went to the United States. Therefore, although the" United States have succeeded beyond almost any other country in the growing of tobacco leaf generally, they have not, and cannot succeed in growing cigar leaf, for various reasons. </para>

                        <para>- I did not say that. The United States make a greater weight of cigars and cigarettes than they produce in leaf of all kinds. If the United States, having succeeded in growing plug tobacco leaf, cannot and do not supply themselves with cigar leaf, then, as we in Australia have not yet successfully solved the problem of producing leaf for plug tobacco - the easiest to grow and the easiest to cure, and' a leaf which will grow under the greatest variety of conditions - is it not nonsensical if 'we are going. to give a bounty to give- it for the most difficult form 'of the industry, the one which we are least likely to succeed in, and which will grow in the least number of places in the Commonwealth? Is it not more sensible to give the bounty for that form of leaf which can be most, easily grown, which needs the least technical knowledge in curing, and which will succeed in a greater number of places in Australia, as we know from experience? One of the great sources of supply, both to the United States and Australia, is- Java and Sumatra. They produce, and largely export, nearly 92,000,000 lbs. of leaf, principally cigar leaf. Java, Sumatra, and Cuba are the great sources of supply of cigar leaf to the world. We have no place in Australia, not .even the Northern Territory, which lies in the same latitude. All those places are much nearer the equator than the Northern Territory. I do not dispute that we can grow cigar leaf in Australia. I have seen it growing, and have smoked a cigar made of Australian leaf. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator had come with us to Wangaratta he would have seen cigar leaf grown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temple</inline> Smith at Edi, near Wangaratta. That leaf was grown, however, under cheese cloth. I am not going to say that it cannot be grown- under the same cover in other places, but I do say that plug tobacco leaf can be successfully grown in the open fields at Wangaratta. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temple</inline> Smith certainly succeeded in growing cigar leaf under those hot-house conditions. He told me that if the present duty was 'allowed to remain he could grow it successfully under' those conditions, but he is also of the opinion that the ordinary farmer is much less likely to succeed with cigar leaf than with plug tobacco leaf. He finds it very difficult to get the ordinary farmer to undertake the methods that will successfully cure plug tobacco leaf. When dealing with- a much higher class - a much rarer type - it will need greater instruction and greater effort to get the farmer to take it up. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. If we had succeeded in growing plug tobacco-leaf, if our growth of it was expanding, and we were becoming exporters of it, after supplying our local market with the grade most generally used, then the honorable senator's argument would have something in it. But if we are to give a bounty we ought to give it for the leaf most generally used, and of which we now import a weight of upwards of 7,000,000 lbs. </para>

                        <para>- The present practice is to put the highest grade of the ordinary leaf into the filler of the cigar, and then Cuban, or Havana, or Sumatra leaf is used for the wrapper. There is a certain amount of waste from those wrappers, and that is used to make the filler of the next highest grade of cigar, in which still higher grade leaf is put on for a wrapper. Those, broadly, are the two different grades, but the fact remains that the ordina iy good cigar is not made with local leaf. The leaf which is popular with Australian smokers is a leaf which gives a light crop to the acre. There is a form of heavy dark tobacco, which will give an average crop of over half a ton to the acre in Australia. But the trouble is that the Australian consumer does not like it, and in a great majority of cases will not smoke it. In order to get the grower to produce a leaf which the Australian smoker will smoke, the Tobacco Combine have been distributing free the seeds of a leaf known as the Hester variety, but the trouble is that with that variety the growers only get a yield of 7 cwt. to the acre, as against from 10 to 16 cwt. of the common varieties. Seeing that the Australian smoker will not smoke the heavy varieties, if we are to give a bounty at all, we should give it to induce the Australian grower to produce the Hester variety, which the Australian smoker will smoke, and give him the bounty in order to compensate'him for the difference in the yield between the heavy and light varieties. </para>

The Hester leaf is a leaf which the Australian smoker will smoke, but it gives a light crop, and by giving a bounty which would compensate the grower for the lighter crop, we might encourage him to go in for the cultivation of this leaf, which we know can be grown in Australia. If we succeed in that, we can then go in for experimental bounties for the production of cigar leaf which we might be able to grow in some parts of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator cannot refer me to a single person who has grown cigar leaf in any part of the Commonwealth for a number of years, and has made his living from that occupation. I can myself refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temple</inline> Smith, who is a Government expert, and grows cigar leaf every year, but he is not making a living from it. There are men in Queensland growing experimental crops of cigar leaf here and there, but they are not making their living in that way. They do not always get a crop, but they have sometimes succeeded. I am not opposed to giving assistance for the production of a leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars, but the amount of bounty proposed is too small to be divided between the two varieties of leaf. I ask, also, why we should give a bounty for the production of a leaf which can only be grown in a few places in North Queensland, and perhaps in North Australia. I am not surprised at the enthusiasm with which Queensland senators have supported the proposal to restrict the bounty to cigar leaf, when- they know that the effect of the restrictions would probably be to confine the bounty to growers in. their own States, and possibly in the Northern Territory. I think it is better that we should give a bounty which we may hope will be distributed amongst growers in all the States. Queensland is doing very well under the Commonwealth, and honorable senators from that State might be a little generous to the growers of tobacco in other States. </para>

                        <para>- Not as a commercial undertaking, but as an experimental crop, on a State farm. The fact is that there are tobacco-growers at Tumut and Wangaratta who make their living at the business. Those at Wangaratta have the experience of an experimental farm alongside of them to profit by, and why do they not take up the cultivation of a leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars? Why are they so blind to their own interests if the cultivation of a cigar leaf would pay them better than the growth of leaf for plug tobacco? The fact is that they do not grow cigar leaf, nor is it grown at Texas in Queensland as' a commercial undertaking. Statements have been made to the effect that cigar leaf can be grown anywhere in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- There is no secret about it; it is merely a matter of latitude and climatic conditions. Java and Sumatra produce more cigar leaf than does Cuba, simply because of their geographical situation. Cuba exported 28,000,000 lbs. of tobacco leaf, and Java and Sumatra exported 92,000,000 lbs. They are, therefore, very much larger producers of this article than is Cuba. I have here numbers of a <inline font-style="italic">Tobacco Journal,</inline> published in New York. I shall not weary the Senate by reading all the passages I have marked, but it will be found that in the southern States of America, right in the heart of the tobacco-growing country, at Tampa, Key West, in Louisiana, and in the other southern States, cigar makers have established factories, and these journals prove that they are sending their agents to Cuba to purchase cigar leaf wholesale. Do honorable senators think that they would do that if they could grow the leaf themselves ? There is a heavy duty on Cuban and other cigar leaf imported to the United States, and if it could be grown in the States, it would not be imported. I suppose it will be admitted that the Americans are as keen business men as we are. It seems to me that we are ignoring the fact that Australia is not sufficiently near the Equator to enable us to succeed in the growth of a leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars. I feel disposed to oppose' the item altogether, because I think that under existing conditions the Tobacco Combine will get the proposed bounty. But if the item is retained in the amended form I suggest, it may have some practical effect. As it appears in the schedule it might lead to the cultivation of a few experimental crops, and as soon as the bounty ceased the industry would cease. If the bounty is given for the. production of a high-grade leaf, suitable for plug tobacco, it may induce growers to go in for the cultivation of a leaf which Australian smokers demand, that is. to substitute for the cultivation of the heavy cabbage-leaf varieties of tobacco, the cultivation of the lighter Hester varieties. I appeal to honorable senators to support my amendment, which, I believe, is in the best interests of the community and of the tobacco growers themselves. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been rather surprised and very much disappointed at the attitude which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has taken up in regard to this question. It was my privilege to be associated with the honorable senator on the Royal Commission inquiring into the tobacco industry, and in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is known to be a nonsmoker, I must say that the intelligence and knowledge he displayed as  Chairman  of that Commission excited my admiration. When speaking previously the honorable senator, in reply to an interjection I made, admitted that it was probable that the Combine would get the whole of the proposed bounty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> also agrees that the Combine would receive the bounty. I agree with Senators Pearce and Gray that if the bounty is made payable in respect of tobacco leaf for making plug tobacco, it will undoubtedly go to the Combine. Probably it was largely on that ground that the other House made the bounty payable on high-grade leaf for making cigars. The other evening <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> pointed out that if the bounty is to be made payable on tobacco leaf for the manufacture of plug tobacco, £4,000 a year will be altogether insufficient. It will be of no use for that purpose. I propose presently to read a few extracts from the evidence taken by the Tobacco Commission, in order to show that high-grade cigar leaf can be grown in Australia, and that possibly, with the aid of the bounty proposed, it could be grown successfully from a commercial stand-point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has mentioned that twenty years ago cigar leaf was successfully grown in the Northern Territory. He stated that eight tons of cigar leaf were shipped from the Northern Territory to Hamburg, where it realized  2s.11d.  per lb. at public auction. It must have been cigar leaf of a very superior quality to realize that price at public auction in a place like Hamburg, which is nearer to what is known as the home of the cigar leaf than is Australia. It has been pointed out that the increased duty of  3d.  per lb. on unstemmed tobacco leaf, and the increased duty of  6d.  per lb. on stemmed tobacco leaf, will offer a very large encouragement to the growth of a superior leaf for the manufacture of plug tobacco. I do not think that there is the slightest doubt that the increased duties will be sanctioned by Parliament. It is now generally recognised that Australia is committed to a protectionist policy. Free-trade is dead; as a matter of fact, it was buried in Sydney a few weeks ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peter</inline> Stewart Thomson, of Wangaratta, manager for Permewan, Wright and Company, when giving evidence as to the possibility of growing cigar leaf, gave an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Tobacco Journal -</inline> 1580. I have here the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Tobacco Journal</inline> for 21st September, 1905, and at page 720 I find the following statement' made :  - " A record price has been obtained for Victorian-grown unfermented cigar leaf.

J. Smith reports this satisfactory result. The price given for tent and field-grown tobacco, 1st and 2nd grades, stamps the first at a value of considerably over1s. per lb. The varieties used were  Comstock Spanish,' and ' Connecticut ' seed leaf, and the crop yielded at the rate of 1,200 lbs. per annum. These results have been achieved from experiments extending over three years, of which time two years were occupied in proving the variety suited to the soil. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> states that the progress made is encouraging, as by further selection of soil and varieties the general quality of the leaf can be improved upon. The price obtained -1s. per lb. for all grades - constitutes a record for Victorian-grown cigar leaf unfermented. The crop was harvested in March, the buyer undertaking the fermentation process." </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">That proves that tobacco leaf not completely cured, but only partially cured, has brought1s. a lb. all round. It also proves that cigar leaf can be grown in the Wangaratta district, in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- Some of it was grown under tents. The cost of growing tobacco under tents is estimated at only£65 per acre. It is simply a matter of stretching cheese-cloth over a, frame to protect the tobacco from the air. A large quantity of cigar leaf brings up to  3s., 4s.  and  5s.  per lb. ' If that result can be obtained from the production of cigar leaf at an expenditure of£65 per acre, certainly it is much better than that which is obtained by the men who now grow tobacco leaf for making plug tobacco - an average price of not more than 6d. per lb. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> Smith, of Wangaratta, was also examined by the Tobacco Commission. He stated that he had had from twenty-five to twenty-six years' experience as a buyer and seller, and also in forwarding tobacco to Melbourne and other places. A gentleman who has had that lengthy experience ought to have some knowledge about the quality of tobacco. He gave the following evidence -  1812. You think it possible to grow a cigar leaf in this district? - I do, if it is grown with proper care. 1813. Do you think it will pay the grower? - It will if he can get a fair price; but it will not pay at 6d. per lb. 1814. Did you see the cigar leaf grown at the Edi farm? - Yes; the same kind of leaf was grown at Whorouly by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> Gibson. 1815. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temple</inline> Smith reports that he received1s. per lb. for the leaf grown at Edi. Would that be a payable price? - Yes. 1816. You have seen other cigar leaf grown in the district? - Yes, very nice leaf. It was grown last season, but not in any quantity. 1817. Was it sold? - No; but it cannot be held for very long. 1818. What was the leaf grown at Whorouly worth ? - I could give you no estimate of the value of it. I have had no dealings in cigar leaf. </para>

                        <para>- Knowing that he had made that statement to the Tariff Commission in Adelaide, and that he was prejudiced against the use of Australian tobacco leaf, I took to him the cigar leaf from Edi, in the belief that it was good cigar leaf, and with the object of trying to remove his objection to the use of Australian tobacco leaf. He confessed that it was the best Australian-grown cigar leaf that he had ever handled. "That was good so far as it went. I smoked several of the cigars, and gave some of them to a number of my friends. Such excellent judges of a good cigar as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne each smoked one of them without knowing that it was an Australian cigar.

It seems to me that if we accept the amendment we shall make the bounty payable on account of any tobacco of high grade of a quality to be prescribed, whereas the Bill only intends the bounty to Le for leaf for the manufacture of cigars. Therefore, the intention of the Bill would be, to some extent, frustrated if the amendment were carried. I doubt whether we have power to pass such an amendment. </para>

                        stated he had no hesitation in giving his ruling. He would remind the House of the different stages through which the Bill had passed. First of all, there was a Message from the Governor-General recommending an appropriation.. The appropriation was voted in Committee, and a Bill was then brought in to give effect to the vole, and providing for certain bounties on certain items in the First Schedule. If the Bill did not provide for a bounty on pine-apples a bounty could not be now put in. If an item in the Estimates were under consideration the destination of a vote could not be altered.  He ruled that no amendment could be introduced which would have the effect of giving a bounty on any item not provided for in the Schedule, or of increasing any bounty.

                        <para>- I draw your attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to the fact - since reference has been made to the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker'</inline> in another place-  that when this Bill was under discussion there the provision relating to a bounty on tobacco was in precisely . the ' same terms as it would be if my ' amendment were accepted. An alteration was made in the schedule changing the destination of the bounty from tobacco leaf to cigar leaf only. .1 am endeavouring to reverse what another place did in Committee, and not to extend the bounty to other articles. My amendment simply proposes that the bounty shall be paid in respect of tobacco leaf, high grade, which includes cigar leaf» as' the Bill originally provided. The ruling of the Temporary  Chairman  is founded upon what has been adopted as the practice in another place. But I submit thai, our practice  is laid down by sections 53 and 54 of the Constitution and by our own Standing Orders. The Senate has determined that it will establish its own practice in these matters. The quotation which the Temporary  Chairman  has made from <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> has no  effect,  since we have not adopted the practice of the House of Commons. We have declared our powers and privileges, and have our own practice. While the  Speaker  ruled that at a particular stage of the Bill the proposed alteration could not be made, it was still within  the power of the other House, under its Standing Orders, at one stage of the Bill to have made the alteration desired regarding " canned pine-apples." In Committee of Supply the other place could, if it had wished, by means of an amendment to the resolution for an appropriation for ' the purposes of the Bill, have decided that " canned pine-apples " should be put in the schedule. Therefore that House had the power at one stage to make an alteration  such as was ruled out of order at a later stage by, the  Speaker.  No honorable senator, would say that we should have less powers than the other House, except so far as they are lessened 'by the Constitution. We are not in an equivalent position, because we never have the stage which I have indicated. A Bill is not brought in on a resolution founded on a Governor-General's message and passed in Committee in this Chamber. Therefore that opportunity never presents itself here. Our equivalent opportunity is when we go into Committee on the Bill. Our procedure is different. Another place, in their procedure, have the power at one stage. If they do not care to exercise it then, but attempt to use it at a later stage, when it is clearly against their practice that is the misfortune of those who bring forward the amendment at the wrong time. But because in another place, at a certain stage, they cannot make an amendment which they could previously have made, are we in this Senate to decide that the only opportunity which we can have shall not be availed of ? Are we to say that because another House has adopted a certain procedure at this stage, we shall not have an opportunity at all to make an amendment? That is what we are asked to say by the ruling of the Temporary  Chairman,  since neither in our Standing Orders nor in the Constitution is there anything that prohibits us from making this amendment. It does not alter the destination of the grant, but allows the bounty to be paid as the Bill originally provided when it was introduced after consideration of  His  Excellency's message. If my amendment is carried, it will, therefore, be covered by that message. I ask your particular attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to the point that my amendment cannot be said to in any way contravene the terms of  His  Excellency's message, inasmuch as the Bill, as originally brought down, provided for what my amendment seeks to achieve. That is a very important point, and I ask you, sir, not to uphold a ruling which would seriously restrict the powers of a Committee of the Senate. </para>

I do not profess to be as conversant with these points as honorable senators with longer parliamentary experience, but I hold that it is getting away from the question to compare the amendment regarding " pine-apples " with this amendment. </para>

                        <para>-  I should like, first, to offer a few observations with reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> main argument. It may be fairly put in this way : He said - and I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> 's interjection that we have no official notice of it - that a message came to another place covering a wider area with regard to this item. To use a simple analogy, the other place received a message which covered the area " ten." Acting within their rights, the other place reduced that area to, say "eight." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> contends that it is equally competent for us to restore the area eight to the area ten originally covered by the message, of which we have no official notice. But the two things are totally different. While it was quite competent for the other House, just as it would be for the Senate, to reduce the area ten to the area eight, it is not within the powers of the other House to increase the area from eight to ten, any more than . it is within our powers under our Standing Orders to increase an area now specified as eight to an area ten. The very fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has indicated to the Senate that a reduction was made is a clear proof that what he proposes to do is to make an increase. It is argued ' that to change the item from tobacco for cigar leaf to a wider area of tobacco is really making no change in the item, and is not on the same footing as would be a change, say, from" tobacco ' ' to " pine-apples." </para>

                        <para>-  The very fact that this does represent an increase, in one respect, and a decrease in the other, is in itself practically admitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to be a variation. It increases the area over which it is proposed to spread the bounty, and, inasmuch as it increases it, it varies it. I consider that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> emphasized as his strong point regarding the Governor-General's message is not a strong point. We have already had a ruling upon the other point, as to the competency of the Senate to transfer amounts from one item to another. In my view, the proposed amendment is just as much an alteration of the schedule as would be the changing of "tobacco" to " pine-apples." </para>

But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> amendment would not increase any burden on the people. </para>

I support the view taken of this matter by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> because in my opinion, the amendment would not increase the proposed burden on the people, and because the Committee has already carried an amendment which is practically identical with that moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> If I were taking a selfish view of the matter, I would support the ruling of the Temporary  Chairman,  but it would not be fair for any senator to take a stand in connexion with such a matter which he could not justify by his interpretation of the Constitution, and by the practice of the Senate in the past. </para>

                        <para>-  We can take cognizance of it here. I remind the honorable senator also that the message has already been referred to in the ruling given by the Temporary  Chairman,  and the matter is, therefore, fairly before us. I think that the amendment is in order as affecting the same item. It is very different from an amendment such as was moved in Committee in another place, proposing a bounty on canned pine-apples, which did not appear at all in the Bill, as originally introduced. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has pointed out, powers are vested in the Committee of Supply of another place which we have not in the Senate. I think that the amendment of the item " Coffee" which has been alluded to is exactly analogous to that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> We struck out the word " raw " after the word " Coffee " and inserted the words " as prescribed." The bounty then applied to the same article, only we dealt with the matter in a different way. That amendment was accepted and carried, and I think it therefore forms a precedent which might be followed until it is shown to be out of order. I urge that the arguments advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and other honorable senators are strongly in favour of the contention that the amendment is in order. </para>

                    <para>- Before dealing with the question raised, I want first of all to have the ground perfectly clear. We have had a reference made to the way in which this item originally appeared in the Bill when it was introduced in another place. I take it that we are not concerned with that at the present time. The Bill came up to the Senate in a complete form, and we must accept it in that form. With regard to any decisions arrived at in another place, whilst they may guide or assist us in forming a judgment, they are not in any way binding upon the Senate. The question we have to put to ourselves is : Is this a Bill which requires to be preceded by a message from the Governor-General? We all know that it is. We presume that it was preceded by such a message, that the message was dealt with in Committee of Supply, and the Bill was introduced upon that message. It then embodied the demand made by the Crown for the services, and it was not then within the competency of another place to increase or to alter the destination of any of the votes included in the schedule, the rule being that the Crown knows what it requires, and makes its demands accordingly. The House says whether it will grant the demand wholly or in part only. But the House has no power to make an amendment in the way of an increase, or in the way of altering the destination of a grant, because the Crown has asked what it requires. The Bill passes through its several stages and comes up to the Senate in whatever form may have been decided on by the House of Representatives. When it reaches this Chamber, we have to regard the Bill as embodying the demands made by the Crown for the services described in the Bill. It then becomes impossible for us to increase or alter the destination of a vote. In the first place, we are asked to vote an amount to provide for a bounty on " Tobacco leaf for the manufacture of cigars, high-grade, of a quality to be prescribed." The amendment is that the words " for the manufacture of cigars " be left out, and the bounty asked for " Tobacco leaf, high grade, of a quality to-be prescribed." That would, if carried, increase the area over which the bounty would have to be spread, if it. did not really initiate another form of tax. Tobacco leaf of a high grade, of a quality 1 to be prescribed, would certainly include leaf for the manufacture of cigars, but it would include much more, and inasmuch as the amendment goes beyond the item as stated in the schedule, it is really the initiation of another tax, or if not, certainly alters the destination of the bounty to be granted. With regard to the question of initiation, section  53  of the Constitution provides that - </para>

                <quote>

                <quote>
                    <para>Tobacco leaf for the manufacture of cigars, high grade, of a quality to be prescribed -  it would not have been within the competency of that Chamber to have altered it by the elimination of the words "for the manufacture of cigars" when the Bill was in Committee, but when the Governor-General's message was being considered in Committee of Supply, it would then have been possible to have made the alteration, whilst it became impossible after the Bill was introduced with the schedule in its present form attached to it. Under section  53  of the Constitution, it is provided that- </para>
                    <para>Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>We are deprived of the power of originating laws appropriating revenue, and we have not a power analogous to that of the other Chamber, when a message is received, of going into Committee of. Supply to consider it, and, having considered it, introducing a Bill in accordance with the determination of the Committee. We are deprived of that opportunity to deal with a measure, and can only take up the consideration of such a Bill in the form in which it comes before the Senate. The Senate is powerless to make such amendments as might be made in Committee of Supply in another place in considering the message from the Governor-General preceding such a Bill. It may be perfectly true that this involves a limitation of the power of the Senate, but, unfortunately, that limitation appears to me to come clearly within the constitutional provision. Allusion has been made to an amendment of the item " Coffee, Raw." I do not propose to offer any opinion upon that. That amendment was made in Committee, and it was not referred to the  President  for any opinion. The fact that such are amendment has been accepted and agreed to without 'having been referred to the President does riot constitute it a precedent having any binding effect on the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to express any opinion on that point. . It is not before me now, and is altogether- beside the matter with which I am now dealing. The question is whether, by leaving out the words, " for the manufacture of cigars," the item would not be altered in. such a way as to change the destination of the vote, or to involve the initiation of a new tax. I am of opinion that the ruling given by the Temporary Chairman of Committees is correct, and that the amendment is not in order, as it is beyond the power of this Chamber, or of another place, at asimilar stage to the present. </para>

                        <para>- I do not regard the amendment as one which could be effected by a request ; though, before giving, a ruling, I would be prepared to hear the question argued, because I believe it involves an alteration of the destination of the vote. A point was considered the other night in connexion with an amendment proposed with respect to the item of " Rice." It was proposed to increase the amount of the bounty. That matter came before the Chair, and the ruling given then was that what, was proposed might be done. That ruling was based upon a precedent laid down in  1903  in. dealing with the Sugar Bonus Bill. I pointed out then that the matter had beer* debated at very great length in both Chambers, and that it had ultimately been accepted as within the power and competency- of the Senate to request an amendment of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> character which would increase a bounty, and the other House had power to assent to the request if it saw fit. That, was the decision 'practically of both Houses on that occasion, . and I so accepted it. </para>

I should like to ask you, sir, if you will, to indicate to honorable senators some method whereby the amendment made in the item " Coffee, Raw " may be referred to you for. your ruling. If I may offer a short reason for my request it is that the amendment made on that item is analogous to the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on the item "Tobacco," and in view of the ruling you have just given, I think it would be better, in the interests of the Senate, if we ourselves took some steps to make the alteration necessary to comply with that ruling than that we should have the Bill returned to us from another place with a message saying that we had done something that was out of order. </para>

                    <para>Before we go further, I should like to allude to cigar tobaccos. The other day I wrote a letter on the subject to our Under-Secretary. There is a strong disposition amongst farmers in the north, and in New South Wales, to' grow cigar tobacco ; but the present Tariff, and the old Tariff in Queensland, before Federation, have acted ' as a deterrent. Local factories have tried time after time to hold their own in regard to the manufacture of Australian cigar leaf, but have failed to do so. A representative of the British-Australian Tobacco Company has been going through Queensland and New South Wales, and has bought up small lots of cigar tobacco at 8d. to od. a lb. It is almost impossible to divert this branch of the trade in face of the present Tariff and the present excise, as our tobaccos are brought into competition with tobaccos imported from Manilla, Sumatra, and Borneo. Our growers get a protection of only is. 6d., and hardly that, because a good deal of cigar tobacco is brought in stemmed and the excise is is. 6d. I am suggesting that the excise should be taken off altogether from cigar tobacco manufactured here, and that the is. 6d. should be added on to the duty on imported cigar tobacco instead. For instance, now, all the cigars manufactured in this State are made from imported tobacco. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not suppose that as many  as  10,000 cigars are made from locally-grown tobacco. If my * suggestion were adopted, the revenue would not suffer. If the duty were made 3s., and there were no excise on cigar tobacco it would amount to the same thing as at present, and would not interfere with the working of the Tariff. The import duty on raw tobacco is is. 6d., and the excise on cigars manufactured in the Commonwealth is is. 6d. per lb. That makes it 3s. 28427. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wamsley.</inline> - As against an import duty of 6s. and 15 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> on manufactured cigars? - Yes; I will read the letter which I wrote to the Under-Secretary. It is as follows : - " Brisbane, 12th June, 1905. </para>
                <para>There is a disposition among the farmers of the New South Wales and Queensland coastal districts to take up the growing of cigar leaf, and a few experimental plots give promise of good quality ; but the present excise prevents the opening of small factories, such as would encourage the industry ; hence all cigars in the Commonwealth are either imported or made from imported tobacco. </para>
                <para>It is impossible to build up the industry of cigar leaf production in the face of the is. 6d. per pound excise ; if this wa-s removed for a few years, small factories working the local product would begin operations, and a local industry develop that would grow to large dimensions, and of immense value to the States. The large factories would also take large quantities of the local leaf when the supply became large enough to establish brands." </para>
                <para>You understand that a brand with a certain flavour has. perhaps a reputation upon the market, so that shopkeepers recommend it to their customers. It is expected that that particular brand will be supplied uniformly to the trade; and if we have not got the tobacco and cannot supply the demand to the trade the brand goes out of existence and money must be lost upon it. But a small manufacturer manufactures a few hundred- cigars only, and does not put his goods on the market in a big way. My letter goes on - " In order to assist this industry, and, at the same time, work no injury to the revenue, I would suggest that the present excise be abolished and the import duty on cigar leaf be correspondingly increased. The present excise would thus be collected as duty, and the local tobacco thus freed from taxation would .be in demand. </para>
                <para>This arrangement could continue until such time as the consumption of locally-grown tobacco impaired the revenue, when a readjustment  might  become necessary. At present the revenue is entirely from imports, no local cigar tobacco being used, hence no serious disturbance of the revenue could occur for some time under such a readjustment, could work no hardship to manufacturers, as they would pay all in duties, instead of. excise and duties, and would stimulate production and manufacturing by enabling men of small capital to go into the business and eventually there would be an export demand. </para>
                <para>We can grow good cigar leaf, such as brings good prices in the European markets ; prices that are remunerative to ordinary labour,  and  it is a pity and a wrong that this valuable industry should be lost to the farmers of the State be- cause of adverse legislation. This industry/ would be especially valuable to outlaying districts, as it will stand transportation to shipping points." </para>
                <para class="block">That is the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill,</inline> the Queensland expert. I do not think that 1 need advance more arguments to show that cigar leaf can be grown, not only in  Queensland, but also in the Northern Territory, New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. With regard to the payment of the bounty, there is a difficulty in the case of tobacco leaf which does not exist in the case of other items in the schedule. I refer to the great difference in the prices of the different qualities of tobacco. Some kinds of tobacco leaf are worth 5s., 8s., and as much as 10s. per lb. This is an argument which I intend: to use against fixing a minimum price 011 which the bounty shall be paid. The experts suggested to' the Commission that  10d.  per "lb. should be the minimum price or* which the bounty should be given. If that suggestion were adopted persons would grow tobacco leaf which was worth about  10d.  or is. per lb., and get the bounty. They would not take the same trouble in growing tobacco which was worth is. 6d. or 2s., or even more per lb. If the item is passed as it stands, it may be possible for the Government to prescribe a way ir» which the bounty can be paid on the high-grade leaf which can be most profitably grown for cigar making. I do npt imagine that it will be possible to have  differential  rates for the different kinds of tobacco. If, however, that were possible, it would be a capital tiling to give a bounty of id. per lb. on the lowest quality of tobacco leaf, that is leaf up to the value of is. per lb., a bounty of 2d. per lb. on tobacco leaf -of higher quality, and even to go up to 3d. per lb. I realize that it cannot be done, but I believe that if it could be done it would encourage and1 stimulate the production of high-grade  tobacco  leaf. I believe that most honorable senators, especially <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> W 11 agree that unless the payment of the bounty is confined to cigar leaf it will goto the Combine. </para>

                        <para>- The manufacturer of cigars is In a somewhat different position from the manufacturer of plug and twist tobacco. -In each State, there are a number of small cigar-makers. I do not know the. present number in Melbourne, but in  1905 there were sixty-eight small cigar manufacturers!. There are probably less than a dozen in Adelaide. The existence of the small manufacturers would secure a reasonable price to the growers for their tobacco leaf. At any rate, the seventy or eighty cigar-makers would compete for the cigar' leaf if it could be produced. From the evidence which I have been able to get, I am convinced that the industry of growing cigar leaf, if properly encouraged, will attain to very large dimensions, and be of very great value to the Commonwealth. I hope that the item will be passed exactly in the form in which it appears in the schedule, so as to allow the Government to prescribe the kind of tobacco leaf on which the bounty shall be paid. If the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> to fix the minimum at is. per lb. were adopted, it would probably prevent the bounty from being paid on high-grade leaf for which the growers could obtain only 1 id. per lb. That certainly would be a disadvantage to the growers who were trying to earn the bounty, and most inconvenient. If it is left to the Government to prescribe the manner in which the bounty should be paid, I believe that the best results will be achieved. </para>

                    although I promised at earlier stages of the Bill that I would vote for every item in the schedule, I am inclined now to alter my opinion after what has happened to the amendment which you submitted. From an intimate acquaintance with men, who for years have been engaged in the cigar-making industry, I am satisfied that good cigar leaf has not been grown and cannot be grown in any part of Australia.

                        <para>- He has done on this occasion. Some one has told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> that cigar leaf can be grown in Australia, and simply because some one told him so he is " going bald-headed " for' a bounty. no matter what it will cost the taxpayers. This proposal means 2d. per lb., in addition to the protection of 3s.' per lb. which the growers now get. I maintain that a good cigar leaf cannot be grown in any part of Australia. That statement will be backed up by experts, who are in no way connected with the Combine, but who are extremely anxious for the encouragement of tobacco growing in Australia. We have not yet grown a good tobacco for plug purposes in Australia. If we had done so, the consumption of Australian tobacco would be increasing, instead* of decreasing, as it has been doing during; the last few years.* According to. the <inline font-style="italic">Year Book</inline> for 1905, in 1900 276,407 lbs. of Australian leaf were used for manufacturing purposes. That is to say that quantity was used for making plug tobacco. We have been told that that tobacco is used for making Matador cigars. I do not believe that that statement is correct. As as matter of fact, I know that it is not correct, because, some tobacco grown <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> Queensland has fetched is. a lb., and that leaf has been made into cigars. </para>

                        <para>- In Victoria. For a number of years in' Victoria, Messrs. Dudgeon and Arnell had a large market for their tobaccoes, which were almost entirely made from leaf grown in&gt;' Victoria, and other parts of Australia.. But the Tobacco Combine came along,, and started manufacturing tobacco from imported leaf. The Combine - this is not my statement, but  it is the statement of  smokers - put on the market a superior article made from imported leaf,, and, as a result, Dudgeon and Arnell's. business has fallen off from year to year. It is true that no small business can stand in opposition to that of a big combine, but the main reason why Dudgeon and Arnell's business has fallen off, whilst the .business, of the Combine has increased, is attributable to the superior article which the Combine placed upon the market. I repeat- that we have not yet grown a really good plug tobacco in any quantity in Australia. If ' we did grow it, there is no doubt that the Australian manufacturers would be only too glad to avail themselves of it. .What advantage would it be to them to pay duties and increased prices for tobacco' simply because it was imported? They carry on business just as do other business"' men,, to make as much profit as they possibly' can, and to put upon the market an article that is readily saleable. Naturally, they would use the' Australian leaf, which is cheaper, if they found it to their advantage to do so. The argument has been used that if we grant this bounty the money will not go into the pockets of the Combine. I know that there are, in various parts of Australia, numbers of men who pay licence fees ranging from£5 to £50. But does any one mean to tell me that the man who pays £5 will have any chance against the man who pays £50. If a good cigar leaf is placed upon the market for sale, the small man will always be handicapped as against the big man. </para>

As against that, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> said that if we voted for the item as it stands in the schedule, the Combine would not have the same advantage in connexion with cigar leaf as they would have in the case of plug tobacco leaf, because in the making of cigars there were many men, who pay a small licence fee, working apart from the Combine. </para>

                        <para>- The small man whether in the making of cigars or in any other line of industry, is always at a disadvantage as against the big man when he has to buy in the open market. I wish to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> that I am on familiar terms with most of the small cigar manufacturers of Victoria. They are ardent Labour men, anxious to increase their business, but I have not met one of them yet who has spoken well of the leaf grown in any part of Australia for the making of cigars. I should be lacking in my duty if I were to offer any opposition to the encouragement of an Australian industry, if : he men engaged in it thought that a bounty would be advantageous to them or to the Commonwealth. As you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> pointed out on one or two occasions, in addition to the advantages which the big men have, from an £ s. d. point of view, the States Tobacco Company, who to-day manufacture cigars extensively from Colonial leaf, have an absolute monopoly of the machines for making cigars. </para>

                        <para>- If we can grow tobacco leaf for cigar making in Australia, those people having monopoly rights to a certain machine would be enabled, as they can produce cigars much cheaper than can others who have not got the machine, to pay a higher price for the leaf, and yet have a larger margin of profit. I am backed up in this statement by the view of the Cigar-makers' Union - the evidence can be read in the Tobacco Commission's report - that the cigars turned out by that machine with the tobacco which I have mentioned are doing more than anything else to injure the reputation of cigars made in Australia, because of the inferiority of the leaf, and because the machine cannot turn out a cigar as well from a workman's point of view as can the man who works with his hands. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose I can please myself in regard to that matter.I should have had no hesitation in voting for the item had it been amended in the way which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> desired, because I defy anybody to produce evidence that we have yet produced a really good plug tobacco in any part , of Australia, and we ought to encourage the production of the leaf which is most extensively used. However we cannot give a bounty for that purpose now, because the amendment has been ruled out of order. ' I wish again to mention to the ardent protectionists in this Chamber that those who desire to go in for the growing of cigar leaf in Australia will have an advantage over outside growers of 3s. per lb. I desire to know, in regard to this bounty on cigar leaf, who is to be the judge as to what price shall be paid for the leaf, and as to its value? </para>

                        <para>- Is the tobacco grown to earn the bounty to be placed on the open market, and are bids to be invited for each .particular lot? I desire to see the grower obtain the highest prices possible, but what methods are to be adopted in order that he may receive that advantage? Is the Government expert to place a value per lb. on the leaf produced, and is the bounty to be paid on that valuation? Afterwards, when it is placed on the open market, we may find that it does not realize half the Government expert's valuation. Those, particulars ought to be forthcoming. The bounty ought not to be paid on any kind of cigar leaf, because, when it was desired to encourage the industry in Victoria, the Government of the day did not take the precaution of giving the bounty for the quality of leaf. The result was that numbers of Chinamen took up the industry, and went in for quantity instead of quality. It will not be possible under this Bill for Chinese or other coloured men to receive any advantage. There are varying conditions in regard to cigar leaf, and various prices are offered, but it is not so difficult to determine quality and price in the case of leaf far plug tobacco. I trust that if I have done nothing more I have started a discussion with regard to a matter that is very important from an Australian point of view. Strong protectionist as I am, and anxious as I am to encourage every . possible industry that deserves assistance in Australia, I. think I am fortified in the position which I take up by the fact that the highest and best quality of cigar leaf cannot be grown in Australia, because Australia is unsuitable for its growth. If the opinion of experts is worth anything at all, they are unanimous that up to the present time there has not been produced, nor so far as they are aware can there be produced at any future time in Australia, a highly suitable cigar leaf which would enable manufacturers to place on the market cigars that would find a ready sale in opposition to cigars made from imported leaf. </para>

                    <para>. - The Tobacco Commission travelled throughout Australia, and all concerned had an- opportunity of submitting their evidence to that body, which I think I may fairly say gathered the evidence, not only "of the growers of tobacco leaf, but also of the manufacturers and distributors of tobacco and cigars. The Commission thoroughly sifted the evidence, and arrived, as far as possible, at the facts in -connexion with the tobacco industry in all its elements and ramifications. In face of the evidence brought before the Commission, I fail to understand why the Government should propose this bounty on cigar leaf. If that evidence proved anything, it proved that whereas leaf for tobacco making might be, and had been, grown ir quantities in Australia, leaf suitable for cigar-making could not be grown here. The evidence showed that whilst leaf suitable for the higher classes of tobacco was not being grown in Australia, it could be grown, especially if the growers would use all the necessary care in the curing of the leaf. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> amendment had been admitted, I should have supported it. I realize that while there may be possibilities of growing here the higher class tobacco leaf for the manufacture of plug tobacco, although it is not being produced now in any quantity, there is very little probability of tobacco leaf suitable for cigar-making' being grown here. I may mention one piece of evidence submitted to the Commission which, in itself, is quite sufficient to prove my statement. The States Tobacco Company is the largest, manufacturer of cigars in the Commonwealth. It has also been said that it has the benefit of a monopoly of cigar-making machinery. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs,</inline> in his evidence, stated that the company had engaged an expert at ^400 a year to come to Australia to find out if it was possible to grow in Australia leaf suitable for cigars. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs</inline> said at that time that he thought it might be possible, and we can understand that, as a business man, he would not have gone to such a large expense if he had not thought that that possibility existed. The expert pointed out a site ,near Cairns, which he thought would be suitable for the experiment. The company lost ^2,000 in the experiment on that farm, and the farm was given up. Seeing that, with all the advantages which they would derive from the production of that leaf in Australia, the company were compelled to admit, after spending a large sum of money, that the experiment was a failure, I should like the Government to inform us of their reasons for refusing to regard that failure as a fair test. I have not the slightest doubt that the Government think that this money would be wisely expended in establishing the industry, but I want to know their reasons for persisting in it, in view of the experience of the States Tobacco Company. One practical illustration is worth a ton of theory, or a dozen small experiments, which, in themselves, prove nothing. In many aspects of commercial life, if you like to expend money, and take exceptional pains in small matters, you can grow many things which, grown on a larger scale, would be failures "from a commercial point of view. </para>

                        <para>- They have exploited America, Cuba, and, in fact, every country where tobacco leaf can be grown, as is shown by their evidence before the Commission. Besides, it is natural to suppose that their business instincts would lead them to- secure all the information possible bearing upon their business. The States Tobacco Company .are by far the largest manufacturers of cigars in the Commonwealth, and are keenly anxious that cigar leaf should be grown here. </para>

                        <para>- He has nothing to do with the States Tobacco Company. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs</inline> is in the Combine, and represents that company. Even if this leaf could be grown in Australia, the Combine would get nearly all the benefit of it. I do not point that out as a reason why the industry should not be encouraged, because, of course, if it could be firmly established here the growers must be advantaged also- I do not care twopence who gets the benefit. I presume that the Government are offering the bounty to enable an industry to be established which will be a benefit to the growers themselves, and care very little who gets the bounty, so long as the leaf is grown and a permanent industry established. We must take a practical view of these matters, and must first see clearly that there is some prospect of establishing the industry. There would be a prospect of the bounty being useful if it was given for the production of plug tobacco leaf, but I tell honorable senators candidly that I revolt against the proposal, because there is no necessity for it. A firm like Dixson' s, who spent ,£30,000 in that direction, can spend another £30,000 if they choose. I do not see why the Commonwealth should put money into the hands of the manufacturers. The evidence given before the Tobacco Commission was to the effect that, whilst the Hester variety of leaf could be grown, the growers would not go to the trouble required in curing it to make the quality of leaf which the manufacturers required. We have the evidence of two experts from America on that point. </para>

                        <para>- What has the Combine to do with the question we are now discussing ? The Combine is a business concern carried on on purely business lines, and, so far as I know, is doing its business honestly. Those engaged in business, whether individuals or .companies, endeavour to make their business profitable: It is  only an arrant hypocrite and humbug who will say that he is in business for philanthropic purposes. The evidence proves that a cigar leaf cannot be grown here. The only person who gave evidence to some extent in favour of the contention that such leaf can be grown in Australia was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neville,</inline> and he was obliged to confess that he could not say that it would have the flavour of imported leaf. We have abundant evidence on the subject before us in the course adopted by manufacturing firms. It is clear that it would be profitable to the local manufacturers df cigars if a leaf suitable for cigars could be grown in Australia. Large sums of money have been spent on the experimental cultivation of cigar leaf. The States Tobacco Company have had an expert, to whom they paid £400 a year, trying for the last twelve months to grow a leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars, but without success. In the circumstances, I find it impossible to believe that the growth of such a leaf can be made a permanent and successful industry in Australia, and for that reason I shall vote against the item. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been strongly opposed to this item from the first time I saw it in the schedule, and in the last few minutes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has given many reasons why I should continue my opposition to it. It was very refreshing to hear the honorable senator's eloquent speech. He dealt with the matter in a manner which reflects great credit upon him. The honorable senator has convinced me that the attitude he assumed in dealing with a previous item was more make-believe than real. Only recently he declared, in the face of opposition, that anything could be grown in Australia, that he was. for the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill, and was prepared to vote for any amount of protection or for any amount of bounty, so long as it was for an Australian industry. I am glad to be able to think that the honorable senator was not voicing the real opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> on that occasion. He has shown now that he is in very close touch with some of the experts connected with the tobacco industry, and has benefited by their experience. It has enabled him to take an intelligent view of. what ought to be done with this item. I do not know whether I should have been prepared to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> amendment, because, in my opinion, the tobacco growers are satisfactorily provided for under the new Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- In some important respects tobacco is very much like other crops. We have good and bad tobacco grown. If we tried to grow an inferior leaf I have not the slightest doubt that we might easily succeed in doing so. If the local growers of tobacco leaf desire to produce a leaf for which they can get from 8d. to10d. per lb. more than they obtain for the leaf which they now produce, the new Tariff offers them abundant encouragement to set about the work. </para>

                        <para>That, while it is desirable to provide old-age pensions for the present generation as soon as the funds can be provided, the Senate is of opinion that any permanent scheme applying to persons under thirty years of age and to future generations should be framed, as far as possible, on the principles of thrift and self-help, and that the Government should, as soon as convenient, introduce a Bill providing for a compulsory scheme of life insurance, old-age pensions, and sick allowance, based upon contributions from both employers and workers, with such subsidies from the Commonwealth as will make the scheme financially sound. And it is suggested to the Government that they might offer a substantial prize to the person furnishing the details of a scheme best suited to carry put this resolution, having regard to the conditions of Australian industrial life. </para>

                    <para class="block">I realize that, in submitting this motion, I am tackling a gigantic subject - a subject with very great possibilities, and one which I am sure all honorable senators must admit is of the gravest importance to the wellbeing of the people of the Commonwealth. In this matter, as in every other, Australia - combined with New Zealand, of course - seems to me to have established a standpoint of its own. It has got into a certain groove, and I believe I am right in saying that this subject is looked at here from an Australian groove. I desire to bring under the notice of my honorable friends the German scheme, which in many ways is opposed to our scheme, differing from it in most material particulars, but conferring upon the people enormous benefits. I feel.  sure that in the end, if I can get consideration for the scheme, it will be "found that our scheme is lacking in some of those essentials which make for social progress. I shall be very pleased to see the motion carried, but my great object to-night is. if possible, to cause honorable senators to consider seriously whether the scheme which has been adopted in New Zealand, New South Wales, and Victoria, and. is now proposed in South Australia, is the best one to encourage thrift and industry, and at the same time to provide in the most efficient way for the aged poor, and all who are disabled from earning their bread by the sweat 'of their brow and their hands. I shall be quite satisfied if I can induce honorable senators to . consider these matters, and to study more' and more the German system which, I regret to say, our Old-Age Pensions Commission in its report, has regarded as impracticable, or not suited to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- In Germany there are three or four different systems, but practically they are all one. As I understand, our Old-Age Pensions Commission expressed the opinion that the German systems are unsuitable to Australian conditions. I most respectfully differ from that opinion, and I hope to make some converts before I have concluded my speech. I have read various reports by leading men in the Empire, and also by leading men in the Commonwealth. I have waded through an enormous mass of evidence, read books and perused many articles, as well as many letters in the press. I have convinced myself that our scheme is essentially a bad one, that it is fundamentally unsound, and that, while it is too soon now to pass any opinion as to its effect upon the moral fibre of our community, the time is not very far distant when its grave defects will become apparent to everybody when he realizes how intensely it has weakened our manhood. I have come to the conclusion that any scheme to do what we want on sound economical and social lines must be compulsory, contributory, and to some extent, discriminating. All those factors or principles are found embodied in. the schemes of Germany. I may just as well read now a letter .from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thos.</inline> A. Welton to the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> last July - </para>

                        <para>It is a matter of profound conviction with me that no scheme for granting old-age pensions should omit to provide for contributions to be made by those who are eventually to receive benefit. I think every member of society who does not belong to the " submerged " element should contribute. Thus an enormous burden on industry would be sensibly mitigated, and the self respect of the people generally would be maintained. </para>

                        <para>A national Insurance Society is a very different thing from a State-paid pension scheme, and need not interfere or compete with any sound Friendly Society.

I am not sure that this was not one of the objections raised at a meeting in the Oddfellows' Hall at Edinburgh presided over by the late Lord Provost Harrison, and addressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackley</inline> himself; but I remember - his saying, in answer to it (I give the substance of his words) : - " A man is either thrifty or unthrifty; if the latter, he must be compelled to make the necessary provision ; if the former, he is not likely, though already belonging to a Friendly Society, to cease to belong to it, or object to make what is in effect an additional investment any more than a man who owns shares in one company will refuse to become a shareholder also in another."

He felt sure that his scheme would not impair them. " They may help," he said, "the self-denial of the best class of our people, but they do not touch the misery of the worst."  His  scheme provides, not only against destitution in sickness, but also against destitution in old age. On the subject of Friendly Societies in general and other aids to thrift, may I venture to recommend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Blackley's  really remarkable little book, published by the S.P.C.K., or his "Collected Essays on the Prevention of Pauperism " ?

In the Friendly Societies the cost is considerably less. Thus, in the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows the same position can be secured for the same weekly contribution, commencing at twenty-five instead of twenty, or by a weekly contribution of 3¼d. beginning at twenty-one, and by members of Friendly Societies insured for other benefits it can practically be secured on easier and more convenient terms still. </para>

                        <para>For instance, in the Manchester Unity the weekly contribution, commencing at twenty-one, to secure sick pay during life and funeral benefits is 4&amp;3/8d. But if a member will commute his claim to sick pay after sixty-five for a 5s. pension from that age, combined with immunity from all further contributions, the weekly payment is 6&amp;7/8d. ; that is to say, his right to the pension costs him weekly only 2½d. extra till sixty-five, and nothing at all afterwards. By the rules of a Suffolk branch of the Foresters as fixed in 1896, which are before me, a member entering at twenty-one and paying 6d. a week secures : sick pay, 10s. per week for twenty-six weeks, 5s. per week for twenty-six weeks, 3s. 6d. per week during remainder of sickness ; pension, 5s. from age of sixty-five, when sick benefits and also contributions cease; funeral allowance,£10 at death. To this should be added a small contribution for management, &amp;c., which is not stated. This court was founded in a Suffolk village forty-four years ago, the members being chiefly agricultural labourers, then earning during most of the year probably not more than9s. or 10s. a week, if so much. At the end of thirty-three years, in 1896, there were a hundred and sixty-six members, and the audit showed a certified balance of £1,072. In the face of such an object-lesson as this, and in view of the great increase in the wages and resources of working men in the last forty-four years, what are we to say of proposals to load the country with crushing taxation, and to open wide the flood-gates of pauperism, in order to relieve the British workman from the payment of 2½d. a week? </para>

                            <para>- I do not care for the opinion of the Government Actuary. This is a matter of common-sense and good finance. A society cannot invest trust funds in every kind of security. It may have to keep a large sum in a bank, and there it could not reckon to get more than  3  per cent. on its money. In order to be safe, I have obtained calculations from some Victorian societies, and they distinctly say that they have calculated on a basis of  3  per cent. I am not prepared to admit that there is very much difference between what a friendly society in Great Britain and a friendly society in Victoria can grant. The next letter I propose to quote is from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> W. Gordon, of the Cocoa Tree Club, St. James-street, who cites a most astounding fact. I suppose that if honorable senators were asked to mention a democratic community which has set to the world an example in providing for its aged poor and disabled workmen, they would point to New Zealand. Will they be surprised to hear that under its despised poor law, on which, I admit, we must make an advancement, Great </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friends are quite wrong. The analogy is almost perfect, and the difference is in favour of Great Britain. ' New Zealand spends a certain amount upon old-age pensions, whereas Great Britain spends relatively the same amount on her poor law ; but she relieves every one who needs relief. Any person who breaks his leg or who is sick, or who is unable to earn a living through any cause, can obtain relief under the English poor law system. </para>

                            <para>- I dare say that the cost of the British system in that respect is considerably more than that of the New Zealand system. Certainly the administration of the old-age pensions scheme in Victoria is most economical, whilst the New South Wales scheme is most extravagantly worked. </para>

                    <para>It is' interesting from that point of view to compare the Colonial figures with our own. The population of New Zealand is slightly' under 900,000 souls; that of the United Kingdom a little over 430 hundred thousand. Roughly, therefore, the two communities are proportioned to one another in the ratio of fifty to one ; to be more precise, in the proportion of four hundred and thirty to nine. In the year igo6, the Colony paid £313,000 in pensions and ^38,000 in subsidies to charities; in all, ^350,000 for the relief of its poor. Multiplied by the factor 430/9, that would give sixteen and three-quarter millions as the equivalent outlay in this country. In the year 1905 - the latest for which my figures are available ; I am quoting from the <inline font-style="italic">Statesman's Year-book</inline> - our outlay was, in fact, sixteen and a half millions. </para>

                    <para>Between these two figures there may seem to be a very striking agreement until one inquires into, their precise significance. Then it will be found that the extent of the relief given is widely different in the two cases. The relief afforded in the. United Kingdom is extended to all ages, and the class which comprises paupers of sixty-five years old and upwards, numbers only about 36 per cent, of the whole. The New Zealand scheme deals with much less than one-half the problem set to our own Poor. Law authorities. If the care of the necessitous and the outworn is the real object which the advocates of old-age pensions have in view, then their proposal cannot be too strongly denounced as tending to divert the relief afforded from its real objects by the blind profusion with which it is proposed to scatter it among recipients whose qualifications are imperfectly ascertained. Any person who will pause to ask himself what proportion of his friends who have attained- to sixty-five years of age are actually incapacitated will realize that the mere age criterion is no test at all. And statistics bear out one's general impression. In our general population, persons of sixty-five years or more count for about 6 per cent, of the whole number of ten years old and upwards. In our commercial and industrial population they count for about 4 per cent., and in the agricultural for about 10 per cent. I do not suggest that a pension of 5s. a week would not be a great boon to a hale agricultural labourer or hearty carpenter of sixty-six years old. But I do take leave to say that it is sheer frivolity to propose that, or anything like that, as a remedy for the distress produced by want or, as a scheme for the relief of the deserving poor. The poor deserving of public consideration in this sense are not the hale old men who are energetic and self-sufficient at sixty-five and seventy years of age, but the broken men and women of all ages whose specialized faculties or otherwise limited aptitudes are a drug in life market through movements of trade, change of fashion, decay of health, or other casual misfortune. These are the meritorious objects - meritorious in the sense in which misfortune is a merit - of public benevolence, and to those of us whose humanity has not been sapped by rhetoric, it is maddening to see their claim postponed to this  demand for old-age sinecures. Do not the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> - does not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burns,</inline> at least - know well that the pinch of poverty is no respecter of decades? </para>

                        <para>I would venture to go a step further, and point out that all experience goes to show that the poor-rate will not only not be diminished, but will ultimately be materially and continually increased. It has invariably been found that when out-door relief has been diminished or increased, indoor relief has diminished or increased at the same time. It is enough to cite the well known case of the Bradfield Union, where in twenty-five years the number of outdoor paupers was reduced from nine hundred and ninety-nine to thirty-five, and that of the indoor paupers fell at the same time from two hundred and fifty-nine to a hundred and five. </para>

                    <para class="block">So that when charity is lavish, and administration is lax, the indoor and the outdoor relief increase. That is a piece of evidence that was brought out in the elaborate report on the Poor-law in  1835.  I should like to remind my honorable friends opposite, who are very critical indeed, that the education of the human race is proceeding very very slowly. The latest authority in support of that fact is the leader of the Labour Party, who has declared that Socialism, as the Germans mean it, and as my honorable friends opposite mean it - the Socialism which would nationalize everything - is not immediately possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> says that we have to educate the people up to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> has gone back on their policy. </para>

                        <para>I am making an investigation into the detailed working of contributory pension schemes in Germany and Austria with a view to finding out how far they could be applied in the United Kingdom. In the event of either political party granting pensions at the expense of the State, continual demands for increases of the amount and reductions of the pension age seem likely to result. Agitation of this kind could probably best be met by advocating a scheme by which the contributions would be provided by those who will benefit. </para>

                    <para class="block">Do not honorable senators opposite see that the system which they advocate simply means doling out - shovelling out - money ? Although they pretend and assert in their scheme that the pension is to be considered and accepted as a right, and not as a charity, will a declaration of that sort make any difference to what it really is? In their scheme, they lay no obligation on the citizen, and bring before him no duty. The German system does. It brings forcibly before him, and compels him to discharge, the most sacred duties of manhood - to provide for his old age, for his partner in life and for the dear ones he has brought into the world. The German system requires that this duty shall be carried out, and stimulates and encourages a man in the effort. Our system is defective in every one of those vital principles. Surely my honorable friends will see that there is room for doubt and consideration. Everything shows that, with all the experience of the world before us, we have chosen the wrong system, while the right system has been under our noses all the time. I now come to it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that it is increased. It ought to decrease immensely, but it will not decrease as much as it ought to. Honorable senators opposite may call the old-age pension a right if they like, but they are going to make the thrifty pay for the thriftless - the industrious pay for the loafer. They give money away to people and ask them to do nothing in return for it. They do not ask them even for one penny, or sixpence per week. They simply say, "Take the money." That is not the way to build up a strong, virile, independent nation, but just the reverse. I hold in my hand two very important documents, which I am indebted to the German Consul -General in Sydney for having sent to me. He evidently saw my notice of motion on the business-paper, and asked me if these two pamphlets would be of use to me. He also asked whether it would be well to send copies to other honorable senators. I said that it most certainly would. I believe that he had not enough to go round, but that some pamphlets were sent. This pamphlet, explaining the German scheme, was prepared with great care for use at  the Universal Exposition at St. Louis_ in 1904. I suppose, therefore, that every  word in it is correct, and that all the facts were carefully checked.  It gives a complete description of the great scheme of Germany, which, consists of three principal funds - a sick fund, an accident fund, and an old-age pensions fund, the last named also including a fund for pensions to those who have not arrived at the pension age. If the decay of a man's powers prevents him from earning a living, he becomes entitled, being an invalid, to what is called an invalidity pension before he reaches the pension age. Consequently there are really four different funds wrapped up in the German scheme. It is stated with regard to the sick insurance fund - </para>

                        <para>The great purpose of the insurance is to secure to the insured an ever certain and sufficient relief, in case of sickness, during at least twenty-six weeks. The minimum relief to which all the insured have a- legal claim includes : - 1. Free medical attendance and medicines from the beginning of the illness, likewise spectacles, trusses, bandages, &amp;c. 2. In case of incapacity for work, from the third day of the illness, foi every working day a sick pay, amounting to one-half the daily wages on which the contributions have been based, or, in special cases - free admittance to a hospital, together with half the sick pay for the family. Besides this assistance the obligatory insurance grants : -  3.  Burial money amounting to twenty times the average daily wages, and  4.  Sick relief to women during six weeks after confinement. </para>
                        <para> The contributions of the insured are limited by the law in the Parish Sick Insurance to 1 - 2 per cent, of the usual local daily wages of common labourers, and for the rest they must not exceed  3  -  4  per cent, of the average daily wages of that class of workmen for whom the club has been formed. The law binds the employers, when depositing the contributions of their workmen, to. pay themselves a sum equal to one-half the contributions of the employed, so that two-thirds of the whole are furnished by the workmen, and one-third by their employers. </para>

I shall refer to that directly when I come to deal constructively with what we should do here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> reminds me that the Workmen's Compensation Act is not nearly so good a scheme as this. I introduced a ' Workmen's Compensation Bill, and succeeded in getting it passed through the Tasmanian House of Assembly ten or eleven years ago, but it was thrown out by the Upper House. I then got my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliot</inline> Lewis, to introduce it again when I -left for the Federal, Convention. It was passed by the House of Assembly a second time, and it was again thrown out by the Legislative Council. The principle of that Bill was that if a man lost a limb or his life, the employer or the industry was not to. pay the whole compensation, but it very rightly made him pay a considerable amount of it. -From the accident fund, he would get a limited amount of compensation, and I provided in the Bill I introduced that  the maximum compensation should be ^300. That is also the Englishlaw. </para>

                            <para>- I have, and I admit that its scope has been greatly enlarged. Looking at it, I was astonished to see how limited was the scope of the Bill I introduced. It was limited, to a few classes only. The English Act has increased the number- of classes to whom the law applies, and takes in agricultural labourers, domestic servants, and seamen, and rightly so, too. I could never understand why seamen should be left out of the beneficial operation of such a law. I could never see why the man who falls from a yardarm when trying to save a ship from going on the rocks, or the man who, in assisting to carry on one of the -primary industries of the country, has his arm taken off in a threshing machine, should not be protected under a workers' compensation law. I did not include these classes of workers in the Bill I introduced, because I knew how difficult it would be for me to get the measure through the Legislative Council, even in the form in which I introduced it. Honorable senators will understand that the German accident . fund is contributed to solely by employers, through trade associations and insurance companies. The workman contributes nothing to the fund; his business in the matter is only to receive compensation for injury. I notice that the fund is under a State guarantee, so that, I suppose, the German Imperial Government does guarantee the trade associations in order that there may be no failure to pay compensation to an unfortunate injured work-  man. As the contributors to the fund include factory owners, and we know how wealthy they are as a rule, there may be no great necessity for the guarantee, but the fund being guaranteed, is as ' safe and sound as the Bank of England. In connexion with the fund, I find that it is said that, in virtue of these . laws, the employers have already paid over  £48,650,000,  have spent ,£10, 500,000 in. sanatoria and hospitals, that 1,433,000- cases have been compensated, and that there are £10,000,000 to the credit of the fund to meet future claims for compensation. I ask honorable senators whether that is not a national system of insurance worth striving for in Australia? Are there not great benefits to be derived from it, and does it not go far beyond anything proposed or carried out in Great Britain, or in any of the Australian States? And all this is brought about without any contribution from the worker at all. Surely even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would not disapprove of that system. I do npt hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> sneering at such- a system. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators must bear in mind that we could not have such a system and a Workmen's Compensation Act operating at the same time. If we adopted this system, we should have to repeal our Workmen's Compensation Acts, and would have to point out to the employer that he must make certain contributions to an accident fund, which would have to be substantial and sound, or arrange to pay certain premiums to insurance companies, leaving the insurance companies to meet the claims to compensation. </para>

                            <para>- Though the task would have been a difficult one, I should very much like to have had an actuary to estimate the liability of a manufacturer under a Workmen's Compensation Act, and compare it with the contribution which he would have to make to the accident fund und.er the German system, which has so nobly answered all the demands made upon it. I think the comparison would show that employers as well as workers would be benefited by the German system. It should pay the manufacturers better that each should have tq contribute a certain fixed sum to a fund than that one or two of them should have to pay possibly £1,000 compensation, under a Workmen's Compensation Act. I believe that the German accident fund would be found more advantageous to both parties, and it certainly would be infinitely more sure for the working man. I find this statement made in connexion with the invalidity pension - </para>

Thus the invalid pension offers a compensation for the Loss of capacity to work. Besides the proof of the disability (not purposely caused), a waiting time of regularly 200 (formerly 235) contributory weeks is requisite to obtain the pension'. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators will see the difference between this system and ours. Under the Australian system provision is made for an old-age pension when a man has reached the age of sixty-five years. But I do not think there is any provision for giving relief to a man who, before he reaches the age of sixty-five years, has .become absolutely incapacitated from work, and is consequently in greater need of a pension than a sound man of the pension age. </para>

                            <para>- I have a note of that, and it shows that, he is aware of the weakness of the existing scheme. I would ask my honorable friends opposite whether, in addition to the amount paid away in old-age pensions, and, notwithstanding the excellent work which the friendly societies are doing, they suggest that we should give sick p_ay as well? If so, where is it going to end? What will be the cost to the taxpayers if we go on giving these grants without asking for a contribution of 6d. or id. per week from persons who may hereafter become eligible for. the grant? The important part of the German scheme is that the employer contributes one-half the fund, and the workman _ the other half. Then there is a State contribution in the form of a little pension of  50  marks, or <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s.  per year, to every man on his arriving at the age of seventy years. That represents the whole of the State contribution .to the old-age pensions fund in Germany. Even taking into account the fact that with us money is more expensive, I should be disposed to be more liberal than that. Really I do not care how generous, within reason, we make the pension, so long as we base the system upon some form of compulsory contribution from persons' who may be eligible for the grant. I could read any quantity of evidence to show that if we trust to voluntary action; if we think that men will make provision, by insurance or in some  other  way, for themselves against accident or old age, we shall be disappointed. Not one in eight or nine will do it. It is ridiculous to go on imagining that we shall ever grow into a robust arid healthy nation, morally and physically, unless people who cannot be induced to do so are compelled bv law to carry out these sacred duties.

We are accustomed to see such things in the newspapers; but it appears that three cases of 1 the kind were tried yesterday in the police courts in Melbourne. In one case a man who had been left  ,£375  gave his unfortunate wife a sovereign, and then went away to Sydney, and spent the balance of the money. After leaving his wife in degradation and want and misery, he came back to her, and she had to take him to the police court. He got rid of the £375

                            <para>- What did the other worthless husband do? He picked up his clothes, told his wife that he was going to clear out, and then sent a man who had sold them some furniture on the time-payment principle to take away beds and chairs and other furniture. When taunted with this in court he asked whether he had not left his wife . a few cooking utensils and a sewing machine. An order was made against him to maintain his wife. The third man was not quite so bad as the other two. With respect to what I think of the working men of the Commonwealth, I believe I could bring evidence to show that the degradation, poverty and misery attributed to drink is very often exaggerated. Some witnesses claim that one-third of the pauperism of the country is attributable to drink, others put the proportion at  40  per cent, and others, with whom I am disposed to agree, believe that very often too great a proportion of the. prevailing poverty and misery in a country are attributed to drink. Very often men are thriftless, and do not join benefit societies, because . they have wives and children to keep. With some men it is a hopeless task, and I do not blame them for not "joining benefit societies, but I wish to encourage people to do so. They should be shown that if they will exercise the smallest degree of self-restraint and thrift it will add to their savings. The State should help men who will help themselves. I do not desire that the State should dole out help to every one independent of character and ' of whether they will help themselves or not. </para>

I have stated that I would not do so, but I would not let him starve. I would look after him better than he is looking after himself. I would give him a home in a comfortable asylum.

                            <para>- Certainly not. An old-age pension, at ios. per week, would amount to  ^26  a year. Does the honorable senator not know that  10s.  or  7s. 6d.  is more than  4s.  od. ? Has he ever heard any one suggest that the old-age pension paid in Australia should be  4s.  od. per week? And yet we have evidence that people are being kept in Victoria for  4s.  od. per week. I would add a shilling or two in order to give them every reasonable comfort which a Christian democracy would like them to have. But I am not going to shovel out money without discrimination. Let me follow up this argument a little further. Suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> and ninety-nine other gentlemen had arrived at old age, and that, while they did not possess very much means, they had accumulated a little by industry, thrift, sobriety, and self-restraint? Suppose that living alongside of them were another one hundred gentlemen who had exercised no thrift or sobriety, who had not stinted themselves, but had had their pint of beer morning, noon, and night, .and their half-a-dozen pipes of tobacco every day. I wonder what he and his friends, honest chaps, would think when they were making their contributions, and at the same time helping to pay the pensions of the gentlemen who had not done a hand's turn to deserve any consideration other than a fair living in a decent asylum. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend will see that the German system is a compulsory, contributory, and discriminating system. Under the old-age pensions scheme the workmen are divided into five classes according to their wages; the contribution of a man increases by. gradation, in accordance with his wages. The pension which he gets is in accordance with the number of contributions which he makes, because the German Government recognises, as we all must recognise, that for one reason or other, a man may at certain times be out of work, and miss paying. Therefore, the whole of that scheme is graded, and according to the class to which a man belongs and the contribution which he makes, his pension is fixed. It is adapted to all the wants of the industrial classes. It tries to provide for all circumstances, and it is based on sound economic lines. Our system is not based on such lines, and it never can be unless a radical alteration is made. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the kind. Many of these institutions are constituted to carry out this law. Does not my honorable friend realise that if we were to set ourselves to work we could administer an old-age pensions fund at practically no cost? Have we not at our service the Post Office Savings Banks, the money order offices, the railway offices, the postal officials, and the State school officials? Is there any difficulty about receiving a contribution or paying a pension ? Is there any difficulty about getting the manufacturer to deduct from the wages the worker's contribution. In Germany it i.° all done by means of a card. On each card there are spaces for recording the fifty-two payments made in the year. When the employer pays a contribution to the fund one-half comes from himself and one-half from the worker. On payment of the money before a certain official he covers one of the spaces with a stamp, which is evidence that the workman and the employer have each paid his respective share. I cannot ascertain from either of the two pamphlets what is done in regard to men who are not in permanent employment, and that, I admit, is a difficulty. I do not know whether Government officials hunt up the men, or what they are supposed to do. Let me repeat what I have said here on many occasions. I cannot conceive a town in a Christian democracy going on without a Department of Labour. I cannot understand any community being able to carry out its laws or charitable organizations, or to find work for the workless, unless it has a complete up-to-date Labour Bureau, with the smartest secretary who can be found, in association with the different centres of employment, so that from one end of the State to the other a person can on inquiry ascertain what miners or agricultural labourers, or mechanics are wanted. If we had such an institution there would be very little difficulty, even in collecting the contributions to a pensions fund from the men who are not in regular employment, that is, from the casuals. </para>

That power was taken in the Constitution, so that we could establish one scheme for the whole Commonwealth, and, according to an American decision, we have the right to make State officials carry out Federal laws. Does my honorable friend think that if New South Wales repealed its system of old-age pensions because a Commonwealth system had been inaugurated, its officials would not use their best endeavours to see that the citizens of that State were paid their pensions? </para>

No. My idea is not that my honorable friends should do away with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act if they will not have any other, but should make it a success if they can, or go in for a system of profit sharing. Whatever they do, they ought to nail to the mast the declaration that the interests of employer and worker are mutual. So long as they have a system under which they point out that those interests are not mutual, and that the parties can only get their rights by going to law, they will have a rotten system.

                    <para>It is clear that the benefits thus secured for the health of the workmen are enormous. The principal aim is not alone to assist sick, injured, and invalid workmen, but to cure and make them capable again of earning their and their families' livelihood. Where death used to occur, life is now maintained. Where formerly the victims became permanent cripples, they now keep their serviceable limbs. Thousand of individuals that would have become wholly or partly incapable of earning their living, are now restored and 'can do their work as usual. The grown-up workmen in general are at present less exposed to sickness, invalidity, and accidents, and seem to have gained greater power of resistance, while the young generation is starting at once with a healthier and stronger constitution. And under the reign of the Workmen's Insurance, which more and more forms the ground and corner stone of social hygiene, this development is growing more favorable every day, and becomes perceptible through the gladdening decrease of mortality, or, to put it in a positive form, through the increase of vitality of the German population. </para>
                    <para class="block">There are many precedents besides the German precedent for the policy of compulsion. I will quote from a paper by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cockburn, which takes the form of a report on the International Workmen's Congress, held at Vienna in 1905. In this document he says - </para>
                    <para>Among Continental nations the German system of insurance is the most complete, but there is also in Austria and Hungary a form of compulsory insurance against sickness for industrial work people generally.

                    <para class="block">In some of these places evidently the rulers have more wisdom than we have. They recognise that miners follow a very dangerous industry, and they have therefore been careful to institute a proper system of compulsory insurance for miners. </para>

                        <para>A gentleman of my acquaintance employs a considerable number of out-door servants, grooms' and gardeners ; he found some time ago that none of these men, who are all young men and who receive wages ranging from 14s. in the case of boys to 30s. in the case of men, had made any savings at all ; and thereupon he proposed to them that if they would save as much as <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. a year and put it into the Savings Bank and bring him the book at the end of the year he would add <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. to it, and that he would go on doing this each year if they increased their savings every year by the amount of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. They were, of course, at liberty to save as much more as they liked, but the contribution of the employer was con fined to <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. in each year, which he intended to be a stimulus to induce the habit of thrift. Well, the effect was extraordinary. Almost all. these persons took advantage of it, and some of them have since left his employment to go. elsewhere taking their books and their savings, with them. But the amount of savings made under this system was perfectly remarkable. ' In one case it rose to ^150, in" other cases the sums were <inline font-style="italic">£20, £30,</inline> ^'40, ^'50, and <inline font-style="italic">£60</inline> bv men in receipt of these at all events not very high wages and altogether induced by this stimulus. But there are other cases which would, I dare say, suggest themselves to members of the Commission, and I have known of similar inducements offered by employers to their domestic servants having similar results, where no contribution would have been made without the additional stimulus afforded by the offer of the employer. </para>

Here is the case of an employer offering to give his men <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. per annum if they would only produce a bank book showing that they had saved <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 10s. for themselves.

I speak with a conviction drawn from intercourse with the class, when I say that it is to the depressing influence of the hopelessness of ever attaining to this most desirable and rightful state of independence, and of the certainty of being reduced ultimately to pauperism, . that the improvidence so prevalent amongst the lower orders may be chiefly traced. </para>

Indeed, I notice that, as a rule, it is the delicate wives who have the largest families. Such a man cannot be expected to save much, and therefore he wants all the help which can be given to him. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Booth</inline> when he says that we ought to have a universal system of old-age pensions in order to make the pension a right and not a charity. Are we to say that a man who enjoys an income of ,£10,000 or ^20,000 a year shall be entitled to get the same pension as a working man? ls a law bad because in it we discriminate? That appears to be a most nonsensical view. Could we ever get such a scheme through Parliament? It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Booth,</inline> or any body else, to suggest it ; but there is a better way out of the difficulty. Just as we discriminate in every law, so I would discriminate in the old-age pensions law. Is there anything wrong in saying that any man who does not get more than £3 or £4 a week shall be compelled to provide for his old age, or in saying that a man who is fortunate enough to earn £3 or £4 a week, winter and summer, wet or dry, year in and year out, shall be exempt, and shall provide for himself ? If the latter does not provide for himself, and comes to us as- a pauper when he is sixty-five, he, too, will be looked after, but not quite so well as the man who has. saved carefully. In any scheme which is to fit in with human nature there must be some discrimination. Although I admire <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Booth's</inline> large-heartedness,  I am not going to let my heart run away with mv head. We must have a system based upon principles which will stand the test of time. The German scheme holds up for commendation and reward all the duties which make for progress and manhood, while the Australian scheme does not hold up one of them. If we have such a system, we may not feel or know it, but in a generation we shall see its effects. I experienced a great deal of disappointment upon reading the report of the Commission, of which Lord Aberdare was Chairman, and that of the Committee of which Lord Rothschild was Chairman. They both came to the conclusion that it was impracticable and impossible for them to recommend any old-age pensions scheme. </para>

The various thrift organizations which have been developed during the past sixty years have without doubt contributed largely to the relative diminution of pauperism in proportion to population which has been in progress during that period. </para>

In conclusion, -we again point out that the number of aged poor who seek public relief, while still very large, has much lessened in proportion in the last thirty years, although the rate of decrease lias greatly diminished in the last decade. We are encouraged in our hopes for the future by the remarkable growth of thrift, as shown by -the savings banks and insurances in friendly societies, which are  largely  increasing in popularity and importance. The self-reliance and strength of character of the working classes thus evinced will greatly aid in the solution of the problems of old-age poverty as well as of general pauperism. </para>

                    <para>Some of the main points brought out by the evidence are : - i. The remarkable continuous decrease of pauperism, qualified only by the demoralizing and. pauperizing mischief of lax administration of the Poor Law ; 2. The remarkable continuous increase of wages, and of the purchasing power of wages; 3. The remarkable continuous growth, among the working classes, of thrift, of facilities for saving, of the desire to save, and of a healthy and honorable spirit of self-help and self-dependence. From these postulates it appears to result that direct aid from the State towards the establishment of old-age pensions is  unnecesary,  and, if unnecessary, detrimental to the- best interests of the classes concerned. And this objection to State intervention on historical, moral, and economic grounds stands separate and apart from the grave financial objection to be urged on the ground of the enormous and incalculable cost which any such scheme would ultimately involve. </para>

As those gentlemen point out, the question is not the fact of a man receiving relief, but the cause of his having to do so. If a man has struggled honestly all his life to support a delicate wife and many children, if he has not had permanent employment and has had ill-luck, is there any disgrace in. his taking the relief or grant or pension which a Christian State says is his right and due? But if another man, who has had no . disadvantage, takes it ; if a man who has poured 'two or three old-age pensions down his throat, or a man who has smoked himself dry with tobacco, or one who has gambled and never exercised one hour's self-restraint in his life, takes the dole, although he may be legally entitled to it, he must feel in his heart, and anybody who is familiar with his history will know,, that he is robbing the State. </para>

                            <para>- I have, and if time had permitted, I should have quoted largely from that admirable document, which puts the German system clearly and tersely, But having received from- the Consul-General for Germany pamphlets published by the German Government, I thought it better to quote from them. I admit the value of the information contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline> report, but I differ from the honorable senator absolutely in the conclusion at which he arrived that the German system is unsuitable to Australian conditions. I see no difficulty which could not be got over by the adoption of the German system. We should have their experience to guide us. Does my honorable friend think for a moment that by simply doling out a certain sum of money we should be establishing a good scheme? Our scheme is, perhaps, as simple as any on the face of the earth, but it is wanting in economic soundness. It is as simple as ABC to dole out  10s.  a week to every one who has reached a certain age, and it might be as simple to dole out £1 a week. But where is such a system to end ? There is an old-age pensions system in operation in Victoria today, and every one - and particularly the members of the Labour Party, and I do not blame them for looking after their friends - desires to increase the pension paid, to decrease the age limit, and to include as persons eligible for pensions persons who are not eligible now. I believe that persons not now eligible for pensions should be included in the scheme. I think it is a disgrace to give a pension to a hale and hearty man of sixty-five years of age, who is as well able as I should be to grow vegetables, to look after a garden, or to do light work on a farm, and at the same time deny a pension to a widow who has one babe tugging at her gown and another in her arms. We should give a pension to women in child-birth, as is done under the German scheme, and they are surely more entitled to a pension than a hale and hearty carpenter at sixty-five years of age. I therefore say that the Victorian scheme is defective, and that all these difficulties could be got over by the adoption of the German scheme. </para>

                            <para>- Surely my honorable friend does not imagine that I would propose to deny an old-age pension to women ? Certainly not.I have too much love for them. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Spencer</inline> Walpole, who signed a minority report, says - " It is proposed, therefore, that when a poor man has an assured income of 2s. 6d. a week, and the guardians are satisfied that he is a proper subject for a pension, they should be authorized to meet it with a pension of 2s. 6d. per week, making the whole income one of 5s. a week. When the poor person has an income of more than 2s. 6d. a week, the guardians should reduce their contribution by one-half the poor person's additional income. Thus, when the income is 3s. 6d., the guardians contribution should be 2s., making5s. 6d. in all ; when the income is 4s. 6d., the guardians' contribution should be1s. 6d., making 6s. in all; when the income is 6s. 6d., the guardians contribution should be 6d., making 7s. in all. </para>

He says - </para>

                        <para>It is, however, said that the principles of independence and thrift are assailed by the provision which takes away the stimulus of saving resulting from the prospect of destitution in old age. That this objection would be fatal if it had any real basis I readily admit, but it has no basis. </para>

                        <para>But that the proposed pension is inadequate in the sense of not in itself providing1 a sufficient maintenance I fully admit. To make it adequate would be an -error in social tactics, and the weakest points in this scheme are the few cases in ' which the pension income would be accepted as sufficient for all wants. I .trust that a rising standard of life may gradually cover these blots. </para>

He expects the pensioner to add to the insufficient and inadequate pension, a pension which he must earn for himself by thrift. </para>

I contend that, according to his scheme, we should cut down the Australian pension to something that would really be inadequate and insufficient, in order that those who may look forward to a pension may be encouraged to make the pension adequate by the exercise of thrift. Honorable senators cannot escape the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Booth</inline> suggests an economic principle. The Government can never go wrong in helping those who help themselves. They can never go wrong in giving pound for pound for charitable purposes, and so long as the people will help themselves, it is the duty of the State to help them. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that if we do something to encourage thrift we may expect to succeed. We may call the old-age pension a charity, or may howl from the housetops that it is a right, but if we give people something for nothing, and do not impress them with the idea that it is their duty to save, we shall discourage thrift. There are plenty of examples which might be quoted to prove that, we have history for it, and our own conscience and judgment must tell us that -it is so. </para>

                        <para class="block">If we are to secure the moral results for which I look, and without which a pension system would- be of little value, out-relief must be abolished. The original proposal of 5s. at sixty-five carried with it, in my mind, a proviso that no one should be granted an independent pension who had received poor relief during the preceding five or ten years. It was a clumsy device, but the aim was, by a gradual pressure, to bring about the abolition of out-relief. With seventy as the pension age, this plan would not work, and there is no practical course short of the entire abolition of out-relief for the old. To carry this out successfully, we need some system which shall put a premium on private  effort  of every kind. </para>

                        <para>This premium may, I think, be found by allowing those who are. in danger of drifting into pauperism to forestall the pension before their resources were exhausted. These early pensioners would not be paupers - they would dip no deeper than others in the public purse-but it would be asking a favour, and would carry with it sufficiently the " stigma of admitted poverty " to make every one prefer to wait for their pension till the proper time if it was in any way possible. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Booth</inline> does not think it -a blot. He says that if we hold out to. a man the prospect of getting a pension upon attaining the age of seventy years, but allow him to apply for it before he reaches that age, it will not be granted unless he can show that he has enough income to enable him to live in comfort. He goes on to say that it would be much better for a. man to struggle on until he attained to that age, and so obtained, as a right and not as a favour, a pension of 7s. per week. To come to the practical part of the subject, let me ask whether the working men of Australia can afford to contribute to some extent towards a system of old-age pensions for themselves ? According to the evidence which I have seen, and the difference in wages being enormously in favour of the Commonwealth worker, I should think that the working man can provide out of his own earnings the whole of the pension necessary to maintain him in his old age. As. to that there may be some doubt. But there is no doubt that he can, to some extent, earn by contribution the pension of 10s. per week which we all think necessary to maintain him in his old age. </para>

                            <para>- How many times have I said here that I opposed the legalization of Tattersalls in Tasmania in every possible way I could? I have never supported gambling, and why should I have Tattersalls thrown at my head here when I come to the most crucial point in my argument? I am looking at the drink bill, tobacco bill, pleasure bill, and gambling bill ; not at the cost of the comforts or necessaries of men, nor at the cost of the perquisites of the wives or the indulgences of children, and I do so because I am suggesting that by acts of self-denial, that would not be burdensome,' provision could be made for old-age pensions. Our drink bill is between <inline font-style="italic">£13,</inline> 000,000 and ^14,000,000, while the tobacco bill runs between ^3, 000,000 and ^4,000,000. For every male adult in the ' community the drink bill is <inline font-style="italic">£11</inline> 15s. 8d. I am charging" against the male adults all the drinks for the female adults. That is not quite fair in one way, but we cannot very well divide the pewter pot between the two. The consumption of alcoholic drink of all kinds by adult males costs <inline font-style="italic">£1.1</inline> 15s. 8d. per head per annum. Treating the tobacco bill in the same way, for I suppose that if a man expressed a strong desire his wife would not smoke if it would deprive him of an old-age pension, the annual consumption of tobacco per male adult costs ^3 2s. 9d. The pleasure and art bill is put down by Coghlan at  £1  4s. 6d. per head, but I deduct the 4s. 6d. for art, and set down  £1  for pleasure, so that "in every house hold of five persons <inline font-style="italic">£5</inline> is spent on pleasure in each year: I put down the gambling bill at <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> per male adult. I know that women do gamble, because in my gallantry I have had to help them. The total bill comes to <inline font-style="italic">£16</inline> 18s. 5d. If we deduct <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 18s. 5d. per head for women, we get the expenditure on drink, tobacco, pleasure, and gambling, by adult males at, say, ^14 per head. Now out of that sum cannot they afford to provide themselves with old-age pensions on the basis of a weekly contribution of 4d., 3d., or 6d, If we intend to make the States pay one-half of the contribution, as in Germany, it will be 2d. or 3d. per week. </para>

With all their Arbitration Acts, with all their strikes, which seem to be successful - - and I am not sorry that they are - with all the <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 14s. per week just won by .the bakers, with all their minimum wage, are they going to assume that the Australian working man will never be in a position to provide an old-age pension for himself?

                            <para>- The drink, tobacco, pleasure, and gambling bills amount to £16 18s.5d. per adult male. My honorable friends can knock off just as much as they please for the good wives, but they cannot make the total cost per adult male less than £13 or £14. Out of the increase of wages during the last few years, out of the increase which was granted to the bakers only forty-eight hours ago, cannot' a working man afford to make a small contribution towards a pensions fund? Will it do a man any harm if he does? Is it not right that he should be reminded by our legislation of those sacred duties which some men neglect, and which, perhaps, at times we all neglect. Why should we pass measures which do not pay any attention to the question of character making ? We all, I suppose, like to be politicians, though probably some of us would be prouder if we were called statesmen, but are we not also character builders? Ought we not to consider how a measure, if passed, will affect the character of our people? I contend that the existing Old-age Pensions Acts do not go to build up sterling character.

One company quoted10d. per week as the contribution by a man to secure a pension of10s. per week at the age of 65 years; but it has to meet all the cost of its office, staff, and directors. Taking the weekly cost at10d., if the State were to pay one-half, the worker would have to pay only 5d. Another company estimates the weekly cost at10d. and11d., but it says that it is on a returnable basis. If the weekly contribution were10d., and the State paid one-half, the contributor would pay only5d., and if he died before he attained the age of 65 years, all the premiums would be returned to his representatives by the company. </para>

                            <para>- At the age of twenty-one years. I have compared the rates of the Australian Mutual Provident Society with the rates charged in England, and I find that they are very much the same. The Provident Insurance Company will pay 5s. weekly to a person at the age of sixty-five years for a weekly premium of 2d. from the age of from one to ten years ; of 3d. from the age of from ten to twenty years; and of 4d.from the age of twenty years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> an English gentleman, says that a pension of 5s. weekly can be" bought for less than 3d. per week. There are even cheaper systems than that in England. I find that some of the English authorities are making provision for pensions for women for whom they now have sick funds, pension funds, and accident funds. There have been many schemes. There is the scheme of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lionel</inline> Holland, the Bristol scheme, the Chester scheme, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Burdetts' scheme. Every one of those schemes was considered by the Royal Commission, and every one was based upon some contribution by the recipients of benefits. They make it a principle to help the recipients provided they help themselves. I could not obtain a copy of the report of the Poor Law Com- . mission of 1835, as the Librarian informed me that our series of reports in the Library commences in 1836. It was, however, a most important report, the result of which was to alter the whole Poor Law system of England. However much honorable senators opposite may sneer at the poor-house, it has to be remembered that under the English system as much is distributed amongst the poor in proportion  of the population of Great Britain as is distributed by the scheme of old-age pensions in New Zealand.

                        <para>The instances which had occurred of the defeat of legislation by unforeseen obstacles, or by the laws not being administered in accordance with the expressed will of the Legislature, led the Commissioners to distrust the operation' of enactments, however clear and precise, unless a special agency were appointed to superintend and to control their execution. They say, "We find on the one hand that there is scarcely one statute connected with the administration of public relief which has produced the effect designed by the Legislature, and that the majority of them have created new evils, and aggravated those which they were intended to prevent " : whilst, on the other hand, they declare that the obstacles to the due execution of any new legislative measure by the existing functionaries are greater than heretofore, the interests of individuals in maladministration stronger, and the interests in checking abuses proportionately weaker. </para>

                    <para>Whether we call an old-age pension " a charitable dole or a right, it will have to be dealt with on the same lines as a charity. When a number of people come forward to claim pensions, each case will have to be inquired into, and the circumstances of each applicant investigated. As a man said to me the other day in reference to the old-age pensions system of Victoria, " Its administration reminds me of a charitable dole." That cannot be helped. The authorities all tell us that the evils attaching to any such system tend to multiply and increase. Therefore, it is most important that in formulating any Federal old-age pensions scheme, we shall take care to base it upon a sure and sound foundation. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Nicholls further says- </para>

                        <para>Anxious attention had been directed to the effect of the change upon the working classes, more especially upon those who had been accustomed to the allowance system. Inquiries were made as to the subsequent condition of those labourers whose allowances being discontinued yet refused to accept relief in a workhouse ; and it was found that they generally obtained independent employment without quitting their parishes. In the Faringdon Union all outdoor relief is discontinued, and relief in the workhouse was offered to. 240 able-bodied labourers, only about twenty of whom entered the house, and not one-half of these remained there more than a few days. Yet the diet in the workhouse was high as compared with the ordinary diet of the independent labourer. The reports from the dispauperized districts reported wages as improving and as being generally higher than in the adjacent pauperized parishes; and in concluding their report, which is dated August 8, 1835, the Commissioners remark that they are sustained in their labours by the conviction that the Act which they have to administer "will fulfil the beneficent intentions of the Legislature, and will conduce to elevate the moral and social condition of the labouring classes and promote the welfare of all. </para>

                    <para class="block">I regard that as a most astounding bit of evidence - that when outdoor relief was discontinued, out of 240 labourers only twenty entered the workhouse, whilst the others, I suppose, found work in the neighbourhood.. This evidence goes to show how much evil may be done by lax administration, and it proves that this subject is surrounded with the greatest difficulties. It requires the utmost foresight and the wisest statesmanship we can possibly devote to the subject to solve the problem in a satisfactory manner. It is not enough to say that we will simply give a pension of 10s. a week to everybody who wants one. The new Poor law proclaims that the personal responsibility of the individual is the necessary foundation of all social progress. Every evasion of that principle, notwithstanding many plausible advantages, has a parasitic and demoralising influence. Are we not now in danger of sacrificing the permanent and expansive principles of social growth for advantages which are merely plausible and evanescent? </para>

My honorable friend has quoted the bygone and utterly useless report - so it is regarded in England - of the Royal Commission of 1895. It  was practically forgotten when I reached England as Royal Commissioner for New South Wales in the following year.  Indeed, it was forgotten in the year after the Commission! had reported. It was forgotten so quickly that within twelve months Lord Rothschild's Committee was sitting to examine into the matter which the Royal Commission presided over by Lord Aberdeen - who died, unfortunately, while the Commission was at work - had dealt with. The Commission absolutely failed. Let me show what it did. I shall quote from what I wrote at the time. I quote from my report, page 23 -

There must be the willingness; nay, more, there must be the desire to construct, or such work cannot be effectually accomplished. </para>

                    <para class="block">While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> bases his whole motion on the idea of contributory support to a pension fund, he seems entirely to overlook the fact that the one class of the community who more than any other require the benefit of an old age pension scheme, who are more entitled to it, and for whom it is more necessary than for any other class, are the one class of the whole community who have no power to make contributions. I refer to the womanhood of the world, or, as we are discussing an Australian proposal, I will say, in this case, the womanhood of Australia. The workman may spend his money in providing for an old-age pension instead of knocking it down at the pot-house, but where is the workman's wife, the woman who gives up her life, her very existence, for the sake of her husband and children, who stints herself, as we know that true womanhood always does, sacrificing everything for those she loves and whom it is her duty to aid - where is she to obtain the money to pay for contributions to an old-age pension? She strips herself, she even goes barefoot, in order to provide the little boots and socks for her children to attend school. She gives up more than men give up. </para>

                            <para>- I gather that my honorable friend thinks it objectionable that there should be inquiries into the circumstances of people who are to receive pensions when they reach the pension age. I do not argue for a pension age. I want a necessity limit, not an age limit, because the man or woman who, by accident, has lost a limb, and can no longer earn a living, is just as appropriate a subject for State aid as is a person who has reached an advanced period of life. I quite agree with my honorable friend that if a man is hale and hearty there is no reason to give him a pension simply because he has reached a stipulated age. But my honorable friend wants these inquiries to be' made, and these circumstances investigated all through life, because how, otherwise, is he going to prove at the end of a life of sixty or sixty-five years . that the person concerned has been thrifty? In my report I recommended that, in the case of those who could show that at some period during their lives they had made an attempt to make old-age provision, and had lost it by unmerited misfortune, through accident or sickness, or some other unavoidable cause - I did not include fire, because you can insure against that - I recommended that in such a case, where the old-age provision had been lost by unmerited misfortune during, say, ten years before the pension age, when, of course, there is not much chance for the old man to overtake and make good that which he has been stripped of, 50 per cent, increase of pension should be paid to those who had made that worthy attempt in the direction of old-age provision. Certainly, I approve of a system of pensions- based upon contribution if you can only work it, but you cannot work it. . You can work it for the well-to-do workman, the man in constant employment, or even the woman in constant employment ; but you cannot provide it for the wife, you cannot provide it for the widow, whose whole attention is centred upon the bringing up of her little children. You cannot provide it for the chronically sick and the chronically feeble, and those who have suffered through accident. You cannot fit any contributory scheme to such cases. There is one other objection that I shall merely name to-night. If you try to build up a. contributory scheme for the whole community, you reach such1 gigantic funds that you cannot make them interest earning. The funds would exceed the national debt of England over and over again. In four years the funds of the German system aggregated £75,000,000, and they did not cover anything like all the workers of Germany. If your fund is so gigantic that it does not earn interest regularly, your whole contributory scheme comes littered to the ground like a pack of cards. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly ;. and that is one of the troubles of the friendly societies. The friendly societies, of England had ,£220,000,000 to their credit, and the difficulty was to find investments for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> as one of the members of the board of the greatest of England's oversea life offices, knows the trouble of finding investments. That is the greatest duty of a board of directors ina large life office. If it came to the handling, not of tens of millions, but of hundreds and even hundreds of thousands of millions, what would be the result ? It is shown in my report in referenceto <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain's</inline> No. 2 scheme - which would give a pension of only 5s. a week to the workers of England, and involve only 7,000.000 of the workers and 4,000,000 women - that when the fund reached its apex it would amount to billions without interest. I need say no more to-night, except, shortly, to open honorable senators'' eyes in one direction at least to two facts : that my honorable friend, in proposing a- ! contributory scheme, is proposing something that all the world has gone against, except in the case of the limited German scheme; and, secondly, that you cannot provide a contributory scheme that is possible of operation by the women, the chronically sick and feeble, and those who are incapacitated by various reasons from regular work. </para>

                            <para>- That is still another matter. It is referred to in my report. I cannot deal with it to-night, but I should like to have even half the time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has had to enable me to show, far more conclusively than I can  in  the course of about a quarter of an hour, that ray honorable friend, while actuated by splendid desires - for we know that he is an enthusiast - has taken up only one phase of the question. He is saturated with the idea of a contributory scheme. Strangely enough, he quotes <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Booth, who is shown in my report as advocating a pension scheme of 5s. a week for everybody in the United Kingdom over a given age. The estimate was for twenty-four millions a year, and I pointed out then, as I point out now, that the world has not yet reached a stage of development ' that appreciates a proposal to pension at the public expense the. millionaires of the nation. I hope that I may be permitted on a future occasion to continue a speech which; out of regard for the comfort of honorable senators, I feel that I should not be justified in prolonging tonight. </para>
