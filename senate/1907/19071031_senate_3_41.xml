            <para>- To the first two questions the answer is &#34; Yes.&#34; Reports have been received, but they contain information with regard to the cost of the various classes of . vessels which might be utilized in connexion with the naval defence of the Commonwealth. The information is confidential, and it would not be wise to disclose the contents of the report at this juncture. I am not in a position to say definitely on what date the Government will announce its policy of naval defence, but its intention is to deal with the matter this session. </para>

              <para>- In the first three of his questions, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> asked whether the attention of the Government had been called to certain statements which had been made, and the reply was &#34; No.&#34; In his fourth question, he inquired whether the Government considered it necessary to make any inquiry, and the reply was &#34; No.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> will see that out of the answers to those questions very Tittle can arise which is strictly relevant. It is only a desire to keep honorable senators to the rule of relevancy which has caused  me to intervene. I wish to say a few words with regard&#34; to the asking of questions without notice. Lately a great number of such questions have been asked. Very many of them have not been strictly questions which should be put in the form in which they were couched. The Chair has the right - which is always exercised - to have questions on notice revised,&#39; and put in such form as it may consider proper and pertinent, and at the same time to fully concede to honorable senators their right to make inquiries in regard to various public matters. My attention was more particularly drawn to this matter yesterday, when I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> &#39;s notice of the questions which he asked to-day. It embraced the complete text of no less than six letters, which had been sent, I understand, in reply . to inquiries made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dalrymple.</inline> It contained a very lengthy extract from another letter, and also a very lengthy extract from a debate or a speech in the Queensland Parliament. When I saw that his questions partook of that character, I intimated to him at once that, in my opinion, the notice was not in such a form that it should be placed on the paper, because the object with which a question is put is to elucidate facts appertaining to public matters which come within the cognizance of Parliament. I realized that if the text of six or seven letters embodying statements or expressions of &#39;opposition by persons outside Parliament could be placed on the notice-paper, an opportunity would be afforded to honorable senators, instead of debating matters, to place on record the opinions expressed by newspaper correspondents or writers of letters. If that could be done on one side, it could be done on the other .side, and we should never reach finality. That would be an abrogation of the functions of Parliament. I did not .consider that it was a proper course to adopt, and therefore I requested <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> to condense his notice of questions, which he did. I &#39;also desire to acquaint honorable senators with the practice in the House of Commons, and they will see how it applies to reading newspaper extracts, and asking a Minister if he has seen a particular report or paragraph.

          <para class="block">I have no desire to curtail the rights or privileges of any honorable senator. While honorable senators individually possess their rights, honorable senators collectively have their rights too. Honorable senators should, as far as possible, refrain from unduly quoting statements which appear in newspapers unless they are in a position to vouch for their accuracy. I ask&#39; them not to found long questions on matters which are contained in newspapers. Once or twice we have had documents quoted in notices of questions. But as far as possible I have struck out everything that was not pertinent to the subject-matter. Honorable senators may regard &#34;this as to some extent an interference with their privileges. But the ordinary business-paper of the Senate would hardly have been large enough to contain the whole of the question already referred to which was handed to me yester. day. If it had been accepted in its original form, it would probably have been necessary to print an extra page to, embrace other business. That would really be the beginning .of what might become a serious abuse of the rights and privileges of honorable senators. I have made these remarks in good faith, and I- wish honorable senators clearly to understand that I do not want to take away from them any rights or privileges which they ought to enjoy. As the practice has grown up and been recognised in this Chamber of allowing certain quotations to be included in questions, I do not propose to interfere with it. But if the quotations and extracts should become unduly lengthy and too great an infringement of the proper practice as adopted in the House of Commons, I might feel it necessary to interfere. </para>

They are quoted from letters which the honorable senator who put the questions says were . written by the companies mentioned. That honorable senator, in placing the questions on the paper, has taken upon himself the responsibility of saying that those are the statements contained in the letters, about which he desires the Minister to make inquiries. I could not object to the statement referred to, because it is an essential part of one of the questions. If I had wished to eliminate it, it would have been necessary to refuse to allow the question to be put. But I have- allowed it in the most condensed form to which it could be reduced. </para>

I quoted the practice of the House of Commons, but I also alluded to the practice which had grown up in this Chamber, and said that I was not prepared to interfere with it, because, if I did so, honorable senators might consider that I was unduly curtailing their rights. If an honorable senator sees fit to quote from a newspaper, I consider that he is responsible for the correctness of his quotation, and not for the correctness of the statements made in it. In quoting it, the honorable senator does not vouch that the newspaper is correct, but that the quotation is correctly made. I have no objection to an honorable senator founding a question upon a quotation in that way, because that has been the practice of this Chamber. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South. Wales) &#91;2.55&#93;. - I regret that I was not able to be present last week to participate in the discussion on a Bill which, if it leaves this Chamber in its present form, can only be characterized by well-wishers of the Commonwealth as discreditable to the Commonwealth, and a serious reflection upon the Chamber which adopts it. I propose also to show in a most emphatic and authoritative manner that the Bill, which purports to be in the interests of the workers, is denounced by the society of workers which it professes to benefit. I shall use at least one official document to show that the party which is keeping the present Administration in power has been over and over againdenounced by those whose votes bring that party here. I regret that I cannot make my remarks more brief than I shall find it possible to do. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator may hold his peace and hide his head before I have done. I wish to draw attention first to some of the clauses to which any thinking person will take serious objection. Clause 4, which deals with the possible appointment of assessors, places their appointment and functions purely in the hands of the  President  of the Court; and, instead of being his colleagues or assistants, they may be, if the Bill becomes an Act, merely his creatures. &#34;And the assessors shall discharge such duties as are directed by the President.&#34; Talk of the old biblical proposition of a son asking bread of his father and being offered a stone ! What is this that, the Labour Party and the Government, who are the creatures of the Labour Party, offer to the workers of Australia? The assessors are to be selected </para>

              <para>- Is there a Court in the land in which the Judge is authorized to refuse the right of a suppliant for justice to be represented by counsel? I very much doubt that in any State in the Commonwealth a law exists under which the Judge of a Court has the right to refuse to allow one of the parties to a matter before him to be represented by. counsel or solicitor. On this point I am going to read the official protest against this clause which comes from the Victorian Agricultural Implement Machine Makers&#39; Society, and which bears the stamp of that society. </para>

It may be pointed out that the Court constituted under this Bill is not a Court of justice or law as we understand it, because the  President  is not to be governed by the rules of evidence or by the rules which govern Courts in the ordinary acceptation of the term. Yet under clause 8, although this is an inferior tribunal, if any man, woman, or child disturbs the high executioner, there isa penalty of &#163;100 attaching to the offence, and no lesser penalty is provided for. If we turn to clause 12 we shall find that if an employS working in one of the factories which come under this Bill chooses, by his absence, to upset the whole course of business of a large concern, though to do so may throw hundreds of men out of employment, a fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10</inline> is considered enough for his offence. But if some person innocently or accidentally interferes with the high sense of decorum of the  President  of this secondary Court, a fine of ,&#163;100 is the only penalty for such an outrageous offender. Let us look at clause  9,  which is the most outrageous clause in the Bill, and I particularly ask the attention of my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of the clause, under which it &#34; is provided that any person who shall -   refuse to answer any question which he is required by the  President  to answer,&#34; is to be liable to a penalty of &#163;100 </para>

              <para>- Here we have a clause which absolutely compels a man to incriminate himself or his dearest friend or nearest relative, or be fined &#163;100. I dare affirm that there is no law in any corner of the British Empire which contains a similar provision. I further assert that such a provision was never included in the instructions to the most outoftheway and extraordinary Commission appointed to deal with the most heinous matter that ever came up for consideration by any British tribunal in any part of the Empire. Clause  5  prohibits the appearance of counsel, except by leave of all the parties ; and how many parties may there not be to an inquiry in connexion with an application for exemption from Excise ? At the inquiry which is at present going on there are three parties represented, and there ought to be four.&#39; The fourth party ought to be the Government, whose duty it is to see that their own legislation is enforced, and to collect the Excise that is collectable under the principal Act. </para>

              <para>- And that is the Government. I am happy to be in complete agreement with the honorable senator. It is in consequence of the administrative neglect - and, if I were dealing with a firm or a company, I should say the criminal neglect - of those in whose hands the responsibility lies to discharge their duty to the public, that this thing has come about at all. The Government could discharge their duties in South Australia. They could make the manufacturers of that State pay decent wages or pay Excise, but in this State they are so utterly the creatures of certain Victorian manufacturing interests that they cannot do their duty or hold their heads before the world as commonly honest. </para>

              <para>- I said that with reference to clause  5  of the Bill I intended to read the statement of the Vic- torian Agricultural Implement Machine Makers&#39; Society. This is a society the members of which are particularly concerned in the McKay works - that is, those&#39; who are left there. Because, whatever honorable senators may like to assert here by way of interjection, they cannot effectively contradict the statements that have appeared in the press that since the Government abandoned the workers in these industries, and they have had to fight for their own rights, no less than 750 of them have been discharged. There is a pretty state of affairs ! No less than 750 of the workers in these Excise-exempted industries have been discharged because they have attempted to win that which a miser: able, decrepit, and unwholesome Act has pretended to confer upon them. I propose to quote from a document which is only two days old. I am glad to say that I believe there is a quorum present, because I am in a position to assert with assurance that attempts have been made by the party who, in this chamber, arrogate to themselves the representation of the workers, to count out the Senate, even on Government business, when I have been addressing honorable senators on this subject. </para>

              <para>- My honorable friend has been told that this matter has been decided by the Chair, and, however courteous I desire to be, I regret that I cannot answer any further question on  the subject. I point out at this stage that when a few weeks ago the largest body in Australia - the Australian Workers&#39; Association, of whichMr. Spence is the well-known leader - wanted to fight a question in the law Courts, they did not instruct <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spence,</inline> with all his ability, to plead their cause, but paid big fees to a barrister who they evidently thought was the ablest man they could engage. </para>

          <para class="block">Of the Act, I suppose it means -  just as the employers in the past&#39; received the benefit of the &#34;old protection&#34; without the responsibility. The free-trade press <inline font-style="italic">(Argus,</inline> 22nd October, <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> 2nd October), the Liberal-Protectionist organ <inline font-style="italic">{Age,</inline> nth October), the Labour paper <inline font-style="italic">(Worker,</inline> 10th October), and the prominent f ree-traders in Parliament, including the leader of the Opposition, all insist that the Government has not done&#34; its duty. </para>
          <para class="block">Without pretending that the words apply to myself, I have insisted here, on several occasions, and I insist again to-day, that the Government have not done their duty in this matter. They have not protected the revenue and the workers, and this Bill is a transparent subterfuge on their part to again dodge their responsibilities, and, if possible, by any method or means to scramble or slink into recess, and have another six months&#39; tenure of office without doing their duty of collecting the revenue under the Statute, the responsibility of which they have incurred. The document concludes - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is only the acquiescence of the Labour Party which allows the Government to continue to shirk that duty. Fools or otherwise, we knew what we wanted when we organized, agitated, paid, and voted for the &#34;new protection&#34; which was promised us in return for our votes and influence, and now we want the contract completed, without having to shoulder the whole responsibility and ruin our organization. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Surely  that is a sentient appeal to the Parliament to see that the &#34;duty of administering the Act and collecting the revenue is discharged by Ministers, and that it should not be left to the struggling members of a trade society to put their hands in their pockets and take from their 3s. or 4s. a week the funds which are necessary. My honorable friend opposite laughs, but he ought to be ashamed of himself. </para>

          <para>Yet a little matterof &#163;25 income tax has been made the subject of , an expenditure of thousands ofpounds by the Commonwealth.; The Commonwealth is now spending thousands ofpounds in employing special persons at bothsides of the world to contest a trumpery income tax claim in respect of the salary of a Commonwealth official in New South. Wales. But whenit comes to the collection of&#163;9,000 of Excise allegedly due by one firm only - fifteen months output of machines at&#163;6 apiece Excise duty - the Government sit supinely by and bring in a Bill to play the fool, not to collect the duty - </para>

            <para>The assumption is that the employer is doing all that is legitimate, and the onus is -thrown . upon dissatisfied employes of conducting an expensive suit to prove that the Excise duty should be imposed, in order that an increase of wages may thus be obtained. Employ&#233;s, who, if their case be proved, . have been underpaid since 1st January of this year, are placed in the position of tax-collectors for the Crown, which stands idly by as if it had no responsibility in the matter. If the employ&#233;s be quiescent all is well, and the Excise duty is not collected. If the employes be dissatisfied, they must go to preat expense to prove that so many thousandsof pounds of Excise duty are due to the Commonwealth. A more extraordinary and , absurd state of things could not be conceived. Surely, if a large amount of revenue be at stake, the Crown should be active and vigilant in enforcing its claim. If no revenue be at stake, and the Crown has not sufficient interest in the matter to be represented by counsel, then the Act is a farce, and the guarantees it professes to afford to employ&#233;s are a delusion. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill is equally a farce and a painful delusion. I come now to what is perhaps the crux of the position, as showing, in the most impersonal wav possible, what has developed within the last few weeks. Inthe first instance, a resolution was adopted by the Trades Hall Council denouncing the Government for failing to collect nine months&#39; Excise, and pottering about with a delusive Bill instead. The next stage was that the workers concerned in this industry called a meeting of ail trades interested in the new protection - the new protection upon which, and onlv upon which, the present Administration is politically living. </para>

              <para>-theyare torats,  butIhope thatthe honorable sena torwillnever occupy that position in a political sense. The third statement is that the meeting of employ&#233;s interested in those trades alsodenounced the Government. They called upon the Labour members to help, and said that they had to thank certain members of the Federal Parliament who did not belong to the Labour Party for the only help they had received in the halls of the Legislature. They had to thank other members when the Labour members had deserted them. The next stage was that the meeting appointed a deputation, which interviewed members of the Labour Party. The reply they received from the gentlemen whom they approached - they may not have been members  of  this Chamber, but may have been of somewhere else - was that &#34; It was notin theirpower  or  their province to do anything to embarrass the Government.&#34; Never mind the pay of the workers ! Never mind the revenue ! </para>

ThePolitical Labour Councilsentacomplaint to the Labour Party, and thereply theygotwas an offerto receive adeputation. Thenthedeputation took place. They waited upon Messrs.Watson, Fisher, Tudor,and, Iunderstandoneother.The interview lasted something like a couple of hours.The deputation askedthattheGovernment should do itsduty, andthat the Labour Party, acting upto its high professions of public service, should see that the Government did itsduty. The effectof the reply was, &#34;You have got yourselves into trouble through employing lawyers. Why did you employ lawyers?&#34; That has been followed up by a member of this Chamber moving and securing the insertion of the very clause to which so much exception . has been taken. That clause provides that no party is to be represented in a suit as to responsibility for the payment of a duty under the Excise Act unless every one else assents and the Presidentgives his blessing to the proposition. Without the blessingof the  President,  there can be no representation, or possibly no adequate representation of the workers, or of the interests of the whole body of the people who are concerned that all shall meet their responsibilities to the revenue. I understand that there has been a great deal of friction and trouble. I know from statements of membersof the Senate that there has been a good deal of &#34;pull devil, pull baker&#34; aboutthis matter. I admit that there have been those in the Labour Partywho have sought tomaintain the interests of the workers. Idonotknow that anybody has worried very much about the interests of the revenue; but I doknow that there havebeen those whose interests have been very much more concerned in the factthat the Government are not to be troubled about the matter than anything else. And with what result?Idare say that we should findthat there is morethan a suspicionof truth inthe whisper that the retirement from the head of a great political partyin the Commonwealth- </para>

              <para>- I have to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> for reminding me of that, and I shall therefore say no more about the penalty provided under clause 8. I wish, however, that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 9 should be reconsidered. It has reference to a refusal to answer any question which a witness is required by the  President  to answer. I think that provision should bo amended to provide that the question shall not be one the answer to which would incriminate the witness. That would be &#39;a reasonable provision, such as is to be found in almost every Act of Parliament, with the exception of some of the very stringent measures which have been before the Senate lately. I may indicate the amendments which I propose to move should the Bill be recommitted as I desire. In clause 5 I propose merely to move that the words &#34; and by leave of the  President  &#34; be left out, in order that it may be left to the parties themselves to say whether they shall be represented by counsel. Surely the consent of all the parties should bc sufficient, without their having to go cap iri hand fo the  President  for permission to employ legal advice? I have indicated the amendment which I think should be made in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 9. These are by no means all the defects I see in the Bill, but I recognise the uselessness of hoping for % more general amendment of the measure. I hope that it will be amended in another place, but I think it would be to the credit of the Senate and in the interests of the people that it should not leave this &#39;Chamber without at least the amendments to which I have referred. I cannot imagine that the honorable and learned senators representing the Government in the Senate can take exception to the very moderate proposals I make. If the Senate is against me, all I can say is, that in- bringing this matter forward I have done that which I deem to be my duty. Let me say that this is a matter which in no shape or way, so far as I know, affects &#39;any resident of the State from which I come, or has any kind of influence on my political fortunes. In taking the action I have taken I have been actuated by what I hope actuates every member of the Senate whenever he rises to address this Chamber, and that is the desire t&#174; discharge a public duty.

              <para>- Members of the Labour Party have a clear recollection that when the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Bill was before the Senate last year, and I introduced the new protection principle by way of an amendment to that Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> opposed it and had no sympathy with it. Yet to-day the honorable senator would make it appear that he is the only friend that the workers have in this Chamber in connexion with the new protection principle which he opposed last year, when he had an opportunity to display a practical sympathy with the policy. </para>

              <para>- No; butI believe that there is a lack of sincerity on the part of many of those who profess to be extremely anxious at the present time for the extension of the new protectionist principle. I believe also that we should not have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> on this matter to-day if he had not been so well fortified with information by a certain gentleman whose occupation will in all probability be gone as a result of the exclusion of lawyers from the Arbitration Court in future. This solicitor would appear to be extremely anxious for the welfare and betterment of those who are engaged in protected industries. But I never heard of him doing anything on be- half of the working classes unless he was paid for it. </para>

              <para>- Yes, it is; but if is not a good reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> who has hitherto been an opponent of the new protection principle, should endeavour to damage the Labour Party in the eyes of the country.I am also aware that this same solicitor has been doing his best to show that the Government has not done its duty in connexion with the Excise law. Well, we do not want any solicitor to tell the Government what it ought to do, because the members of the Labour Party in this Parliament have an opportunity of telling the Ministry face to face what ought to be done. A copy of the leading article which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> quoted from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> has been supplied to every member of the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Woolf, or by his instruction. I make that statement because. I made inquiries, and know that it is correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> also said that there was barely a quorum present when he called attention to the state of the Senate. The fact is that at 4 o&#39;clock there were seventeen senators present, of whom nine were members of the Labour Party, three Government supporters, and five members of. the Opposition. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> supporters were as regular in their attendance, and were as anxious to promote the betterment and welfare of the working classes, as the LabourParty are, we should not have anything to complain about. </para>

              <para>- I am. not here to defend the Government. I am here to keep them up to the collar in regard to the administration of certain Acts. But behind this attack upon the Government in regard to the non-collection of the Excise is the old free-trade bogey. This move is made by certain people, not only in Victoria, but in other States of the Commonwealth, who have no sympathy with the application of protectionist principles to manufactures, and who have never, so far as I know, shown any disposition to give relief to those who have been working under sweating conditions in protected industries. To-day we hear for the first time, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> himself, that he has become a convert to the new protection principle. Probably the conversion is due to the influence exercised over him by his legal adviser, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Woolf. </para>

              <para>- Well, we have to believe statements that are made by the responsible representatives of the Government. F or my own part, I have no other object in view than to see that the Act is properly administered. We have pur own opinion in regard to the delay that has occurred, and no one regrets that delay more than do the members of the Labour Party. In regard to the provision in the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Act, for which I am, mainly responsible, little or no time has elapsed since the Act came into operation; but I can assure the Government, that, being in a measure responsible for the provision, I shall give them&#39; no peace until satisfaction is arrived at in respect to the .workers engaged in the industry who are entitled to protection. In concluding these remarks,I wish to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> on his conversion. If his example be &#39;followed by other members of his party,, there is reason to believe that many of the measures which will be brought  forward .by the Government this session will, receive not opposition, but whole-hearted support from him and some of his Opposition friends, because almost all the measures that are expected to be brought &#39;forward wilt have embodied in them certain provisionsgiving additional protection and benefits toworkers throughout the Commonwealth. If. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> shows the same disposition and anxiety for the interests of the workers in other industries that will receive protection under the Tariff as he has shown in&#39; connexion with those engaged . in the harvester industry, the Government will have an easy task. </para>

            <para>. - I should not like this opportunity&#39; to pass without rising to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> upon his conversion. As it happens, the whole case which he has submitted to the Senate was laid before me yesterday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is the only member of the Federal Parliament, in addition, to myself, who was supplied with a copy of the circular from which he has extensively quoted. But when the circular was handed to me I was careful to inquire who had written it, and on whose authority it had been, issued. I inquired also by whose authority the stamp of the Implement Makers&#39; Union had. been put upon it. It was for that reason that, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> commenced to quote from the document, I asked him who had signed it ; because I think that, when a senator quotes from a document which professes to <inline font-style="italic">bb</inline> issued by a great union of workers, we have a right to know whether he has satisfied himself of its genuineness. The agent who&#39; approached me with regard to this matter last evening requested me to try to get a certain clause in the Bill recommitted. When I inquired who had written the circular which he handed to me, he informed, me that it was &#39; written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Woolf. I have not the slightest doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> obtained his copy from the. same source. The press cuttings which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has quoted were also sent along to other senators by the same gentleman or his agent. </para>

              <para>- That is what I mean. I can quite understand the bond of sympathy that exists between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> as an opponent of this Bill, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Woolf, who has been receiving big fat fees from workers in receipt of such wages as 2s. nd. per day. Naturally <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woolf</inline> did not like the idea of lawyers being excluded from the Excise Court. The object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> had in view in quoting from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> article was to prove that the workers of Australia wanted to have  the lawyers admitted into Courts concerned with industrial affairs. He tried to make it appear that &#34;the workers regard it as. a shame to exclude the members of the legal profession. But I have in my possession certain telegrams which go to disprove the honorable senator&#39;s statement. Prior to moving the amendment referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> I telegraphed to Sydney for the purpose of procuring information, and I received the following reply from the&#39; Secretary of the Trades&#39; Hall, Sydney - </para>

          <para class="block">I think those telegrams afford clear evidence that the workers are entirely opposed to the admission of lawyers to these Courts. We have not had an expression of opinion from the combined body of unions in Melbourne, but, nevertheless, we know that they are against the admission of the lawyer&#39;s to the Appeal Court. Throughout Australia, wherever there is a union of workers, they are almost unanimously against admitting lawyers to these Courts. I rose principally for the purpose of showing that the document read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is by no means a correct expression of the opinion of the workers. What is more, that document was not written by any person officially connected with any industrial union. It was not signed by any recognised worker or any person responsible for a trade union. It does not bear the signature of any union official. In fact, it is merely an attempt on the part of one individual, who has .certainly secured a very fair amount of money out of legal proceedings, to maintain his  position. I regret to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has fallen into the trap. I deeply sympathize with him on having been placed in such a false position, or having such a bad legal adviser. I wish him well, but ask him in future, before he gets up-: - </para>

We can promise him an audience wherever he may  go to speak, especially when he has such a popular creed as the new protection to advocate. The electors of New South Wales who have voted for him will, I am sure, stand by him. He will also have the support of a large number of labour men who hitherto have voted against him. His success at future elections is now assured, and his popularity in the Senate, which has always been great, will be much greater than it has been. </para>

            <para>. - I desire to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> because he has said a good deal of which I can approve. At the late election, I was one of those who advocated the policy of new protection in all sincerity. At that time the people had great expectations, but, after an interval of nearly twelve months, what have they received? Personally, I do not care a rap who may be Prime Minister, so long as the law is properly administered. If Ministers neglect to administer the law, I have courage enough to express mv views. We cannot ignore the fact that the Government have not done their duty in connexion with the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. It came into operation on the 1st of January, but until the end of May practically nothing was done, and even then what was done was not of a satisfactory nature. The case of Bagshaw and Sons was the first to be heard under the Act. The position taken up by the Government for a time was that only the masters and the men concerned should be allowed to give evidence. I can prove that statement, because the proof is in print. A member of the other House communicated with the Minister ; an alteration was made ; and the United Labour Party of South Australia had to put their hands deep into their pockets to pay for legal advice to defend their interests - really to protect the revenue. In view of the long interval which elapsed before the Act was brought into operation, I think that the Excise duty should have been collected from the very beginning. Of course, I recognise that it would necessarily take considerable time to get the machinery into working order. I do not advocate the oppression of even employers, but the law should have been brought into effective operation within a reasonable time. We have been amending not only that Act but other Acts, because it is claimed by the Government that the machinery is not complete. My impression is that the Government did not fairly try to put the machinery of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act into motion. Last night I said I would be prepared to trust the Government in connexion with another measure because I felt sure that they would not go too far..

I exceedingly regret that he was not present. It is for him to say whether or not he had a just cause to be absent. Surely honorable senators on the other side cannot throw stones at us ! During only one week - the week  before last - since I have been a senator have I seen the other side well repre?sented, especially in the evening. </para>

              <para>- In Adelaide the workmen were brought into the Court to give evidence in the presence of their employers, and almost without exception they admitted that they were satisfied with their wages. It was known and proven to the Court that their wages were not at all reasonable. Some of the men who were suspected of having had to do with labour unions were dismissed, and then a number of practical men, who had been in this employment for some years, and whose work had always previously been satisfactory to the firm, were said to be too slow, and not worth a full and fair wage. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is taking so much notice of labour matters, I now call his attention to the fact that under this Bill if an employ&#233; who has given evidence before a Court on questions of this kind is dismissed, the employer is liable to a penalty of &#163;50 unless he can prove that theemploy&#233; was dismissed for some other reason. That should appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> as a just and fair provision. </para>

              <para>- I am very glad that the honorable senator has seen them. I thought that he had not. I have seen them, and they are very gratifying to me.. I was here, and helped to put them in. Most of the Conservatives were absent. They mostly are at night time. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> objected that there was to be a penalty of &#163;50 in the case of the employer, and of only &#163;10 in the case of the poor workman. Not only is the principle recognised that employers must treat their men fairly and reasonably, and must not dismiss them because they give evidence before a Court, but it is also provided that if an employ&#233; absents himself from his employment for no good or satisfactory reason, he shall be subject to a fine also. That is all in the Bill. But there is a practical side to the question which the honorable senator has not looked into. I speak now not only as a representative of South Australia but as a farmer of long standing. These men would not have been dismissed if the season in New South Wales and Victoria had been different, if we had had abundant rains, and a promise of abundant crops. They would have been required in McKay&#39;s Sunshine Works. I know for a fact that during the recent good seasons in South Australia Messrs. Bagshawand Sons had to refuse a lot of orders. I have no doubt that that has been the case here. The Government should have taken up the matter  before, instead of ten months afterwards, when it- is a little too late. They are now trying to enforce the law when everything is in favour of the manufacturer and not of the workmen. It is of no use for  the workmen to blame the Labour Party. We have done our best to see that the Act is carried out. . I think that in the future I shall be able to have frequent conversations with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> and when we talk matters . over I hope that&#39; we shall come to a better understanding. . As the Bill is likely to become law, and will give the Government the necessary powers to carry out the <inline font-style="italic">Act</inline> in a proper way, I hope that they will do so. I admit that this is not a Chamber for the making or unmaking of Ministries, but, unless they carry out this and various&#39; other Acts that I accuse them of neglecting to carry out, they will get from me no more support than I am pledged to give. It is time we spoke as a Labour Party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> is our leader in most things, but on this question I speak entirely as a private individual, and want the Government to understand that they will have to toe the mark. Unless they do so, they will be simply playing with politics, making use of the Labour Party, and giving us nothing in return. I will support with pleasure the third reading of the Bill for the reasons that I have given. There is nothing inconsistent in that attitude. It is not this Bill, but the administration of the Act passed last year, that is at fault. Seeing that that Act requires a little patching to give the Government more power to carry it out, I shall be one to push them along -if they will try to do their duty. If &#34;they do not, I shall do the opposite. </para>

          <para class="block">It is most undesirable that we should bediscussing and criticising what is taking: place in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. I was a little shocked&#39; at the outspoken way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> did so, but I find, as he did, that I cannot deal with this matter in a practical way unless I also comment. upon what is going on at the Court. I understand&#39; from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> reports that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice-</inline> Higgins has already, in an informal way, made certain statements which demand the serious attention of the Labour Party. Of <inline font-style="italic">course, be may,</inline> in his formal judgment,, alter what he has said, but I do not think that he will, because it is in accordance with the Act which he is bound to administer, and outside of which he- cannot go. I am alluding to judicial findings which the Judge made as he went along. He is not bound by them, but still, he has made them. He has said that all that he has to do is to determine if certain wages are fair and reasonable, and: that he has not to ascertain or certify that they have been paid. He has&#34; dis:tinctly stated that that will be the duty pf the Customs Department. Evidence has already been given in the McKay case that certain wages alleged to have been paid have not been paid. I do not know whether the facts go to show that certain rates of wages are presumed to be paid, whereas a lower rate is. paid. But the members of the Labour Party will seethat if they wish to build up and develop a proper system of newprotection, and give to the Court adequate power to carry it out, it is useless to provide that the Judge must only find that certain wages mentioned are fair and reasonable, and leave it to quite another tribunal to ascertain whether those wages are actually being paid. We ought to amend the original Act, so as to pro-&#39; vide that the Judge shall certify that fair and reasonable wages have been paid. The language of .the Act is .so plain that any one can see that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgin&#39;s interlocutory  judgment on this point cannot: be altered - </para>

              <para>- The boot is on the other foot. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins finds that the wages are fair and reasonable, he makes that finding from the day on which he gives the certificate, and, therefore, for all the time which elapses from 1st January last until the day of the order <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> will have to pay the Excise duty even if be has been paying fair and reasonable wages. If that is the position, why. has not some enthusiastic member of the Labour Party called attention to it? We are now patching up the Act, and let us do our work in a practical manner by rectifying the mistakes in our legislation which are brought under our notice by the admirable reports of the proceedings of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court appearing in the newspapers every morning. A third most important matter is that we should give power to the  President  of the Court to make his certificate retrospective. He may find that some workmen are getting wages a little below what is fair and reasonable, that others are getting fair wages, and others again a little more. But suppose that, on the whole, he thinks he must give a certificate that the wages paid are not fair and reasonable, would it not be right for us to say under this Bill that a certificate may be issued if the employer will consent topay the difference where the wages previously paid have not been up to the standard defined as fair and reasonable? A man may be paying unfair wages unintentionally. He may have peaceable workmen, or none who are intent on looking after their interests, and he might have been prepared to pay better wages if he had been asked to do so. Surely our law should be sufficiently elastic to permit such an employer to make good the difference where he has been paying wages considered less than fair and reasonable. In the debate which took place on the new protection policy in another place, I believe it was stated distinctly many times that it was not the intention under the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act that the Government should necessarily collect duty from these manufacturers, but only that it should be used as a means of inducing them to pay fair and reasonable wages to their workers. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. Any one may see from the evidence given in the cases now being heard that some of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay&#39;s</inline> workmen have been getting the standard rate of wages. It is also a little obvious that some of them, and especially the juniors, have not been getting fair and reasonable wages. And if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> should be willing to pay up the difference between the wages he has paid, and fair and reasonable wages in those cases in which it is decided that he has not paid fair and reasonable wages, why should wenot encourage him to do so? Why, where both sides are willing to give effect to the spirit of the Act, should its letter be allowed to override its spirit and intention? I hope that the Minister will permit the recommittal of the Bill, and I urge with all the eloquence that I can command that it should be allowed to remain in Committee until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins has given his decisionin the cases now being heard. I understand from certain expressions of his opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins believes himself to be charged with the duty of finding, not that a generous wage, or even a good wage, has been paid, but that a living wage, with a little over to go and come upon, has been paid. We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has introduced a Bill to define some principle or standard by which we can find out whether the wages paid in an industry are fair and reasonable. We have heard of a minimum wage, and a living wage, and we are talking now of a fair and reasonable wage, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins makes a distinction between a good wage and a fair and reasonable wage. I hope that many of our workers are getting good wages. I have nothing to do with the new protection policy. I do not quite believe in it. But I hold that if the profits from an industry are generous the wages of the workers in that industry should also be on a generous scale. I do not, however, imagine that we can control human nature. I do not believe that all workers in an industry are of exactly the same value. I have always denounced the idea that there should be a minimum wage under which all workers should be paid exactly alike. </para>

              <para>- I think it does; it is wanting in elasticity. The average worker and the inefficient worker get the minimum wage as well as the tip-top worker. I believe that in some respects the members of the Labour Party have done excellent work. But I see in much of their work fatal blunders which will bring the whole industrial system toppling about our ears, because the skilled workman who is worth  &#163;4  per week is called upon to work side by side for the same wages with a man who is worth not more than&#163;3 or&#163;3  10s.  a week. </para>

I admit that there are some exceptions, and that a foreman may get higher wages than a journeyman. Honorable senators will forgive me if I have been wrong in other statements I have made on the subject, but  I  stand to this statement that hundreds of men are getting the same wage where there is a difference of  50  per cent. between the value of the work of some of them. </para>

              <para>- It is not a question of robbing men of their wages at all. It is a question of the adoption of a system under which skilled and efficient men can rise; honorable senators are. keeping them down, and I want to lift them up. I ask the Minister of Home Affairs to say whether it would not be well for us to keep this Bill in hand until we get the decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. I believe that that decision will throw a great deal of light on the subject, and will bring under notice two or three of the defects to which I am now directing attention. It would be well for us to wait for his Honour&#39;s definition of fair and reasonable wages. He is at present obtaining evidence as to the cost of living, and he has already said that a fair and reasonable wage should be a living wage, with a little to go and come upon.  I  think he has also decided that he could not withhold his certificate if the employer were not paying good wages, so long as he paid fair and reasonable wages. </para>

              <para>- That is another point, and I do not. see how any one can fairly fix a&#39; standard of wages without&#39; having regard for the fund from which the wages must be paid. Men are entitled to a living wage for their work, whether the factory in which they are engaged is making, or losing money. But they have no right to expect generous wages where the owner of the factory is getting no interest on his capital, and is getting nearer to being ruined every day. I believe that in their policy of new protection, honorable senators of the Labour Party are taking a retrograde step. They have been successful in setting up Conciliation and Arbitration Courts, and Wages Boards, but, not content with those sure and certain methods, they are now desiring to follow a speculative policy. They propose the policy of new protection to induce manufacturers to pay their employ&#233;s fair and reasonable wages, when all the time they have at hand tribunals to which they can appeal to fix wages that are fair and reasonable. Would it not be better for them to take that course rather than to continue to pursue the complicated system of new protection which has been proposed? </para>

              <para>- I think that the new protection policy is a backward step on the part of the Labour Party. I prefer the Conciliation and Arbitration Court or joint committees of employers and employes, to settle what are fair and reasonable wages amongst themselves, as is done in America and in England. Where joint committees fail, the Conciliation and Arbitration Court could be referred to. </para>

              <para>- I can inform honorable senators that in Tasmania we have peace, contentment, and prosperity. Those are three very good things. There may be low wages paid in .some instances in Tasmania, but ours is a small community, without the command of very much capital. We have peace and contentment there, and I hope honorable senators opposite will not attempt to disburb us, or we shall be bound to point out their fundamental, socialistic blunders. I again ask the Minister to permit the Bill to be recommitted, and I should like to hear what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has to say on the points which I have brought under notice. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> said just now that he knows that we do not take any notice of his remarks. In making that statement, the honorable senator did an. injustice to us as well as to himself. I recognize that his criticism has been, entirely friendly, and that he has put his finger on weak points in this_ legislation, which I may inform him  have worried others as well as himself. The honorable senator has exposed the weaknesses of this legislation in a perfectly honest fashion, and he takes a mistaken view when he thinks that we do not listen to what he says. I think we all pay a good deal of attention to what he has to say. If it had not been for the speech of the honorable senator I should not have spoken at all. I venture to say that the only useful contribution that has been made to the debate has been his speech. He has touched on the vital points. The rest of the criticisms have been so much beating the air. I should like to say a few words on some of the points that he has raised, as they are pertinent to the Bill. There is the point as to who&#39; is to administer the Act, after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins has declared what are fair and reasonable wages. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> would not say, in the case of the Arbitration Court, that after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor had formulated his schedule of wages and conditions to be observed in an industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor himself should be charged with the duty of seeing that the employers - the pastoralists - paid and the shearers received the wages laid down. </para>

              <para>- What I take it will happen is this: Several employers have appliedto <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins as the constituted authority for a certificate of exemption from paying Excise. Before that certificate canbe granted to them <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins has to decide what are fair arid reasonablewages. He has heard the evidence. He will come to a conclusion, and will lay down a schedule of what he believes to be fair and reasonable wages. The manufacturers willthen apply to the administrative branch of the Customs Department for their certificate; and they will, Itake it, haveto makea declaration that they are payingthe wages and observing theconditions that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins declares to be fair and reasonable. Upon theirmaking that declaration they will get their exemption certificate from theCustoms Department ; and itwillbe for the Customs Department, I take it, to see that the conditionslaid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins are being observed. But it stands to reason - and I have always recognised this- that even theCustoms Department cannotpolice thiskindof legislation. It willrest very largely with the employ&#233;s themselves to police it, as the policing of all industrial legislation rests with them. I venture to say that where the Wages Boards in Victoria have failed they have failed because of the laxity of the employes in not safeguarding their own interests. Every form of industrial legislation will fail if the employ&#233;s will not take the trouble to safeguard their interests. </para>

              <para>- If there is collusion, of course it will fail. It seems to me that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins declares what are reasonable rates his duty ceases. He lays down a schedule to guide the Customs authorities in the collection of the Excise. The certificate of exemption is issued. But if any manufacturer of harvesters does not conform to those conditions the Customs officers can at once suspend the certificate, and collect the Excise from the date when the breach of the award occurs. That is as to the future. It seems to me that provided the Customs authorities do their part, and the men do what they have to do under any industrial legislation the administration of this law will be compara tively easy. But a greater difficulty has to befaced when we come todeal with the interregnum from the1st of January last to the present date. It seems to me that the Government areopen to fair criticism, on the ground thatthey should havecollected the Excise fromthe1st of January oneach ofthe machines manufactured, have paid the money into a trust fund, and then refunded it to suchemployersas proved that they had observed the conditionslaid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. </para>

              <para>- Yes, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins has pointed out that he can only take a Wages Board decision as a guide, although he would give great weight to it. I think there is very good reason for that. This is a Federal and not a State Act. It applies to the whole area of the Commonwealth. We have in theCommonwealth a number of competing factories. One of these factories may get a decision from a Wages Board, and another factory in another part of the Commonwealth may pay very much higher wages. Both factories would be receiving the same benefit from our protective system. </para>

Coming to the point as to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JuiticeHiggins&#39;</inline> determination, and as to the rules that will guidehim in deciding what are fairand reasonable rates of wages, I point out that the Act says that he shall determine what are &#34; fair and reasonable&#34; rates, but not what is a &#34; good &#34; rate.

If the Judge were to determine what is a &#34; good &#34; rate of wages, he would have to consider the questionof profits madeby the firm. Lookat what that would lead to.He would have to compel that firm to put in evidence its books to show what profits it was making, and then, if hefixed what he regarded as a good wageonthe existing profit, he would have to provide a sliding scale as profits decreased or increased. </para>

              <para>- It would be a system of profit sharing which would add infinitely to the difficulties of working our industrial legislation, which are serious enough at present. If we are going to ask a Judge to say what is a fair and reasonable rate, having regard to profits made, the task is still more difficult. Look at what it would lead to. There may be in the same area some firms making a profit and others enduring a loss. What is to be done then? Is one firm to pay good wages and another bad wages? Endless difficulties are opened up. Abad season may come. Are we then to say that because there is a badseason wages are to be allowed to fall below a living rate? All that we can do, it seemsto me, is to lay down a roughandready rule, not a rigid rule. A minimum wage is, not rigid. In fixing it, we say &#34; Thus far shalt thou go down the scale, and no farther; below that rate on the scale the wage paid would be such that outworkers would not be able to maintain that standard of living which we think they should maintain.&#34; Even in those States where a minimum wage is fixed by law, it is not rigid. Take my own State. I have worked under a condition of things where wages were regulated by an Arbitration Court. But my own experience was that I never worked for anything so low as the minimum rate. </para>

              <para>- The system is not rigid, although it may be worked rigidly bysome employers. When we hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> - who in this matter, I recognise, tries to be fair and impartial - giving vent to some of the opinions which he has expressed on industrial questions, we must be confirmed in our belief that lawyers should be kept out of our industrial Courts. It is their inability - honest inability, I admit - to grasp industrial conditions which has led us to try to exclude lawyers from Industrial Courts. In Western Australia the great mining industry, the timber industry, and the great bulk of the manufacturing industries are working under the awards of an Arbitration Court in which no lawyer has been allowed to appear. The cases affecting the mining industry, where the awards affect thousands of men, were fixed up in one-fourth of the time which the case being heard in Melbourne has occupied. On every occasion the mine manageandthe miners&#39; secretary have each appeared before the Judge, called his evidence, and stated his case. In some instances, where the awards affected hundreds of men, the hearing did not occupy more than two days. No technical points were raised. It was purely an industrial question, and not a legal question, which had to be settled in each case. A lawyer&#39;s opinion on an industrial question is worth no more than my opinion on a legal question would be. For the reasons I have given, I intend to vote against the proposed recommittal. </para>

I desire to show <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and others that this general discussion does not affect the recommittal of the Bill by one iota. We are asked to recommit the Bill to alter clause 5, with respect to the appearance of lawyers in Industrial Courts. The proposed amendment is of such an insignificant character - it relates to the permission of the  President  of the Court - that in my opinion it does not justify any intelligent senator in voting for a recommittal. I do not think that it matters one straw whether we retain or omit the provision requiring the permission of the  President  to be obtained, so long as the wishesof the parties in a case are clearly expressed and carried out. </para>

              <para>- I know that the honorable senator believes that the Bill ought to be recommitted for a great many purposes. A recommittal is also desired for the purpose of altering paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 9 with respect to the giving of evidence. When evidence is given it ought to be &#34; the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.&#34; Whether it incriminates the witness or not, the truth ought to be told. </para>

              <para>- Under this legislation both employers and employes receive protection. We ought not to have been subjected to this long debate simply because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was not present on a previous occasion. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> must admit that the amendments which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> seeks to make are of such an insignificant character that even he should not vote for a recommittal of the Bill. I firmly believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is earnestly desirous that something should be done to establish fair conditions, and to insure a peaceful conduct of industrial pursuits. But whenever he has entered into a discussion on industrial affairs, he has laboured under the same error. He is guided by the statements in certain sections of the press, and by certain interested individuals, that the minimum wage always becomes the maximum wage. </para>

              <para>- I have never worked unless I have received fair wages. This Bill was brought in to amend the principal Act for the purpose of making it easier for the Government, the workers, and every one else concerned to carry out the intentions of this Parliament. We may fail to achieve our purpose by this Bill, and we may have to amend the law again, and to continue to do so for many years to come. I hope that we shall always be found willing to remedy any defects which may be discovered. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will refer to the Act he will find that there are laid down therein principles by which the policy of new protection is to be carried into effect. One method is by the decision of an Arbitration Court ; another method is by the decision of a Wages Board, and still another method is by an industrial agreement. In every part of the Commonwealths-whether labour or capital is organized or not - workers and employers have the privilege of meeting together and entering into an industrial agreement. If it is satisfactory to both parties, there can be no difficulty in reference to the collection or the failure to collect the Excise duty. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I deplore the neglect or the inability of the Government to carry into effect this legislation from the very first. There may be some neglect or inability in that regard, but so far as I can see, it is of no use to &#34; cry over spilt milk.&#34; If we have failed in the past to frame a satisfactory law, we must do the best we can for the future. I desire to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> because I believe he is amenable to reason, that forty years ago I worked in callings where industrial agreements existed. In some of the yards on the Clyde, a conference would be held between the workers in the different branches of the ship-building trade and the employers, and an agreement would be arrived at as to hours to be worked, conditions to be observed, wages to be paid, or prices to be given for piece work. These agreements would be kept by both parties, and wouldexist for six months if trade was fluctuating, or for twelve months or two years if trade was steady. If it was possible then to arrive at industrial agreements, surely with our advanced intelligence we ought to be able to adopt that plan, even where trade organizations may not exist. Icontend that in the Act and this Bill there is machinery to carry out the principles which Parliament is trying to lay down. I feel confident that honorable senators will not delay the passage of a measure so important to the industrial classes, merely to insert the trifling amendments which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> wishes to introduce. Let us send the Bill to another place, and if anything should transpire to show the necessity for making any amendments, they can be made there. Certainly up to the present time, no event has happened to justify a recommital of the Bill. </para>

The Labour Party is to a great extent responsible for the policy of the new protection. If that policy fails, or is only  a partial success, the blame, rightly or wrongly, will be laid at the door of that party.

              <para>- That would probably be going too far. I . should not give them any sympathy in that direction at any rate. The Government ought to have taken steps to enforce the law at a much earlier date. For the success of this policy, three elements are essential. The first is that the protection should be sufficient to embrace the manufacturer and the operative ; the second that the Government, so far as lies in their power, should administer the Act with due vigilance; and the third that the  employes  themselves should form a strong and effective union. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> read this afternoon a document ostensibly prepared by a -certain union connected with the Sunshine Harvester works. That union blames the Labour Party for the present state of affairs. I have no doubt that a g-neat number of people throughout the Commonwealth will be very glad of the opportunity given to them, by the reading of that document, to point out how feeble and ineffective is the action of the Labour Party in getting its own policy carried into effect. I believe that the document read* by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> emanates from a number of the employe&#39;s at the Sunshine Harvester works. </para>

              <para>- There is really no union in connexion with those works.Only a very small percentage of the 500 operatives employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> belong to any union. No matter what law is passed by Parliament, no matter how vigilant the &#39;administration of the Government may be, .unless the men bland themselves together, organize, and police the administration of the law, - that law will  fail.  Although we appoint policemen to prevent breaches &#39;of &#39;the law- every citizen is himself . responsible for its maintenance. If not <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> a policeman, every man  is  perhaps a .policeman <inline font-style="italic">de jure,</inline> and the police can at any moment call- upon him for assistance in maintaining order and prevent^ . ing breaches of the law%.. There are a great number of people in the Commonwealth apparently for whom it is not sufficient that you find food for them, and &#39; place it upon the table. They expect you to bring it up to their bedrooms . for therm to enjoy without the trouble of getting out &#39;of bed, dressing themselves, and coming down to-  breakfast. That seems to be the position&#34; of the men in <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Mr. McKay&#39;s</inline> employment. They expect Parliament to do everything; for them, and are not prepared to do anything for themselves. The sooner they realize that it is impossible for them tobenefit by such a course of conduct thebetter it will be for them. . If they are not prepared to assist the Legislature in carrying out the policy of the new protection, it is foredoomed to failure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> made an attack upon the minimum wage, to which his chief objection&#39; is that it becomes the maximum. That is the principal objection hurled at it from . capitalistic quarters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> himself is a member of a union which has the reputation of being one of the strongest and most solid in the world. It permits, no black-legging. It has a minimum fee of six and eightpence, but we know that there are members of it who are paid far more. Their minimum does not become the maximum. Whereas one member of the profession may go into a court for half a guinea or a guinea, you must pay fifty guineas to another member of it if you wish him to appear for you. Any man who employs those lawyers pays them according to the value which he sets upon their services. </para>

              <para>- It may happen occasionally1, and I believe it does. If it is the case, it only proves that the employer who pays a week each to two men, one of whom is worth 50 per cent, more than the other, is robbing that man of 30s. a week. It is a very strong condemnation of the action of certain employers. </para>

If the law is to be a success, and if the Government are sincere, they must see to its proper administration, and must see also that the men are not put to any undue expense.

I think that most honorable senators have expressed the opinion that the jurisdiction of the States with respect to health quarantine, using the term in its subordinate sense, should remain unaffected by what I have referred to myself as the strictly proper quarantine powers hitherto enjoyed and exercised by the States Governments being transferred to the Commonwealth. It has been proposed to leave out the words &#34; State or,&#34; because they are redundant, being covered by the expression &#34; part of the Commonwealth.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> is in some doubt whether, if the amendment be agreed to, he can submit an amendment which will raise the large question which has been so much debated, and which he desires to raise in connexion with paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g.</inline> Subject to the opinion of the  Chairman,  I think that if the words &#34; State or &#34; are left out, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> will be able to move his amendment. He can move that the words &#34;part of the Commonwealth&#34; should be left out, and if that were carried it would have the effect he desired of indicating the view of the Committee to restrict the powers sought to be conferred on the Commonwealth Government by this </para>

My honorable friend wants this power of quarantine - using that term not in the strict sense in which I think it ought to be used - to be extended, so as to enable the Commonwealth authorities to prohibit removal from one State to another, but not to give power to prohibit removal from, say, Melbourne to Ballarat. But, then, he wants to retain the words &#34; State or&#34; because he desires the power conferred by those words to be given <inline font-style="italic">(o</inline> the Commonwealth. </para>

But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane&#39;s</inline> amendment raises a point of principle.

If, then, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane&#39;s</inline> amendment were carried, there would be no difficulty.

          <para>. - It seems to me that it is quite easy to decide the issue involved on the amendment submitted by the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> is anxious that power should te retained to prohibit the removal of diseased animals or plants from one State to another, but he wishes to strike out the power to prohibit removal from any part of a State to another part of the same State. If we strike out the words &#34; State or,&#34; we clearly leave the power to prohibit removal from one part of a State to another. It therefore seems to me to be clear that a vote on a proposition to strike out the words &#34;State or&#34; settles the question contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane&#39;s</inline> amendment. What I desire, and what I think the Committee desire, is that the Commonwealth should have power to prohibit removal from infected sections of the Commonwealth to clean sections without regard to where they are. That is the point at issue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> merely wishes to prohibit removal from one part of a State to another part of the same State. If we strike out the words &#34; State or,&#34; we. declare that we do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane,</inline> but desire that the Commonwealth should have the -wider power. Therefore there is no necessity to alter the amendment proposed by the Government in order to settle the issue. </para>

            <para>. - It will be remembered that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> acting on information supplied to him, left the impression by his speech that there had been some exercise of bad faith on the part of the Government in connexion with the linotype operators. He even went so far as to say that the men were engaged in writing, and promised permanent employment, and that, notwithstanding that fact, a number of them had been dismissed. I am not complaining about the statement, but from an investigation of the facts of the case I am prepared to say that it is quite erroneous. The terms of the advertisement, of course, is a matter of some importance. It was not before the Chamber when he was delivering his speech. It was inserted in the newspapers in February, 1904, and reads as follows - </para>

            <para>Wanted, thoroughly competent lino, operators who can&#39; average hourly at least 6,000 L. Pr., 15 ems, corrected matter. Constant employment offered. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I understand that  6,000  long primer 15 ems would be equal to 150 lines of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The operators were required to possess that qualification to obtain employment in the terms of the advertisement. The statement in the advertisement - &#34;constant employment offered &#34; - could not be reasonably construed by anybody to mean that the Government were to enter into a covenant, that the operators would be permanently and constantly employed whether there was work for them to do or not. It was simply an indication as to  ..hAt  the prospects were. I do not wish to lay too much stress on that matter, because it is not necessary for. an impartial representation of the case&#39;. So far as my information goes, every competent man - that is to say, every man who complied with the stipulated qualification- has been continuously employed. It so Happens that out of those who have been employed from, time to time, there are only about four at present engaged who have shown that they possess the qualification. </para>

              <para>- A large number of other men have been employed from time to time, but as regards .those who came in under the advertisement, only four have been continuously employed, and, mark,. neither of those four men, nor any others of those employed in the printing office, have been exclusively engaged on Commonwealth work. They have been engaged on Commonwealth work for a considerable portion of their time, but, by reason of an excellent working engagement between the Commonwealth and the State, when they are not employed on Commonwealth work they are engaged on State work. The time is taken, and the Commonwealth or the State, as the case may be,. is charged the wages earned during that period of employment. The men, when they were engaged, were informed of the standard to which they would have to work, and all the men who attained that standard have been constantly employed, as promised. When Parliament is in session a very considerable number of men are employed,  but  when it is prorogued about two-thirds of that number have to go. In other words, no more than one-third of the usual number employed during the session are required for the recess work. It must not be thought by honorable senators that any of these operators .are constantly and exclusively employed on Commonwealth work; they are all employed on Commonwealth and State work. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>An advertisement appeared in the daily newspapers in the various States calling for thoroughly competent linotype operators, and offering them constant employment at a weekly wage of ^4 lbs. The promise of constant employment has not been kept, despite the fact that some of the men had an understanding in writing that they would have an assurance of constant work. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>First, there was no understanding in writing, and secondly, there was no statement about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4.</inline> 10s. per week in the advertisement. As regards the term &#34;constant work,&#34; they were promised constant employment if they could comply with the condition of the advertisement, which, as I mentioned, required them to be capable of setting about 150 lines of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> per hour. The assurance given to me is that the promise to give constant work was kept to all the men who fulfilled the condition laid down. It was alleged by,Senator. Needham, by way of complaint, that one man was put on the classified list, and that he was a linotype engineer. That statement is quite true. The linotype engineer was put on the list for the simple reason that he was constantly and (permanently engaged in the discharge of his duties. But the whole of the linotype operators are not&#39; consistently and constantly engaged on the machines. In another part of his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As the machines belong to the Commonwealth the men had a reasonable ground for believing that eventually they would be placed on the classified list. </para>

          <para class="block">So far as I can ascertain, nothing was said by the Government Printer or any authorized officer which would justify such an assumption, or indicate any promise of permanent work. Then the honorable senator said - </para>

          </quote>
          <para>We- paid not .&#163;30,000 but &#163;14,026 for the machines. They never stand idle when there is suitable work for them to do. When not employed on <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and other ordinary parliamentary work they are frequently employed on State work. The honorable senator also said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>An additional fact is that these men are not paid overtime for night work. </para>

          <para>According to the information I have the men are paid overtime. Operators doing night work receive overtime at night time for 42 hours per week. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> also mentioned that the wages (paid by leading printers in Melbourne range from &#163;3 10s. to &#163;5 5s. per week. My informa-  tion is that all linotype work in outside offices is piece-work. </para>

What is more natural than that the Government Printer, having full confidence in the men who would otherwise have to be dismissed as soon as the linotype machines came into operation, should seek to retain their services by allowing them an opportunity to learn how to operate those machines?I believe that within reasonable limits that is the practice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> asked - </para>

          <para class="block">The information given to me is that the State has recently bought one linotype machine, and is purchasing four more. The State owns all the lithographic plant, all the stereotyping plant, and nearly all the plant in the process branch. That plant is all very expensive. The State had sufficient plant to do its own work when the Commonwealth&#34; was established, and it must be remembered that the three large Departments, Customs, Post and Telegraph, and Defence, have been taken away from the State, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> asked that inquiries should be made by the Government as to how many men in addition to the linotype operators and officers referred to in the motion were permanently engaged on Commonwealth work. The answer to that, as I have already indicated is, &#34;none.&#34; I have dealt with the main features of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> remarks, but there are one or two other points which I wish to emphasize. The motion states that, &#34; In the opinion of this Senate the officers and all competent operators employed on the Commonwealth linotype machines who have served a period of twelve months and over on those machines, should be placed on the classified list.&#34; Who is to judge as to who are competent, and who are incompetent? According to the standard laid down, the only &#34; competent operators &#34; are the four to whom I have referred, but,  in any case, it would have to be left to an expert like the Acting Government Printer &#39;to say which men were competent. I had a somewhat vigorous fight during the consideration of the Estimates with regard to the common-sense arrangement which has been made between the Commonwealth and&#39; State as to Commonwealth printing. I pointed out then that, so far as our experience has gone, the position is eminently satisfactory. I have here a statement from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kemp,</inline> which I think is of a very significant character. He says - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>During the twelve months the State used the Commonwealth printing machines for 3,543 hours, and the Commonwealth used the State printing machines for15,500 hours. As a set-off against the State occasionally using Commonwealth linotype machines, I may mention that three-fourths of the Tariff Commission&#39;s reports, recently issued, were set up in State type. None of the employ&#233;s in the office are permanently employed on Commonwealth work except clerks in the Accounts Branch and the Linotype Engineer. </para>

          <para class="block">In the circumstances, I submit that it would be unwise for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> to persist with his motion. He will gather that the facts which formed the basis of his claim for consideration for these men are not strictly as he understood them to be. I have referred to the terms of the advertisement, and have given the assurancesI have received from head-quarters, that every person engaged under it, and relying upon it as a contract, has had the privilege of being continued in employment. In all the circumstances, and having special regard to the fact that these men are not exclusively engaged on Commonwealth work, but on State as well as Commonwealth work, it is not, I think, unreasonable to suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> the advisableness of withdrawing his motion. </para>

            <para>. - As it is evident that no other member of the Senate desires to join in the debate, it is incumbent on me, in justice to myself, to reply to the statements made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I will admit that it was difficult for me, in submitting the motion, to separate the case for these men from the question of the necessity of establishing a Commonwealth printing office. But any one who reads the speech I made when moving the motion will, I think, agree that I succeeded in doing so. My intention was to prove to the Senate that certain individuals in the employ of the Commonwealth Government were engaged upon conditions that had not been complied with. I also stated that there was a written agreement that constant employment would be given them. When cross-examined during the course of the debate as to whether I could produce any proof to substantiate my statement, I said that at the moment I could not lay my hands on the proofs, but I thought they were obtainable. I have here some information which I think will bear out to the letter the statement I made in moving the motion. Here is a telegram from the late Government Printer of Victoria to one of the men originally employed under the conditions I have specified - </para>

              <para>- I am leading up to that point. Let me remark that in introducingthe motion I said that advertisements appeared in the newspapers of the Commonwealth on two different occasions setting forth the terms referred to in that telegram; and I also said that the wages were to be &#163;4 10s. per week. I made a mistake as to the wages, which were to be &#163;4, but the other conditions prove up to the hilt the statement I made. I have here a letter from an employe who is at present engaged as an operator on one of the Commonwealth linotype machines in the Victorian Government Printing Office.

He said that he had a promise of constant employment, and it meant, ifit meant anything, that if he was asked by the Government to take a fortnight&#39;s holiday some remuneration should be given to him, otherwise it was tantamount to a dismissal. Some little trouble arose in connexion with the matter; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barker&#39;s</inline> assertion that he was constantly employed was questioned by the officer in charge, and as the result of inquiry he did not get the fortnight&#39;s holiday, and he is working in the office to-day. Now, as to the test, and whether these men are carrying out the specified amount ; of work, to use the expression employed bythe VicePresident of theExecutive Council, from information I have received I say emphatically that these men. are doing the specified amount of work, and if they are not, why are their services retained? I am now about to refer to a phase of the question which does not appear to have occurred to the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Honorable senators are aware of the practice that exists in connexion with the very undesirable system of confidential reports. That is to say, an employ&#233; may be thought by his superior officer not to be doing the full amount of work that he ought to do, or not to be conducting himself as he should. A report is sent to head-quarters without the knowledge of the employ&#233;, and without his having any chance of defending himself until judgment has been delivered. The men at present employed on the linotype machines ofthe Commonwealth are turning out the number of ens per hour required by this written agreement, the existence of which has been questioned. </para>

            <para>-As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> - who is a practical man - interjects, they would not be employed continually unless they did the necessary amount of work. But they get no opportunity of contradicting or disputing the statements of the computer, who is also engaged by the Commonwealth Government. If the Acting Government Printer says to a man, as a result of information received from the computer, that he is not turning out the requisite number of ens per hour, he has no adequate opportunity of defending himself. That is a phase of the question upon which the. . VicePresident of the Executive Councildid not touch. The firstincrease of wages granted to these men was during the <inline font-style="italic">r&#233;gime,</inline> of the Labour Government, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> at its head. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> as Commonwealth Treasurer increased their salaries for night work from  &#163;3  10s. to  &#163;4  per week. The members of the chapel sent him a memorial, and that was the result. But no increase was granted for day work until twelve months ago. I have already referred to the fact that one of the employ&#233;s who would have been discharged, on his refusal to take a fortnight&#39;s holiday, was retained, owing to the fact that he had preserved the conditions under which he was engaged. I allude to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barker.</inline> I also know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barker</inline> holds a reference from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. J.</inline> W. Hackett, the proprietor and editor of the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Western Mail,</inline> Perth, for his twelve years&#39; services there. </para>

              <para>- He is one of the employes of the Government Printing Office engaged on the Commonwealth linotype work. Another man, who was discharged because it was alleged that he was incompetent, is now working at San Francisco, on piece-work, at -&#163;&#38; ios. per week. I also desire to emphasize the fact that when the Commonwealth Government desired to obtain the services of suitable competent men to work these machines, they approached the Typographical Society in Melbourne. At that time - -whether owing to the briskness of trade or for some other reason - sufficient men were not obtainable. Consequently, advertisements were published&#39; in the leading newspapers of the States. Men left their homes and gave up good positions to take employment under the Commonwealth. But now my honorable friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, turns round and tells the Senate that only four of the men at present engaged in the service of the Commonwealth were amongst those originally employed. The inference which he draws from that fact is that the remainder of the men - about twelve - were not fit to meet the demands made upon them, or were dismissed. But, apparently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has not considered the fact that when many of the men, whose names I mentioned a few weeks ago, realized that there was no possibility of securing continuous employment in the Government Printing Office, and that they could be dismissed at a moment&#39;s notice, they took the first opportunity to better themselves, either with the view of securing more continuous employment, or of earning larger wages than they were receiving under the Government. There are people who would rather have security of tenure in a Government position, though earning a smaller weekly wage, than be casual employes in a private firm receiving a higher weekly wage. I commend that aspect of the case to the Senate. Simply because only four of the original employes are left, it ought not to be inferred that the other men were not competent. Another point which I desire&#39; to emphasize is that on the  14th  June, of this year, the employes working the linotype machines presented a memorial to the then Commonwealth Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest. He received it. I have a copy of it here. They put their case before the Treasurer, as I have endeavoured to put it before the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest forwarded that memorial on to the Acting Government Printer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kemp,</inline> who afterwards stated that he had not the time to report upon it as requested. From that day. to this, no report has been supplied as requested. Surely it was possible for the Acting Government Printer to say. yes, or no, to the statements contained in that memorial? Surely it would not take from June to October to furnish a reply to the petition of employes who said that they were labouring under grievances which they desired to have redressed. That is another phase of the question to which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has not referred. Again, I contend that the wages paid to the men are not adequate for the class of work required, or the conditions under which they labour. They work principally during the night. They are not paid overtime rates. They work out a certain number of hours per week. Any, one who has had the slightest experience of night work is aware that it imposes a greater strain on the physical and mental resources than does day work. We must also consider the nature of the employment. Men employed on these linotype machines amongst lead, and oil, and gas, are engaged in occupations which are necessarily prejudicial to their health. It must also be recognised that during the session upon which we are engaged, Parliament may demand that these men shall work on from -half -past 6 in the evening until perhaps 8 or 9 o&#39;clock the next morning. We should give some consideration to their case from that point of view. I do not desire to refer to the question of whether these men are doing State as well as Commonwealth work. That raises an issue which I desire to avoid, namely, as to whether we should constitute a Commonwealth Printing Office or should continue the conditions as at present existing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> when I originally submitted my motion, asked the question what became of the State men when they became competent operators. M.v reply was, and is, that they are sometimes drafted to other spheres of Government work - for instance, to the Post Office. The honorable senator also said that it was impossible for an operator to learn the mechanism of the machine in twelve months. There is no necessity for an operator to have a direct knowledge of the mechanism, because a staff, under the supervision of a competent engineer, is engaged to deal with the mechanism. The operators are practically forbidden to touch the mechanism. Their duty is simply to set up the reports of the parliamentary speeches. If it was right for the Government to place on the classified list the man who is in charge of the machines, is it not also right that the men who work them should be similarly treated ? What would be the use of the engineer if he had no operators to work the machines ? I am not asking for any great concession. We know that recently men in the Post Office and several other Departments have been placed on the classified list. I am simply asking the Government to treat their employes in the Printing Office in the same way as they have treated those persons. It may be said that I am attempting to place the employ&#233;s of the Commonwealth on a better footing than those of the State. The employ&#233;s of the State - that is in thePrinting Office - have an assurance of constant employment. </para>

              <para>- Not one of the Commonwealth employ&#233;s in that office has any guarantee. Even if such were not the case, I am not attempting to place one set of servants in a better position than another set. If we admit that the men are employed by the Commonwealth, it is our duty to see that they receive at least a fair modicum of justice. Let the State Government deal with its own employes. Only the other day three of the best operators left the Printing Office to take up positions in private offices simply because they felt no sense of security, had no assurance of continuous employment or guarantee as to how they would be dealt with in the future. </para>

              <para>- It would mean that when absent through illness they would receive pay in return for the number of hours they worked longer than they should without receiving overtime pay. It would also mean that if it should be decided to dispense with their services at any time they would have the right to appeal against that decision. Under existing conditions the Acting Government Printer, on the advice of the computer, can say that the men are not fulfilling the condition on which they were engaged, and not one of them has the right to challenge the decision or to prove whether he is doing the work as guaranteed. That is not a position in which the men should be placed. </para>

              <para>- If the Government desired to bring the work of the Patent Office up to date every one of its linotype operators could be constantly employed on Commonwealth work during the parliamentary recess. Since  1901  the work of the Commonwealth has been growing, and we have no reason to believe that its printing work will diminish in the years to come. On the contrary, we have every ground to expect that as the Commonwealth grows older the work of its Government will increase. There is not the slightest doubt that if the Government like to face the question fairly and squarely every one of their linotype operators can have constant work on every working day in the year. If the Government decline to meet me and say that the men are not constantly employed during recess, that is not an honest reply to my contention, because if they like they can find work for all the men to do. I ask honorable senators to weigh well the speeches which have been made. I remind them that my motion has had the support of Senators Findley and Chataway, who are practical men. </para>

            <para>. - Honorable senators need not be alarmed that I shall detain them at any great length, but it is the duty of every honorable senator to have an opinion, and to express it, on such an important question as is raised by the motion. Although various criticisms have been levelled at the proposal, I think that the majority of the Senate will approve of it. In Australia, land services of this description are really in the hands of the people. We do all our own railway land carriage, and, the people of this country have realized that that is greatly to their advantage. In other parts of the world private enterprise has not done for the people all that the people expected, but on the contrary has given them, in many cases, inefficient services at high cost. Every business man in , the world to-day is looking to the methods adopted in Australia and New Zealand in the matter of land carriage, and various. European countries have even gonetothe extent of following our example. </para>

              <para>- I have no doubt that we could make Brisbane the terminus both ways. In that case, it would be a continuous service around Australia, calling at Brisbane first, and leaving there last, but I do not know whether that system would be adopted if notice were taken of the general cry of honorable senators opposite. They are always talking about doing our business on commercial principles. I should like to see a service of this description carried out by the Commonwealth on the principles about which we hear so much - principles that would give the greatest convenience to the public of Australia at the least possible expense to Australia. I have heard very few objections to the railway services of Australia being in the hands of thepeople, and I believe that the people would receive the same benefit if the mail service suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> were inaugurated. Where is the impossibility? Where are the greater difficulties in carrying mails, passengers, and cargo by sea than by land ? Which gives the greatest chance of success ? Undoubtedly carriage by sea, because in a system of sea carriage it is not necessary to acquire land, and there is no expense of maintenance, as the sea generally maintains itself. There are a hundred-and-one other advantages in carriage by sea which do not exist in the. case of carriage by land. Some honorable senator may point to the risks of sea carriage. There are no greater risks with an efficient mail service, well manned by Australian sailors and Australian officers, than there are in railway carriage. </para>

              <para>- I shall deal with that question later. I wish first to make a comparison between the conditions involved in sea and land carriage. It would not be necessary to maintain an army of permanent-way men on vessels carrying goods, passengers and mails, and we should not have to pay a large amount of interest every year on money borrowed for the repurchase of the land on which to build lines. All those difficulties would be got rid of. We should have simply to invest our money in vessels that would be of service to the Commonwealth, and, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s amendment were carried, those vessels would be built with a view to conversion into cruisers for the protection of Australia if the necessity arose. They could also be used in conjunction with the railway system for the transport of troops from one part of the Commonwealth to the other. That would be a great advantage to Australia in times of difficulty. While establishing an efficient fortnightly mail service with Great Britain and other parts of. the world, we could also carry on our own mail service around the coast and between the mainland and the islands. Many of the vessels that would be required for that purpose could also be so fitted up as to make them of great service to Australia in the event of war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> wishes to know what would happen in the case of competition. But who would oppose a Government line of steamers trading between Australia and Great Britain? I suppose the answer would be, &#34; The companies already in existence.&#34; If the day has arrived when even the greatest combination of millionaires in the world can be said to be more powerful than the nation itself, it is a very bad day for the people, not only of Australia, but of the rest of the world. No combination of that description could successfully compete with a State-owned line of steamers, and I will show why. Consider the matter first from a passenger point of view. If the State-owned steamers are properly constructed and arranged for the carriage of passengers, they will be as good as those of any other line, or ought to be if they are to be successful. Existing lines of steamers charge at present anything from &#163;40 to&#163;140 or&#163;150 for a return ticket to Great Britain. If the Government line of steamers charged that amount and no more, and its vessels were as good and as safe as those of any other existing company, it would be just as likely to get passengertraffic as any other company would be. If the conditions were exactly the same, if everything was as good and not a bit better in the State-owned steamers, that wouldnecessarily be so. Suppose that opposition did spring up, and a combination of private companies said, &#34; We will knock this State business out altogetherby carrying passengers for nothing or for half the rate charged by the State line.&#34; It would not matter whether the State line reduced its passage money or not. They could continue to charge the &#39; same fares, and privately.-owned steamers might carry passengers for nothing, or for half the fares charged by the State-owned boats. But who would be the gainers? Would it not be the people of Australia? Why, we would all be taking trips to the Old Country when we could get a return passage on one of these privately-owned boats for nothing, or for half the fares charged by the State-owned boats. </para>

              <para>- All the farmers and their wives would, if they could afford the time, make the trip to England. The State-owned . vessels would get no passengers, or only the patriotic few who would be prepared to pay from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;40</inline> to ^140 for a return passage. But the great mass of the population of the Commonwealth, getting passages by the privately-owned steamers for nothing, or at very low rates, would reap all the benefit, and they might then very well be asked to put their hands into their pockets to maintain such a State-owned service as might be necessary to continue the competition which brought that state of affairs about. But if the shipping companies, in oppositionto the State-owned steamers, acted fairly, and tried no tricks, they would still get their share of the trade to be done between Great Britain, the Continent, and other parts of the world with Australia, and would have nothing to complain about. The very &#39;same may be said about freights. I suppose that, to carry on a fortnightly service, we should require eight or ten steamers, and if the private shipping companies acted fairly, the State-owned boats would get only their share of the business to be done. The freights would be the same, there would be no undercutting, and business would go on as usual, because, as every one must admit from the experience of the past, the increase in trade with Australia, in a very short time, would, certainly warrant the construction of eight or ten new steamers. If the State-owned steamers charged the same freights as were charged on privately-owned boats, they would get their fair proportion of the&#39; cargoes carried to and from Australia, and no more, and what, then, would private shipping companies have to complain about? But if the private companies determined to run the State-owned&#34; line of steamers off the sea, how would they set about it? They would begin to carry the produce of the farmer, the miner, and the pastoralist from Australia to Great Britain for nothing, or for half the rates of freight charged by the State-owned steamers. What would be the. result of competition of that kind? The first result would be that the farmers, miners, and pastoralists of Australia would be the gainers? The people of Australia would benefit also. The shipping companies or combinations would very soon arrive at the conclusion that the best thing they could do would be to; act fairly and say nothing, to be content with a fair proportion of the trade, and allow the Commonwealth steamers to do their fair proportion of it. The people of Australia need not fear such competition in the reduction of passenger and goods rates, because they would themselves reap the benefit, and the greater the opposition to the State-owned line of steamers, the greater the benefit which the people owning those steamers would receive. The Australian people, getting the advantage of verylow fares and freights, could afford to put their hands into their pockets to maintain the State line of steamers that brought that condition of affairs about. </para>

              <para>- Certainly I do. We should have only eight or ten vessels competing against at least five or six times their number of privately-owned vessels. Our vessels would do about one-fifth of the trade, and we should, in the circumstances I have described, be getting four-fifths of it done at half rates. The honorable senator &#34; must see- that the greater that opposition was the greater would be the benefit reaped by the people of Australia, and the more they would save to enable them to subsidize their own vessels, if that were found to be necessary. I have pointed out also that if- the Stateowned steamers were allowed to obtain a fair proportion of the trade they would pay the Commonwealth, and the people of Australia would! reap the benefit in increased facilities of communication. With respect, then, to the fear of opposition, there is no occasion for alarm. We could beat any opposition, because we should be serving our &#39;own people all the time. I think it is opportune now to ask the question : What is really wanted? Negotiations are in progress for a mail service with Great Britain. Every time the Commonwealth Government has to enter into these negotiations they will find it more difficult to carry them out unless some steps are taken in the direction indicated by this motion. On every occasion the subsidy asked for is increased, the bands are drawn tighter, and the hands closed more firmly against the interests of the people of Australia. We have to pay more, and if we are- looking for &#39;a better service we must pav more still. I do not </para>

          <para class="block">see any reason why, in this respect, we should be always at the mercy of somebody else when we have the matter in our own hands. We have had to pay subsidies of &#163;80,000, &#163;120,000, and &#163;125,000; it is probable that we shall now have to pay a subsidy of &#163;170,000 or &#163;180,000. Every time we renew the agreement we must pay more. But is that the way in which our business ought to be done? Are Australians to be squeezed for ever? Are they never, like the worm, to turn? Are we never to say, &#34; We will do something for ourselves &#34; ? Can we not find examples in other parts of the world? Are honorable senators not aware that the very same thing was tried in the United States of America in the early days? They had to negotiate with shipping companies for the carriage of mails and goods, and they did so until the price became so high that they considered it ruinous. Then they determined to do something on their own account. They did not &#39; start a State-owned line of steamers, as &#39; we propose in this motion. They adopted a far less effective method. They adopted the poundage system for the carriage of their mails, and for years they paid no subsidy to any line of mail steamers. Honorable senators must agree that if a country like the United States of America, which is at least as important as Australia, could get along for years without paying exorbitant mail subsidies, we could do the same thing. But we have a better proposal in this motion. We have here a proposal to do our own carrying of mails, passengers, perishable products, and products of every description. It is our duty to do it, and I hope the people of Australia will realize the position they are in. The question of the amount that would be necessary to carry out a service of this description has been inquired into, and it has been clearly proved that for between &#163;2,000,000 and &#163;3,000,000 we could supply ourselves with a service equal to any we have had in the past, or to any we are likely to have in the near future. Why. then, should we not do it? Are we afraid that we shall be unable to pay the interest on the money, if we borrow it? I am sure that it will be admitted that if the&#34; Commonwealth went into the money market to borrow for the construction of vessels as suggested in this motion, we should get all the capital we required as cheaply as could any private promoters in the world. What, then, is.  there to be alarmed about? Our wealth is increasing so rapidly that if we do not find avenues for investment for ourselves much of it will leave the country for investment in other parts of the world. It may be said that that would not be a bad thing, because we should get a return in the way of interest. But it would be better still if the money were invested in our midst. Even the money required for the construction of these vessels or the purchase of them could, I am satisfied, be raised in Australia. </para>

              <para>- I am much obliged to the honorable senator for the short breathing time that he has afforded me. The investment of Australian capital in a service of this kind would be greatly to the benefit of the Commonwealth at large. I should like to conclude with a word or two as to the necessity for a new line of steamers, such as is contemplated by the mover of the motion. Large numbers of our producers would begreatly benefited by the competition of eight or ten newvessels. Consider the case of our dairy farmers. We have not to look back far in the history of this country to ascertain the manner in which those unfortunate producers were treated by private enterprise. In Victoria alone they were penalized, on account of the excessive butter freights charged, to the extent of &#163;27,000 a year. That is to say, they were robbed to that extent - it is a strong term, but I cannot think of a better one to express what I mean. </para>

              <para>- I am very much obliged to the honorable senator for the suggestion. They were overcharged to the extent of&#163;27,000 a year in freight on butter alone, and then had to be very humble and submissive or they would not have been served at all. Those engaged in the dairy industry had to work long hours, and had to suffer great privations to enable them to rise above the verge of poverty. Why ? Simply because they were continuall y bled in the manner I have indicated. Other producers have been made to suffer in the same way. The growing of fruit of every description is extending all over Australia. Are not the representatives of the States bound to look after the interests of their people, who are dependent upon cheap and rapid facilities for getting their produce to market? There is another section of our producers that must be regarded as one of the most important in the community, as I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> will admit. I refer to the wheat growers. Consider the way in which they have been treated, and then let us ask ourselves whether it is not our duty to do everything in our power to enable their produce to be carried cheaply and rapidly to the markets of the world. Our small stock graziers are also deeply interested, as well as those concerned in the mining industry. As long as private enterprise is allowed uncontrolled sway in connexion with the carriage of produce from Australia to the Old World our producers will always suffer. We, the members of the Socialist Party, want to do something for the benefit of the people of this country in relieving them from the tyranny which they have had to endure from private enterprise. It can be seen at once that the introduction of ten fresh vessels would have such an effect upon freights and fares in Australia thatit would be most beneficial to our industries. With all these considerations in view, I am satisfied that the Senate should have no hesitation in voting for the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson.</inline></para>

            <para>. - I should not perhaps, have risen had I not noticed the hearty approval which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> gave this afternoon to the maxim that it is always wise to give effect to legislation which conduces to the &#34; greatest good of the greatest number.&#34; Those who are favorable to the establishment of a line of steamers between Australia and&#39; the Mother Country are satisfied that that would be one of the best means of realizing the maxim of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> approves. Of course, the motion will meet with strenuous opposition from many sections of the community, who inthe past have not only benefited from the extension of State activities, but have actually asked for their further extension, though they would resent the idea thatthey were favorable to socialistic enterprise. While they have been anxious to have the sphere of the State extended for their own benefit, they have been blind to the necessity of the extension of the sphere of the State for the benefit of the community at large. Australia is a vast continent, with a small population, and we must ever bear in mind the fact that we depend largely upon a close, swift, and cheap means of communication with Europe. This, therefore, is one of the principal questions to which we should direct attention. Australia is further removed from Europe than any other land <inline font-style="italic">-on</inline> this globe. We are entirely dependent for communication with the Motherland on lines of ocean craft which in the past have not done justice to Australia. It may be said : &#34; Is it not foolish to extend the functions of the State to the open ocean, where so much competition exists ?&#34; Ko doubt that is an argument which will be relied upon by the opponents of this motion. It is quite true that on the broad ocean every one who has capital to invest is entitled to compete. It will be contended that that excessive competition would tend to bring about the failure of State enterprise earlier than would otherwise be the case. But I feel that we should consider not so much the direct beneficial results of this proposal as the great benefits which it would be the means of conferring upon the people of Australia. I hold that it will be a mistake if it is viewed from a purely balance-sheet stand-point. The only logical stand-point to take is to &#34; size up &#34; for ourselves the amount of good which it would confer in the form of cheaper freights and fares. .It is quite true that from a monetary stand-point the service might not be a success. But the reasons which have justified .most enterprises in the several States apply with equal force to this proposal to establish :a line of Commonwealth steamers. .1 have stated that those who are maintaining the &#39;Communication &#39;with the Old Country are not doing justice to the. people of Australia. The best means of proving that statement is by citing those who have :been in the past, and are to-day,  inveterately  opposed to any system of State expansion. For instance, we have in this city, as well as elsewhere, men who, on noticing how steam-ship and sailing-ship lines &#39;have treated Australia, have placed on record their unqualified disapproval, and suggested a very effective means of coping with&#39; the evil. But before I refer to those authorities, &#34;let me ask  any  honorable senator who is opposed to this proposal to point to a single instance where a State, after it has embarked upon -a system of State Socialism, has retraced its steps. I venture to say that not one opponent of this proposal can point to such an instance -either here or elsewhere. On the contrary, in regard to both State and  muni- cipality,  the tendency has been to gradually widen the sphere of influence, and to direct the collected energy and enterprise in many new directions. Who would be so vain or so foolish as to suggest a departure from the policy of State ownership of railways? The same remark applies to our telegraphic system. It also applies to our waterworks  system,  because in the past private enterprise was the sole means of supplying <inline font-style="italic">thi</inline> people in large centres with water. Where, at present, is there any inclination to revert to the old method of private enterprise to carry on and supervise such works? I venture to say that there is none. There is no such tendency exhibited in any country of which I have read or heard. I have mentioned that there is a type of citizen who, whenever he finds himself severely touched by the operations of a monopoly, instantly calls upon the State to step in and help him. In *the past we have had many such cases. For instance, when in Western Australia, the league of insurance companies oppressed the people on the gold-fields and elsewhere with heavy insurance rates, the argument of this class of men, as expressed by the Chambers of Commerce in Kalgoorlie was that the only way of coping with the situation -was for the State to establish .an insurance Department, and so relieve the people of a positive evil at the hands of a- private-enterprise ring. That is a small indication of how business men, w&#39;ho usually are not found in a socialistic camp, or associating themselves in any aggressive way with Socialism, have been driven into the position of asking the State to come to their aid whenever they feel the pressure of the operations of private enterprise. lt is impossible to -ascertain how the shipping companies trading to Australia are -progressing. For reasons which I suppose are best known to themselves, some companies do not publish a balancesheet, and therefore we are not in a position :to (gauge accurately whether or not thev are profitable concerns. We are constantly , told by the prominent mouthpiece :of one of the companies, at least, that  they  are carrying on their business at a loss. Yet, in the face of that repeated declaration, which is made at every meeting of the shareholders of one of the largest steam-ship companies trading here, we find that it is continually adding to its fleet, and aiming at securing an increased &#39;hold upon the trade of this country. Where they have obtained the capital up to the  present time I have not discovered, but the presumption is in favour of the suspicion that it has been taken out of the profits which have been earned out of a trade which over and over again it has declared to be unprofitable. The fact remains that while the shipping companies have declared the Australian trade to be unprofitable, they have continued to add ship after ship to their fleets, and to increase their hold upon that trade, notwithstanding their declaration that it is unprofitable. Either what they say is misleading to the public, or the trade is profitable even Beyond what thev would like the pub- . lie to believe. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has expressed some solicitude for the great industries within the Empire. He has said that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> suggestion were adopted it would destroy the greatest industry in the Empire. I have no tenderness for an industry which has shown no regard for the&#34; people of Australia. I certainly shall not extend any compassion or consideration to the shipping ring iri the Old Country, which has made the people of Australia practically beasts of burden. What has been happening? For a long time we have had a shipping ring connecting Australia with the Old Country, and it has been So well organized and managed that an outside competitor has not had the ghost of a show of entering into competition. What has been the result? For a. number of years a high range of freights and fares has been maintained, and the ring is now making a superhuman effort to see that the men it engages at low wages shall not form a union for the purpose of protecting themselves, although it constitutes the most perfect union of which we have heard in Australia. &#39; Brushing aside this foolish talk which is indulged in about the proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> being impracticable and socialistic, let us get clown to business, and ask ourselves what really is happening? During the last twenty years the people&#39; and producers of Australia have been taxed equal to 100 per cent, in fares and freights simply by reason of the existence of the shipping&#39; ring, and the impossibility of any shipping company entering into competition. That is a position of affairs which should be seriously considered. It should arrest the attention of every person who desires that that burden shall no longer be borne by the people of Australia. The question is : Are we likely to meet with more favorable consideration from the shipping com- panies in the future than we have received in the past? The probability, nay, the certainty, is that we shall be called upon to bear a much heavier burden than has been borne. Freights have been as low as &#163;3 ros., and as high as &#163;7 ios., a ton, but lately there has been a threat to raise the freight on perishable products to &#163;5. a ton. How to grapple with this greatest of problems which present themselves to the people of Australia to-day is a very serious question. As I have said, the shipping ring has been charging extortionate freights and fares during the last twenty years. Yet during that time the cost of working the steamers and sailing ships has fallen from 25- to 50 per cent. While on the one hand we have had an increase in freights and fares, .on the other hand we have had a decrease in the working expenses of steamers and sailing ships. If the freights of twenty years ago were payable, the present freights must be payable by more than one hundred-fold. As regards working expenses, what is the position ? According to -the report of the Navigation Commission, it has been found that from 1854 to 1900 the number of men who have been engaged on steamers per 100 tons burden has been reduced from 7.69 in 1854 in varying gradations to 2.27 in 1900. In other words, while it was necessary, in 1854, to have seven and a-half men,&#39; so to speak, to work a steamer of 100 tons burden, that number has been reduced to two and a-quarter men in 1900. During the period with which we &#39;are most concerned - that is, from 1880 to 1900, when the increase in freights and fares took place - the reduction in the working of steam-ships on this basis has been from 2.95 men per 100 tons burden to 2.27 men, being equal to 25 per cent. I have referred to that particular period in order to direct attention to what was happening in the case of freights and fares on sailing ships, which carry a lot of our produce, and the greater portion, of our wool clip, to the Old Country, and also a very great proportion of our general trade. There has been a considerable reduction effected in the cost of working that line of traffic. In sailing ships, from 1854 to 1900, the average number of men employed per 100 tons decreased from 3.97 to 1,-62. In the particular twenty years period, to which I will later refer for the purpose of making a comparison of freights and fares, the average number of men employed on sailing ships per 100 tons decreased from 2. 32 to 1.62, or equivalent to 50 per cent. Consequently, during the twenty years to which I am now going to direct attention, there was in steam-ship lines a reduction of 25 per cent, in the labour employed, and of 50 per cent, in sailing ships.- That indicates in some degree the reduction of expenditure on both classes of craft. What has happened during the same period in the matter of freights and fares so far as Australia is concerned? I shall quote no less an authority than the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> Reid, who was  President  of the Melbourne Chamber&#39; of Commerce for the year 1 900-1, and at that time a member of the Legislative Council of Victoria. In his inaugural address to the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, he dealt with the question of the freights and fares then and previously obtaining between Australia and other countries. He said, as reported in the annual report of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce - </para>

So severe was the competition in freight from the United States to Australia some time ago that 8s. 6d. and 10s. per ton of 40 cubic feet was. accepted, compared with 47s. 6d. and 60s. from ports in Great Britain, and even now, although the lines of English-owned steamers trade regularly with Australia from New York, their freights are as a- rule half those from English ports, being 20s. to 30s. per ton from New York, and 40s. to 70s. from Great Britain. </para>

Their power, if unchecked, is a serious menace to the trade of the Empire, for securing as they do all the British trade at higher rates, they arrange for the exclusion of competition with the foreign lines, and in consequence drive a- large portion of our legitimate trade into foreign countries. </para>

          <para class="block">The latter part of that quotation must give food for serious thought to those who believe in the principles of free-trade, and also to those who advocate making strongerthe connexion between Australia and the Mother Country. We have there the testimony of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> Reid that through the operation of the shipping companies much of our trade is diverted from Great Britain to other countries.

While twenty years ago it was considered by ship-owners that 27s. 6d. was a fair thing from Great Britain to Australia, since the conference or combination of brokers, who simply limit the number of ships placed on the berth, they have by a cunning system of rebates maintained a- freight Tate which has averaged 47s. 6d. for the past twenty years. </para>

I am not quoting: any member of the Labour or Socialist party. I am rather directing attention te* the views expressed by those who are known to have long held fixed and inveterate opinions as to the way enterprises should be conducted, and whose opposition, if not antipathy, to every form of State enterprise is notorious. Those two gentlemen, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Malcolm</inline> McEacharn and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> said that if this intolerable condition of affairs continued, the only way out of the difficulty - the only road out of the wood - was the formation of a direct line of State-owned mail steamers between Australia and the Old World. I wish to cite, before concluding, an instance of the success of State enterprise in the open market. The manufacture of tobacco is a State monopoly in Austria,- and yet that Austrian-made article finds a profitable sale in Germany, where industrial activity is forced to its utmost limit. It crosses the border, and competes successfully in Germany with the products of private enterprise. That is a forcible example of State activity competing against, if not thrusting aside, other forms of competition. We should not believe that, if we embark upon the enterprise advocated in this motion, it will end in failure,, because, in the instance to which I have referred, it is- shown that tobacco manufactured, in Austria, by the Sta.te, though ^exposed to the full blast  of  competition, &#60;San hold  its  own in that very active commercial centre, the German Empire. I come now to -the financing  of  the project. The estimate  of  the cost given in the report <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> the Commission is ,&#163;3,300,000 odd, which, divided between the six Federated States, would amount to something over ^500,000 each. That would not be :a great amount  for  each  State to risk in embarking on this experiment, when we remember the way in which their  people  have had to suffer in the past,  and  that every  form of  enterprise, and every unit in the community in every grade  and  -walk  of  life, have had to bear their share  of  the extra impost due to the high freights maintained by the shipping ring controlling trade between  Australia  and the Old Country. I think that the experiment -would be well worth the amount it is estimated to cost, if its effect were only to  bring  about a reasonable degree  of  competition, which would place the people  of  Australia on a more equitable footing with others in the markets  of  the Old Country. I am supporting the  motion  in the belief that the  amount  the experiment is estimated  to  cost would be  well  expended when  the  opportune time arrives. I - admit -.that I see no prospect  of  our embarking upon it immediately, but there is certainly no reason why the experiment should be indefinitely postponed, or  for  believing that it would  not  be possible to finance it with loan  money.  We certainly have every justification  for  making the experiment, and there is no reason why we should continue indefinitely to submit to the enormous imposts levied by  the  shipping ring, under whose operations we have been enjoying  for  years the luxury  of  paying <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per  ton more in freights, than we should have been  called  upon to  pay. </para>
