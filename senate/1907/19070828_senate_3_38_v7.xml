                        <para>- I very much regret that so far I have been unable to lay the N Navigation Bill before the Senate, but that is through no fault of myself or the Government. Unfortunately the final report of the Navigation Commission has not yet been received. We expect that it will be received within a week, and if it is, I.  should say that with very little delay the Navigation Bill will be introduced here. Subject to anything which may transpire subsequently, I may go so far as to say that if the final report is received this week I hope to be able to move the second reading of the Bill on Friday week. </para>

                    <para>- - My chief object in proposing to alter the period of twelve months to six months is to consider the interests of the public generally, or, at any rate, of that part of the public who are accustomed and able to draw cheques. It would be inconvenient for a man who has drawn a cheque to find that it could be held out against him for as Jong as twelve months. The shortening of the period would be to the advantage of the public. On the other hand, it must not be made too short in a country of such vast areas as Australia, but with our present postal facilities, or want of them, there is ample time for a cheque to travel from any part of Australia to another and return again in less than six months. When I first suggested a period of six months, I considered also the possibility of a cheque drawn in Australia being sent to some other part of the British Empire. After making inquiries, I think that six months would be ample even for that. I also inquired from many of the leading bankers both here and in another State, and found it was their unanimous and express desire that a period of six months should be enacted. Therefore, six months is long enough from the banker's point of view, while it is in the interests of the public that their cheques should not be out for more than six months. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is quite willing to make a cheque stale and of no value at the end of twelve months. The question of going to law is no more involved if the period is made six months. The whole question is the convenience of the public. Any honorable senator would much prefer after he had drawn a cheque to know that it must be presented within six months, and not be held over for twelve 'months. A man may ' draw a cheque and may wish to leave Australia for England "before twelve months have elapsed. He would naturally want to have his account cleared, and would consider it somewhat objectionable to leave an open account for twelve' months. It is difficult on the spur of the moment to bring forward definite arguments about an arbitrary matter of this kind, but I have come to the conclusion that six months would be ample for all purposes of interchange in the Commonwealth, and even for interchange between the Commonwealth and other parts of the Empire. We shall be consulting the interests of public and bankers alike if we reduce the term. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - This sub-clause was not in the Bill as originally submitted to the Senate, but an amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> in Committee, to insert a provision of this character, was carried with a modification.  His  proposal provided for a period of six months, but the Committee made the period twelve months. It was pointed out on that occasion that regard must be had to the peculiar conditions obtaining in many of the remote parts of Australia. In many instances storekeepers, or others in business who handle a good deal of money, act almost as bankers. Men who receive their wages for, perhaps, a lengthy period in the shape of cheques cash them with a storekeeper of that kind, who possibly holds cheques for a very long time ; at any rate, for a much longer period than anybody in a metropolitan area or any of the provincial towns would do. He perhaps holds a great number of cheques until he comes down to town to transact some of his business, which may happen only once or twice regularly in a year. In these circumstances, it might easily happen that he would have in his possession a number of cheques which had run beyond a period of six months. </para>

                        <para>- It is 'only in remote centres that such a thing happens.. I have been assured by persons who have had actual experience that it does happen sometimes. Cheques are' in circulation practically in the same way as bank notes at great distances from the centres of population in which banking institutions have their branches. It is quite conceivable that in Australia, perhaps more than in any other country, cheques would remain out for a particularly long time. I recognise with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that it is very difficult, in discussing a matter that must be settled  more or less on arbitrary principles, to lay down any hard and fast rules as to the practice in any particular place, but in all the circumstances we shall be conserving the interests of the customer, the banker, and the general public if we make the term twelve months. The liability of the; drawer in law still ' remains for' a period of six years from the time he draws the cheque, but .this provision is simply to enable a bank, at the end of a certain period, to say, "That cheque is stale. We do not propose to honour it, but refer the holder back to the drawer to recover the amount of the cheque." After the previous discussion, honorable senators saw the wisdom of extending the period to twelve months, and will, I think, see no valid reason for " departing from that attitude now. I believe .that banks now, in many instances, hesitate about honoring .cheques that are out for longer than six months. </para>

                        <para>- It has apparently no power to do so, unless it has made a rule to that effect, acquiesced in by the customer, and forming part of the contract, express or implied, between him and the bank. Ordinarily speaking, a bank has no power at law to dishonour a cheque for a period of six years. All we are providing is, to a certain extent, to protect the banker, and to  convenience the customer, but the convenience of the public must also be consulted. Taking into consideration the convenience of everybody concerned, it will be found that twelve months for a country -like Australia is a very fair and reasonable term. </para>

                    <para>. - I object to the proposed amendment. According to the Minister of Home Affairs a debt due under a cheque can be collected at any time within six years. I point out that in country districts men commonly accept cheques from persons whom they consider sound, and put them away for months together until they have some occasion to visit a town in which there is a bank' at which the cheques can be cashed. If the amendment proposed were agreed to a man keeping a cheque in this way would find when he got into the town, perhaps seven or eight months after he had received the cheque, that he could not cash it, and it would be necessary for him to go back to the drawer and get another. I think that the period of twelve months represents a fair compromise. Hundreds of people are in the habit of taking cheques from men whom they consider " as good as the bank," and they keep them for long periods until, having to go to the nearest town at which there is a bank, a convenient opportunity is afforded to cash them. If the amendment were accepted, it would be very inconvenient for these people to find, on presenting them at the bank, that the cheques they had kept so long were no good, and it would be necessary for them to get fresh cheques from the drawers. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Perhaps the drawer of a cheque made stale after a period of six months might turn round to the man who asked him for a fresh cheque, and say, " I have already paid you, and I hold your receipt. You will have to go to law if you want another cheque." I think that the Committee ought not to undo what it has already done. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator referred to the banker's interests. As soon as I suggested an alteration of the. period to six months, the honorable senator interjected that that would suit the banker. I point out to the honorable senator that the provision as it stands is eminently in the interests of the banker, because it says that the banker shall not be responsible, or incur any liability by refusing payment of a cheque. The . true meaning of the provision is that after the lapse of twelve months the banker is to be at liberty to pay or not to pay on a cheque, as he thinks fit. That is the kind of provision for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sayers</inline> expresses so much admiration in the interests of the public. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with the whole sub-clause. I think that the period should be reduced to six months, and we should amend the sub-clause so as to provide that after the expiration of six months from the time it is drawn, a cheque shall become absolutely valueless. That would be a convenience to the public. We have, further, to consider the interests of the drawer, and I ask what security the drawer has under this provision. He may find out on scrutiny of his bank pass-book that one of his cheques drawn twelve months before has not been presented for payment, and unless he communicates, with the banker to stop payment of the cheque, as he can do at any time, he will be left in a state of complete uncertainty, and will not know whether it has been cashed or not. </para>

To use the phrase of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> the cheque should become automatically of no value whatever. If the sub-clause were altered in that way, the public would be convenienced. We certainly should not leave it to the discretion of a banker to honour or dishonour a cheque as he thought fit. </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable senator says, in some instances they serve the purposes, of currency for months together. In my opinion, twelve months may be regarded as a short period. _ It seems to me that the drawer cannot possibly be injured in any way. The man who draws a cheque should at the time he draws it have money to his credit to meet it. If the cheque is not presented, the money is npt drawn, and its presentation at whatever time it is- presented, is simply the collection of a debt. It was agreed that the responsibility" of bankers should be limited to some reasonable period after a cheque is drawn, and' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> proposed that the period should be six months. I think it was at my instance that the period was altered to twelve months, but at that time there ' was a consensus of opinion in the Committee tha.t twelve months would be a more convenient period than six months. I hope the Committee will not depart from that view. </para>

A point that has been overlooked is that it would be an advantage to the drawer of a cheque if in a case where a cheque was lost a bank could return the cheque as stale after six months, because he would know then that he would be justified in giving a duplicate cheque. The advantage' to the drawer in such a case would be greater if the .period were fixed at six months than if it were fixed at twelve months. </para>

                    <para>. - I am aware that it is not always desirable to draw general conclusions from particular cases, still, when one has a particular case brought under his notice, it is liable to influence his judgment. I intend to give a vote for the longer period, and I do so because of a particular case which has come quite recently under my notice. I have some little property at a place 40 miles from one town and 50 miles from another, in each of which are three banks, and a shorter distance from a town in which there is one bank. This should indicate to honorable senators that there is no great, difficulty in presenting cheques for payment at this place. Some time in April last I gave a cheque to a man who had completed a. contract'. He went to work on an adjoining, property, and only a fortnight ago he purchased a team from me, and paid me, as a portion of the purchase money, with my own cheque. Here was a man who did, as many bush workers do, put my cheque iri. his pocket satisfied that he could cash it when he wanted the money. When such a thing could occur in a fairly settled district, with reasonable banking facilities, what might not happen in the outside districts of Queensland or of Western Australia? </para>

                        <para>- I would do nothing, of the sort. The man had the option, if he chose, to present the cheque next day and get payment for it. I have shown that, in a district which, in view of the present development of Australia, may be regarded as a fairly settled district, such a thing could happen, and I ask what might not happen in this way in the outside districts of Queensland or of Western Australia, where for months together men never visit a town Which can boast a bank ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has, however, raised another point, that, according to his reading of the sub-clause, it is left optional with the banker whether he will honour or dishonour a cheque. I agree with the honorable senator that no banker should have that option.' We should decide the law, and not leave it to the caprice of one banker to do one thing and to the discretion of another banker to do another thing. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [3.42]. - I think there has been' some misconception in the framing of this provision, because as the sub-clause now stands it gives statutory power to a banker to_ dishonour anybody's cheque after a certain interval.' That is a position in which I do not think we should put a banker. A cheque, like a bill of exchange, wilh certain differences, must be presented within a reasonable time to make the drawer liable.
                </para>
                <para class="block">But it is a very different thing to say that a banker shall be at liberty to dishonour a cheque which perhaps the drawer may wish to see paid. Under this sub-clause a banker is given power to dishonour a customer's cheque, and that is a very unpleasant thing. A customer may always protect himself if the reasonable time does not give him the protection, by stopping his cheque. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The stopping of a cheque does not mean that the drawer thereby relieves himself from liability to pay the debt it represents, but it interposes an obstacle to the immediate payment, and requires that it -shall be referred to the drawer. It should not be left to the banker to dishonour a cheque if he pleases, but, after a certain time, whether three, six, or twelve months, the cheque should be made no longer a negotiable instrument. Probably the longer the time fixed the better. I do not at this moment see any advantage to be gained by shortening the period to six months. Certainly if the period is made six months, we shall hasten the time when the banker may dishonour a cheque which it may be desirable that he -should pay. The clause requires amendment at least in the direction suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - I think that every argument which we have heard upon the clause this afternoon was brought forward when the subject was discussed last week. The clause as it stands is the result of a compromise as between the interests of the drawer of the cheque, the holder, and the bank. The argument which weighed chiefly with the Committee in making the term twelve months was that cheques are a form of currency in the remoter parts of Australia, especially in Queensland. Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> was not here when we had the long discussion on the clause, but he may take it from me that every possible interest was considered. </para>

I said before that the liability in respect of a cheque is governed by the ordinary law with regard to contracts and endures for six years. If we legislate to interfere with the law in that respect we shall be interfering with well-established principles of the common law without good justification for so doing. In the first place if we provide that " all liability upon such cheque shall cease," though we may not relieve the original drawer of a cheque of. responsibility in respect of the transaction for which the cheque was given, yet as the cheque may have passed through several hands since it was drawn, the interest of other persons may be affected. </para>

                        <para>- But the cheque would still be good against the drawer under the clause as it stands. The holder could go into Court, even though he had not seen the drawer, and sue him upon the cheque two or three years afterwards. He could sue any of the persons who had indorsed the cheque prior to its coming into his hands. I think that it would be dangerous to say that all liability in respect of a cheque shall cease at the end of a period of twelve months. It would, in my opinion, be highly undesirable and unjustifiable to interfere with the present law on the subject. In this clause we should simply make provision for the relations between the banker and the customer. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia) [3.55]. - We are now enacting or re-enacting a code which has been the law in England for a very long time, and which has also been' the law in some of the -States for a considerable period. It is an exceedingly dangerous thing to make new-fangled alterations in a code without the gravest consideration. After listening to the debate, I think that the Committee will be well advised in eliminating the sub-clause altogether as well as in rejecting my honorable friend
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline>
                    amendment upon it. A cheque, like every bill of exchange, has to be presented within a reasonable time, but non-presentation within a reasonable time does not discharge the liability of the drawer of the cheque unless some prejudice has resulted to him - by the insolvency of the hanker, for instance. .The drawer remains liable upon his cheque as long as it happens to be out and unpaid. By the provision which we are discussing we are going to enable a banker, absolutely without rhyme or reason, except that a certain interval has elapsed, to dishonour a man's cheque.

                    <para>In England bankers, it seems, are bound by usage to exercise caution in paying cheques which are presented a long time after they are drawn. Such cheques are called stale. It would appear that if a banker pay a stale cheque, he does so at his own risk, and that if he pay it to a wrongful holder he cannot charge the drawer wilh its amount. He is, it is said, bound to make inquiries ; and payment without inquiries or a reference to the drawer would be irregular, and out of the usual course of business. </para>

What amounts to an unreasonable length of time for this purpose is a question of fact. In determining whether the time is reasonable or not, the nature of the instrument, the facts of the particular case, and the usage and trade of bankers must all be considered. </para>

                <para class="block">Then, as illustrating what is a reasonable time in Great Britain, where, of course, banking transactions and the drawing of cheques are confined more to certain classes of the community than is the case in Australia, <inline font-style="italic">Hamilton</inline> says - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>A cheque negotiated eight days after date was held not to be on the footing of an overdue bill, and the same was held with respect to a cheque given to the plaintiff seventeen days after its date ; but a cheque taken two months after date has been considered stale. A person who takes a stale cheque takes it at his peril. In Australia, however, cheques seem to be regarded by many bankers as continuing authorities to pay to which a banker may conform without inquiry. They are rarely, it is believed, treated as stale, nor, as a rule, is payment of them refused on the ground that a long time has elapsed since they were drawn, unless the drawer's liability to pay has been discharged by the operation of the Statute .of Limitations. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">In England, in the absence of any express rule or principle of law, the banker seems to be bound by the usage of his business to make due inquiries before he honours a stale cheque. If he honours a stale cheque he does so at his peril, and it has been held in Great Britain that a period of two months elapsing between the drawing and the presentation of the cheque has constituted it stale. On the other hand, as <inline font-style="italic">Hamilton</inline> points out, in Australia a cheque seems to be regarded by bankers as a continuing authority, to be determined only by the Statute of Limitations. He does not assert that that is general, because he says that a cheque is rarely treated . as stale. </para>

                        <para>- No. The authorities for the application of the Statute of Limitations are <inline font-style="italic">O'Ferrall</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Bank of Australasia</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Hutton</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Glass.</inline> It has been stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> that after a period of six months banks frequently refuse to honour cheques on account of their being stale. I think I have seen cheques which have been out for a longer period than six months returned by the bank. I do not remember whether' they were marked " Stale" or " Too long out," but they bore an expression to that effect, which, however, did not impute anything in the nature of insolvency or inability to meet the cheque on the part of the drawer. I feel sure that on reflection honorable senators will agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that the position is a very delicate one. In whatever we do, it behoves us to so provide that .we do not throw any imputation upon the drawer of the stale cheque. At the same time, we can, I think, safely' legislate somewhat in conformity with what would seem to be a compromise between the British practice and what evidently is the practice with many banks in Australia. I hope that we shall not legislate to make a cheque of no validity after a certain period, but that we shall let the determination of liability rest upon the Statute of Limitations, and provide that at the end of twelve months the banker shall be in a position to decline to honour a cheque. Of course it is open to a banker, as has been said, to exercise a certain amount of caprice, and to say that 'he will honour A's  cheque after a period of twelve months and more if he is in funds, but that in regard to B, he will stand on the law, and will not honour his stale cheque. We know there is a practice that after a cheque has become- what is known or regarded as stale in Australia, the banker may still return' the cheque as stale without any imputation against the drawer. He may do that at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- After a certain period, when a banker thinks that a cheque is stale, then, .for the protection of the  customer,  he very often declines to honour it. He refers to the cheque as "stale," or as -something to that effect. That is done in some instances, perhaps, because a cheque may have got into the wrong hands. The holder may have held it fraudulently and secretly for a considerable time, and when, perhaps, he thinks that the recollection of the lost cheque has faded from the mind of the drawer and the banker, he attempts to put it into circulation, and through the bank. </para>

                        <para>- The man may have passed the cheque on to an innocent third party months afterwards, and the third party may have brought it to the bank, and the. bank, thinking that the cheque had been out rather too long, holds- it up. Then there may be cases in which a bank knows that a customer had given out a cheque a considerable time before, and that it had been held for some purpose or other. When it is presented, after the expiry of six months, the bank, knowing the nature of the drawer's business, and the peculiar circumstances under which, at certain times, he may have to conduct it, says : " We see no reason why we should treat that cheque as a stale one,'.' and so it is paid. I think that the reason why 'it is left to the option of the banker is because he generally knows the nature of his customer's business, and is able in many instances to judge whether a cheque has. or has not been out rightly for a lengthy period. I think it is advisable to leave that discretion to the banker. For these reasons we can, in my opinion, fairly leave the clause as it stands. We need not assume that the option would be exercised by the banker unjustly or harshly. </para>

If payment of a cheque is refused under any pretence it injures the credit of the drawer. The money belongs to the depositor, and not to the bank, and he has a right to say when his cheque ought to be paid. If any question arises, undoubtedly the bank ought to refer to the drawer. I prefer the period to be fixed at twelve months- rather than at six months ; but after what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has said, I think that it would be better to omit the sub-clause! </para>

Suppose that a stale cheque drawn by A,'B, and Company in the same town came into a bank. The bank would telephone to the drawer, or send a message round to him before returning his cheque as stale. -Has it occurred to honorable senators that, owing to a cheque having been out for a long time, a duplicate cheque may have been issued by the drawer? It has never injured a person's credit to have a cheque come back marked as "stale," because that word has a distinct meaning. </para>

                <para>The amendment, if carried, will restore the clause to its original form. The honorable senator, at whose instance those words were left out, advanced the view that the Bill as it stood made provision for work for solicitors and notaries. I pointed out then, and do so again, that the only case in which a notary would be required for protesting the dishonour of a bill would be that of a British or other bill from outside the Commonwealth which was dishonoured here. As the clause now stands, it provides that any householder or substantial resident of the place may in the presence of two witnesses ' give ai certificate attesting the dishonour of the bill, and that might be rather a dangerous condition in which to leave the law. Bills of exchange entering the Commonwealth from abroad may be dishonoured here, and somebody, relying upon that provision, might endeavour to get from a householder a certificate of dishonour. The householder, unaccustomed to doing anything of the kind, as he very likely would be, might issue the certificate in such a form that it would be of very little use. </para>

                        <para>- Notwithstanding the most strenuous efforts of  Parliament from time to time to provide simple forms to be used by the public, we often find some reputedly intelligent members of the public making very serious blunders in using them. A notary is an officer who attests documents in one country for use in another. Throughout the other parts of the British Empire, as well as in foreign countries, it is the custom for notaries to attest certain documents which are to go outside that country into another. The attestation by a notary public is in such cases accepted abroad straight away, so to speak. The Courts of a foreign country will often take judicial notice of it. On the other hand if a document attested by a witness who is not an official is presented, the Courts of a foreign country cannot take judicial notice of it, but are compelled to seek other evidence. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think they will. We provide that where the services of a notary are not available it shall be competent for a householder or substantial resident to issue a certificate. In that case, however, it would be set forth that the services of a notary were not obtainable. -Most of these bills will be dealt with by business men, who in ordinary circumstances would avail themselves of a notary's services. Other persons into whose hands the bills might come, and who were not accustomed to notaries, might endeavour to rely upon the provision as it stands, and find that they had " fallen in." Phillimore, in his <inline font-style="italic">International Law,</inline> speaks thus of the office of a notary - </para>

                <para>In all civilized States throughout the world a protest of dishonour made by a notary is regarded as effective. Therefore, the supposed advantage to be gained by the amendment previously made in this clause, or the supposed detriment imposed upon notaries, does not balance the disadvantage caused by the establishment of an unsettled system of law, which will not harmonise with the law in other parts of the Empire, and in foreign countries. I ask the mover of the original amendment to recognise the advisableness of restoring the clause to its old form. In the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopedia of the Lams of England,</inline> vol. 9, appears a somewhat lengthy article on the notary, in which it is stated -  " The general functions of a notary consist in receiving all acts and contracts which must, or are wished to, be clothed with an authentic form; in conferring on. such acts the required authenticity ; in establishing their date ; in preserving originals or minutes of them, which, when prepared in the style and with the seal of the notary, obtain the name of original acts, and in giving authentic copies of such acts." The office of a notary is thus described by the only English text-writer upon the subject <inline font-style="italic">{Brooke,</inline> 3rd edition, page 12), but the description more accurately applies abroad than in England. By commercial usage, now embodied in the law, the intervention of a notary is in some cases necessary, and in others advantageous, in the proceedings consequent upon the dishonor of a bill of exchange. </para>

                        <para>- I think not. Some of the functions of a notary are sometimes conferred in the case Of Great Britain upon Consuls abroad, who have to authenticate particular transactions. A notary's position should be regarded as somewhat analogous. It is an established practice throughout all civilized countries to use the services of notaries, and unless there is a solid justification for a departure from it, we shall be well advised to adhere to it. The elimination of the provision requiring a notary to attest the dishonour of a foreign bill will not have the effect of benefiting persons who might be regarded as unable to afford to pay the notarial fees. The great bulk of those interested will be persons who receive bills of exchange, in the course of outside business transactions. In an endeavour to eliminate the necessity for a notary, and the consequent costs, we might mislead some people into the belief that all they had to do was to go to a householder and get his attestation of dishonour. I am not prepared to say how that would be regarded abroad, but . all civilized nations look one to the other to have responsible officers to authenticate particular acts. </para>

                        <para>- He has considerably more than a private householder. He is a registered officer. He has to make application for appointment. It is. not very easy for anybody to be appointed as a notary. No matter how great his qualifications, or how excellent his credentials may be, he will find that a considerable time passes after his application goes in before it can be even favorably entertained. The authorities have to be thoroughly satisfied of has responsibility and integrity before his appointment. After being appointed and becoming entitled to receive the' fees pertaining to the office, a notary - unlike a householder, who might be selected at random - will not probably so conduct his business as to render himself liable to forfeit his office. The better he can conduct his office the more intimate his knowledge of the business, and the more careful he snows himself in preserving the records and transactions of his office in his books, the  more likely is he to attract a <inline font-style="italic">clientiele</inline> which will return to him something in the nature of an income. If an individual holding a foreign bill of exchange seeks to have it protested by a householder who may or may not be substantial, but whom he believes to be substantial, what record is there of the transaction a day or a week afterwards? In the most perfect good faith the householder might be prepared to protest the dishonour of the bill, as the matter would not be one which would come in the ordinary course of his business transactions. On the other hand, officers who are appointed for the special purpose may be relied upon to do the work correctly, so that no question can be raised abroad as to the exact form of the certificate. Such an officer would also, in carrying out his duties, make his own records of such transactions, which in the last resort might' be relied upon should the original documents be lost in transit through shipwreck or otherwise. In every sense of the word, we know that a notary would be much more responsible than any private individual could be, so far as these acts are concerned. In the circumstances, seeing that we are not, by this provision, taking away from notaries fees which might be collected from persons ill able to bear them, I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> to consent to restore the Bill to its original form, in order that we may have provisions dealing with this important matter of the dishonour of foreign bills of exchange framed on lines which have proved to be satisfactory heretofore, and in absolute conformity with similar provisions in all civilized countries with which we have commercial transactions. </para>

                    <para>. -  The tenacity with which persons who have in the past possessed any privileges hang on to those privileges is simply marvellous. After a full discussion of the merits of the case, when the Bill was previously before the Committee, we struck out the provision making it compulsory to employ the services of a notary public to protest a bill of exchange when the services of such an officer were available. Not content with having put up a good fight on behalf of the privileged notaries on that occasion, the Minister of Home Affairs now asks the Committee to waste an hour or two in reconsidering the matter in order to try to restore a provision which honorable senators on a previous occasion deliberately eliminated from the Bill. The honorable and learned senator has indulged in a great deal of special pleading in support of his particular view of the amendment. He has said that we ought to get into line with respect to this matter with the rest of the civilized world, but I point out that the fact that there has been a close corporation of lawyers and notaries in every civilized country up to the present is not a good reason why we should continue to extend the same privileges to those people for all time. I have not the slightest doubt that the members of the legal fraternity and their off-shoots, the notaries public, will be found sticking up for each other in every portion of the civilized world. I have never disputed that, and I shall not waste time in doing so now. I point out that my amendment, which was previously adopted by the Committee, does not prevent any one from availing himself of the services of a notary, a lawyer, or anybody else. Any one who has a bill to protest may, under the Bill as it now stands, go to any notary he pleases to get his bill protested. On the other hand, if he thinks it wise to do so, he can get any reputable householder or substantial resident to do the work for him. After all, what is a notary? It is, I think, a fairly full definition to say that he is an official appointed for the purpose of attesting documents, but any ordinary intelligent person can do that just as well as a notary. I fail to understand why a man should be compelled, when he does not desire to do so, to pay heavy fees to a notary to do something which he can get equally well done by other persons without having to pay those fees. The Government recognise that the protesting of these bills of exchange can be efficiently performed without the services of a notary, because in this clause they made provision that this work might be done by a householder where the services of a notary were not available. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> said that all sort of mistakes would be liable to be made by persons who are not notaries, but I fail to see that business people, frequently dealing with bills of exchange in the course of their ordinary business transactions, are likely to be incapable of filling up the form set out in schedule 2, when an eight-year-old school boy could fill it up correctly. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. He would find it all set out for him, with the exception of a few blanks, and a boy eight  years of age ought to be able to fill up those blanks. If he could not do so, he would be no credit to his schoolmaster. I see no reason why we should restore the clause to its original form. This is one of the matters in which we might have a little free-trade. Why should I be compelled to pay a fee to a notary, or to employ such an officer, "if I do not wish to do so ? I do not understand why the close preserve of lawyers and notaries public should be protected by this Committee. Since my amendment was adopted I have received at least a dozen letters from notaries public and lawyers, asking me to forego my opposition to what is now proposed by the Minister. I have not replied to any of them, but I can now reply to them all by saying that I wish people to be allowed to conduct their own business in any way they think fit, and I do not wish that they should be compelled to pay fees to any privileged class in the community. If I have bills of exchange to protest, why should I be compelled to go to a notary public in Collins-street, when I could get one of my fellow senators to do the work; or, to use the words of the bill, " any householder or substantial resident of the place," to protest them for me? I am not certain whether the word " substantial," as used in this clause, means that the resident shall weigh so many pounds avoirdupois, or be so many inches tall. I shall certainly resist the amendment. The Committee rejected a similar provision at a previous sitting, and no good reasons have been given why we should go back on the decision then arrived at, and place notaries public in a privileged position, where they must be employed, whether a man wishes to employ them or not, and simply because the legal fraternity, who seem to possess so much influence with the present, and with all other Governments, wish to make this work a close preserve for these gentlemen. </para>

That is one of the best reasons which could be offered for refusing to reinsert the words which the Committee previously decided to leave out. These business men are men. of intelligence, and know exactly what they are doing. They could render this service one to another, and there is no reason, why they should not do so. It is not proposed that they should go to any one outside indiscriminately, and they would know that they would be protecting their own interests in making use of each other for the protesting of bills of exchange. I see no reason why we should continue to uphold a system by which this class of work is left to persons who may have had somewhat similar duties to perform as church officials under a custom and practice established over a thousand years ago. The Minister of Home Affairs has himself shown that it is not absolutely necessary that the protesting of bills of exchange should be done by notaries public, since the Bill, as presented, made provision for the performance of the work by a householder or substantial resident if a notary were not available. There is no reason in the world, so far as I can see, why business men in places like Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, and Adelaide should do this work for each other'. At present they have to go to a notary, but if they were relieved of this method of doing business no one can believe that any inconvenience would be caused. </para>

                        <para>. - It is my intention to support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> I shall do so, I may inform the Minister, from no contrary spirit. I realize that the Government, in proposing to offer bounties for the establishment of industries, have acted under the belief that those industries can be permanently established. I desire however, to submit for consideration  whether  the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau, with all the advantages that it would give to the different States, in regard to land culture in all its varieties, would not be a more permanent factor in achieving the objects which the Government has in view. In 'my belief the benefits to be derived from the establishment of such a bureau would be permanent, and would tend towards the welfare of the community at large. The United States Agricultural Bureau, to the organization of which I propose to refer, is of such a character  that  I feel sure details concerning it will not only be interesting, but a revelation to honorable senators. If a similar institution were established in Australia, its influence would extend throughout the Commonwealth, and it would tend to the establishment and development of industries suitable to Australia, and which would be successfully carried on here. Such a bureau would have the assistance of competent experts, possessing a thorough practical knowledge of soils, seeds, methods of cultivation, climate, and meteorology, and who would be able to advise and educate our producers. But the industries which the Government by this measure wish to assist are in themselves of such a speculative character that Ministers will be taking upon themselves a grave responsibility by spending the money in such directions. I feel certain that the -Â£400,000 odd which it is proposed to spend would be better spent in establishing such a bureau as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> amendment indicates. After all, the soil is the pivot around which all industries centre, and must be the main factor in the development of Australasia. But I shall vote against this Bill for other reasons. In my estimation; the bounties scheme should be considered in connexion with the Tariff. Instead of its preceding the consideration of the Tariff, it should follow that measure. We have a very large expenditure to face if the proposals foreshadowed by the Government are to be carried out. We are to have an old-age pensions scheme, a defence scheme, and a Commonwealth occupation of the Northern Territory. By-the-by'e, I should like to say a word or two about that matter, because my views have been misinterpreted. I am not opposed to the Commonwealth taking over the Northern Territory - indeed, I believe that it is our duty to take it over. </para>

                            <para>- Because_ I conceive that, when forty years ago South Australia pluckily. took upon herself the full responsibility of developing that great land, she entered upon a task greater than she could sustain. She now confesses that she is unable to continue to bear the great expenditure involved. When we consider the responsibility and expense which South Australia has already had to endure, the Commonwealth, in my opinion, would scarcely be acting Federally, in the highest interpretation of the term, if we did not favorably consider the question of taking over the Territory. But that does not prevent me from expressing a strong antagonism to the agreement which was entered into by the Prime Minister, and which I consider inequitable, especially as we have not been vouchsafed a scrap of information as to why those values were fixed, why those conditions were agreed to, and what we have to do in connexion with the development of that vast Territory. Considering the great expenditure which will have to be incurred, and remembering that, according to the Treasurer, we have only a little over  Â£100,000  to play with at the present time, it seems to me to be most, injudicious to inaugurate a system of bounties with a view to assisting industries, most of which I can prove are absolutely speculative, and some of which do not need any help from the Commonwealth., In view of our financial position, I shall vote against the Bill for the reasons I have given. The principle underlying bounties is one against which, theoretically, little can be said. We know that many nations have adopted the principle. I will not say that in many instances the expectations have been realized. I remember the time when the British Government offered a- bounty of  Â£50,000  each for the building of three first-class battle-ships, according to a certain design. I believe that the money was well spent. We all recognise that in that case the ship-builders accepted a very grave responsibility, because they had to provide for all modern requirements. Upon the Government of the Commonwealth rests a very grave responsibility. If the bounties are successful, they will take the credit. But if the bounties are not successful, then those who will have suffered will be infinitely ['more to be considered 'than the Government. In my opinion, a Government should only submit a system of bounties on irrefutable evidence that they will achieve their object. It is cruel and unjust to induce men and women without practical knowledge to sink their little capital in industries, and devote the best years of their lives to working under semitropical conditions. To an irresponsible Government failure means little, but to a worker it means a considerable sacrifice. Victoria's last experiment with bounties cost Â£233,000. I venture to affirm that in every instance, except one, the bounty was a failure, and even in that case it cannot be said that it achieved a real success. I recognise that, as regards the dairying industry, the bounty did a certain amount of good, although the channels through which the money was spent were such as to cause Australia to blush. </para>

                            <para>- No. As regards the. expenditure of .Â£233,000, all the bounties were failures, except in one case. I have looked at the expert evidence upon which the bounties provided for in this Bill have been based. Speaking as a business man, I consider that if ever there was a document which damned a proposal with faint praise  the report of the experts on this Bill does. In the case of almost every item, qualifications are given. I do not like to pass an opinion upon the ability of the experts, but as regards one or two matters, on which I possess personal knowledge, it does seem to me that they have based their conclusions on. very flimsy evidence. Under existing conditions, what is the prospect of success with the specified industries? The conditions are against everybody but capitalists. If honorable senators will read the report of the experts they will find that in the tropical area the bounties must inevitably go to capitalists, whom my honorable friends opposite dislike. Take, for instance, the bounty which is offered on the production of copra. . A cocoanut tree takes from six to seven years before it fruits. The bounty is not to be given to small men who clear the land and put in the trees, but at the end of seven years, under the terms specified in the Bill, it will go to capitalists, who have had sufficient capital to enable them to await the results from the planting of the trees'. It is only capitalists who can go in for the production of copra. </para>

                            <para>- That is no reason why small men should not engage in the industry. In Ceylon and the Philippine Islands thousands of small men are engaged in the production of copra. I shall assume that the bounty is to be given for the purpose of assisting men and women who are on the soil- to engage in industries for which they are suitable. It is stated that,, with two or three exceptions; the bounties are offered for the purpose of inducing' white persons to emigrate to the Northern Territory and other tropical places. Ha.vewe a surplus population ? Is it businesslike to take persons from the thinly-populated States, which are crying out for suit- able labour, and plant them in an almost unknown land under conditions which few men would like their fathers, brothers, or sisters to endure, and probably without a practical knowledge of the work to be done? </para>

Practically during that period we have done nothing in that direction. Within five years Canada placed 13,000,000 acres under intense cultivation, and established 81,000" homesteads. </para>

If the colonial leaf were as popular, or equal 'in quality, to the imported leaf, would it pay you better to use more of it? - Yes, certainly ; but it is not. 3908. It is not equal in quality? - No. 3909. Is it a matter of public taste, or is there something radically deficient in the quality of Australian leaf ? - Both. The highest grade of Australian-grown tobacco leaf is not nearly of so good quality or flavour as the imported leaf. 3910. Do you know whether that arises from the cultivation or manipulation, or what do you think is the reason for the difference? - I should say, first of all, that it largely arises from the cultivation. It also arises from climatic conditions, and, personally, I am inclined to think that the soil has something to do with it. I have had an experiment made in our factory with the highest grade leaf grown in the State, and the result was very unsatisfactory. 3911.

With all due deference to the opinions of others, I do not think we shall ever be able to grow in Australia the high-grade tobacco leaf that is grown in America. 3912.

Can you state shortly to the Committee what are the differences between Australian and American leaf? - That is a very difficult question to answer. The Australian-grown leaf is a rank leaf. It is lacking in aroma, and it is not cured as it ought to be. The rankness is not overcome in the curing. The quality of leaf is such that it does not give the same aroma or taste to the smoker as the American tobacco does. 5405.To what do you attribute that? - I do not think it can be overcome. It may be due to the very heavy land on which it is grown. 5406. Do you think it is due to the curing or the growing? - I think partly to the curing, although I am not now speaking as an expert. I am merely expressing my private opinion. I should say that it is partly due to the heavy soil and partly to the way the tobacco is cured ; and then there are climatic conditions which we have not yet succeeded in overcoming in Australia.

There is a certain type of tobacco - aromatic tobacco - which we cannot produce, or which we have at least been unable to produce hitherto. The soils suitable for the growing of aromatic tobacco lie in the western districts, where the rainfall is insufficient, or on the uplands of Queensland, where we cannot get the water necessary in connexion with transplanting operations. </para>

I venture to say that the inquiries of those personally interested in the manufacture of tobacco will be admitted to be more reliable than those of Government officials, however good their intentions. If a suitable leaf could be produced here, it would result in great benefit and increased profit to the manufacturers of cigars, and when they have not been able to secure a suitable leaf, it is open to very serious doubt indeed whether the results of a bounty in connexion with the growth of tobacco would be such as should commend the proposal to honorable senators in their position as trustees of other people's money. </para>

                            <para>- I propose now to deal with the proposed bounty on copra, and this is a question on which I can speak from a practical point of view, as I could not in respect of the tobacco industry, seeing that I am a non-smoker. Copra is the kernel of the cocoanut. The cocoanut' palm is grown throughout the Pacific Islands, Ceylon, the Philippines, and to a very limited extent, indeed, in Australia. At Mackay, there is a small plantation of cocoanut palms, from the nuts of which copra is made. I have no hesitation in saying that in the Northern Territory there is land adapted to the growth of the cocoanut palm, but they will make a very grave error who believe that persons entering upon this industry in the Northern Territory may expect a "fairly good return for their money merely because it will have Government backing in the shape of the bounty proposed. I quote the following from the report of the Conference of States Officers on the Bounties Bill - </para>

                        <para>The cocoanut palm flourishes in the coastal portions of tropical and sub-tropical Australia. While no systematic attempts have been made to cultivate it in this continent isolated plantings have proved very successful. There is no doubt that it will grow luxuriantly along our northern sea-board. Quite a number of products can be won from the cocoanut palm, a fact which makes its cultivation in Australia highly desirable. A cocoanut plantation takes about five years to come into bearing, and when once established it lasts for sixty or eighty years. Probably no plantation requires less labour and expense to keep it in profitable condition. </para>
                        <para>The most important product is copra, or the dried kernel. . . . The trade in copra and the other products of the cocoanut has each considerable importance. . . . </para>
                        <para>As the industry is one of promise to Australia, the Conference recommends a bonus of 15 per cent. on the market value of the copra produced for ten years. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators must not forget that not a penny piece in the way of bounty will be paid to any one until the trees get into bearing, and the copra is made into oil; and I may inform them that there is only one oil mill working at the present time in Australia. That is one which I had the honour to build for the firm I then had the honour to represent. The Manchester Cooperative Company had a copra mill built, but it has been closed for three years, and I believe Messrs. Kitchen and Sons had a small mill, which is also closed at the present time. </para>

Whilst I might find some fault with the conditions stated in the report, the results deduced are fairly correct. Allowing for Australian conditions and wages, I have been at considerable pains to find out what would be the cost of production of copra in Australia as compared with the cost in the Islands. Up to the time when the trees would be in full bearing, the cost in Australia would amount to from Â£36 to Â£45 per acre. That would include the clearing of the land, the planting of the trees, and cultivation to the extent of keeping the plantation free of weeds and any growth which would prevent the trees obtaining the full benefit of the soil. </para>

I have taken the price of the land in some of the Islands, and I have not taken the price of the land in Australia in every case, because I thought it possible that the Government might give some of it away for the purposes of cocoanut plantations. The nuts have to go through five processes - collecting, drying, cutting up, and so on - before they are shipped, and whilst in Australia this work would cost Â£6 per acre, in the Islands it would cost only Â£2.

                            <para>- The experts put the price at Â£12 per ton, or Â£6 to the half-acre, and I think that is fairly accurate. But there is this to be said - That whilst three or four years ago the price of copra was <inline font-style="italic">jÂ£8</inline> per ton, it is now about Â£12 per ton, and it has been Â£16 per ton. The question is whether with the enormous production that is going on throughout the whole of the cocoanut-bearing countries, the present price is likely to be maintained under normal conditions. I would ask honorable senators whether they do not think they would be fit for a lunatic asylum if, having money to invest, they decided to spend it in the production of copra in Australia, when they could invest the same money three times as profitably in the copra-producing islands in Ceylon and in the Philippines? Are we justified in using Commonwealth money as we would not think of using our own? If I were looking, at this matter from the personal point of view, I should be inclined to encourage the copra industry in Australia, because it would benefit the firm which I had the- honour to represent for many years, and in which I still have an interest. That firm possesses the only mill working' in Australia, and it crushes copra to the extent of 20,000 tons a year. The more copra that is brought into the market the more advantageous it is to Lever Bros. . But surely it must be evident that the money which it is proposed to spend in- this direction could be more wisely applied as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> amendment. In that way we should do an immense amount of good in the Commonwealth, whereas by encouraging the growing" df the cocoanut palm for copra in Australia we shall simply be speculating with, the people's money in a business which may or may not be profitable. I do not say that the money would be lost if the present price were kept up, but that price is abnormal. </para>

                        <para>It was' the unanimous opinion of the Conference that the cultivation of certain fibres is worthy of the most generous encouragement. Prominence was given to the matter of jute production. As the raw material of which bags are made, the question of jute supply vitally affects most producing interests in the Commonwealth. The recent heavy increase in the price of all bags and sacks has caused some disquietude amongst farmers, who are naturally concerned when they find the price of the bag holding their wheat equal to an impost of 2d. per bushel. </para>
                        <para>It is known that jute will grow readily all over the  moister  portions of Northern Australia. Being an annual, a crop can be raised within a few months of the planting of the seed. </para>
                        <para>In 1904-5 India had 2,845,000 acres under jute, the crop being 7,450,000 bales, an average of about half-a-ton of fibre per acre. The price to-day per ton is <inline font-style="italic">Â£26</inline> 10s. c.i.f., so on these figures the industries should have a future in Australia. The importation of jute manufactures into the Commonwealth is considerable, approximating One million pounds worth a year, and the amount is likely to increase. </para>

                    <para class="block">The experts go on to refer to an article published in the <inline font-style="italic">Town and Country Journal</inline> in Sydney to prove the advantage of growing jute in Australia. The article stated - </para>

                        <para>Woolpacks arc dearer in Sydney than for the past twenty years. New packs, this season's importations, weighing nÂ£ lbs., in bales of 50 packs, loose or fast lid, are 3s. each to-day in Sydney, as compared with is. gd. six years ago. An extra 3d. each pack is paid, if the bales are broken. Packs shipped from 'Calcutta at the end df last season are to-day in Sydney 2s. iod. each. These high rates affect the squatters and sheep breeders generally. A great many more woolpacks are used now than formerly, owing to the increase in the New South Wales clip. It is estimated that there are ten million more sheep in New South Wales than three years ago. There is also a greatly increased demand for jute for the United States and other parts of the world. Jute is nowadays used for a large additional number of purposes as compared with a few years back. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Since the article referred to was written, sacks, which were 8s. 6d. per dozen, have gone down to 5s. 6d., but more recently, owing to the loss of a large cargo, the price has gone up again to 6s. 6d. The fact is that there is no article with regard to which the tendencies are so speculative as jute in its manufactured condition. The experts have, unfortunately, left us to place our own interpretation upon the most vital figure in their estimate. They put down the price of jute at about ^25 per ton. They estimate the cost of cultivation in Calcutta and India to be 52s. per acre. Since this estimate was published, I believe that the price has gone down to <inline font-style="italic">Â£20</inline> per ton. But the experts also say that the price per ton to-day iÂ§ <inline font-style="italic">Â£26</inline> 10s. .c.i.f., and that there is a large future for the growth of jute in Australia. I venture to object absolutely to a boom price being fixed upon for such products, in order to encourage people to embark upon their growth. I object to encouraging men and women to invest their money in a business upon speculative values, which have really no practical relation to ordinary prices. What does it mean when it is said that the cost of cultivation is 52s. per acre? It means that, practically, the whole cost is spent upon labour; and what does labour cost in India? The maximum wage for a man there is 4d. per day, and there are women and "children employed in the industry who on an average are paid from one- half -penny to three farthings per day. If, then, it costs 52s. per acre to cultivate jute in India, what would it be likely to cost to produce such a crop in Australia? I venture to say that it would not realize a profit, but would show a very serious loss indeed. I think that the gentlemen who drew up this report have been very negligent indeed in making such a statement as they have done, and in not giving us any idea as to" 'the relation between the cost of production in the countries to which they refer and the probable cost in Australia. How can we, as business men, induce the people of Australia who have money to invest to embark- in such ail industry upon such a statement, as is placed before us in this report? I am not saying whether this industry is in itself one that could be successfully grafted on to other industries in this country. But I object to being asked <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> vote, for a bounty for the encouragement of any industry until I know exactly what the conditions are. I want to know all the details which are essential to enable me to form a judgment as to what the probable results will be. I know a Sydney manufacturer of bags' who has suffered a considerable loss in consequence of the action of the Government. He complains that, whilst the Government have placed a duty on jute, they have allowed bags to come in free. The consequence has been that this manufacturer, who employed fifty hands, and has purchased machinery to enable him to carry on his business, finds that he cannot conduct it profitably. He informs me that one of his customers, with whom he had a contract last year, has asked him to renew that contract in ten days. He is placed in this position - that if he cannot enter into the contract on the same terms as before, bags from Calcutta will be used. </para>

The trees demand exactly the same care as do the trees in a first-class orchard. If a man is not careful, he may not get his cocoanut trees to bear until two or three years after the usual bearing time, and the  crop of nuts which he will get will be decreased very materially. Modern planters use the plough, and adopt every possible means to strengthen the trees by securing to them all the nutriment they can obtain from the soil. </para>

                        <para>The heavy expenses incidental to the initiation of a plantation, and the long period that elapses before any returns can be expected, are the main drawbacks to the industry. The idea of catch crops being possible in the meantime is, in our opinion, misleading. It is also to be remembered that the chemists of the world are actively in search of a' synthetic substitute. In this connexion, it is well to bear in mind how the German chemists ruined the indigo industry of India. </para>
                        <para>At the present time, a synthetic substitute for rubber is claimed to have been discovered in the form of some preparation of wheat, which successfully admits of vulcanization, in which essential qualification other would-be-rubber substitutes have so far failed. In addition to the long delay that must be experienced before the rubber-planter can obtain any return for his heavy expenditure, there is always the possibility that the research chemist may evolve in his laboratory some substance that may render of little or no value, the planter's costly undertaking. In spite of all these considerations, the members of the Conference, haying regard to the general importance of the industry, and the necessity of securing settlement in the tropical parts of Australia, agreed to recommend a bonus of 10 per cent, for ten years. </para>

                        <para>The importations of rice into the Commonwealth are sufficiently large, and its value as a food product is so well established that the encouragement of its production in Australia is much to be desired. It is, however, a product which is principally raised in Asiatic lands, and the following conditions are necessary for its successful cultivation. The best varieties of rice are grown in swamps or level irrigated ground, and the initial stages of its cultivation are carried out while the land is entirely under water. Rice is also grown largely in the swamps of Southern United States - Carolina in particular - and is partially worked with white labour. A good quality of rice is also produced by white labour in Northern Italy. Coming nearer home, in the Northern Territory, near Port Darwin, Messrs.  Kloppenburg  and Erickson, with the help of aboriginals, some 25 years ago, harvested 8 tons of uncleaned rice - swamp variety - from 5 acres of land, which represents a gross return of about Â£20 per acre. This may be regarded as a very satisfactory yield. </para>

                    <para>Upland or hill rice, which, as its name implies, grows on dry land, is perhaps more within the scope of Australian producers. As far as climate and soil are concerned, there is no reason why it should not be extensively cultivated in Australia. It is produced, for instance, on a large scale in Manchuria, where, although its summers are warm, the winter is much colder than ours. </para>
                    <para>It is possible that both varieties of rice may be harvested by the stripper, in the same way as wheat or oats. </para>

It will be seen, therefore, that the cultivation of rice opens up an entirely new field. It is open to doubt if it can be successfully exploited under Australian conditions. The industry, however, is sufficiently important to deserve encouragement, and the Conference recommends a Bonus on uncleaned rice at the rate of 20s. per ton, . for a term of 5 years. </para>

From what I know of the cotton industry, I think it is unfair to offer a bounty upon the production of the article. I believe that it can be grown in Australia profitably without the aid of a bounty. In 1904 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> J. Boyd, F.R.G.S., Queensland, editor of <inline font-style="italic">The Queensland Agricultural Journal,</inline> published a pamphlet entitled " Cotton Cultivation in Queensland." I propose to quote his estimate of the value of cotton. If it be true, the marvel is that every farmer in Queensland does not rush into the cotton industry. Let us see how much a farmer can realize from 10 acres of cotton by selling his crop at 2d. per lb. After giving details of the cost of producing an acre of cotton, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boyd</inline> setsout the return as follows - </para>

If those estimates are at all within reason there can be no possible justification for giving a bounty to such an industry, which yields double the profit to be gained from any cereal crop throughout Australia.

                    <quote>
                        <para>While a very general feeling prevailed that coffee planting was not likely - at any rate in the near future - to become an important Australian industry, Conference is of opinion that steps should be taken to encourage it. </para>
                        <para>It is undeniable that coffee of a good quality can be produced over large areas of the tropical and sub-tropical portions of the continent. The returns, however, from the plantations, are not at all alluring, while the consumption of coffee by the people of the Commonwealth is on a very slender scale. The experience of the chief coffee-producing countries of the world - and these are countries where an abundant supply of cheap labour is obtainable - does not afford much hope for the extensive and successful exploitation of the industry under Australian conditions. </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>It is generally understood that a large proportion of the crop was destroyed, so as to keep the production within the consumption - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is also an ominous fact that, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Trofeifpflamer</inline> - a recognised authority on all tropical matters - the planters of Brazil have not only destroyed large quantities of coffee berry because of the low prices prevailing, but have also pulled up the bushes growing on large areas of coffee plantation, and are using the land for other purposes. </para>
                        <para>The records available of Australia experience in coffee-growing are by no means encouraging. In the  year  1903 there were 318 acres under coffee in Queensland, the total yield being 83,632 lbs. Valuing this at9d. per lb. - which is allowed to be a fair average price - the return would not be more thanÂ£10 per acre. Considering the labour involved in clearing and preparing the land, in picking and cleaning for market, and bearing in mind the fact that the plantation does not become productive until it is four years old, this return appears totally inadequate. </para>
                        <para>With all these disadvantages, the fact remains that coffee of a good type can be produced over large portions of Northern Australia, and accordingly a bonus of1d. per pound for eight years is recommended. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I condemn this proposal with all the force at my command. The recommendation of the experts is absolutely inconsistent. Ex-Senator Staniforth Smith, in his report on Papua, Malay, and Java, states that coffee was planted there in considerable quantities, but that the result was absolute failure as regards its being a profitable industry. It has therefore been discontinued. I take it that the two most important questions before us within the near future are the development of our lands and the provision of naval defence. I intend to show shortly how our lands can be developed, and how this money, which it is proposed by this Bill to spend upon what I may call speculative industries, could be safely invested for the benefit of the whole of the people in that direction. In the second place, if the money was spent in encouraging shipbuilders by means of a subsidy for torpedo boats, submarines, or gun-boats, it would be infinitely better spent. We all recognise that for many years to come we shall be dependent upon the old country for our means of defence. But I think the time has arrived when this young Commonwealth should initiate a policy by . which in a small way we can show the mother country that we are doing all that lies in our power to help to defend ourselves, so that we may be able to stave off the dangers that are around us, and  that at any moment we may have to grapple with. The man who inaugurates an industry such as the building of torpedo boats, gunboats, and submarines will have to face a very heavy initial expense. He must obtain models and engage experts of experience from the old country, who will command large salaries. If we undertook to encourage an industry of that sort we should be acting well within our powers. It would be money well spent in the interests of the whole of the Commonwealth, arid not in partial or restricted areas, as will be the case under this Bill.' I shall refer now to what I consider the crux of the whole question of agricultural production. I wish to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> for the very able speech which he delivered, and for the valuable facts and figures which "he placed before us, and which he must have been at considerable pains to obtain,' in order to show the value that Australia would derive from the establishment of a Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau. The investment of money in that direction would yield ten times as much as these bounties will ever return. I earnestly ask the Minister to give full consideration to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> speech. Does he not realize that this sum of ^412,000 if spent in creating a Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau would be a far sounder and -better investment than if it were dissipated in giving . small sums to create . or develop industries which, to say the least, are largely of an uncertain character? It is impossible to ignore 'the great practical and developmental work that has followed the agricultural policy adopted in the United States, Canada, and Germany. Does not the Minister realize that the very industries selected in this Bill for initiation and development would have a greater probability of permanent success through the practical educational effect of the direction and guidance of experts? In America, experimental stations have been established in almost every State, and the highest professional expert knowledge is given to every inquirer in regard to suitability of lands, climate, and chemical1 adaptation of soils. I might refer to the good work that has already been done in some of the agricultural colleges in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Potts,</inline> the head-master of the Hawkesbury College, New South Wales, has rendered! inestimable service to that State. One cannot fail to be struck, when visiting that institution, with the advantages which will be derived by the young men who are being educated there in every; phase of agricultural work. Practically every one of those young men goes back .to his own district from the college as a missionary or teacher. When I visited the college, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Potts</inline> gave me practical illustrations of the results of his work. He told me of instance after instance of young men who had gone from the college, generally with very  little means, but had almost invariably succeeded through applying to the cultivation of the soil the technical knowledge they had gained of agricultural chemistry. As a matter of fact, practically every young man who leaves the Hawkesbury College is engaged almost immediately. Applications by the hundred are received for their services. </para>

Together they have demonstrated the utility of agricultural investigation and shown its practical importance to the farmer and the horticulturist.

The Department has become in effect a great experiment station, with probably the largest personnel and the most liberal appropriations of any institution of its kind. Congress has year by year increased its appropriations for investigations independent of its administrative work, and its organization has steadily developed along the lines of a central experiment station. But it has lacked Some of the characteristics of an American station in its equipment and methods of work, and these differences, together with the wide distribution of the stations throughout the country, have made the reciprocal relations of the Department and the stations the more important. </para>

                        <para>College instruction in agriculture is given in the colleges and universities receiving the benefits' of the Acts of Congress of 2nd July, 1S62, and 30th August, 1890, which are now in operation in all the States and Territories, except Alaska, Hawaii, and Porto Rico. The total number of these institutions is 65, of which 63 maintain courses of instruction in agriculture. In 21 States the agricultural colleges are departments of  the State universities. In 15 States and Territories separate institutions having courses in agriculture are maintained for the coloured race. All the agricultural colleges for white persons and several of those for negroes offer four years' courses in agriculture and its related sciences leading to bachelors' degrees, and many provide for graduate study. About forty-five of these institutions also provide special, short, and correspondence courses in the different branch of agriculture, including agronomy, horticulture, animal husbandry, poultry raising, cheese-making, dairying, sugar-making, rural engineering, farm mechanics, and other technical subjects. The officers of the agricultural colleges engage quite largely in conducting farmers' institutes and various other forms of college extension. The agricultural experiment stations with very few exceptions are departments of the agricultural colleges. The total number of persons engaged in the work of education and research in the land-grant colleges and the experiment stations in 1905 was 5,406; the number of students in these colleges, 59,812 ; the number of students (white) in the four-year college courses in agriculture, 2,638; in short and special courses, 3,885. There were also 1,624 students in agriculture in the separate institutions for negroes. With a few exceptions each of these colleges offer free tuition to residents in the States in which it is located. In the excepted cases scholarships are open to promising and energetic students; and, in all, opportunities are found for some to earn part of their expenses by their own labour. The expenses are from $125 to $300 for the school year. </para>

This union of effort and resources has been an economy of the departments' funds in carrying out its work, and has served to bring it closer to the farmers. For example, if in its sugar-beet work the department had been obliged to rely upon cooperation with farmers as a means of determining the range of adaptability of this crop and the practicability of its cultivation, vastly more time and expense would have been involved, and a large proportion of the trials would have been of no value owing to failure to follow directions. There would also have been an absence of constant trained observation upon the growing crops and of carefully weighed deductions at the close of the trial. As it is, the facts were secured mainly by the sending out of the beet seed and the extension of the franking privilege of the stations. The dissemination of alfalfa growing is also an illustration of successful co-operative effort in which the stations took a prominent part. Not only the adaptation of the crop to different localities had to be determined, but the best methods for putting in the seed and securing a stand, and these matters have been the subject of a large number of experiments at the stations. In arid farming the department and the stations have supplemented each other in an important way, for while the department has introduced many of the things which are proving successful in developing farming under restricted rainfall, the stations have exploited these crops in their regions, tested their adaptation, and even conducted special branch farms as a basis for their intelligent introduction. Such farms are maintained at State expense, for example, in North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Kansas, and Nebraska, and in several other States on a less formal basis. New plants and crops cannot be safely introduced from remote regions without preliminary experiments to show their value and to adapt them to the new locality ; and the experiment stations, which will be called upon sooner or later to advise farmers regarding their culture are the natural and most suitable agencies through which these preliminary trials can be made. Such trials, like practical experiments in other lines, have a value which does not attach to tests made by farmers unless the latter are closely supervized and controlled, for they are conducted under suitable conditions by trained observers competent to interpret the results. These things show the intimate relations which almost inevitably exist between the work of the departments and the stations. Consciously or unconsciously, these two agencies depend in a large degree upon each other for suggestions for materials and for results, and their activities are guided as a matter of course by these reciprocal relations. The advances in agricultural science are so complex as to their source that it is often difficult to assign the credit equitably, because there have been so many contributory causes, the real value of which is often difficult to measure. </para><para>On the question of co-operation in agricultural experiments this work states - </para><quote>
                        <para>For example, the appropriations for conducting experiments in animal breeding and feeding, for continuing the work in plant breeding and selection for testing plant introductions, for studying the influence of environment upon the competition of cereals and sugar and starch-producing plants, for determining the adaptability of grape stocks, for studying market conditions affecting the fruit and vegetable trade, for the improvement and extension of cereal production, for work upon grass and forage plants, for drainage and irrigation investigations, for work in connexion with the ravages of the cotton boll weevil, and for studies on human food and nutrition - all make special mention of the experiment stations as co-operating agencies. But the lines of work to which co-operation has extended are in fact far more diverse and comprehensive than indicated by the congressional acts. For several years past co-operation has embraced the culture of field crops and vegetables of various kinds, of special crops like cotton, rice, and sugar beets, the breeding and adaptation of cereals and other plants, the . control of insect pests and plant diseases of various crops, the water requirement of crops and .ils application, alkali reclamation, feeding and breeding experiments with animals, experiments in butter and cheese-making and curing, and various phases of arid farming. </para>

Careful methods of breeding were devised, and methods of judging cottons by score cards worked out, which have become standards for work in this field of investigation. The frequency of natural crossing in the field was studied so that different varieties might be grown without risk of mixing and deterioration. The correlation of characters, the laws governing the splitting up of hybrids, the form of plant and other important matters have been carefully studied.

The second important fact is that contrary to previous popular and scientific opinion, the same species of rubber does not extend throughout the Central American region. The reports which the Department have published have served as a warning to the public of the essentially uncertain character of a number of undertakings in rubber culture, and have undoubtedly saved to the American Republic millions of dollars. </para>

As I have been afraid that my voice would not hold out very long,' I have only quoted that information which I think most relevant to the question before the Senate. I have desired to show conclusively to the Minister of Home Affairs that, even in the interests of the industries which it is proposed to develop, the amount of the bounties could be better expended upon the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau similar to that of America. Take, for instance, the Northern Territory. An Agricultural Bureau could carry out there scientific and practical experiments which would place at the disposal of the Government facts which would enable them to offer bounties upon the production of those articles which, they would know beforehand were likely to be permanently successful. </para>

                        <para>The soils of the United States are considered as the greatest natural economic endowment of the American people, far exceeding in the value of their annual products all of the returns secured from mines and fisheries. It is the purpose of the Soil Survey work to outline the most economical method of securing' the utmost efficiency in the handling of these soils and in the production of food products from them. The questions involved concern not only the farmers themselves, but also every person interested in labour, commerce, manufacturing, or professional life. The problems are fundamental. The studies thus far made of the soils of the United States include the survey of 197 separate areas, located in 44 States and Territories. These surveys aggregate 63,621,120 acres, or 99,408 square miles. They have been so distributed as to constitute a study of soil conditions in all the different physical divisions of the United States and for all of the chief staple crops. In addition the special conditions favouring the production of special crops under intensive methods of  agriculture  have also been studied. Surveys of the tobacco soils of the United States have been made in sixteen different States. Their results show that the variety of leaf produced is controlled largely by the texture of the soil upon which the crop is raised. Thus, the heavy clay soils produce a thick, gummy leaf, while the lighter sands produce wrapper leaf and bright tobacco. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">I have tried to state from my point of view the advantages which will be derived from the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau. Should the Senate decline to accept the amendment, and read the Bill a second time, it is my intention to move the amendment which has been circulated. When white men, women and children are asked to live and work under severe tropical conditions, deprived of the privileges which are enjoyed by their fellow citizens in the Commonwealth, surely a great responsibility is placed upon the Commonwealth to see that their interests are carefully safeguarded by regulations, that their lives are made as comfortable as circumstances will permit, and especially that drinking facilities shall be restricted. I recognise that at the present time the States have jurisdiction in these matters. It must be remembered that in many districts there is no Arbitration Court or Wages Board. I decline to limit the wages to be paid according to the surrounding conditions, because it might result in initiating a white man's slave State. I do not believe that a tropical country is a white man's natural home. I consider that if white men settle in tropical districts the result will be a weak, degenerate race. I am aware that white men can work on the littoral of the Persian Gulf ; in fact, an honorable senator has told me that in his opinion there is no difference between a white man and a black man except as regards the colour of the skin. He has affirmed that wherever a white man can work there a black man can work, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> Apparently in his opinion a black man can work in the Arctic Zone equally as well as a white man. When we recollect that in England, which has offered a free home to the coloured races of the world, there are practically very few coloured men, we must realize that if a black man could work wherever a white man can work that country would have been inundated with black labour, especially when  we take into consideration the wages and conditions- obtaining there as compared with other countries. We may hold as a general principle that Australia should be preserved for white people, but I believe that there is an exception to every rule. Where we find that it is impossible for white people to live and work consistently with the social  conditions  which prevail in every other portion of Australia, we should be doing a real good to the white race by introducing into certain districts under strict regulations, British coloured races, I do not say in- large numbers, but in numbers applicable to the needs of those districts, and to be  employed  under conditions which would prevent free intercourse between the white and coloured people. Some time ago I expressed that opinion in the Senate, and notwithstanding all that has been said on the other side, I adhere to it. I hope that I am wrong in my view, and that we shall find that the white man can develop the resources of Northern Australia, and maintain that physique which we pride ourselves belongs to the English-speaking race. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- That may be so. Because white men can work' on the littoral of the Persian Gulf it does . not follow that it is their natural home. Would the honorable senator like to send his mother, his sisters, and brothers there to work in the rice fields, sugar plantations, or rubber plantations ? No, he would be the first to flinch from sending his kith, and kin into tropical regions. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> in his desire that this great continent shall be what we -hope it will' be - the future Britain of the Southern- Seas. As I listened to the honorable senator on Friday, my memory went back thirty or forty . years, and I thought I was listening to one of the great free-trade orators of that day. When I heard the honorable senator speak of the primary industries, and of this country becoming an . exporting country, I was reminded of the fact that we still had room for him  in the free-trade ranks. I shall be very glad to welcome my honorable friend into our ranks, and then I think he would have a brighter prospect of seeing his ideals realized. There is one thing, however, which we must never forget, and which General Booth in his statement has made clear, and that is that in commerci'al and industrial affairs no country has shown such an expansion as has Japan, and that China is following suit. If we imagine that we are going to become exporters, trading in the Southern Seas, we may reckon that there we shall find a competitor who, so far as I can judge, will be able to manufacture every article of commerce on much cheaper terms than we can do. Therefore it behoves us to put our house in order if we wish to realize our ideals. With all the earnestness I can command, I put it to honorable senators that, in order to attain our ends, no money could be more profitably spent in the interests of the Commonwealth than upon the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau on the lines, so far as it is practicable, of the great institution in the "United States. </para>

                        <para>.- It is a little disappointing to find that some honorable senators seem to take very little interest in this Bill. The measure appears to be one of the very greatest importance, for it asks us to spend Â£412,000 in fifteen years. I should say that it asks us to waste it, because I am certain' that a great part of the proposed expenditure will not achieve the object which we all have in view - that is, . to give bounties in order that some permanent industries may be firmly established on the soil. We all desire to stimulate production, to encourage land settlement, and to inaugurate a better system of cultivation. But the great difference between the two sides of the Senate is as to the means of doing this. Ministers appear to have chosen the wrong way. We must all have listened with very great pleasure -to the splendid speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> last Friday. He has put before us an alternative which we cannot pass by without very serious thought and discussion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> has also given us excellent arguments and valuable data about other countries, which ought to lead us, as I hope they will, to support most heartily <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl'</inline> s amendment. </para>

                            <para>- There will be plenty of opportunity, but I have had my notes prepared for the last three weeks, and I have been told by my party to keep the debate going. I want also to get rid of my speech. A great many people in this world, including politicians, seem to have a very exaggerated notion of the benefits which can be derived from an Act of Parliament. It is a common error to make, but I do not think I know of a case in which that error has been more emphatically committed than the present. It is all very well to see a fancied benefit1 or advantage, or to imagine that a certain slate of things will bring industrial prosperity. Some honorable senators at once jump to the conclusion that if they pass an Act of Parliament they will have secured the advantage and made certain of all the benefits. Evils arise which we desire to put down, and, in the same way, some honorable senators, in their innocence, think that they have only to pass an Act of Parliament 'and the evil will be removed. The teachings of all history, even examples at our very doors, go to show that an Act of Parliament sometimes accentuates an evil, and operates in the very reverse way to what those who passed it intended. When people imagine that by passing an Act of Parliament they will insure certain advantages and benefits, they generally leave out of their calculations the most important factor of human nature. Unless that factor is taken' into consideration Acts of Parliament are very often nothing but waste paper. </para>

It is not very wonderful that the bonus succeeded im that case, with all the facilities of land and labour present, and with all the other conditions 'favorable. How does the honorable senator get over the fact that a failure was made in every other item ? I have a list of the bonuses offered by Victoria. Their name is legion. I will read only a few of them. </para>

                            <para>- Some of the bonuses were paid. Here are some of the objects of the Victorian bonus system : " Growers of grapes, fruits and general vegetable products." That was a failure. Factories for fruit canning, fruit drying, dairying, raisin and currant making, &amp;c, was another class of items. These bonuses were also a failure, except as to the dairying. The raising of currants and raisins came later, after the expenditure and loss of thousands of pounds. The next item was " Importation of new varieties of seeds and plants." That. was a failure. Then there was " Technical education by the employment of experts to supply instruction." That is the only sensible proposal in the whole lot. Another was "Introduction of new machinery and appliances." That was a failure. " Publishing agricultural reports and illustrations in connexion with educational work " - that began to take on years afterwards. It was also proposed to give bonuses " For the encouraging of the planting and cultivation of forest trees." Every one of these was more or less a failure. The Act passed in New South Wales was also to a great extent *. failure. I am not sure that that Stat* r  ali  point to a single industry which has been permanently established on the soil by this bounty-fed system. </para>

                            <para>- Then, I ask, where is the demand or the reason for this Bill ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> said that it was not a party measure; but it is in this respect, that it is part of the policy of the Government, with their ultra system of protection, and their efforts to do something for everybody. They are not content with bringing in an enormous protective Tariff to benefit the manufacturers of Victoria and other States, but desire also to make a friend of the farmer, and show him that they are alive to his interests by giving this sum ofÂ£41  2,000.  It was originallyÂ£600,000. They want to make the farmer believe that the Government are his friends also. You cannot have a Tariff of ultra-protection on everything such as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne has proposed, and pretend for one moment that you are also the friend of the farmer. On the one hand, the Government are proposing a bounty on cotton. Machines which cost about  , Â£2,000  each are required to gin the cotton, but in the Tariff a duty of from  30  to  35  per cent. is imposed on all machinery. Although this may not be a party question in one sense, still it is part of the rotten policy of the Government. It is impossible to give these bounties and to expect the industries to succeed as they ought to, if by means of the Tariff an enormous duty is placed on machinery, which will absolutely penalize the man who desires to buy a machine in order to earn the bounty which the Government ask and expect him to earn. When a similar Bill was before the Senate last year I succeeded by a majority of only one vote in having it laid aside. I pointed out then that the report of the experts, as laid before us, was a most impracticable document. It gave no information to guide us, nor did it attempt to prove, with regard to a single item, that a permanent industry would be the result of the giving of a bounty. Since then the Minister of Home Affairs has, I understand, obtained further reports from the experts. Those are before us, but they seem to be little better than the previous one. I have the greatest respect for experts. If one of them were in the gallery, I should try to obtain from him all the information possible. But while they may be very good at theory, and have a perfect knowledge of their sciences, they do not seem to have a particle of practical ability among them. I read with astonishment the report upon which the Minister of Home Affairs has the temerity to ask us to spend this  , Â£412,000.  Those experts have brought before us a lot of information, which, however, is not stated in very logical sequence. They appear, after giving the evidence, to wind up in every instance with a recommendation that such and such a product ought to be encouraged, as it will be of the greatest use to the Commonwealth, and they, therefore, recommend a bounty. But in almost every instance their recommendation is absolutely contradicted by the evidence which they have supplied. They do not appear to have exercised the slightest judicial skill or to have looked at the question from the point of view of practical agriculturists. They do not seem to have the slightest idea of what a farmer's life is, or what it means for a man to risk his capital in trying to grow new products or in seeing that the soil is fit for them. They have given no evidence whatever as to whether white labour can do the work or not. They have absolutely shirked the whole labour question. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. I am not going to touch the labour question. I shall suppose that we are all going to be loyal to the policy of a White Australia. But that is all the more reason why these men ought to have shown that the industries can be carried on with white labour. We have our own little Territory of Papua, with its half million of natives. If rubber is to be grown there, or half the products that are mentioned in their report, it was their duty to show that, under a White Australia policy practical farmers in Australia could, with the white labour at their disposal, or with any white labour that might be introduced, cultivate these products and establish permanent industries in face of such competition. What is the good of their report unless they show that? </para>

                        <para>The members agree that the prospects of the industry in Australia are not specially promising.... During the American civil war the commodity was produced in Queensland, Western Australia, and New South Wales, but judging by the rapid abandonment of the industry, it did not prove as lucrative as other crops.... We find that in the year 1882 - and under the stimulus of a bounty and high prices - 717 acres of. cotton were planted in Queensland, the yield being 212,370 lbs. of ginned cotton, or a return, at ordinary market price of Â£8 per acre, which allowing for the work involved in growing and marketing the produce, leaves a very slender margin for the producer.... Except for the fact that cotton seed has recently become valuable because of the oil that can be extracted from it, and the cake which can be manufactured, from the residues, the cotton industry would be utterly without hope in Australia.... With the resumption of cotton cultivation in the United States at the close of the war, and the abrogation of the bonus, the industry was practically abandoned. </para>
                        <para>The bonus offered wasÂ£5,000 for the first 5,000 yards of cotton goods, but the manufacturing company ceased business very soon after the bonus had been paid over. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is the whole of their testimony. and it is absolutely against any hope of the establishment of a permanent cotton industry in the Commonwealth, and yet the experts wind up by recommending a bounty. During the debate on the" Desert Railway," one honorable senator was " hauled over the coals " because he said that a certain report was made to order. But the honorable senator used only a common phrase to describe what occurs when a number of experts are asked to advise upon a certain course, and are aware that the person who asks them wishes them to advise in a particular way. In this case the experts were aware that it was a part of the policy of the great Deakin-Lyne Government to bolster up agriculture. They knew that the Bounties Bill of last session had been laid aside for lack of expert information, and they have given the best report they could, knowing that a favorable report was expected of them. I invite honorable senators to consider the way in which they have allowed their judicial judgment to be absolutely overriden by the very evidence they put before us in their report. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> to say of what use the evidence submitted by the experts is to support a proposal for a bounty on cotton. They have pointed out that in the past such a bounty has not resulted in the establishment of the industry, that those who manufactured a certain quantity of cotton to enable them to secure the bounty gave up the manufacture as soon as they had secured the bounty, and they go on to say that the chances of the success of the industry in Australia are very doubtful. </para>

                        <para>While a very general feeling prevailed that coffee planting was not likely - at any rate in the near future - to become an important Australian industry, the Conference is of opinion that steps should be taken to encourage it. </para>
                        <para>It is undeniable that coffee of a good quality can be produced over large areas of the tropical and sub-tropical portions of the continent. The returns, however, from the plantations, are not at all alluring, while the consumption of coffee by the people of the Commonwealth is on a very slender scale. The experience of the chief coffee-producing countries of the world - and these are countries where an abundant supply of cheap labour is obtainable - does not afford much hope for the extensive and successful exploitation of the industry under Australian conditions. </para>

                            <para>- It is impossible to conceive that Ministers can have considered the financial position of the Common wealth in submitting this Bill. To go back to the point I raised a little while ago, I repeat that the States have not asked for this Bill through their Agricultural Departments. I should like to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether he does not think we should pause before- enacting further legislation in connexion with which we shall be overlapping the work of the States Governments? It is perfectly true that the granting of bounties rests with us, but we have not a single agricultural expert in the service of the Commonwealth to advise us,, and we must work the whole bounty system through the Agricultural Departments of the States. We shall be dependent on them for the carrying out of the provisions of this measure, and it does not seem to me that there is a practical agriculturist in any of the States Departments. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that I should enjoy a chat with any one of them very much, and might obtain from him a great deal of useful information, but the Minister will agree that before the Committee stage on this Bill is completed it will be necessary to prove that, there is some reasonable hope that the granting of these bounties will lead to the establishment of some permanent industry. Are we to understand that if that proof is not forthcoming our honorable friends opposite will be prepared to support this Bill blindly? In all the circumstances, would it not be better that we should lay this Bill aside and get on with our legitimate work ? Is it not better that we should ask ourselves what we intend to do to provide for an adequate system of defence, for old-age pensions, and other things for which people are calling out, and set aside a measure for which there has been no demand whatever? </para>

But from an article which I cut from one of the Melbourne newspapers referring to the first official forecast of the (Indian jute crop, it appears that there are 3,855,500 acres under jute in India, or just about 1,000,000 acres more than the figures supplied by the experts. </para>

                            <para>- I should like further to point out that the experts quote the price of jute at <inline font-style="italic">Â£26</inline> 10s. per ton, whilst in the article to which I have referred it is stated that a few years back, in 1897, the price was <inline font-style="italic">Â£9</inline> 10s. per ton. Considering the enormous increase in the area of land devoted to the cultivation of jute, can any one foretell what the price is going to be, and will any one say that it is likely to be anything like the figure quoted by the experts? I should like them to tell us whether they have recommended the proposed bounty on jute on the assumption that the price is <inline font-style="italic">Â£26</inline> 10s. per ton, <inline font-style="italic">Â£9</inline> 10s. per ton, or Â£15 per ton. </para>

                        <para>Jute is cultivated in practically only one part of India, namely, Bengal and Eastern Bengal, the soil, climate, and supply of labour being especially suitable for the crop. A small quantity is grown in Madras, but the plant is not identical. Attempts  have been made for many years past to grow jute in other tropical countries, but with little or no practical result so far. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is a warning which the experts have not given us, and in my opinion it is quite sufficient to dispose of this item. Over 3,800,000 acres are under cultivation for jute in the only part of that country where its production is attempted. It requires a particular kind of soil, a suitable climate, and cheap labour. This brings me to another practical point. I suggest to the Minister in charge of the Bill that it would be right to insert a clause to the following effect. I take it that the regulations under the measure would provide the conditions under which claimants for bounties must make application, but I doubt whether the regulations will go far enough. The Bill gives the Minister power to prescribe the minimum quantity of goods to be produced, the proportion in which, the bounty shall be payable to claimants, the manner in which the market value is to be determined, and the time within which, after the production of the raw material, the production of goods in respect of which bounty is claimed shall be completed. I think we ought also to provide that every claimant of the bounty shall give particulars, to be examined by experts, showing where he is going to cultivate, and what land he has, in order that the experts may ascertain whether the land is suitable. He should state what labour he intends to employ, whether he will employ white men, imported Italians, two or three natives, or half-a-dozen Chinamen ; what capital he has to spend on his land, and what outlay he will be able to sustain every year. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it would be. Cannot <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> devise a clause which would prevent these bounties being as great a failure as others have been in the past? We ought to learn from experience, and make this a more perfect Bill than others have been. When bounties were given for the planting of vines in Victoria, all kinds of people planted. Many did not even take the trouble to cultivate marketable vines. They did not take the trouble to ascertain from practical men what were the right stocks to plant. We do not want that sort of thing to happen under this Bill. If my honorable friend does not introduce such a clause as I have indicated, I shall, in Committee, take steps to provide that every applicant for a bounty shall give evidence of his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> We have a right to expect that applicants shall enable our experts to form a judgment as to whether they are likely to succeed. We are dealing with new . products, many of them connected with tropical agriculture. Surely a man who is going to claim money from the rest of the taxpayers should satisfy us that he has a reasonable hope of establishing a permanent industry. Such a clause might also be useful in preventing men from wasting their money, and a warning to others to devote their capital and attention to something which they understand, and to leave tropical agriculture alone. The Minister should be careful to provide that some of the benefits obtainable under this Bill shall go to the Northern Territory. What hope is there of farmers there being able to take advantage of the measure if the whole of the bounties are to be appropriated before they get a chance?. We cannot settle the question of taking over the Northern Territory this year. Would it not be wise to keep back  Â£50,000  or  Â£100,000  of this vote for the purpose of establishing various branches of tropical agriculture there? I admit that. there are no farmers there now, but Judge Herbert has suggested that many tropical products can be grown under a system of mixed farming. If a man is engaged in cattle and horse breeding at which he makes a living, he can slip in coffee or tobacco or jute, and thereby increase his income. In Tasmania the most successful farmers are the mixed farmers. A man has a few acres of orchard, and  a  larger area under cereals, in addition to which he goes in for pigs or dairying. If a man has only one crop, he stands  a  great chance of being ruined in a bad season. Therefore, Judge Herbert suggests, and, I think, rightly, that if we want to try' the experiment of producing tropical crops in the Northern </para>

                            <para>- By the time practical farmers have established themselves  in the Northern Territory the bounties will have been absorbed by persons in other parts ' of the Continent. If we are to spend this enormous sum in bounties, let us keep part of it back for use in the Northern Territory. With regard to the question of rubber, I read some time ago in the newspapers that Â£10,000. had been subscribed in Victoria to develop the rubber industry in Papua. We all know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Staniforth</inline> Smith has given great attention to this subject. What are we going to do in regard to rubber production in our Possession? Would it not be wise to wait and see how the industry progresses in Papua ? We have there some of the best soil in the world, a suitable climate, and plenty of labour. Would it not be well to give a bounty to those who are trying to produce rubber there? But we are leaving Papua out of consideration, and giving a big bounty to people in Australia to grow rubber. If the industry can be made a success in Papua, so much the better. If an enormous income can be derived from the production and export of rubber from that country, what a grand thing it will be. But what is the use of rushing this proposal forward when experiments are being made .under favorable circumstances in our own territory? Can any one suppose that there is a better chance of rubber production being carried on in Australia than in Papua? The conditions are all in favour of Papua. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> in his long and useful speech, has pointed out that we can spend our money in much more useful ways than bv giving bounties as proposed in the schedule to this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> speech on Friday ought to-be studied with attention. Much useful information may be derived from it. Would it not be well to devote the money to purposes of agricultural education rather than dole it out as is here proposed? Suppose we were to devote .Â£500,000 during the next fifteen years to the purposes of ah agricultural college as good as any in the world, barring neither America nor </para>

                    <para class="block">Java. Suppose we engaged the best experts, and encouraged scientific experiments in that direction. I venture to say that Â£500,000 spent in that way would give an infinitely better return than the same sum paid in bounties to men growing  things haphazard, without knowing whether they were going to establish a permanent industry or not. Last year I asked the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether the Prime Minister had communicated with the British Cotton-growing Association in regard to employing capital in Australia. I inquired whether it was intended to suggest that cotton-growing experiments might be conducted in the Northern Territory or Queensland, with the consent of the States. I suggested that we might offer the association our help in making the experiment a success. The reply which I received, was that the Prime Minister had not communicated with the British Cotton-growing Association, but would do so. The matter seems to have been forgotten. Here is an association of some of the richest men in the world, formed in Great Britain four or five years ago, for the object of making inquiries in all parts of the British Empire in regard to the growth of cotton, and establishing it as a British industry, so that the consumer might be independent of supplies from America, where there are trusts and rings which put up the price of cotton. Why should we not have communicated with this association? We should have said to them, " You put up the money, and we will find the land; we will do anything to help you within reasonable limits, provided you show that cotton can be cultivated here." </para>

                            <para>- The Commonwealth could have taken steps, with the consent of the States. The Prime Minister is interfering With the business .of the States in trying to induce immigration to Australia. He is alleging that the States do not move quickly enough, whereas we all know that whatever <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> may think of inducing immigrants to come to Australia, the whole of the Labour Party is against it. He would have done the right thing in inducing the British Cotton-growing Association to spend some of their capital here, communicating with the Premiers of the States, and asking them whether they  would not provide * 10,000 acres of land which the association could lease, or, if it preferred, purchase on fair terms. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> made two or three very good points. For instance, he showed that the grant of the bounties will not help the small men. They will benefit, not the small farmers, but the rich agriculturalists or the men with capital who can club together, take up land, buy machinery, and clear and plant the land with a view to getting the bounty offered upon the production of the article which they are growing, making their calculations beforehand and knowing perfectly well that the bounty, added to the value of the product, will defray all their expenses and leave them a fair interest on their outlay. Rich men will benefit from the enactment of the Bill, but we shall all be sufferers, because I do not think a case can be made out that the grant of a bounty is likely to lead to the establishment of a permanent industry. In regard to the bounty offered upon the production of fibre, I propose to quote a passage from a letter by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> McNaught in to-day's newspaper. To some persons it may appear a very simple thing to grow flax and hemp, particularly New Zealand flax, but what does this correspondent point out in his letter ?

                            <para>- Quite so. We all know that New Zealand has a soil which is as rich as any soil in the world, and that it has a suitable climate and magnificent rainfall. Concerning the item of fibre, more inquiries ought to be made. We ought to get some evidence from New Zealand. Surely it would be worth while to ascertain by telegram how long it has taken to rear the industry in that country, how it was started, and how much money was expended in that direction. No information of that kind is furnished in the report of the experts. In my opinion, it is a very disappointing document. I hope that the amendment will be carried, but if it is not carried, and the Bill is read a second time, I shall do all I possibly can to get the total amount of the bounties reduced. I am obliged to you, sir, for pointing out to me that, according to a standing order, it is irregular to instruct a Committee of the Whole to do anything which otherwise it has the power to do, and that, therefore, my contingent amendment for an instruction to the Committee on the Bill to reduce the total amount of the bounty by Â£200,000 is not in order. I can see now that the Committee will have the power, if it thinks fit, to reduce the amount from Â£412,500 to Â£212,500. If I can satisfy honorable senators that, having regard to our financial position, or even if our finances were more flourishing than they are, it is too much money to spend under the authority of one Bill, leaving nothing for the development of the Northern Territory, then it will be for the Minister to bring down an amended schedule and apply the reduced amount to the payment of bounties upon the production of such articles as he thinks there is a reasonable hope of growing profitably and permanently. </para>

I admit that I do not know much about what articles will grow in tropical countries. But I have always held the opinion that if by the expenditure of a small sum a man can make two blades of grass grow where formerly only one blade .grew he is a benefactor to his country. It is not my intention to say much in reference to the Bill as it stands. But as a  protectionist, and also as a farmer of over forty years' standing, who gave a pledge  to the electors that the interests of the primary producer would1 always have his ".first consideration here, I was rather amused when I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> quoting so much in reference to the farming community and their interests. Perhaps it was done with a nice motive. When gentlemen are electioneering sometimes they go out of their way in that regard. I am also very pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> stated the area of land throughout the Commonwealth, and gave certain information with reference to other countries. But in that respect I do not propose to follow his example, or  that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> I propose to speak as a farmer, and to touch upon one question which so far has not been referred to. If there is a' doubt let us take advantage of it. If there is one industry more than another which we are assured we can assist without running the chance of losing your money, that is the safest industry for us to encourage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> referred to the great progress which is being made throughout the Commonwealth, but I would  remind him that even in the State which he so ably represents the agricultural interest is on the wane, as I shall prove by reading an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of last week, and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will listen to it, because I presume that it emanates from an expert - </para>

                        <para>Victorian Statist Drake has just issued his -wheat-area statistics for 1907-8. He shows that there is an actual shrinkage in the area tinder crop in Victoria this year compared with last year - 2,263,301 acres last year; 2,133,000 acres this year. In the whole of the Western District there is only one county - Ripon - with enough land, under crop to be worth including in the detailed statistics; and even Ripon is down for a miserable 69,800 acres, which is  actually  about 3,000 acres less than it was the previous year. Evidently, in the absence of a progressive land-tax, the absurd prices demanded - whether you rent land or buy it - have driven men out of the State. They have got sick of working for the landlord and the mortgagees. </para>

I hold in my hand a statement which was made two years ago by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, when he was dealing with a Bill for the compulsory re-purchase of land for closer settlement, to place population on the soil. If I can show by his statement that under a certain rule or mismanagement South Australia had lost thousands of its population, then I shall move an amendment to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> amendment for the purpose of bringing about a remedy which will cure the difficulty.

                        <para>The Government did not like the word compulsorily, but at the same time it was found that it was a choice between securing the estates or allowing the people to continue to leave the State. The population was going faster and faster, and would continue to go unless they secured land for the people. They had in these large estates about 1,700,000 acres of good land inside the line of rainfall, and about two-thirds of it was arable land, well fitted for the purpose of Closer Settlement. It was chiefly alongside the railway lines, and if they could utilize that land they would improve the traffic on the railways. Someone had stated that people were not leaving the State, but figures supplied by the Statistical Department showed that the population of South Australia in 1S85 was 307,433. During the ten years ended December 31, 1894, it increased to 343,237, the actual increase being only 35,804. The natural increase, the excess of births over deaths, for the same period was 67,895, so that during the ten years they lost 32,091 by emigration. On January 1, 1895, the population, was 343,237. During the ten years ended December 31, 1904, it increased to 368,652, the actual increase being only 25,417. The natural increase, the excess of births over deaths, during the same period was 52,561, so that during the 10 years they lost' 27,144 by emigration. That directly contradicted the people who said that the population was not going away. During the 20 years they had lost about 60,000 of the population, and now, instead of the population being 437,000, which it would have been, had they retained the natural increase, it was 368,000. It was a great reflection on a young country when it could not retain its natural increase. </para>

                            <para>- A lot of them have gone to the West and taken up land there. In the face of those facts, this is a problem that we might well look to. I am not one to interfere with State rights any more than I possibly can, but the question before us is how to bring about a remedy. I have quoted the case of an area of  1,700,000  acres, most of it splendid agricultural land, with railways running through it, and with an excellent rainfall, as I may tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> As honorable senators know, the squatters when they have the opportunity, pick the eyes out of the country. With railways running through the land, what a good thing it would'be if it were only possible to repurchase it and let the people settle upon it as they wish to do. The same thing obtains in that State as in Victoria. If a few blocks of land are offered by the Land Board,  400  or  500  people may apply for them. If we want to increase our population we must open up these lands. I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> to listen to what happened with regard to the Yongala estate, although I have quoted it in the Senate before. </para>

                            <para>- I want to make sure of the honorable senator, because he is a little shaky. When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCulloch</inline> died, South Australia took the opportunity of securing a grand estate of about  60,000  acres, two-thirds of which, at least, was really good agricultural land. It' carried very little population while held by one family. When people go in only for wool growing, there are very few men employed once the fences are up, except a.t shearing time. Now, according to the latest figures, as shown by parliamentary reports, there are  127  families settled on the estate. A family is generally taken to represent five. Consequently, if  127  farms are being cultivated, you get a fine settlement, reckoning five to each family. Practical men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will recognise that all the townships around such a settlement are benefited. The Yongala estate was no exception to that rule. Jamestown, Yongala, and other townships around benefited greatly. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler,</inline> the conservative ex-Premier of South Australia, admitted that the Yongala settlement had been a great success, and that the farmers had done well, not only for themselves, but for the Government. They had spent a good deal of money in building houses for themselves, and had reaped really good crops. The result was that they had paid their rents up to date and, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler</inline> added, the extra amount derived from the carriage of wheat by the railway that ran alongside the estate was equal to the amount the Government had to borrow to repurchase the estate. I think I am making out a good case. I hope I shall have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson's</inline> support when I move an amendment in this direction. It is patent to every one that good must ensue when large estates are cut up into holdings of  400  or  500  acres. My experience as a farmer is that if you have  500  acres of good quality land with a good rainfall, if your head is on the right way and you are not afraid of work, y ou can make a good living out of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and other speakers explained their idea of education for the farmer. At Roseworthy, in South Australia, we have had an agricultural college established for a long time. On one occasion I was invited by the Government to act as an examiner of the- toys of the college in practical agriculture. The college has done a great deal of good. Boys belonging not only to South Australia, but to other States, are being trained there, and are given practical experience in a better system of farming. The system of farming in South Australia has been so greatly improved during the last ten years that the average of the crops within Goyder's line of rainfall has been increased by one-third. When I move my amendment, I hope I shall have the support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> also. Before concluding, I wish to refer to the State of Victoria. Since I have been travelling between Adelaide and Melbourne, although most of the journey has been in the dark, and I have not been able to see so much of the land as I would like, I have noticed that a great deal of it is held by a few men. I hope when I have finished my speech that honorable senators who differ from me will attempt to show wherein they think I am wrong.  I have advocated the cutting up of large estates in South Australia, and I thoroughly believe in that policy, whether it is called Socialism or anything else. At one time the Parliament of South Australia granted a bounty on butter, and it was said to be attended with great success. In that State, we have established an export depot, and this year it is expected that over 200,000 lambs will be frozen there for export to England. The Government does the killing, freezing, and marketing, and they pay the farmers and squatters who supply the lambs every farthing to which they are entitled, deducting only actual expenses. I presume that those engaged in the dairying industry in South Australia had been reading about the butter business in Victoria, because there was a suspicion amongst them that they were not- being fairly treated by the middleman. Some of the farmers believed that when they sent their cream to the factories, they did not get a square deal. I do not know whether they were justified in the view they held, but a Royal Com-  mission was appointed to make inquiries on the subject. In the meantime, however, the Government of the State took action which some people would describe as Socialism. We have a Labour Premier in South Australia, and the State Govern-' ment there established a Government butter factory. They received the farmers' cream at the factory, and I understand that farmers who have sent their cream to the Government factory have had no occasion to complain. I can tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that if the people of his State took up a little of this Socialism in an earnest spirit much good would follow to the primary producers . I said I would refer to the position in Victoria in connexion with the occupation of land.- I was disappointed to find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> made no reference to the subject. I find that 8 per cent, of the occupiers of land in Victoria own 53 per cent, of the alienated lands. Of a total of 52,987 land-holders, 4,498 hold more land than is held by all the rest put together; 550 families or corporations own one-half of the alienated land in Victoria; 116 individuals, families, or corporations own one-fourth of the alienated land of the State. . I find also that in 1896 the Government Statistician said that in eight years cultivation had considerably decreased. I have referred already to what has been done at Yongala, where they have land that is not nearly so good as the land in Victoria!, where millions of acres are held by a comparatively few persons. The position here is that there are millions of acres of good land practically unutilized. I do not care to exaggerate in any calculation I make, and I should not like to say how many families might be settled upon that land. Four or five hundred acres of good land should keep a family of five. In Victoria, the rainfall is equal, and in many parts greater, than the rainfall in South Australia, and if we can do what I have said we can in South Australia - and I make the statement as a practical man - why should not the same be done in Victoria? This leads me to' the amendment I wish to move in order to test the opinion of some of our conservative friends, and to make them prove by their votes whether they are the farmers' friends or not. I plead here on behalf of 'the class to which I belong. I know their hardships, and I know how some of them have been driven from South Australia. I am here to fight their battles although I am a member of the united Labour Party. I put the case before honorable senators, and I challenge contradiction of any of the statements I have made. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is now ready to hear the amendment I desire to move upon his own, so that we may be able to pull together to bring about the desired object of assisting the primary producers, enabling them to get -the land they require, and enabling our young people to get married and settle down in life, and  obey the first commandment that God gave to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. I propose to move as an amendment. upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> amendment - </para>

I recognise the delicacy of the matter to which I wish to direct attention, and I wish it to be thoroughly understood that there is on my part no ill-will towards any man, party, or association in connexion with the matter.. My only desire is that, should it be clearly shown that a wrong has been done which is punishable under the Electoral Act, the matter shall be taken into consideration at once. The article to which I refer is practically a synopsis of correspondence. It is printed under the headings " Corio Election Episode, Interesting Correspondence."

This the Queenscliff Lodge refused to follow, and several members of the two other lodges in the Corio constituency refused to vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crouch.</inline> Amongst those who had known <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crouch</inline> for several years as a personal friend and political supporter was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> N.

I believe it is connected with election matters, but as I did not lay the charge, nor did it emanate from me, I have no authority more than to lay same before you, and I trust you will be there, so that the lodge may have both sides to deal with. Note- The meeting date is the ordinary. Could not get the hall on the special night fixed, so called committee to deal with the dates. </para>

                        <para>. - I am. astonished that the Minister has made no reply to the serious matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> has brought before the Senate. That it is serious, I do not think any honorable senator will question. <inline font-style="italic">Prima facieit</inline> appears to be a case of gross interference with the right of citizens of the Commonwealth to exercise the franchise which the Constitution has conferred upon them. I do not think that any action which could be taken to counteract such conduct on the part of individuals or associations could be too drastic. An honorable senator near me observes that the statement made is merely <inline font-style="italic">exparte.</inline> No one wishes to take action upon any <inline font-style="italic">exparte</inline> statement. But, on the face of it, a statement of that character, published in an independent newspaper, and giving all the facts in the form of correspondence, at least calls for inquiry. We have a right to expect from  the Minister that he will promise that a searching inquiry shall be made into the whole of the circumstances, and that action shall betaken to prevent such tactics being resorted to at any election in the future. We know that, as a matter of fact, the religious association in question - the Loyal Orange Lodge - has, throughout Australia, taken a very active part in Federal politics. It is a matter for sincere and profound regret that an association of any kind whatever, belonging to any section of the Christian religion, -should try to stir up bitterness and bigotry in the political life of this young country. Speaking as a Protestant, I know that the action of the Loyal Orange Lodge throughout Australia has been enough to make anybody feel ashamed to belong to a denomination which would harbor such persons. Instead of allowing the various Christian sects to live in harmony, they are trying to stir up bigotry of all kinds, and to make religion subservient to the basest political purposes. I refuse to believe that there is any warranty in the Christian religion for such a course of conduct. It is time that the Government did take some drastic action to prevent politics from being degraded by the introduction of sectarian bitterness and bigotry, as. has been done in the instance mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- I hold that the introduction of religious bigotry into politics degrades politics, and also religion. It is all very fine for honorable senators who are benefited by these religious organizations to stand up in defence of them, but when we have cited .a specific case where a man has been pursued with the utmost rigour, and punished because he has dared to exercise the franchise which the Constitution has conferred upon him, I think it is time for the Parliament to interfere, and to say that no such interference with his right as a citizen shall be tolerated. The matter is a very serious one to me, as a member of the denomination for which this bigoted organization claims sometimes to be the mouth-piece - a claim which I entirely repudiate - and it, therefore, interests me personally. I want the denomination to which I belong to keep its hands clean, and not to be mixed up in disgraceful affairs of that sort. </para>

                        <para>.- At the beginning of his speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> said that he wished particularly to bring a matter under the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs. I listened carefully to him, and I think that, after reading- the extract from the newspaper, he quoted a  provision in. the Electoral Act, and concluded by stating that, having brought the matter under the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs, he desired that attention  should be given to it. I did not understand the honorable senator to put any question to me, or to ask me to express an opinion on the case. Other matters might lie, -and were, raised on my honorable colleague's motion of adjournment, and if my honorable colleague had spoken to the motion he would have closed debate, hut he would have at the same time Stated that the representations made by the honorable senator would receive the careful consideration of the Government, .that whatever inquiries were necessary would be made, and that the matter would be referred in the ordinary course for advice. No Minister is expected, as honorable senators know, to give legal, advice on any question which is raised here, except perhaps in respect of a Bill which he is piloting through the Chamber. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that I listened to him, and heard for the first time the circumstances which he read from a Geelong newspaper of to-day. I also noted his reference to the Electoral Act, and I promise him that proper inquiry will be made into the circumstances. </para>
