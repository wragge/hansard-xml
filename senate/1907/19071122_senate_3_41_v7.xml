                        <para>- The Government has a special concession, and is charged is. per word in respect of the press messages which I referred to last night and which are circulated amongst some of the newspapers in the United Kingdom. The rate for ordinary Government messages is is 7&#189;d. per word, and, of course, the rate to the public is 3s. per word. I am given to understand that the charge of is per word to the Government barely covers the expenses. </para>

It supplied me with some information, with which the honorable senator was furnished, but, as he desired that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Murray</inline> should be acquainted with the nature of the specific charges made against her, I asked the Department for further information. It has now supplied me with a memorandum . from which it appears that a letter had been written by a resident in Tasmania.  with regard to the case, and forwarded  to  the Department through a member of the other House. The memorandum reads as follows - </para>

He desires to know &#34;upon how many occasions&#34; the Orient Steam Navigation Company have been late in delivering the mails, and makes no reference to any particular period. If he will fix upon a date to which he wishes the Department to go back, it will considerably facilitate the getting of the information. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I desire to mention a matter which I admit is not of much consequence now. I am inclined to think that yesterday we rather departed from our practice with reference to the suspension of the Standing Orders. They were suspended to facilitate the speedy passage of the Supply Bill. The question I desire to ask you, sir, is whether notice was taken of the fact that something more was done than to suspend the Standing Orders. The resolutions which are called Sessional Orders were suspended. So far as my recollection goes, that is a new practice, and I only make these remarks in the hope that during the adjournment you may give some consideration to the matter. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday the Senate determined to suspend so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent the passage of the Supply Bill through, all its stages without delay. The Sessional Orders provide that Government business shall take precedence at certain times, and private business at other times &#34;unless otherwise ordered.&#34; The suspension of the Standing Orders was made with the intention of enabling the Supply Bill to go through all its stages irrespective of other  business, and I construed that as an expression of the will of the House that the. Sessional Orders should not interfere with the consideration of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>In the opinion of the Postmaster-General, there are many places where office&#39;s can be closed at 6 p.m. without any serious inconvenience, and only in such cases will offices be closed at that hour. In several States a large proportion of the Post Offices are already closed at 6 o&#39;clock, and it is considered desirable, with a view to reduce to reasonable limits the working hours of the staffs, to extend this arrangement wherever practicable. Where mails arrive after 6 p.m. and up to 8 p.m., arrangements will be made, as at present, for the delivery of correspondence, but it is thought unnecessary to keep offices open continuously after 6 p.m. merely for the purpose of waiting for these mails and transacting an infinitesimal amount of business. </para>

                    <para>. - As Honorable senators will remember, the Bounties Bill was before the Senate for a considerable portion of this session. In Committee,  a majority of honorable members decided to strike out of the schedule of items mohair, copra, and tobacco leaf. Having struck out those items, it was necessary to make in the body of the Bill, and in the second schedule, certain consequential amendments. The message now received from the House of Representatives, lengthy though it is, indicates merely that another place agrees to the amendment striking out mohair, but does not agree to the amendments made by the Senate striking out copra and tobacco leaf, or to the  amendment with regard to the allocation of the bounty proposed in respect of combed wool or tops. It was provided in -the Bill as originally introduced that on combed wool or tops exported, for two years, commencing from the 1st . January, 1908, a bounty should be paid at the rate of 1&#189;d. per lb., and thereafter for three years at ad. per lb. The Senate amended that provision on the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> and the House of Representatives, after considering the amendment, has sent back the Bill with a modification . of the amendment, the object of which is to provide that in the last year the bounty payable shall be at the rate of id. instead of &#163;d. per lb. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> amendment provided for a sliding scale from 1&#189;d. to id., and then Jd. per lb. All, therefore, that the Senate is asked to do by another place is to restore the items copra and tobacco leaf to the schedule of products on which bounty shall be payable, and to agree to their modification of the Senate&#39;s amendment in regard to combed wool or tops. The other amendments to which the Senate is asked to agree are simply consequential amendments in the second schedule and the second clause. As some of the amendments occur in the body of the Bill, and can only be dealt with after we have disposed of those in the. schedule, I move - </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but if copra is not likely to be produced to commercial advantage in the Commonwealth, the bounty provision will probably not be drawn upon. We have in the Commonwealth land and climatic conditions that  warrant us in believing that we can grow copra with a fair degree of commercial profit, and, therefore, we should include it in a general system of bounties for the stimulation of tropical productions. Copra is of great commercial value&#39; throughout the world. It is very largely used in certain manufactures, and markets for it may be found, not only in the Commonwealth; but abroad. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> and others may say that,  as it can &#39; be produced more cheaply elsewhere, we&#39; could be&#39; under-sold in the world&#39;s markets ; but all .that the Government ask is that&#39; a provision shall- bc made in&#34; this schedule in the nature of a promise to those who can &#39;grow copra in the. Com.monwealth under the conditions&#39; laid- down in the Bill, in commercial quantities, and of marketable value, :that they.- will receive a bounty at the rate provided if - the article is grown during the period, specified. -&#39;If the circumstances are ;such as &#39;not&#39;, to induce persons to undertake, the cultivation of copra, we are not incurring any financial responsibility by- offering the bounty, but if,, on the other hand, some find that they can undertake its- cultivation,  even  though -the prospects are not very alluring -to the eyes of others, they should be compensated  equally with those who- pioneer in the Commonwealth other important industries for which provision -is made in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to discuss the merits or otherwise of the proposed bounty for copra.- The matter was previously debated at considerable length, and all&#34; the reasons for and against it were freely advanced and considered. The Senate twice arrived at a&#39; decision regarding the item. I admit that on the first occasion&#39; it was struck out on an equality of votes, but, subsequently, in a larger House, a motion for recommittal with regard to copra was negatived by the substantial majority of  18  to  12.  Another place has furnished us with scanty reasons for asking us to reverse our verdict. The only reason offered was that the bounty would tend to establish an important industry. That argument was put forward in the first instance regarding every one of the items in the schedule, and is in no sense a reason which was not previously considered why the Senate should undo what it has done. In the absence of fuller information, or some additional reason which was not before us previously, I do not see my way to reverse the vote which I then gave. </para>

                    <para>. -We should consider this matter a little more carefully before a vote is taken. The item has been  twice  passed by another place. That is some reason why the Senate should give it careful consideration, although of course it is not in itself a sufficient reason why the Senate should alter its previous decision. But, in the circumstances, when we are looking about for fresh avenues of employment for our  people,  seeing that copra  is  an essentially tropical product, and that we have such an enormous area of tropical and  semitropical  country, a very large section of which is about to be taken under direct Federal control,  it  is our duty to consider whether  it  is not desirable to encourage the production of copra in the Commonwealth. Honorable senators need not necessarily consider themselves bound to vote against the item now simply because they voted against  it on  a previous occasion.

                        <para>- What the honorable senator suggests  is  a very good argument, but the fact that a person thought a certain course right many days ago  is  by no means conclusive proof that he thinks the same thing right now. I would not dream of urging the honorable senator to do what he thought was not right. </para>

                <para>It will be remembered that this matter was discussed at considerable length. The circumstances under which a majority of the Senate decided in the first instance not to retain the item in the schedule will also be remembered. It was a decision which, I think, surprised the majority as much as it surprised the minority. On a subsequent occasion the matter was dealt with again, when the voting was even. It is unnecessary to labour the question as to the desirableness or otherwise of providing a bounty for the production of high-grade tobacco leaf, nor shall I reiterate any of the arguments previously adduced as to the practicability of establishing the industry in Australia, and the suitability of our soil for the growth of cigar tobacco. </para>

                    <para>. - The original proposal of the Bill in regard to wool tops was that for two years commencing from the1st July, 1908, the bounty shall be 1&#189;d. per lb., and for three years thereafter 1d. per lb. The Senate thought it desirable to commence the bounty not from the1st July, 1908, but from the1st January, 1909, in order that those endeavouring to get the benefit of it should have an opportunity of erecting the necessary machinery. Therefore, the Senate altered the item so as to make the bounty payable at the rate of1&#189;d. per lb. for three years from the1st January, 1909, at1d. per lb. for one year commencing1st January, 1 91 2, and&#189;d. per lb. for one year commencing1st January, 1913. The House of Representatives have agreed to our amendment except that they propose that the bounty for one year commencing1st January, 1913, shall be1d. per lb. instead of&#189;d. per lb. If the amendment is agreed to it will not affect the total appropriation made by the Bill nor will it affect the totals in the second schedule. Under these circumstances I can safely ask the Committee to agree to this small amendment. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I think there is a very good reason why the House of Representatives&#39; amendment should be agreed to. Since the matter was last before the Senate I have ascertained that there is a strong probability that the expensive machinery which would be requisite if this industry is to be initiated could not be erected in time for the bounty to be claimed for the first year or two. Consequently it seems to be not unreasonable that those who go into the industry, and who, owing to the circumstances of the case, are unable to claim the bounty in the first two years, should be treated a little more liberally in the last year for which the bounty runs. For that reason I shall support the Minister&#39;s motion. </para>

                    <para>.- We made a series of amendments in the second schedule for the purpose of making the amounts conform to the alterations made in the first schedule. In the original schedule the amounts ranged from &#163;60,000 in 1908 to &#163;412,500 in 1922. Consequent upon amendments made by the Senate those amounts were altered, and in the amended schedule ranged from &#163;43,000 to &#163;323,500. But, as the other House asked for the restoration of copra and tobacco leaf, it was necessary to make the second schedule harmonious. The Committee has now agreed to restore tobacco leaf, but has refused to restore copra. I have had prepared different schedules for any contingency, and now intend to propose the insertion of an amended schedule which has been worked out on the basis of the insertion of tobacco leaf and the omission of copra. The amounts range from &#163;46,000 in the first year to , &#163;339,000 in the last year. I will read the amounts for each year to be provided by the schedule, as I desire to have it amended. They are: - &#163;46,000, &#163;97,000 , &#163;151,000, &#163;205,600, &#163;259,500, &#163;279,500, &#163;297,500, &#163;311,500, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;319,000,</inline> &#163;326,500,  &#163;329,000, &#163;331,500, &#163;334,000,  &#163;336,500,and&#163;339,000.  These, of course, are not cumulative amounts, but the maximum expenditure allowable up to the end of each succeeding year of the Bill&#39;s operation. This schedule has been prepared very carefully, and I can confidentially recommend it to the Committee as representing the proper proportion of the amount which is provided in the first schedule. On a previous occasion, when amendments were made, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> calculated out in each instance what alterations would have to be made in the second schedule, and I think he found in every instance that the official calculation was exact. I think it will be found so on this occasion. I therefore move - </para>

                <para class="block">I may explain to honorable senators that it is not my intention to ask the Senate to assemble for the transaction of business on the date named in the event of the Tariff not being concluded in another place before that date. Although we have every reason to hope that the consideration of the Tariff will have been concluded in another place before that date, that contingency has been thought of, and it is proposed to provide for it in this way : A number of honorable senators representing adjoining States have been good enough to intimate that they will assist to provide a quorum on the 22nd January next if it should be necessary at that date to propose a further adjournment of the Senate until such time as we shall have received the Tariff from another place. Of course, if the Tariff has been received from another place, we shall then resume the transaction of business. May I take this opportunity to thank you, sir, and the  Chairman  of Committees, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> for the manner in which you have discharged the duties of your respective offices. I must say that the manner in which the proceedings of the Senate have been conducted by yourselves has been a source of universal satisfaction to honorable senators. The very best traditions of the Chairs have been most worthily upheld by you, sir, and by the  Chairman  of Committees, I take this opportunity also to extend <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> most hearty thanks to honorable senators generally for the assiduous attention they have given to the very important work submitted for their consideration since we met. We have been at work continuously since the 3rd July last, and measures of the greatest importance have been dealt with by the Senate in the interval. It is a source of very great satisfaction to remember that the courtesy and consideration which has been extended by honorable senators generally has resulted in the expeditious performance of the work of the Senate and the maintenance of the very best feeling amongst honorable senators. I think I should say that we have regretted exceedingly the absence from his place of the  Clerk  of Parliaments, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackmore,</inline> who possesses the high esteem of every member of the Senate. We have been exceedingly fortunate in having in his place the Acting  Clerk  of Parliaments, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boydell,</inline> who has discharged the duties of the office with marked ability and courtesy. We have to extend to him our sincere thanks for the zeal, energy, and ability he has displayed in the performance of his duties. I wish to recognise also the duties performed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Upward, Mr. Monahan, Mr. Lennox,</inline> and the other officers associated with them in the conduct of the business of this Chamber. I take this opportunity, early as it may seem, to extend to one and all the compliments of the season and to express the hope that we may all reassemble for work, thoroughly recuperated and with the same zeal and anxiety as have hitherto been displayed to discharge the duties of our various offices in the highest and best interests of the community. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sure that honorable senators will appreciate the sound business considerations which have induced the Vice-President of the Executive Council to propose the adjournment of the Senate in the circumstances which he has related. It will undoubtedly meet the convenience of honorable senators if the proposal he has indicated is carried out. I desire on behalf of honorable senators on this side to indorse the remarks of the Vice-President of the Executive Council with regard to yourself, sir. and the other officers of the Senate. There will be very little contest for the honours as to the number of those on either side whose remarks have occasionally called for your interposition. I feel that on this side, and throughout the Chamber, honorable senators generally recognise the admirable manner in which you have discharged duties, which at times, have rendered it necessary that you should rebuke some of us. I reciprocate very cordially the pleasant things which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has said. Honorable senators on this side arc, of course, frequently in conflict with the Government, and perhaps can understand better than those who support them the difficulties which confront the Government in carrying out their duties. We on this side have nothing but the kindest thoughts of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the Minister of Home Affairs, for the, way in which they have strenuously fought for their measures. I can say that with an added emphasis, because whilst I recognise that they are invariably wrong, I still understand that they are trying to do the wrong thing in the pleasantest way. I desire to express, on behalf of honorable senators on this side, my hearty wishes that the coming season will be a pleasant one, and that we shall meet in the forthcoming year, and for many future years, in the best of health, strength, and happiness. </para>

                    <para>- Although it may be somewhat unusual for the Chair to speak with reference to the remarks that have been made by the leader of the Government, the leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Labour Party, still I feel that I should be wanting in my duty were I not, on behalf of myself, the Chairmen of Committees, the Clerks of the Senate, and the other officers, to say a word of thanks for the very kind sentiments expressed regarding the way in which they have discharged the duties of their respective offices. I may safely say that it has been a matter of pleasure as well as of duty for myself, the Chairmen of Committees, and the other officers, to give our best efforts and energies to the orderly and proper conduct of the business of the Chamber. It is at all times a pleasure for men occupying positions of responsibility to find that their efforts are appreciated, and that credit is given to them for their desire to do what is best in the interests of the Chamber and of Parliament. The feeling that exists in the minds of all of us is not only that we have a duty to perform, but that we are called upon to perform it as efficiently, pleasantly, and agreeably as possible. If at any time it has fallen to my lot, as perhaps it has occasionally, to say a few words of rebuke to honorable senators, I can assure them that it has always been done with the most earnest desire to conduct the business honestly and fairly, and in the interests as much of honorable senators themselves as of the Chamber. </para>
