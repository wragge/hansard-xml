This morning I had an interview on the subject with the officers in the Attorney -General&#39;s Department, and ascertained that certain evidence was required before they would be in a position to go fully into the matter. Moreover, I may explain that at the present juncture they are taxed very severely with a great quantity of work. </para>

I desire the appointment of a Select Committee, as nearly as possible similar in <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> to the Select Committee, which was afterwards converted into a Royal Commission, appointed to investigate matters in connexion with the Tobacco industry. I ask for a suspension of the Standing Orders to enable me to submit a motion to that effect. It would be exceedingly difficult to obtain the appointment of a Select Committee by any other process, inasmuch as the business paper is fairly crowded with private business. 1 am positively informed that no communications have been addressed- </para>

            <para>.-! think that honorable senators are placed in a false position when a motion of this kind is submitted without notice. In the first place, we have no idea as to the character of the motion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> desires to move, and, secondly, before we can consent to an investigation, we need to have a categorical statement of the charges which he wishes to have investigated. I think that the more desirable plan will be for my honorable friend to give notice of a motion, and to allow the matter to be discussed in the ordinary way. I feel quite certain that at all times, the Senate will be anxious to do justice to every section of the community, and to see that all the facts are made public in connexion with any statements which may be made here. The proper course for my honorable friend to adopt is not this unusual one, but to give notice of a motion in the ordinary way. I regret that I cannot in the circumstances support this proposa.1. </para>

              <para>- That is quite a different thing. I am not opposed to the appointment of a Select Committee, if sufficient reasons are advanced and a clear case is made out. But I think it is only due to honorable senators that when any honorable senator wishes to take a step of this kind, he should communicate with them privately or give notice of a motion, so &#39;that we might all be prepared to act. I do not know what the attitude of the Senate towards this proposal is likely to be, but unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> can give better reasons than he has given I shall certainly oppose a suspension of the Standing Orders for the purpose, though the probability is that I would vote for the appointment of a Select Committee if it were moved for in the ordinary way.

If an opportunity is given to any honorable senator to make allegations about a company or individual, full and early opportunity of replying to or inquiring into those allegations ought to be as freely given to the person or company charged. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has intimated to-day that the Combine desire an inquiry into those allegations. </para>

              <para>- If the statements made upon the floor of the Senate are true, then those who made them have nothing to fear from an inquiry. If any one made false and injurious statements about myself, I should certainly press for an inquiry at the earliest possible moment. What I claim for myself I am willing to give to others. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> very properly said, the notice-paper is so loaded with private members&#39; business that, unless the Standing Orders are suspended, he will have no opportunity of bringing the subject up within a reasonable time. Honorable senators ought to be governed by their sense of what is right and reasonable in the interests of justice. </para>

I know nothing whatever about them, but if ever I make charges in this Senate, I shall never be afraid of their being inquired into. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I should always be only too willing to have an inquiry. I can see no other course open to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> than the one he is now taking. He tried to bring the matter up recently, and was ruled out of order. He is taking another opportunity now, and the Senate, in all fairness and justice, should assist him. </para>

            <para>- There is one reason which has not yet been mentioned why the sense of justice of the Senate should lead it to assent to the motion. Immediately after the debate from which the motion springs, the attention of the Government was called very sharply to the case that was made out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> Even on this side of the Chamber, which is said by its opponents to be a sort of constitutional machine for the oppression of the poor, it was pointed out that there was need for investigation on the part of the Government. The leader of the Government in this Chamber has been repeatedly asked to state what progress has been made with that inquiry, and has had repeatedly to state that no progress has been made. He informed us this afternoon that there is little prospect of his getting any &#34; forrarder.&#34; If the charges made are not true, a great injustice is being done to the company or Combine in question. If they are true, it is the bounden duty of honorable senators on the other side, and also to their advantage, to see that those charges are properly met. Inasmuch as a month has elapsed since they were made, and the Government have made no progress with their inquiries, although they have had time to do so, surely it will appeal strongly to the sense of justice of the Senate that the motion ought to be carried, in order to give an ample opportunity at the earliest date possible for the Senate and the public to be able to judge of the merits or demerits of the charges. </para>

The suspension of the Standing Orders is an unusual proceeding. They are made to insure a properly organized procedure, and should only be suspended for very good reasons. Still, they are made for honorable senators and not honorable senators for them, and if a sufficiently forcible case can be shown, I, for one, shall never hesitate to agree to suspend them. Why has not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> taken the ordinary course of moving for the appointment of a Select Committee during the month that has elapsed since this matter was first mooted? He may have good reasons for all I know, but he has not informed us of them yet. In the second place, will any bar be placed in the way of the investigation of the alleged charges if the honorable senator gives notice of motion for to-morrow ? We are entitled to this information. If the honorable senator can show good reasons for not having moved previously, and prove that he will be placed under a grave disadvantage in the investigation which he requires, by having the matter delayed until he can adopt the usual procedure, I shall vote with him. </para>

Whilst your ruling, sir, may have prevented him from taking a certain course in submitting the motion, I do not suppose that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> would attempt to prevent him from indicating briefly to the Senate the charges which he desires the Select Com.mittee to investigate. It is due to honorable senators that they should be given some reason for being asked to vote for the suspension of the Standing Orders. It appears that the honorable senator who has moved the motion is the custodia&#39;n for the time being of at least an alleged grievance, and I shall be no party to prevent the suspension of the Standing Orders for the purpose of investigating the grievance.

But if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> will permit me I should like to repeat what I did say. I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> was disposed to go into the merits of the proposal, and I pointed out to him that the question before the Senate was the suspension of the Standing Orders, and that while he might intimate what he wanted the Standing Orders suspended for, I would not allow him to go into the question of the merits or demerits of the. proposed appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into certain charges.. I thought that as honorable senators had a general knowledge of what the honorable senator desired to do they would be in a position to say whether they thought the Standing Orders should be suspended. If they are suspended, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> can then submit his motion for the appointment of a Select Committee, and if it does not commend itself to honorable senators they will oppose it. By assenting merely to the suspension of the Standing Orders honorable senators will in no wise be pledged to any particular line of action other -than the discussion of the motion to be subsequently moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> and they will be at liberty to vote upon it as they think fit. </para>

              <para>- Certainly not. The honorable senator is at liberty to state the charges, and when he replies to the debate I shall not prevent him giving the information for which honorable senators are asking at the present time, but I shall not allow the honorable senator to discuss the merits of the question. He may say what he wants the Select Committee to inquire into, so that when the motion for its appointment is before the Senate, honorable senators in dealing with it will be able to exercise their own&#34; discretion. </para>

              <para>- I know that statements which were made very fully in the -Senate aroused considerable sensation in some of the States, and certainly in Victoria and Tasmania. Their effect might have been to very greatly injure the persons about whom they were made. It, therefore, seemed to me to be a pity that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> could not impress the Senate with the seriousness of the situation. Another thing that made me rather anxious in the matter was an interjection which I heard &#34;made by the honorable senator who brought the charges forward. I give that honorable senator every credit for bringing them forward if he thought they were justified, but I think he ought not in his place in the Senate to have said, as he did by interjection, that the company against whom the charges have been made do not want an investigation. </para>

              <para>- That is precisely the third charge to which I have referred, namely, illicitly obtaining knowledge of the proposed Tariff, and thereupon clearing tobacco from bond. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> asked me why I had not taken pr101 action, and said that his vote on this motion would depend on my reply to that question. I point out that the Government promised an inquiry info the matter as far back as the 16th of last month. It will be four weeks ago next Friday since that promise was made, and we have heard today that the Vice-President of the Executive Council can offer no kind of promise as to the making of the inquiry. As a matter of fact, the inquiry has not yet beer* commenced. I am in a position to assert positively that no communication has been made to the firms concerned with a view to obtaining any information whatever as  to the facts. As to my not having put a motion dealing with the matter on the paper in the ordinary way, if the suspension of the Standing Orders be permitted; I am prepared with a motion proposing that the Select Committee appointed to investigate the matter shall report on the 1 st&#39; October. I found that the business-paper was so full that I could not hope to move in the matter in the ordinary way, until 10th October. </para>

              <para>- Is it in order for an honorable senator while walking about the chamber to shout at me? Evidently the matter is giving rise to a great deal of heat on the part of some honorable senators, though I have desired to impart no heat into its discussion. I have had no direct personal communication with any of the persons connected with the compan ies against whom the charges have been made. All that has reached me has been in the. form of written documents. I have not seen any one of the persons concerned in the charges, nor have I been asked to adopt this particular form of application. With reference to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the tobacco people do not wish the matter to be inquired into, I can only say that, according to the written communications sent to me, they are most anxious that it should be inquired into. I hope that, in the interests of that fair play for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and others have pleaded, and which plea <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has indorsed, the Senate will consent to the suspension of the Standing Orders. To show my <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in the matter, I suppose I shall be in order in saying that I propose that the Committee shall consist as far as possible of honorable senators who were members of the Committee that previously dealt with the tobacco business. I intend to propose the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray,</inline> who was on the previous Committee, for New South Wales; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> who was also a member of the previous Committee, for Victoria </para>

            <para>. - I think that the motion conclusively justifies the action that I felt it to be my duty to take in protesting against, the course pursued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> The motion now submitted is that a Committee be appointed to inquire into certain accusations made by certain honorable senators in the course of a debate. In other words, the Committee is to review an important debate which took place three weeks ago, and lasted several hours. I do not think that such a procedure is consonant with the dignity of the Senate. If my honorable friend desires that a Committee be appointed to investigate certain charges, let those charges be formulated, and let them be investigated ; but I do protest that it would be a most unreasonable and improper procedure on our part simply to take <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> in which is contained the report of a debate, throw it before a Committee, and say, &#34;Ascertain whether the statements there made are true or not.&#34; My honorable friend must, on reflection, see the impropriety of a course of that kind. I. have suggested that he should take the opportunity of bringing this matter forward to-morrow evening, as I think he would be able to do. The paper to-morrow is fairly clear. I think there can be no doubt that the honorable senator would be able to move. In the meantime, he would be able to formulate the charges to be laid before the Committee, which would be saved from being placed in the most improper position of having practically to review a debate which has taken place in the Senate. I urge my honorable friend to accept the suggestion which I have made. </para>

            <para>-- I have no desire to avoid an inquiry into any statements which. I have made in this Chamber, but if we are going to have Select Committees appointed to inquire into my speeches&#39;, I am afraid I shall lead the Senate a merry dance for the rest of the session. &#91; am afraid, too, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will lead us a merry dance.

          <quote>
            <para>The increase of prices of tobacco, and the throwing out of employment of a large number of workers by the Tobacco Combine, and their allegation that this action has been caused by the new Tariff proposals. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those were the reasons upon which I moved the adjournment, but they are not the points upon which the honorable senator wishes to have an inquiry. Practically, he desires to have an investigation into the whole debate. As to his statement about the &#34; improper &#34; throwing of workmen out of employment - who said that it was improper? I did not, and I do not think that any other  speaker  in the course of the debate said so. Then as to the &#34;illicit &#34; obtaining of information - who said that the obtaining of the information was illicit? I cannot remember that a single honorable senator said so.  Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> &#34; charges &#34; are based upon something that did not occur in the debate at all. But really the whole procedure is a farce. While I voted for a suspension of the Standing Orders to give the honorable senator an opportunity of moving for the appointment of a Select Committee, I nevertheless think that it would be ridiculous to appoint a Committee to inquire into the accuracy of speeches of honorable senators.  </para>

              <para>- They also gambled in reference to the Excise, because they got the unmanufactured tobacco without paying the additional duty, made it up into the manufactured article and paid the old Excise of is., instead of the new Excise of is. 3d., thereby escaping the payment of the extra 3d. The Melbourne distributing house of the Combine, no doubt, passed on the imaginary increase - imaginary, so far as it affected them - to the consumer. The facts that I gave I am prepared to stand &#34;by. But I did not charge any one in the Customs Department with having supplied &#34;illicit information,&#34; nor did I charge the Combine with having obtained illicit information. The Combine anticipated action upon the Tariff, and thereby were enabled to make thousands of pounds at the expense of the public. </para>

              <para>- My opinion is that if it had not been for the discussion in the Senate, in all probability the men would have had to walk about the streets for two or three weeks longer, and the public would have been told that it was owing to the new Tariff. Anyhow, the men were sent for, and work was resumed, and&#39; since that time I understand that they have been given two or three weeks&#39; holidays on half-pay. The motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has had good results. It has enabled the men to be employed; and the public to get an idea of the way in which business is carried on by the Combine when it suits them to increase the price of commodities at the public expense, when there is no occasion to do so. </para>

          <para class="block">It would be a most extraordinary thing if an honorable senator were to ask for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into a specific accusation by a particular senator. But this motion does not specify any accusation or any honorable senator. I participated in the debate on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> motion because I was interested in the subject with which it dealt, and I suppose that I can be charged with having made strong accusations. Any accusation which I make here I expect to be refuted here, and not by a Select Committee. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> who I am sure wishes to do justice to all sides, will ventilate the matter on the floor of the Chamber, where the accusations - if statements can be so described - were made. May I suggest what the report of the Select Committee would be if it were appointed and carried out its work? It would either <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> a vote of censure against certain honorable senators or a finding that they had not been guilty of making any accusations which were unwarrantable. In either case could the result of the inquiry be of any use to any one? Is there any honorable senator who would care whether he was censured or exonerated by a Select Committee? If any of us has made statements here they ought to be refuted here. I venture to think that no honorable senator would pay the slightest attention to the finding of any Select Committee which reported that he deserved censure because he had made strong statements in &#39; regard to the Tobacco Combine or any other industrial enterprise. I believe that Senators Pearce and Find ley do not want a Select Committee to say that they are not guilty ; I am certain that I do not. I sincerely hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will ask leave to withdraw his motion, and take advantage of an opportunity - and there is no one here who is better able to find an opportunity than he is - to meet the statements that have been made in regard to the Combine. </para>

              <para>- When I attempted to move the adjournment of the Senate I was not permitted to do so. Then I dealt with the matter in a supposititious manner on a motion for adjournment, and the  President  observed that he felt sure that the Senate would not object to the appointment of a Select Committee. Under those circumstances, and acting upon his suggestion, I have moved this motion today. The charges which were made in the twenty pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to which I referred come under different headings, but the two main charges are undue increase of prices and inhuman treatment of operatives. As regards the former of these two charges, the allegation was that the new Tariff did not justify the increase in prices by the Combine, and that if it did the price charged greatly exceeded the increased cost caused by the new Tariff. </para>

          <para>That proposition is emphatically and absolutely denied by the companies forming the so-called Combine. Speaking now in the Senate, if honorable senators like, on behalf of those companies, just as Senators Pearce and Findley, and others, spoke on behalf of some one who supplied them with information, I say that the companies concerned absolutely deny anything of the kind. The alterations in the Tariff are as follow: - On imported leaf, unstemmed, old duty per lb.,1s.  6d.  ; new duty per lb.,1s.9d. That is an increase of threepence. Imported leaf stemmed, old duty is  6d.  ; new duty,  2s.  ; increase,  6d.  Excise on locally manufactured leaf, old duty, is. ; new duty, 1s  3d.  ; increase,  3d.  The increases, therefore, amount on unstemmed leaf to  6d.,  comprised of  3d.  extra Customs duty, and  3d.  extra Excise duty, while on stemmed leaf they amount to9d., made up of  6d.  extra Customs duty and  3d.  extra Excise duty. </para>

              <para>- I am quoting; from certain notes with which I have provided myself, in order to put the matter clearly. I necessarily have to use full&#39; notes, because I cannot carry these details in my mind. No one could, except, perhaps, the manufacturers themselves. Except on that erroneous assumption on the. part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the whole allegation falls to the ground. There is also the charge of combining, which means practically conspiring, because it is a breach of the law. An unlawful combination to raise prices is practically a conspiracy under our law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> assumption that only unstemmed leaf will be used! is unwarranted for the following reasons : - First, owing to the necessity of maturing the leaf and providing against crop failures, sufficient stocks have always to be kept in bond to provide ahead for from twelve to fifteen months&#39; consumption. The tobacco crop, whether in this country or any other, is subject to vicissitudes. The commonest crop in the world, &#39; wheat, is subject to vicissitudes, but the supply is so large from different parts of the globe that it is not necessary to provide against defective harvests in the manner in which the tobacco manufacturer has to provide against defective tobacco crops. It is well known that the tobacco crop is very liable to injury from changes in the weather, insects, mil-&#39; dew, and other troubles. As a matter of fact, the Tobacco Combine have at the present time in bond and to arrive - and necessarily if it is in bond or to arrive it will be liable to the new duty - about twelve months&#39; stock of stemmed leaf for the purpose of making plug tobacco. On that stock they will have to pay the Customs duty of  2s.  per lb. on stemmed leaf and the Excise duty of1s.  3d.  per lb. on manufactured tobacco, or a total of  3s. 3d.  That represents an increased duty of9d. per lb. </para>

              <para>- I am only speaking of the actual goods that these people are importing, and have either in. stock in bond or on the way to Australia. Upon it they will have to pay9d. per lb. additional duty. The leaf is stemmed and treated in Virginia, when it is in a more or less green condition. This is referred to bv <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Neville</inline> in question No. 28419 of the report of the Tariff Commission, in the following terms -  &#34;It <inline font-style="italic">&#91;i.e.,</inline> the stemmed leaf) is put on the market. After that the  re-handler  gets&#39; hold of it,  and he allows it to hang in his drying-room for two or three months. That tobacco is not taken out until the following spring, say in May or June. Then it is put into hogsheads holding from 1,200 to 1,400 lbs. This continuous handling, with freezing and thawing, and the coming and going of soft and dry weather, eliminates the objectionable qualities of the tobacco and develops its flavour.&#34; </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <para class="block">The information which I have obtained in writing states that to import the leaf unstemmed, and do the stemming in Australia, would involve re-handling, re-moistening, and re-packing, and would so injuriously affect the tobacco and reduce the weight as to render the operation, to say the least, injudicious and inexpedient. It is for these reasons that the British Government recently reduced the differential duty of 3d. per lb. against stemmed leaf to the nominal revenue import duty of Jd. per lb: Consequently, whilst we have been raising the duty here, in the United Kingdom it has been reduced to a mere nominal id. per lb. Even assuming that these objections did not exist, and that the companies were in a position to import unstemmed leaf at the lower duty of is. 9d. against 2s. for stemmed leaf, this difference in duty would, it is estimated, be entirely neutralized by the increased cost of stemming under Australian factory conditions as compared with the cheaper . negro labour of Virginia, to which increased cost must be added the cost of the extra freight on unstemmed leaf compared with stemmed, and the interest charge on the capital outlay for plant and buildings in Australia in which to carry on the stemming and rehandling operations. Another matter of consequence that must be considered relates to the alleged untaxed ingredients that are used in tobacco manufacture. I do not know what they are with any degree of certainty, but I believe that sweetening matter of some sort is used. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> stated that about 5 per cent&#39;, of untaxed ingredients entered into the manufacture of plug tobacco, but he altogether omitted the consideration that all those alleged untaxed ingredients pay Excise duty. That point has a material influence upon the question of the price of tobacco. I am positively assured - and this is- a point that I should like the Committee to investigate whether the statement is true or not - that all sales made by the </para>
          <para class="block">Tobacco Combine are subject to 2 J per cent, discount. That means a discount, not only on the cost of the tobacco, but on the amount paid in Customs and Excise duties. Any one with a knowledge of the tremendous quantities of goods handled by the companies, and the large annual value of the turnover, must recognise that 2J per cent, allowed upon the duty that has been already paid means, in the course of twelve months, a fairly heavy handicap. If the matters that I have been expatiating upon are taken, into consideration, it will be very clearly recognised that the increase in price is absolutely, less than the increased duties that these people are now called upon to pay. Instead of their making money out of it they are actually getting less. That is an assertion which I make in quite as good faith as those honorable senators who made statements in the opposite direction. I should like the Committee to investigate that allegation also. There are certain popular brands, known as Capstan and Vice- Regal. They are made from pure American leaf, and the price has been advanced by 3d. less than the advance in the duties, so that instead of these people having increased their prices and used the Tariff as an excuse to plunder the public - because that is practically the charge- that was made - they are absolutely selling their favourite brands of tobacco at 3d. per lb. less than the additional cost caused by the new Customs charges. The question of competitors&#39; prices was mentioned and dealt with. From my own knowledge of documents, which I have, had in my possession for the last six weeks, I can state how the prices came to be raised. I make the assertion that an opposition company doing business in Sydney approached the so-called Combine and implored them to consent to raise prices, or otherwise they would have to go insolvent, and their hands would be turned out of employment. The Combine yielded to their solicitations. I ha.ve the company&#39;s letter in my possession. As long ago as the 19th July this letter was written an3 signed by three directors of the Sydney Tobacco Company, and addressed to the managing director, of the British Australasian Tobacco Company.

            <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, -</inline> The Sydney Tobacco Company, nf which we the undersigned are the Directors, desire to bring under your notice the difficulties which we have to contend with. For a long time past, certainly the last six months, the factory has been working at a heavy loss, the cause of which, as you can readily understand, is primarily the great increase in cost of the raw material, .Colonial leaf costing at least 25 per cent, more, while the prices of imported leaf have enhanced even much more than that. Notwithstanding these great difficulties in prime cost, the selling prices of our manufactured tobaccos have not been increased. The position that faces us now is most serious, there being but two alternatives, viz., the liquidation of our company or an increase in the selling prices of our tobaccos. This we are unable to do by ourselves, and appeal to you, as the larger and stronger company, to take into consideration the desirability of agreeing with us to raise prices at least id. per lb. on the high grade, and 2d. per lb. on the lower grade of tobaccos. If this could be done, and we see no reason why it should not be, as the position is forced upon us by circumstances over which no manufacturer has control, we respectfully ask that you will agree to our proposition, and that such advances take place as from the 1st August next. </para>
            <para>We do not think&#39; that we can say anything further to show you the urgency of the case; it is, as we have already mentioned, life or death with our small company. It would be very hard for our shareholders to have to suffer heavy loss such as would necessarily be the case if the company goes into liquidation when there is a just and reasonable way of avoiding that disaster. </para>

              <para>- The company appealed to a rival, but the honorable senator must admit that whatever action the Combine took upon this letter they would have laid themselves open to his sneer. Had they refused to raise prices, and, as a consequence, this little struggling company had been shut out, it would have been claimed that the Tobacco Combine had destroyed a small competitor. On the other hand, if they agreed to the request to raise prices, then it would have been said that it was a conspiracy to rob the public. The honorable senator must- see that there was no middle course, and that whichever course they took they were liable to the attack that he makes. </para>

              <para>- It is no use to try to catch me in such a really shallow manner, because the meaning of the observations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> must be patent to every member of the Senate. The proposition the honorable senator lays down is that there was practically a fraudulent raising of the prices of tobacco as an alleged consequence of the Tariff. I have made two allegations here this afternoon as plainly as a man can speak. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps the honorable senator will allow me to proceed? One is, that the prices were raised on certain lines of tobacco before the Tariff was heard of. The second is that there has been an all round rise of prices since The rise of prices before the Tariff affected only certain low-class tobaccoes, but since then, in consequence of the increase in duties of Customs and Excise to the extent of 9d. per lb., there has been an increase in price in some cases of 9d., and in other cases of 6d., per lb. &#39; </para>

              <para>- That only confirms the accuracy of what I am saying. I do not wish to read the whole of the correspondence. I have in my possession all the letters that passed, and I desire to put them before the Select Committee, that the truth of the statements they contain may be investigated. Surely it cannot be suggested that I wish to make statements here that are not true, or that  1  wish to bolster up any man&#39;s position if he has done wrong. Surely after a quarter of a century of public life in Parliament, in -the blaze of publicity that surrounds&#39; every man in public life, it is not likely that I would come here to bolster up the reputation of dishonest men. I am putting forward what I believe to be a reply to certain charges which I wish to have investigated. There was a fair chorus demanding that I should specify what the charges were, and when I propose to specify them I find that is the very last thing some honorable senators wish to hear. I suppose they now very much regret that the remarks of some of them tended in a direction that made my present reply lawful and proper, and think that it would have been very much better if the matter had been dealt with without the demand for such particulars as I am giving. All I wish is an investigation to prove whether these things are so. I shall wash my hands of the matter for ever if it is shown that the statements submitted to me are untrue. I am asking for an inquiry, but the honorable senators who made the charges do not want an inquiry, and they say the Combine do not want an inquiry. This is their attitude in the matter: &#34; Do have an inquiry; we are all in favour of an inquiry; but for God&#39;s sake do not say anything about it. Do not make any reply.&#34; Special reference was made in the course of the debate to tobacco known as &#34; Perfection.&#34; I was asked about that, and these are the facts - </para>

          <para class="block">Information improperly obtained, I should like this point investigated. The Combine state that they cleared only one quarter of their bonded stocks, and the same inference may just as fairly be drawn from the clearances of bonded stocks . by traders throughout the Commonwealth. It is a matter of notoriety that not only in the case of tobacco, but in the case of scores of other kinds of goods,&#34; there were very heavy clearances in anticipation of the Tariff. There never was a Tariff introduced but what there were heavy clearances in advance. </para>

In the circumstances, why should one firm or company be picked, out of the whole of the traders* of the Commonwealth, and held up to public reprobation as having done something which was, at least, indecent, &#39; if not dishonest and illegal ?

              <para>- That is not the case; but I shall not &#34;barney&#34; with the honorable senator. I am prepared to have the statements upon- which I . base these allegations probed to the fullest possible extent ; and if I find that I have been misled in one particular, I shall be the first to wash my hands a/f the inquiry, and to be ready to&#39; report te the Senate against those who have made fallacious misrepresentations. It would be an utter misuse of  my  opportunities for me to put forward allegations that are untrue. Far- more responsibility lies upon those who  supply  information, than upon those who use it in good faith, and after an investigation of its reasonable probability. I know that honorable senators opposite, who have made statements on this subject, have done so in good faith. Let them give me equal credit when .1 ask for an inquiry and state the reasons for it. For several weeks &#39; prior to the introduction of the Tariff, there was a very heavy demand upon manufacturers and wholesale dealers for cigars and cigarettes; so much so that, by the 9th of August - I think that was the day on which the Tariff was introduced - the stocks of &#39;the Combine were very largely depleted. Their cigarette factory, for instance, was  completely depleted of stock. How can it be alleged that there was anything. wrong about the action of a firm which, prior to the introduction of the Tariff, absolutely cleared out every cigarette in stock? If the statements supplied to me that their stocks were entirely cleared out is untrue, I will wash my hands of the whole affair. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Colonel NEILD.-</inline>That is a matter to be inquired into by the . Committee. As to the fixing of retail prices, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> displayed a handbill showing increased cost under the new Tariff. It was sought to be shown that this handbill, and the increased prices which it proclaimed, were inspired by the Combine&#39;s distributing agents, Kronheimer Limited. The companies state that they are in a position to assert positively that this handbill and the prices listed in it, were the outcome of a meeting of the Semi-wholesale Tobacconists Association, and the Retail Tobacconists Association, and that Kronheimer Limited had no connexion, direct, or indirect, with either of those meetings, nor had they, in any  shape or form with either of those associations. The meetings were the natural outcome of the altered duties, as were also the retail prices. With my own eves, I have seen the advertisements published in the Sydney newspapers, calling those meetings. They are signed by men whom I know to be in the retail trade. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will suggest that they were put up to it by the Tobacco Combine. </para>

              <para>- With reference to the treatment of employes the principal allegation was that the Combine suddenly and inconsiderately closed its factory in order to gain time to work off a great superabundance of stocks resulting from having worked its operatives at high pressure and on overtime for many weeks prior to the promulgation of the Tariff. Now what are the facts? There was no exceptional pressure, and comparatively little overtime was worked during the period preceding the declaration of the Tariff. I have been supplied with a table showing what the overtime pay was. It gives exact details of the overtime worked from the 6th of June to 7th August. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps not, but I hope I shall be permitted to point out that the companies not only pay to their employes a bonus at Christmas time equal to one week&#39;s salary, but also pay one-half of the contributions of the operatives to any registered Friendly Society to which they may belong. Those facts give the best possible contradiction to the allegation of callous disregard of the well being of the employe&#39;s. I have surely given sufficient information to those honorable senators who have asked me what it was that I wanted to have inquired into. I have asked that the scope of the inquiry should be limited, and point out that, notwithstanding the phraseology of the motion, I pledge my word as a senator of the Commonwealth that I will use my utmost endeavours to restrict the inquiry to the matters mentioned in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> motion for the adjournment, and will not seek to introduce any other matters whatever. I hope that the Senate, having spent so much time upon the subject, will allow the Committee to be appointed, in order that justice may be done. I wish to elicit nothing but the truth, in. the interests of the public. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> will not persist with his amendment. It seems to me as if the Committee were treating far too lightly the proposal to establish a cotton industry in Australia. Honorable senators probably are not aware that the cotton crop is one- of the largest crops in the world. I believe that at the present moment it is the largest agricultural crop in the United States. It is grown there in a climate which is very similar to that of a large portion of Australia. I believe that it could be grown over two-thirds of this continent. That being the case, honorable senators ought to do everything in their power to encourage its production. When we reflect that we are living within easy distance of China and Japan, populated as those countries are by hundreds of millions of people, of whom a large number are clad almost exclusively in cotton cloth, I think that the prospect held out to us from that point of view is very alluring. </para>

                        <para>- Where the black man has been placed by Providence, there let him remain and flourish, if he can. I am not going to do anything to interfere with him.. It is only when persons for their own  profit  bring the black man here and exploit him that I object. I am sure that the honorable senator would like to see the people of India, China, and Japan, indeed, of the whole of Asia, so well off that they would be able to buy. not only any cotton which might be produced here, but also our wool. We are apt to plume ourselves upon being the greatest wool producers in the world. I believe that we do hold the premier position in that regard, and I do not see any reason why we should not also occupy the same point of advantage with regard to the twin product - cotton. In Australia we have every natural advantage which is required for its cultivation. Some experiments in the growing of cotton no doubt have been made in parts of Australia, and have been partial failures. Why ? Simply because the time was not ripe. Even agriculture itself, up to a certain point, failed in Australia. For what reason? Because people could earn a better living at pastoral work, mining, railway building, timber getting, and so forth. It was only when they were compelled by sheer necessity that a large number of per-, sons turned their attention to the cultivation of the soil. As time goes on, we shall find that many more persons will exert their efforts in that direction, and that cotton-growing on a very extensive scale will be brought about in Australia. I think, therefore, that instead of doing anything to damp the enthusiasm of such persons as may be inclined to experiment with regard to this commodity we ought to help them by every means within our reach. If, however, the amendment is carried there will be very scant inducement for any one to embark in the industry. Indeed, the Government proposal is of such a meagre character that I felt half inclined to vote against it on account of its inadequacy. We have here the germ of a huge industry, and all that the Government proposes to spend is a paltry few thousand pounds per annum. </para>

                        <para>- I forget nothing in that connexion. I know that all these matters must be taken into consideration ; but, as I have pointed out. we have here the possibility of one of the largest industries which have yet been established in Australia, and we ought to strain every nerve to give it a fair start. I find that in the southern States of America consumption is fast overtaking production, and that British cotton spinners are almost at their wits end in obtaining cotton for manufacturing purposes. This ought to appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> more especially as he is a very strong loyalist. The Americans are straining every &#34;nerve to take away from Great Britain the cotton industry as well as a number of other industries. To&#39; that end they are establishing countless manufactories, with the express object of manufacturing all their own native-grown cotton, and in that way driving Great Britain&#39; out of the cotton industry. Very naturally the latter is turning her eyes towards her own Colonies. This is an industry in which we can, not only help ourselves very materially, but also give substantial assistance to the mother country. If we can produce a large quantity of cotton - enough not only to meet our own wants, but also to leave a surplus for export - Great Britain will be partially independent of the &#39;United States, so far as the raw commodity is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Does not the honorable senator see that the United States, in pursuance of their industrial and trade policy, have set out to take the cotton spinning&#39; industry out of the hands of Great Britain? Undoubtedly, the United States will succeed within a very few years in striking a fatal blow at the cotton industry in Great Britain. On Friday last <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> urged very strongly that there was nothing in the by-products of cotton. On inquiry, I find that in addition to what may be called the cotton wool, which is used for weaving purposes, there is quite a number of by-products, every one of which is marketable at a very substantial price. Oil and oil-cake are produced from cotton-seed. Kitchen and Sons have established in Brisbane works for that very purpose, and are prepared to buy all the seed produced at a decent price. Joyce Brothers, bag-makers, of New South Wales, have bought up the old cotton mill at Ipswich, which formerly belonged to the Queensland Cotton Manufacturing Company. Apparently they see something ahead of them, and are prepared to take all the cotton that is grown in the State. The Queensland Government are now distributing seed and employing an expert to teach farmers how to grow cotton. If those steps are being taken by private companies and by a State. Government, the Commonwealth Government may very well follow suit and do all it can do to promote the industry. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> amendment will appeal to the Committee. I believe the majority of honorable senators would very gladly give cotton a very much larger encouragement than is proposed in the schedule if they possibly could. If nine-tenths of the other items could be wiped out, and the money transferred to the bounty for cotton, I believe the Committee would do it, but unfortunately we are not in a position to take that course. </para>

                    <para>. - Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 9, the Government have power to make regulations prescribing the proportion in which bounties shall be payable to claimants who have complied with the prescribed conditions, in cases where there is not sufficient money available to pay the full bounties. Consequently, if the bounty for cotton is successful, and encourages production, the amount payable will automatically decrease year by year in proportion to the value of cotton produced, and so <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> object will be exactly carried out. That appears to be a complete answer to the arguments in favour of inserting the amendment in the Bill. The opponents of the Bill are really standing on velvet. They can quote the experts&#39; report when they argue that if an industry is going to be successful there is no need to give it a bounty. They can also quote the experts&#39; report when they argue that if an industry has no prospects of success it will be a waste of money to give it a bounty. In that way, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and others use the experts&#39; report against the Bill in both directions. It was interjected that cotton is already protected under the Tariff. It is not. Under the new Tariff, ginned cotton is free. There is a duty on cotton goods, which will benefit the cotton manufacturer, but not the cotton-grower. This proposal is to give a bounty to the grower to induce him to produce cotton. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> in the strong stand he is taking in favour of the production of cotton. I wish to direct the attention of the Committee to the following extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Agricultural Journal</inline> for August - </para>

                    <para>The shortage of the American cotton crop is again causing a rise in price of the raw material, and it is questionable whether sufficient supplies from that source will be at any future time forthcoming to keep the Lancashire mills in full work. Cotton mills in the&#39; southern States of America are still increasing in size and numbers, hence cotton which once found its way to England is now utilized in the former country. In the West Indies, in Africa, and in other parts of the world every effort is being made to create a cotton industry ; yet still Queensland looks on apathetically and continues to make  experiments,  as if it had not been fully demonstrated many years ago that this State can produce cotton equal to any American cotton. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall support the granting of a bounty on cotton, because I believe it would be greatly in the interests of Australia. I wish to deal particularly with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> amendment. I believe he is actuated by the very best motives.  His  desire is to make the bounty as effective as possible from his point of view ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Chataway&#39;s  argument shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> idea is very erroneous as applied to a bounty on cotton. No doubt that is due to the honorable senator&#39;s great familiarity with figures. He deals so much with interest and compound interest that he likes to introduce fractional percentages, forgetting that he ma.y mystify, not only honorable senators, but the public generally. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> takes the view that the amendment would begin to operate from the year in which the bounty commenced, but. that is not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> idea. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> says, &#34; From the commencement of cultivation.&#34; If one producer of cotton in Queensland began a year or two &#39;later than another, the reduction in his bounty would? not begin until the year after he commenced cultivation. It would be very difficult to administer a bounty on that principle. If there were eight cotton growers, one commencing this year would begin to get the full bounty in&#39; the first year of cultivation and receive a diminishing quantity up to the end of eight years, so far as he was concerned. The eighth cotton grower might not start until the eighth year. He would then begin with a full 10 per cent, and continue to receive a diminishing bounty  for the next eight years, so far as he w as concerned. Consequently, we should have a bounty straggling on for sixteen&#39; years like a flock of goats scattered over a-&#39; wilderness. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> will see how ridiculous such an idea is. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> in moving his amendment, has no desire to hamper the growth of&#39; cotton in Australia. If the only purpose of the amendment is to. defeat the object of. the Bill, I hope the honorable senator will withdraw it. He must recognise that the difficulties I have indicated of administering a  a bounty on cotton, in the way he proposes, would be so great that no Government  would undertake the work. The Government are prepared to commence the distribution of the bounty as soon as people begin to produce cotton, and they propose to continue to give the bounty until the term of eight years expires. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has pointed out, there will be, as production increases,&#34; such a wide area over which the &#163;6, 000 annually set apart to provide a bounty for the growth of cotton will be distributed, that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has in view will take place. I should like to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and others, who seem to be very anxious about this bounty that if, at the end of the period of eight years, it is shown that the expenditure of the ,&#163;48,060 we are now asked to grant for the purpose, has had the effect of proving that there is every prospect of the cotton industry, which is of so much importance to&#39; the Commonwealth, ultimately becoming successfully established, and that an extension of the bounty is necessary to complete its success, there need be no fear that the Parliament will not grant the extension. I hope that  the item will be carried. </para>

I may point out that if we are to take it for granted that the maximum amount of bounty set out in the fourth column of the 1st .

If, in like manner, the maximum amount is granted in respect of all the other items, the total amount expended, instead of being &#163;4I 2,000, will be &#163;533,000.

                        <para>- It .must, if we are to give the maximum bounty in each year in respect of every item, and, apparently, it is desired that the maximum should be given in the case of cotton. I am very much obliged to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> for his statement as to the effect of my amendment. Under the amendment, a person producing cotton would get a bounty at the rate of 10 per cent, for the first year, and at the rate of per cent, less annually for the balance of the eight years, until in the last year the bounty would be reduced to 1 1/4 per  cent. The objection I have to the proposal in the Bill is that, whilst the grower would get a bounty of 10 per cent, for every year during the eight years&#39; period, he would get nothing in the ninth year. I think the bounty should be . distributed on the tapering principle, just as a father may assist a son in business by lending him money at a low rate of interest, and providing that he should pay off a portion of the loan each year. At the end of a certain period, he might expect the son to rely upon himself to continue the business. I was in hopes that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> would propose an amendment which I could  support, but it would appear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway&#39;s</inline> arguments have beer* so convincing, that the honorable senator does not feel disposed to move any amendment.

                        <para>- -At the end of his report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bottomley</inline> supplies a map showing the cotton-growing countries of the world, from which I find that in seven different places British people have experimental areas. In four other places, the people of other countries have established experimental areas. I point out -that the members of the British Cotton-growing Association, which was started some three years ago, and is intensely interested in the growth of cotton, evidently do not think it wise to invest their capital haphazard in any locality, since they have established experimental areas in seven different parts of the world. I contend that we are not now in a position to grant this bounty. We require not so much the evidence of experts as practical tests before we shall be in a position to select suitable localities and proper seed. Honorable senators will say that that should &#39;be left to the growers, but I have pointed out that that is not the opinion of the British Cotton Growing Association, who have made many experiments to discover where they can commence to grow cotton on a large scale. I have read that if there is one industry which more than another must to be successful be carried on on a large scale, it is cotton-growing. In every part of the world where it is grown successfully it is grown on a verv large scale indeed. In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jenkins&#39;</inline> report I find this very significant statement - </para>

Honorable senators must therefore admit that we are undertaking an experiment while we are being asked to vote money as though we had made our experiments and our tests, and favorable results had been obtained. I do not think that this is the right way in which to proceed. If it is the will of the Committee that most of the items in the schedule should pass.

New Zealand flax is indigenous to that country ; according to statements made to me it grows practically wild there, and, speaking generally, its cultivation receives very little care and attention. </para>

The average was &#163;26 5s. 11d. per ton. I noticed the other. day that the price of sisal hemp in London was over &#163;30 per ton. </para>

                        <para>- Last Friday I visited the Agricultural Show, and was especially interested by a visit which I paid to the building occupied by the Agricultural Department of Victoria. I learnt from the experts in charge that experiments are being made in this State in the cultivation of New Zealand flax. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knight,</inline> the Government expert, told me that the Government has planted 50 acres in Gippsland. Further than that, we know that this hemp is being grown in some of the public gardens in Melbourne, though not for commercial purposes. The Victorian Government are anxious to establish the industry, because a ready market can be found for the product, which can be easily converted into rope and binder twine. It must not be understood that New Zealand flax is a plant that can only be grown in the cooler portions of the country. Expert opinion is that it can be grown in almost any part of Australia. As a ready market can be found for it, it is desirable to give it all the encouragement we can. I am not looking at the matter from a Victorian point of view, however. I am considering it from an Australian aspect. At the same time, the fact that experiments are being conducted in Victoria seems to indicate that those who are now engaged in the cultivation will be stimulated to further efforts by a bounty. It is probable that in a few years the industry will become a valuable and profitable one to the Commonwealth. I have therefore pleasure in supporting the item. </para>

                    <para>- - O - On the motion for the second reading, I suggested that the item New Zealand flax should be withdrawn from the schedule. My reason was that I thought it was undesirable to give bounties to two kindred industries and to have them trying to knock out each other in the market. I relied upon statements regarding New Zealand flax made by Messrs. Sei.fert and Smith, members of the New Zealand Flax Millers&#39; Association. Before going further, I would point out that they say - and I suppose they are to be relied upon - that the price of New Zealand flax in London last year was &#163;31 per ton. According to the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Agricultural Gazette,</inline> quoting from- the <inline font-style="italic">Public Ledger,</inline> the value of sisal hemp, on the 15th March last, was from &#163;18 to &#163;34 jos. per ton. Further reference is made to the views of Messrs. Seifert and Smith in the <inline font-style="italic">Agricultural Journal</inline> of Queensland for August.- This is an official publication, and the statement may therefore, I suppose, be relied upon. It states that these gentlemen -  paid a visit to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Boyd&#39;s</inline> plantation at the Broadwater, and also to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. T.</inline> H. Wells at Farnbro&#39;,  Childers. There they interested it number of Bundaberg farmers in the matter of the production of sisal hemp, and they stated that the abundance of cheap suitable&#34; land for the production of this fibre in Queensland, together with the slight cost of cultivation, and the simple method of cleaning the leaves in a single swift operation, - could go far towards extending this valuable industry, and so render our State a formidable competitor in the world&#39;s fibre trade. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> think it would be unwise to grow New Zealand flax unless there is evidence that it is likely to be successful. There is evidence to show that the flax growers of New Zealand themselves are inclined to leave New Zealand to grow sisal here, because it is more easily treated. Besides, we know that the market price is slightly higher for sisal. The manufacturers at the St. Louis Exhibition declared themselves in favour of sisal as opposed to New Zealand flax. It would be unwise, in my opinion, to give a bounty on both of these items, and the evidence seems to me to show that it would be better to give the bounty on sisal than on New Zealand flax. </para>

                    <para>There are several machines which are used for extracting New Zealand hemp, but they are all constructed on the same principle. The leaf is introduced between horizontal, fluted, revolving feed-rollers, by which it is crushed and held securely while being scraped. As it passes out, the epidermis and parenchymatous tissue are stripped off by means, of a beating-drum, revolving more rapidly than the feed-rollers, and carrying . flanges on its periphery, which press the leaf against a bar, and thus exert a scraping action. An arrangement is provided for adjusting the difference between this bar and the drum so that neither can the leaf pass through unstripped nor the fibres be cut. Vulcanized india rubber cushions or steel springs are placed oyer the journals of the upper feed-roller so as to accommodate the varying thickness of the leaves. The quality of the fibre produced depends largely on the form of the scrapers or beaters and the speed of revolution of the drum, but more on the ease and accuracy with which the machine can be adjusted. </para>

                    <para>To imperfect machinery and carelessness in the selection of green plants may be ascribed the apparent coarseness and the inferiority so often complained of in the flax exported from certain portions of New Zealand. But with improved flax dressing machinery and proper care exercised in the selection of the raw material, a very superior article can be produced. The fibre of Phormium Tenax is susceptible of a much higher degree of preparation than has been bestowed upon it up to the present. This, however, is not altogether the fault&#39; of those who are engaged in its manufacture ; it is for want of the necessary machinery. The hand-dressed article prepared by the natives is as fine as silk as compared with&#39; the modern-machine dressed flax of to-day. </para>
                    <para>This only demonstrates the fact that the fibre may be reduced to a much finer quality, and all that is necessary to do this is an improved machine. </para>

                    <para>When the colonists first arrived in New Zealand the valuable qualities of the Phormium fibre were well known, as it was in constant use by the natives, and constituted the first article of barter in the trade carried on by the Maoris with Europeans. A very considerable trade in the fibre existed as early as 1828, when the Islands were only visited by whalers and Sydney traders, &#163;50,000 worth being sold in Sydney between 1828 and 1832. A factory for the manufacture of articles from New Zealand hemp was established at Grimsby, in Lincolnshire, in 1832, but failed for some unexplained cause, notwithstanding that the results at the time were regarded as satisfactory. From 1853 to1860 the average annual value of the fibre exported was &#163;2,500, reaching as high as &#163;5,000 in 1855; but up to that time the only fibre exported was that prepared by native labour, no machinery of any kind being used. In1860, therefore, when the native disturbances affected the Waikato and other interior districts of the North Island, the production was confined to the native tribes north of Auckland, so that in 1861 the export fell to 2 tons, of value &#163;43.. Attempts were then made to devise machinery by means of which the fibre could be profitably extracted by European labour. About this time the increasing demand for white rope and the limited quantity of Manila hemp available led to a rise in the value of New Zealand hemp from &#163;21 to &#163;56 per ton, and even to &#163;76 in America during the Civil War. These high prices stimulated the endeavour to introduce Phormium to compete with Manila, and several machines were invented for rapidly producing the fibre from the green leaf. With these machines the export trade again increased, so that from1866 to1871 the yearly average was about &#163;56,000. The total quantity exported between 1864 and 1876 amounted to 26,434 tons, valued at &#163;592,218. </para>

                    <para>In order to encourage the industry the New Zealand Department of Agriculture has repeatedly offered bonuses for a machine which should be an improvement on the machines or processes in use, and which should be found to reduce materially the cost of production, improve the product, or increase the yield of dressed fibre. Another bonus was offered for a process for utilizing the waste products of the hemp. A considerable number of inquiries were made with regard to these bonuses, but apparently nothing resulted beyond some slight improvements in existing machines, and the adaptation of machines used in the preparation of other fibres. </para>
                    <para>Owing to the complaints of rope and cordage manufacturers with regard to the lack of uniformity in New Zealand hemp, parcels brought under the same classification and shipped from the same port varying in colour and preparation, the Government passed an Act in 1901 providing for the establishment of a grading station for the compulsory grading of all hemp exported. As a result of this the quality of the fibre rapidly improved, and the confidence of buyers has been secured. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be seen that in New Zealand the industry was started in a comparatively casual way, and that it was developed under conditions which were anything but highly favorable. &#39; Apart altogether from those facts, when the. industry had attained to some dimensions, and the hemp was being exported for sale, it still had to go subject to these two very glaring difficulties, first that it had not always been cultivated as well as it might have been, and secondly, that the leaves themselves had not been dressed by the most efficient machinery for the production of the largest quantity and best quality of fibre. Again, superadded to that, the industry has experienced a difficulty, in that many of the shipments from the same port, and of apparently the same quality, opened up in the markets abroad very variously, and it became necessary then for the Legislature to make the grading of hemp for export compulsory. Since then, according to the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin of the Imperial Institute,</inline> the  quality of the fibre has rapidly improved, and the confidence of the buyers has been secured. Further on appears an interesting table giving the quantity and value of the exports of New Zealand hemp for every fifth year from 1856 to 1896, and for each year from 1897 to 1905. They range from 2 tons in 1861 - the extraordinary year to which reference was made in a quotation I made just now - 22 tons in 1856, and 45 tons in 1866, up to 27,877 tons, of a value of ?696,467, in 1905. In 1904, the total quantity of New Zealand hemp, including tow, exported amounted to 28,137 tons, of the value of ?714,147, and was distributed as follows :-TO the United Kingdom, 19,918 tons, of the value of ?506,832 ; to the United States of America, 3,949 tons, of the value of ?106,872. The rest went to South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and other countries in much smaller proportions. As evidencing the fact that this is a hemp that might with profit be commercially grown outside New Zealand, the article goes on to show what has been done in St. Helena - </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">Phormium tenax</inline>has been planted somewhat largely in St. Helena, and was cultivated successfully during the years 1S76-1S80. The largest amount of fibre exported in any one year was 615 bales in 1879, and the greatest value of the export (^1,890) was reached in 1880. A factory was established at Jamestown for extracting the fibre, but, as this was several .miles distant from the plantations, the cost of transport absorbed all the profit. The question of reviving this industry in St. Helena came to the front in 1904; and in 1905 an attempt was made to extract the fibre on a commercial scale. This effort did not meet with much success, owing partly to the difficulty of raising the necessary capital and partly to the fact that the machinery purchased was not altogether satisfactory. A further endeavour is being made at the present time to re-establish the industry with Government assistance, and under the guidance of an expert from New Zealand. Samples of the fibre which have been forwarded from St. Helena to the Imperial Institute have been found to be of very good marketable quality. </para>

                    <para>From a careful estimation, it is thought that this crop can be made to yield from ^15 to <inline font-style="italic">?20</inline> per acre when properly established. -It will take from 4 to 5 years to become established, but after that an annual cutting may with care be made. In New Zealand, where the plants in their natural state are well and closely established, as much as <inline font-style="italic">?9</inline> or ?10 per acre is given by the millers for the right of cutting, which is done every third year; the plant is then cut down close to the ground, which . is a serious check to its growth, consequently it would not be possible to give any accurate description of what the yield would be when cut annually and the matured leaves only selected. </para>

                <para class="block">It is obvious that the method adopted ir? New Zealand does hot commend itself to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knight,</inline> who evidently considers that the plant should not be cut sp. close- to the ground, and that the leaves should not be taken indiscriminately. In spite of the adverse conditions, and the unscientific and crude methods adopted in the past, the industry has thriven remarkably well in New Zealand. We can confidently hope that by encouraging our own people to give proper attention to the cultivation of this plant in the Commonwealth, we may not only rival the New Zealand output, but with our much more extensive territory soon outstrip it, and put upon the markets of the world a very suitable hemp which would hold&#34; its own under ordinary conditions with what are now regarded as the world&#39;s superior productions. I confidently commend to the kindly consideration of the Committee the proposal to give ? bounty for New Zealand hemp. </para>

                    <para>.- T hardly think that the extracts which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has just read, lengthy though they be, have answered the information and facts contained in the extracts read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> from which J gathered that some difficulty is found ir? preparing New Zealand hemp for market, that the machines used are more costly than those for other fibres, and that some of the flax-growers of New Zealand are actually giving up growing flax there, and proceeding to parts of the Commonwealth, because they can grow sisal hemp&#34; here better - an article which is more easily prepared for market. The extracts read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> confirm the .sentence which J. read to the Senate, during the second reading debate, to the effect that before the New Zealanders made the growing of flax payable they lost about &#163;150,000 over it. Now, after establishing it, they find that another fibre can be more easily prepared, and, in the Commonwealth, more easily grown. All this goes to show that we have hardly entered the experimental stage. The Minister lias reminded us of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> said about the Victorian Government planting 50 acres in Gippsland with New Zealand flax, to see if it can be profitably grown here. That bears out my argument that the States Governments ought to tackle this question through their Departments of Agriculture, and plant considerable areas, so that if it is a success they will have a sufficient quantity to use in factories or to export. Bounties amounting to &#163;22,000 a year for four different kinds of fibre are a great deal too much. I hope the Committee will support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> in leaving out the first of these four items. One of these flaxes or hemps must be better than others. If New Zealanders are finding out that New Zealand flax is not so good as sisal hemp, and are coming here to grow sisal, that ought to be a warning to us. </para>

                    <para>. - It is my intention to vote against this item.&#39; Some very strong reasons against its inclusion in the schedule have already been given. I direct attention to another. If we are to give in every instance the maximum amount in each year during which the bounties are to be payable we shall have to expend altogether &#163;533,000, whereas the Bill appropriates only &#163;412,500. If the full&#39; amount of the bounty proposed for New Zealand flax were given over the ten years period provided for,- the amount so expended would be &#163;30,000, and if this item be not agreed to so much of the &#163;120,500, . which we are not authorized by the Bill to spend, will be accounted for. I point out that if these items are all agreed to it will be very awkward after a time to say how much should be devoted as bounty in each year with respect to each item. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has stated that New Zealand flax compares unfavorably with sisal hemp. It has been said that what can be grown in New Zealand can equally well be grown here, but it is apparently forgotten that- the New Zealand climate differs from the climate of a very great part of Australia. They have in New  Zealand a splendid rainfall, regular seasons, and good soil, and there is one important condition which cannot be found here, and that is that the natives of New Zealand cultivate the flax. </para>

                        <para>- The statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> with regard to sisal hemp should carry some weight, but surely some importance should also be attached to the statement made by the Minister in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway.</inline> Conclusive evidence has been given that during the present year New Zealand flax has realized a much higher price in the English market than the sisal hemp, about which so much was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway.</inline> We know that in Victoria, under Government supervision, experiments are now being made in the cultivation of New Zealand flax. In conversation with me the other day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knight,</inline> one of the Victorian Government experts, stated that because of the manner in which the hemp was being treated in New Zealand there was a growing fear that it would not be very long before the plant would be exterminated from that Colony. It is because of its high quality and the high prices being realized for it that the Government of Victoria, acting on the advice of their experts, are experimenting, with a view to the establishment of the industry in this State. As the Minister has pointed out, the Imperial Government have in the  past few years been experimenting in the cultivation of New Zealand flax. The bulk of the evidence goes to prove that the growth of this article is an industry which should be encouraged,- and as I- presume we are anxious to secure the establishment of industries which will be of advantage, not merely to one State, but to the whole of the Commonwealth, . I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> will not persist in his objection to this item. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) &#91;7.53&#93;. - I oppose this item, and I make no secret of the fact that I shall oppose every item in the schedule, because I see no justification for heaping these burdens upon the people. The proposal that the people should be taxed to the tune of 150, 200, and 250 per cent, on articles of every day use in order that a bounty may be paid on the cultivation of a weed is one of the most scandalous outrages which any Ministry in any part of Australia, or of the world, ever mustered sufficient courage to be guilty of. I am not surprised at the outrageousness of the proposition coming from a. Government who have . recently given us an example of their capacity to vote in support of slander, and libel upon people who are not here to defend themselves. A Ministry that can do that sort of thing can vote to tax the people of* Australia, in the interests of wildcat schemes for which there is no justification in fact or sense. My honorable friends opposite may smile, and think that there is no method in my madness, but they will find that there is a great deal of method in my madness if they regard me as mad. As one who lived for some years as a boy in New Zealand, and who knows something about flax, I point out that, so far as Australia is concerned, this article is cultivated only by Chinamen for the tying up of bundles of vegetables. In this proposal the Government are appearing as advocates of Chinese labour. They are advocating the payment of a bounty to Chinamen to grow flax with which to tie up bundles of vegetables, and they gammon that this is establishing a great national industry. Great national industry be hanged ! </para>

New Zealand flax grows in a part of the Pacific which ought to be, and which would be, Australian waters if the present Government did their duty.

                <para class="block">South Wales, to wit. This Government, this national Government, this Government that was going to dominate the Pacific, this tin-pot, barbed- wire-taxing Government, have not enough manhood, and not enough of what St. Paul calls &#34;bowels of mercy &#34; - but to which I might apply a simpler and much more efficacious term, which I will lea.ve to the imagination of honorable senators - to take this little island in the Pacific, which is governed from Australia, under the brooding wings of their protectionist extravagance. Honorable senators will, no doubt, remember in connexion with the history of this interesting island, against which Captain Cook bumped up one morning, that there was some talk of the growing of flax&#39; there, and as soon as settlement had been made on the mainland of Australia, Lieutenant Philip Gidley King, of the <inline font-style="italic">Sirius</inline> frigate, was sent in command of the tender brig <inline font-style="italic">Supply,</inline> with a small party, to occupy Norfolk Island and cultivate the flax to be found there. Lieutenant Philip Gidley King afterwards became Captain Philip Gidley King, and the third Governor of Australia - because New South, Wales at that time was Australia, and it is a pity that it is not Australia today. New South Wales as a State has shown more capacity for developing national interests than the whole of the blessed caboodle called the Commonwealth has done. Lieutenant King&#39;s party expected to find a plant something like the European flax plant, and it was by mere accident that they discovered that the flax they were looking for was what they had described as a plant of the Iris family. This  is of importance, because we are dealing now with a proposal to develop an industry which was conceived in infamy and promoted by kidnapping. To the eternal disgrace of  certain  British officials, a ship was sent, I think* in command of the well-known explorer, Vancouver, to New Zealand to kidnap natives to be carried to Norfolk Island to develop the cultivation of the New Zealand flax - a public nuisance of a weed, the cultivation of which, after a lapse of 120 years or thereabouts we are asked to encourage in Australia by a tax upon the people. They did kidnap a number of natives, and the history of the affair is to be found in the <inline font-style="italic">Historical Records</inline> of New South Wales, if honorable senators are studious enough to consult them. These people had their little idea as to how to develop the flax industry. Here I must give credit to my honorable friends opposite. They know more -about the matter than did the officers of the British Navy 100 years ago. These officers kidnapped a couple of New Zealand chiefs - -just as if a New Zealand chieftain was such, a miserable slave as to know much about anything but war ! What became of the experiment I do not know, except that after some time these unfortunate kidnapped chiefs were returned to New Zealand; and from that day flax on Norfolk Island has never been recognised as- anything better than a pestilential weed. And here are my honorable friends, who know no more about New Zealand flax than they know about the Solar System as understood by the Grand Llama of Thibet, coming here with the proposal to pick the pockets of the people by means of a schedule for the cultivation of what is no better than a weed in a Chinese market garden ! </para>

                        <para>- I always appreciate a remark according to the quarter from which it comes, and treat it accordingly. We are taxing the people to the extent of 40 or 50 per cent, on wire netting to keep rabbits out, in order that this bounty may be achieved for the cultivation of a weed. I will be no party to voting a bounty on flax which can only be paid for by raising the money through a tax on fencing wire. We are asked to spend &#163;30,000 to encourage the cultivation of New Zealand flax. How can it be New Zealand flax if it is grown in Australia? Tt will be Australian flax, and I suppose there will be some &#34;  tiddlewinking  &#34; on that point. But to tax the netting which is necessary to protect growing crops to the tune of), hundreds of thousands of pounds, under the pretence of benefiting the  people of the Commonwealth by the growth of New Zealand flax, is a proposal that cannot commend itself to any one outside a lunatic asylum.

For that reason it was considered desirable to cultivate it. But is that the proposition before us?

We can imagine that 15 points represent the best article, and 7 points an article of 50 per cent, lower quality. I have had a very large and long experience as a fire and marine underwriter, and I know that there is nothing under Heaven more dangerous than New Zealand flax as an article to put in a ship&#39;s hold, or in a warehouse. How many fine ships have gone to the bottom, burned from truck to water line as the result of carrying a cargo of New Zealand flax? How many fine stores in my own little city on Port Jackson have been destroyed by fire as the result of the stowage of a few bales of New Zealand flax? It is about as dangerous an article to handle as is gunpowder with a box of colonial-made matches in its immediate vicinity, and a few rats to set them alight. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator will not require anything of the kind. I know that he objects to anything like a deadly weapon. A gentleman who, with a capacity for eloquence unrivalled in the State, could slaughter a great modern newspaper, need not look for any more dangerous weapon than his own eloquence and splendid intellect. The original trade in New Zealand flax led to the destruction of the splendid Polynesian race who inhabited that country. It almost wiped them off the face of the earth. Traders from Australia went over there in the early part of last century, and their great game was to obtain flax. It was not cultivated as is proposed by this bounty, but grew as a weed. The natives worked day and night at dressing the leaves with the shell popularly known as Venus&#39; ear, and the flax, in bales, was exchanged for old Tower muskets weighing up to 20 lbs., and kicking like a Californian mule. Everything was done to achieve a great production of bales of flax to exchange for the old Brown Besses,- and as soon as a sufficient number of them were obtained off went the flax traders, leaving the natives to make a deadly assault upon the people of the next tribe, just as my honorable friends opposite are making a deadly assault on the pockets of Australians through the medium of this bounty. They are no better than political buccaneers; in fact, they are no better than the semi-piratical traders of the old days on the New Zealand coast, who handed over to the savages thousands of wretched old weapons with which to slaughter their, enemies. Then the next phase of this awful traffic in flax came to the front. The. heads of the natives who were shot with the Tower muskets were carefully cured, and the cured heads became the chief export of New Zealand when flax growing was pretty well at&#39; an end. That sort of thing has gone on with the knowledge of every man who has any right to be considered an Australian by virtue of knowing what has happened in the country in which he lives. I suppose that only a few persons like myself, who was imported fifty years ago, really know much about these matters. I do not think that the average Australian takes enough interest in the country of his birth ; he would rather read Deadwood Dick novels. There is a good deal to be said about the other kind of flax, but  1  shall deal simply with the question of New Zealand flax. One attribute of that article has not been mentioned in this debate I am quite sure, and that is the splendid cover which it afforded to the natives of New Zealand when they were fighting against the British in the sixties - not because they had any more excuse than that they would not sell any lands of their own, and did not want anybody else to sell. Having had a personal connexion with that war, and knowing something of its history, I can tell honorable senators that the .New Zealand flax affords magnificent cover &#39;for infantry troops defending a locality in which it grows. It will grow to a height of quite 15 feet from the ground. Of course I do not mean to suggest that the leaves of the flax are of that length. They are perhaps from  6  to  8  feet long, but they grow from a big tuft of root which has gradually grown up just like a fern or palm tree grows, only that it is less ornate. This big tuft of rough matter grows to a height of from 2 to 3 feet above the ground. I suppose that it could not be battered down with artillery. Australia is taking no adequate steps to defend its shores by present methods, unless it is- by running in small schoolboys. If it is proposed to give </para>

                        <para>bounty for growing New Zealand flax to afford cover for the Defence Force along the coasts, there is some sense in the proposal, but to spend the money -in growing the article for the benefit of Chinese market-gardeners is ridiculous.  In order that honorable senators may have an idea of how it grows, I shall read some extracts from the evidence taken by the Select Committee whose report I have quoted. On Wednesday, the 27th September, 1905, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irven</inline> Willis Raymond, the first witness, was examined, and in reply to the  Chairman  he said that he was a merchant of Invercargill. I admit that I cannot, speak with any degree of positiveness about the flax grown at the far south end of New Zealand, because I have never been there. My knowledge of the flax is of very much more importance for the purpose of this discussion, because I know the flax as grown in the North Island, in a climate very much more akin to that of the more southerly part of Australia - not so far south as Tasmania, but as far north perhaps as Newcastle, in New South Wales, or Perth, in Western Australia. It approximates to the climate to be found in those portions of Australia, not only as to temperature, but also as to atmosphere, being more or less damp, and rain- falls more frequently than it does in the North. Of course, my remarks have reference to the coastal portions of Australia only, because New Zealand flax will no more grow inland than it will grow on the comet, which can be seen if one remains out of bed long enough at night. New Zealand flax will not grow without frequent rain ; it will not grow in a. cold-pinched climate so freely as it does in the more generous climates I have referred to. The first witness&#39;s examination occupied an entire day, and apparently he did not know very much about the subject. On the day following a flax-miller was examined, and I am sure that honorable senators will take particular interest in what he says, though the words of the merchant concerned in the export of the flax would, no doubt, give them a few points in connexion with- the . exploiting of the taxpayers in favour of this ridiculous industry. When such a thing is called an industry, the state of pettifog to which the Federal Parliament has descended becomes absolutely appalling. I thought that this was to be a great national Parliament. Instead, we are peddling away with a preposterous proposition to pay a bounty of ?30,000 in ten years for the growth of a common weed. . The flax industry has been, up to a certain point, the New Zealand edition of the Australian rabbit industry, which arose out of the rabbit curse. Will any one tell me that soil can be put to no better use than growing this weed? New .Zealand flax might answer the purpose of fodder for the festive Angora goat, for which it is also proposed to vote a large bounty. There might be something in it if the Government put New Zealand flax and Angora goats together at a bounty of so much per ton, whichever weighs the heaviest.

I think it would be well if I gave a little information as. to the condition of the industry last year in Southland. I have not travelled in the North island sufficiently extensively to speak about the conditions of the industry there. Last year was the boom year in Southland in so far as the flax industry was concerned, and I am satisfied that unless the replanting of flax is very vigorously pushed forward Southland will never reach the output of last season. There were seventy mills working in Southland last year with an export from the port of Bluff of 6,100 tons - that is, up to the 31st March - while 300 tons went  northward, making altogether 6,400 tons of fibre produced in Southland. This represented a value of ?167,000. </para>

                <para class="block">That looks like a big industry which is well worthy of attention, but the value of the export was nothing like the value of rabbits exported from Australia, amounting to ?1,000,000 or more. But who will propose a bounty for rabbits? The only one that I know of is the proposal to tax wire-netting in the new Tariff. Large as are the figures I have , quoted, they are&#39; no proof that the export of flax represents any advantage to New Zealand, any more than the giant size of the Australian rabbit export trade  represents anything but a national curse. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Raymond&#39;s</inline> evidence continues - </para>

                <para>Here we have 85 per cent.. of mills that did not pay, and of the  15  per cent. that did pay, none earned more than&#163;1,000 a year. This is a glorious industry to drag over from New Zealand and start here with a bounty. It is absolutely incredible that any Administration with the smallest excuse for remaining outside the gates of Yarra Bend should put forward such a proposal. The witness goes on to say - - that with a fair approximation, fully &#163;20,000 was lost in milling - </para>
                <para>This is a nice proposal to submit as an excuse for a bounty.Ofwhat use will &#163;3,000  a year be to an industry in which, in its own habitat, &#163;20,000 a year is lost? Who instigated  this lunatic Administration to propose anything so hair-brained and so utterly comic opera? The witness continued -  instead of &#163;20,000 being won - you will see that it is time this Committee or some other Committee took the matter up and endeavoured to stop the leakage. </para>
                <para>To stop the leakage ! Why, this is a demand on the pockets of the people to bolster up an absurdity in the name of establishing a national industry. The witness continued -  because the expenditure of this money, while very advantageous to the employes and plant manufacturers, means ruination to the mill-owners, and this falls to some extent on the community. </para>
                <para class="block">Of course it does. Every &#163;1 that is not earning a profit or interest is a waste to the community. This loss of &#163;20,000 every year, whilst it falls in the first instance on a few men who are ruined, extends throughout the .community. We lose as much in Australia now in the lost endeavours of Australian energy as is beneficial to us as a community. I call Australia the land of lost endeavour, for there is perhaps no country in the world that is so pock-marked all over with evidences of human failure and loss. We do not want to add to these channels of leakage and to these intolerable assaults on the well-being of the struggling souls on the soil by bringing here a wretched weed and encouraging its cultivation by a bounty. The proposal is unheard of as a public scandal. In most of the States of the Commonwealth, and, to my knowledge, in Western Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales, large sums of money are being spent to instruct the people on the .soil as to the most suitable crops for different belts of country. Money is being expended in experimental crops to act as guides to farmers. Who will afford guidance in connexion with this absurdity? There is no Commonwealth. Department of Agriculture. Only the other day honorable senators rejected a proposal for the establishment of something of the kind which would have been q&#163; use perhaps in teaching people where to plant this flax, if it is to be planted in Australia. It will not be planted here, with my permission, under these conditions. I am satisfied to leave the Chinamen to tie up their bundles of parsnips with it. Referring to what I said just now of the lost endeavour of men who have, with hardihood unequalled, and courage beyond all praise, attempted the growth of vegetation of one kind or another in different parts of Australia, I suppose that tor one who has succe&#233;ded a thousand have failed. One could not travel along some of the main railway lines in New South Wales a few years ago, before the system of . instruction for the growers was in vogue,, without passing vast pipe-clay patches, where men, with all the courage of strong hearts and the energy of strong right hands, had started to grow wheat on a pipe-clay bottom, knowing no better. Who knows any better where to plant flax in Australia? I may be speaking a little more strongly than- usual on this occasion, but surely I have warrant for it? It is impossible to introduce into the country exotics such as New Zealand flax and Angora goats and expect these exotic industries to be carried on with success without instruction. Are we to introduce flax seeds or plants from New Zealand ; and are we to dibble them in the sand down at Scarborough, or whatever the name of the place is? I have seen land on the Brighton line that would be very suitable for the growth, of New&#39; Zealand flax, but it is at present utilized for market gardens, and market gardening at Brighton pays better than a return of  85  per cent, of failures in the flax industry in New Zealand. New Zealand flax cannot be grown on sand hills or on basalt ridges. You must have damp flats for its cultivation. I quote again from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Raymond&#39;s</inline> evidence - </para>
                <para>The question naturally arises, what is the cause of this great loss in handling the raw material ? </para>

                <para>I think the primary cause is incompetency in -management. </para>
                <para class="block">If in the home of the New Zealand &#34;flax plant after British people have been trained there for 100 years, and have been handling and preparing the article for at least fifty years, we find one of the large operators in the industry admitting that there is great loss in the handling of the raw material, and that that loss is due to incompetency, I ask, where on earth is the element of competency to be found in the Commonwealth? Who is competent to conduct the industry here? Whom are the Government going to get to give useful information to the unhappy people who will venture their all in the hope of scooping some of this &#163;30,000? I denounce this proposal, as I. shall denounce others in the schedule, as a most unworthy effort to lead honest men from endeavours to achieve a competency for themselves and . their families, when these producers of experience in New Zealand, with all the assistance derived from the aboriginal race, are unable to make a success of the industry. When I speak of the aboriginal race of New Zealand, I do not mean that the Maoris are absolutely aboriginal, because the Maoris came as the successors of an earlier race, the remnants of whom are now to be found in the Chatham Islands. The present Maori race probably came, not, as some wise-acres have said, from Central Asia, but from Central America, and are the descendants of the ancient people of Maya. </para>

If the New Zealand people, with the assistance of the natives in New Zealand, who for generations have handled flax, and if the Britishers, who have handled it with all the resources of machinery, cannot produce it successfully, what kind of fate may be expected to overtake those inhabitants of this country who, induced by this miserable, contemptible, degrading little bounty, are likely to be led from reasonable paths of industry into an agricultural gamble  to win a stake, not to achieve an industry ? The result will be similar to that which occurred in the case of a factory which was established in Victoria a few years ago, when a bounty of .&#163;5,000 was spent for the production of so many yards of tweed. A factory was expressly built, machinery was put into it, the tweed was made, and the bounty was paid. I suppose that any one could have bought the remnants of that industry a little while after for a few pounds. It went into liquidation. A similar fate overtook the Maffra sugar business. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Raymond</inline> also said - </para>

With a view to curtailing my remarks as far as possible, I shall not discuss where the fuel is to come from beyond saying that if it is to be the brown coal of Victoria, Heaven help the unfortunate people, but that if it is to be the good coal of New South Wales, there may be a chance for  them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Raymond</inline> continues - </para>

                <para class="block">Is there one member of the Senate - I dare swear there is no Minister - who has the remotest knowledge of the cost of the machinery suitable to handle a single acre of flax? Here we see the initial difficulties staring us in the face. On those points at least I speak with personal knowledge, although it is a long time since .it was gained. As regards the manufacture of flax, I confess that I know nothing, but I have informed myself, as I hope others have been informed, by the evidence of this manufacturer and exporter. I may tell the Vice-President of the Executive Council that I have been quoting the evidence of the owner of six mills, and a very large exporter, &#34;who told a Select Committee in New Zealand that  85  per cent, of- the mills in Southland have been a failure,- and that not one of the others has earned more than &#163;1,000 a year. Where is the excuse for offering this bounty ? First of all there is the difficulty of soil, climate, and rainfall ; next there is the&#39; supreme difficulty of knowing how best to grow the plant under exotic- conditions, and then come the questions of. putting .up buildings, purchasing machinery, and running it. We are told here over and over again that only men of large experience who have made a success of the industry are suitable as Government guides to assist the people who live amongst the flax to make a success of its. growth or manufacture. How can it be grown here under conditions of complete novelty, and with no instruction? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Raymond</inline> continues - </para>

They have, however, stated that they think we aim at too fine a class of fibre - that a coarser fibre would suit their requirements, and would suit them better providing the fibre was entirely free from diseased leaf, knots, and other evidence of imperfect stripping,  4uc.l1  as backs and feather edges. In that connexion I am inclined to think, though a miller, that the. Government Grader should&#39; seriously penalize the miller who sends in stripped diseased leaf among &#34;good fair&#34; fibre. &#34;As far as my own mills are concerned, I have sent out circulars to the millers, telling them that when the classers find a diseased leaf they should put it to one side, and if it is not seriously destroyed &#34;by worm, it, it could be put through the mill afterwards and used in a lower grade fibre. </para>

I have been asked for the No.  2  grade {&#34; fine &#34;), but only on rare occasions. I think ten points only between the various grades would <inline font-style="italic">te</inline> a desirable change.

                    <para>In support of this contention, one has only to possess the knowledge of the value assessed <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> home buyers on &#34;fair&#34; fibre as against &#34;good fair&#34; for the last year or so. Three years ago about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;i</inline> a ton was considered a fair margin,  but  latterly from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 10s. to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> per ton has been insisted upon, because the home buyer, while buying fair fibre that might reach 70 points or 73 points, stood a chance of receiving fibre that went only 60 points - one point removed from &#34; common &#34; - therefore he had to base his calculation on the minimum grade that he might bc supplied&#39; with. This marginal allowance meant a serious loss to the miller, and I believe the excessive range in points has had a great deal to do with the disinclination of home buyers to operate freely for the  &#34; fair &#34; grade. </para>

There is another matter which I air. satisfied, should be given effect to, and that is a reform in the method of tagging. &#39;&#39;At present graders place a tag at one end of the bale denoting the grade, which can easily be removed in transit or at home, and another tag substituted. </para>

                    <para>In Southland, owing to the ravages of stock, the cutting of , flax in the winter time or off season, and the cultivation of the land, I am satisfied we shall never reach within 50 per cent, of last season&#39;s output unless flax planting is vigorously proceeded with. With this object in view I am of opinion that the Government should consider the advisableness of empowering the Land Boards to acquire suitable areas from existing pastoral tenants or small grazing run-holders when such! are applied for, because in many such cases the land is not bringing in a halfpenny per acre to the Crown, while it is capable of growing flax suitable for milling and flax containing the least amount of vegetation. </para>

This witness, who is an experienced man, advocates the taking in hand of the industry as a Government affair, but the Minister in charge of this Bill throws down his &#163;30,000 bribe at the expense of the taxpayers, saying, in effect, &#34; You can scramble for it.&#34; I would sooner put my money into Tattersall&#39;s sweeps, although I have never put a copper into them yet. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Raymond</inline> gives particulars of cost, which will give honorable members some idea of what they are so lightheartedly entering upon - </para>

                <para class="block">Here is a beautiful chance for our people to grow flax as an exotic in Australia for a bounty, and get 13s. 6d. per ton for it. I do not wonder that this information falls with a chill on the Vice-President of the Executive. Council, who is responsible for this proposal as one of half-a-dozen ignorant enthusiasts. I do not use the term &#34; ignorant &#34; offensively, and perhaps I had better say that they are enthusiasts lacking knowledge. We are being asked to vote &#163;30,000 as a bounty to induce people to grow flax worth 13s. 6d. per ton. The witness continued - but the royalty is low, the flax is convenient to the mill, and cutting is only 4s. per ton. The average price last year was 5s. 6d. to 6s. </para>

We have therefore three differences in the condition of the industry within a very small area. These differences will be intensified tenfold here, in view of the differences of climate and rainfall, which will be found in the portions of Australia in which people might unhappily be induced to make useless efforts in pursuit of this <inline font-style="italic">ignis fatuus</inline> of a bounty.

A good percentage of it goes away  undumped  and does not require to go into a shed at all. The merchants and millers feel very keenly where they are compelled to have two or three cartages. Where they are compelled to take it into the dumping shed and out again, they feel that that is a great hardship. At the beginning of &#39;this month I determined not to sell my flax, that I would send it into the store. I must cart it to the dumping shed, cart it in and out again, and if I do not want to have it dumped I &#34;have to pay rs. per ton storage for it. My people have a good shed.

I gave instructions to put the flax in this shed at the beginning of the month, waiting for a rise. &#39; It goes into the shed, and when it is sold I have to have it carted out to get graded. If it is not going into the shipping company&#39;s vessels, not going to be dumped, I have to pay an extra charge for cartage. What we would ask the Committee to recommend is that within a radius of three-quarters of a mile of the shipping any merchant should have the option of putting any quantity of flax he likes in a shed, and have it graded there without any expense of removal attached to it. I often get a telegram, &#34; Send me down till you have got.

There are times and seasons affecting plant life, and it is the same in regard to animal life, which militate against success. Plants just like animals and human beings, become sterile under unfavorable conditions. That remark particularly applies to exotics. Is it not a well known fact that in India Europeans become sterilized in four generations? The same applies to plants when the conditions under which they are grown are unfavorable to their perpetuation.

Another question referred to by the last witness was the raw material. This is a question that all the millers are anxious about, because undoubtedly the more we cut our flax the weaker it gets-, and we find in time the Quantity obtained per acre is much lower than it was. some years ago. Many in the Manawatu district have, been planting flax-both with seeds and with plants, and we have been fairly successful; but I should like to point out that there are a number of different qualities of flax. Some will produce one ton of fibre from  &#60;64  tons of the raw material, while others will produce <inline font-style="italic">io\</inline> tons per ton of&#39; heap.
