                        <para>The readers&#39; assistants are employed in reading from the original to the readers, who check the proofs. The average number employed is nine. Their wages range from 7s. to ros. per week, the rate being slightly higher than that fixed by the Printers&#39; Board. Their average.. &#39;ige &#62;s over 15. The boys are, as a rule, employed on day work one week and on night work on the following week, but on an average about six boys volunteer each week to do night work in preference to day work. Those doing night work are employed in reading typewritten copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> They usually work from 5.30 p.m. to 4 a.m. on four days of the week, and are free for the rest of the time. The total number of working hours is 42 per week. As the work of the Commonwealth and the State Governments is done by the same employes, it would not be practicable for the scale of payment to be different. </para>

I desire to ask the honorable gentleman whether it is not possible to give them more compensation than that for the work performed ? It is not true that that kind of work is performed by boys in any other part of Australia. </para>

                (New South Wales)  &#91;3.19&#93;.  - I desire  at  this stage of the Bill  to  refer at once  to  certain matters which, at a later stage, I shall have to deal with separately. I beg  to  ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council if, when he replies  to  the debate, he will give the Senate some definite information with reference  to  the legal process that was issued by the Commonwealth Government against the State of New South Wales in respect of an historic seizure of wire netting. On most authoritative information, I understand that the facts are these : That the Commonwealth Government issued a process against the Attorney-General of New South Wales, and made that process the basis of an application for an injunction. After going  to  some very considerable expense, as I think there was a heavy bar engaged, the Commonwealth Government made the remarkable discovery that they had gone about the business in. the wrong way, by issuing a process in the wrong name, and they have never from that day  to  this dared  to  take any further legal proceedings in respect of the matter. I should not make a statement of this kind unless  on  the highest authority, and that I may not be misunderstood, I repeat that I am informed that the Commonwealth Government issued a legal process against the Attorney-General of the State of New South Wales in respect  to  the seizure of wire netting, seeking  to  recover penalties for that seizure, and made it the basis of further proceedings, in equity I presume, for an injunction, and finally had  to  drop the whole business because they had started in the wrong manner, had issued the process in the name of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth instead of in the name of the Minister of Trade and Customs,  or  something of that kind. I do not wish  to  tie myself  too  closely  to a  statement of the exact form in which the process was issued, but it suffices  to  say that it was issued in the wrong name and in incorrect circumstances, and the whole pack of cards came tumbling down. That is one thing I hope the Minister will tell us something about when he replies to the debate. I am not in the habit of taking up the time of the Senate with matters of a military character. It is a long time since I did so, but I&#39; take advantage of this opportunity to bring certain matters of the kind before the Senate. I think it might be a courteous thing if the Minister at the head of the Defence Department was informed that I propose to deal with some matters affecting his Department.

                    <para>- If the honorable senator will be so courteous to the Minister and to myself. The first matter to which I wish to refer is one in connexion with which it seems to me a serious illegality has occurred. On the  9th  August of this year Statutory Rule No.  84  was passed under the Defence Act, necessarily by the Governor- General with the advice of the Executive Council. It is scarcely credible, and I would not believe it if I had not the printed document before me, that on the  20th  of the month, eleven days after the rule had been passed, the Military Board - because the document is signed by &#34; S. A. Pethebridge, Secretary Military Board&#34; - issued &#34;certain military orders. The one to which I wish particularly to refer is Military Order No  208.  The Board, in issuing this order, absolutely took upon themselves illegally to set aside the decision of the Governor-General in Council, and to set aside, vary, or amend Regulation  98.  What is the nature of the alteration which has been made ? I know that military matters do not interest honorable senators very much. They form a fine subject for . talk in after-dinner speeches, but do not attract much attention here. However, that will not prevent me putting the matter forward for very serious consideration. There are in some of the States volunteer regiments the members of which receive no remuneration of any kind whatever for their services. In the State from which I come there are four of these regiments, in addition to corps. It has hitherto been the practice for officers commanding these regiments to manage, by careful handling of the parliamentary capitation grants, to find enough money to supply their men with boots to wear with their military uniforms when engaged in military work.

I have refreshed my memory by looking up the vouchers, and I may say that before the Commonwealth Parliament imposed Customs duties we were able to supply our men with military cossacks at 6s. 6d. a pair, and very fair boots at that, just as good as the &#39;boots which now, under the operation of the Federal duties, cost 9s. 6d. per pair.

However, what I am taking exception to is the fact that a departmental order has been issued by the Military Board altering what is practically statute law, in the shape of a regulation adopted by the Governor-General in Council. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator is very kind, and I thank him for his consideration. This is what I wish to call attention to. It is a detail that the price of these boots has been increased by about 50 per cent., but the departmental order issued, setting aside the statutory rule passed by the Governor- General in Council, has had this effect, that instead of the men being supplied with boots as hitherto, they are required to pay half the price, and the expense of repairs. I presume that these military rules are correctly printed and issued by order as they are signed by S. A. Pethebridge, Secretary to the Military Board, and printed &#34; By authority &#34; by &#34; J. Kemp, Acting Government Printer. Melbourne.&#34; If this statement is correct I have with regret to charge the Military Board with a grossly illegal action in altering by departmental order a statutory rule made under Act of Parliament, and practically statute law. </para>

                    <para>- Yes, but only by the authority that created them. That is the point. You cannot; alter an Act of Parliament by a statutory rule, and you cannot alter a statutory rule by a &#34;departmental order. We in the Senate can alter our Standing Orders by a resolution, but our Standing Orders cannot alter the Constitution. We find, therefore, that the Military Board have deliberately, on their own showing, set aside the statute law of the Commonwealth and done just exactly what seemed good in their own eyes. </para>

                    <para>- No; the honorable senator has brought his own good self, and that is quite sufficient. He makes such an admirable audience that I cannot wish for any one better. There is another matter to which I wish to direct attention. It is this : If, after receiving boots as part of their regimental uniform for ten or twelve years, the unpaid soldiers of the Commonwealth- because what I refer to does not relate to New South Wales only, but to the volunteers throughout Australia - are now to be called upon for the first time to pay half the cost of their boots and repairs, the regiments that have been already suffering many drawbacks and disadvantages will practically receive a death blow. I do not mean to say that the volunteers  5862 <inline font-style="italic">Supply Bill</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">(No.</inline> 3).  of Australia are such miserable beings that they would fail to do their duty owing to the fact of having to pay 4s. or 5s. a year for boot leather. But what I do say is that it is this continual pin-pricking that is destroying the Military Forces. </para>

            <para class="block">Certain lines are cancelled, and then the instruction is given to officers commanding regiments only to issue boots at&#39; half-price. As I have said, I do not charge the volunteers of Australia as being so miserable as to throw up the sponge for the sake of 4s. or 5s. a year. My own knowledge tells me that Australian volunteers&#39; will go into camp on very poor rations and no pay whatever, and will even in many cases out of their own pockets pay other men to do their work whilst they are away. I know that that has taken place in several cases at least that have come under my own personal notice in connexion with men under my own command. But I do say that if this continual diminution of the small privileges that are granted to the volunteers of Australia goes on - if their privileges are to be illegally tampered with - we may bid good-bye to our volunteer forces. Let me relate an incident that occurred a few days ago in Sydney. Major-General Hoad, the Inspector-General of the Commonwealth, was inspecting the regiment of which I have the honour to be colonel. The men were drawn up in line two deep. The Major-General said, &#34; Now, any man who has a grievance will shoulder and take two paces to the front. &#34; Nobody moved. If any one had a grievance he kept it to himself. The Inspector-General seemed rather surprised, and went a stage further. He said, &#34; Well, now, any man who is without a great-coat will shoulder and take two paces to the front.&#34; The whole battalion shouldered and took two paces to the front. If that had been done on the comic opera stage, the audience would have regarded it as an admirable joke. </para>

                    <para>- I tell the story as I remember the incident. Perhaps I am wrong as to one man. I believe that one sergeant did not step forward. But everybody else did. The facts are these. Here is a regiment of over 500 men, and I find that amongst them they have 126 or 136 great-coats. It is not deemed by the Commanding Officer to be desirable that any difference should be made between one man and another. These great-coats are therefore not issued, but are kept in stock, and a man has to be paid to turn them over once a fortnight or thereabouts to keep the moths out. That is the Commonwealth method of encouraging our citizen forces, and of exercising care over our financial resources ! </para>

                    <para>- It would be very &#34; h-odd &#34; if they were not. Jokes are all very well, but I am speaking on a subject that is of very great interest as affecting our volunteer forces. It is a subject which apparently attracts very little sympathy from gentlemen who by word of mouth appreciate very loudly the citizen soldier,&#39; but do not care to do very much for him. While I am sneaking on this matter, I will show how the Military Board wastes money under the pretence, I will not say of saving it, but of doing something that is advantageous. I have here a military badge of the same regiment. It represents St. George and the Dragon. This particular regimental badge was purchased in London from one of the greatest military outfitters in England. It may, therefore, be  reasonably  supposed to be correct. But it did not suit the Military Board, which must have something else. The dragon and the horse must have no ground <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> rest upon, and there must be upon the badge the name of the regiment in letters so small that I&#39; cannot even read it with glasses, and require a special magnifying glass. I do not know how many pounds have been wasted over this absurd badge, but at any rate the small regimental funds </para>

            <para>SenatorColonel NEILD.- I am; I do know of my own knowledge. There is another matter to which I wish to draw attention, and that is the fact that while the Commonwealth promotes officers on the permanent staff, it makes no provision for the payment of the emolument that&#39; attaches to the higher office. The same rule applies to the civil branch of our service. No doubt it also applies to the naval branch. I find that it is quite a) common thing for the statutory increments in the Post and Telegraph Office to be withheld when they are due, and officers are told that they cannot be paid, because Parliament has made no grant. They are told, &#34; You must wait until the next Estimates are passed.&#34; There was an occasion, a little while ago, when an officer on the permanent staff of the Defence Department received a very well-deserved promotion. He was a man who had risen from the ranks. . He had been under my own observation for years, and I took some little interest in seeing that his long-delayed promotion eventuated. He was promoted. As a captain he is entitled to more pay than he received as a lieutenant. But until the next year&#39;s Estimates are passed by Parliament he cannot be paid his increment. I know that there is no provision on the Estimates before Parliament, and there is no hope of the man being paid until perhaps eighteen months hence. The same rule, as I have said, applies in the civil departments. I once spoke to the present Minister of Trade and Customs when he was Postmaster-General, and in company with him was the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, and urged that just as Parliament places a considerable sum at the disposal of the Treasurer to meet unforeseen outlay, in exactly the same manner the Ministers of the Departments in which increment are likely to accrue ought to be provided with a fund and enabled to make payments which are due upon the promotion of officers. An advance ought to be obtained from Parliament for that purpose. Apparently that suggestion has had no useful result, and nothing has been done. But I am taking advantage of the present opportunity to bring the subject forward again. There is another matter to which I wish to direct attention. It will scarcely be believed by honorable senators that when such a humble officer as a sergeant is promoted, and a corporal is entitled to be promoted to take the sergeant&#39;s place, the mills of the military gods grind so very slowly that the thing does not seem to be capable of eventuating. When honorable senators are very properly interested in preventing or trying to prevent sweating in the civil&#34; departments, I should like them to take a hand in such a matter as this that I am now laying before the Senate. I am going to refer to the case of an acting-sergeant. He is not permanently appointed. I will not mention his name, because I will never assist in making the Senate a place for individual grievance-mongering. I will, however, give the name to the Minister if he wishes to have it. This man was on what is called the married establishment. He obtained leave to marry, and had some children. </para>

                    <para>- I thank the honorable senator for remindking me that in the harvester case a Judge of the High Court has ruled that such wages are. improper wages to give to an ordinary working man. Yet here is a man - I will not say what branch of the service he belongs to, but it is one of the technical branches; he is not a common &#34;Tommy,&#34; but a man of valour and experience, such as the Commonwealth ought to value as one of its public servants - who, at the end of twenty years of service, gets the grand total of 6s. 7d. per diem on which to keep himself, his wife, and three children. The Commonwealth methods of defence administration are so absolutely puerile and contemptible that, although there is a vacancy for this man to be promoted to, the Commonwealth is too inert to promote him. He could be promoted to the rank of full sergeant. I suppose, even then, he would have to wait until next year&#39;s Estimates were passed before he could get the shilling or two extra that would come to him for that rank. I have said that I do not want to make this Chamber a grieva nce-monger - ing place, but I should not be doing my duty if I did not bring such matters before the Chamber, because this is a Chamber which has to deal with the welfare of the people that the Commonwealth employs, and it has the even more important duty of aiding in seeing that those who serve the Commonwealth are properly treated and_ that the .Commonwealth receives the service which it imagines that it does obtain. It does not obtain that service unless the men it employs are properly  remunerated  - unless the proper manly human obligation of the Government to the individual, as well as the obligation of the individual to the Government, is fulfilled. I have with me me papers of other cases- which I could bring forward, but I defer them to another time, and shall see what I can do privately. If it is considered desirable, I may be permitted in Committee to go into matters a little more fully; but the records of the </para>
                </talk.start>
            </interjection>
            <para class="block">Senate will show that I have never yet, in the six or seven years of the existence of the Commonwealth, used this Chamber for the purpose of ventilating any personal grievance, or any grievance connected with the Military Department, of which I am a humble member, and in which I have as large and as virile an interest as I imagine any honorable senator has in any subject to which he devotes his .energies and experience. There is one case that I am very much tempted to speak of. I shall treat&#39; it in the most vague manner. A certain commissioned officer in the permanent employ of the Commonwealth has had his name very much, in the records of Parliament in  connexion  with certain matters that were the subject of inquiry. Although that gentleman has  been  moved from one State to another, the ill fortune which has marked his discharge of duty in one portion of the Commonwealth has marked it in others - if not for himself, at least for those under his command. I take the case of a man whom I have known from childhood, and whose father I knew before him. He has had some eleven years&#39; experience as a non-commissioned officer in the employment of one of the States and of the Commonwealth. He has been specially selected for onerous duties coming within his sphere of military service. He has discharged those duties with unerring acceptance. I once sought to have him attached to my regiment as an instructor, and it goes without saying that no commanding officer who is responsible for the discipline and training of his regiment will ask for a duffer for such a position. After some ten or eleven years&#39; service, having passed all the examinations required of him, he had to go to a school under the permanently employed officer to whom I have tei erred. I understand that the proceedings upon the barrack square, or wherever the instruction or examination was held, were so remarkable that a young officer who was exceedingly raw to the business very nearly fainted under the process to which he was subjected, and this non-commissioned officer of whom I am speaking was reported as incompetent. After nearly eleven years of non-commissioned service, having acted on several occasions as the sergeant-major of his battery of the permanent service, he was, on the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of this commissioned officer, and with the approbation of the  Military  Board, reduced to the ranks, without an appeal. Such things are scarcely credible, and are certainly not creditable. To show that I am not bringing an unworthy case forward, although the man was reduced to the ranks at the instance of this major, and by the direction of the Military Board, yet the colonel of the regiment - the R.A.A. - and the State Commandant, who is an officer of general&#39;s rank, took him out of the ranks, and made him a clerk in the Rifle Department. I cite that to show that he is an admirable man, because no general and no colonel would so deal with him if he were not worth it. They do not want a bad man in the onerous position that this man has been placed in. I believe, the matter has gone so far that the Military Board, in a sudden access of generosity, has permitted this disrated man to go up for examination - which I have not the  slightest doubt that he will pass triumphantly if he gets even a ghost of fair play - for what rank? For appointment to a higher non-commissioned rank than he has been put out of - as a sergeant or sergeant-major on the instructional staff ! I will not take the action myself at present, but I shall be very happy to cooperate with any honorable senator who will ask for the appointment of a Select Committee, not to interfere in matters of discipline or questions of military misconduct, but to deal with some of these finance questions to which I have referred, and with such an apparently glaring case as that which I have just detailed. </para>

                    <para>- If the authority of a general officer is not superior to that of the lowest rank of field officer - say, a major - I do not know what is the good of having superior officers. I have surely given sufficient indication that this man has occupied responsible positions for eleven years, and that, although he was disrated three or four months&#39; ago, he has been taken out of the position of having to &#34; Tommy &#34; in the ranks, and given clerical duties by the colonel of the regiment and by the Brigadier-General .Commanding in the State. He has been recommended by the same general and by the same colonel to the Military Board, who, after crushing the poor chap for the time being, have now consented to -allow him to show his capacity as the trainer of other soldiers. I really do not think it necessary to elaborate the subject. If I do not make myself clear - for I recognise that there are certain technicalities - I am certain that if honorable senators will do the subject and themselves the honour of looking at my statement when printed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> when they will be able to compare one sentence with another, they will see that I have put forward what are really very serious grievances, and that I have not employed any intemperate language. </para>

I go further,, and say that there are sergeants who have refused to go up for examination under this particular officer, and even though they have been so far insubordinate, no trouble has befallen them. They are there. &#39; </para>

                    <para>- For a considerable time I have been trying to deal, with the matter privately, and certainly I should riot have brought it forward today if I had met with much success in that way. I have not heard any whisper or any communication which conveys to me the  impression  that the man to whom I have referred is unworthy of the fullest confidence of those who employ him. When we find, say, a colonel in the permanent employ of the Commonwealth, whose departmental record shows that he has not passed a higher examination than that of captain, and that he did that many years ago, when examinations were very  easy  - when we put such cases as that one in juxtaposition with those unfortunate noncommissioned officers to whom I have been referring, we shall agree; I think, that that, sort of treatment is not likely to make for the good of the service, and I have no other object than that in speaking here. I have no grievance of my own to ventilate. We are all more or less charged with responsibility, and this afternoon I have attempted to discharge my duty to the best of my ability. </para>

I have made this reference to the matter, not half so much for the purpose of complaining of the ill-usage done to these men, as to point the moral and adorn the t&#39;ale that some change is necessary in connexion with the administration of military affairs, to promote wider  sympathy,  to give better conditions of service, and to create more hopefulness in a service that is now very much without hope.

                will take a note. We have deliberately provided that the defence of the Commonwealth shall be in the hands of a citizen soldiery, but not one officer of the citizen forces, either paid or unpaid, is a member of the Military Board, except occasionally when he is called in to have a chat. I have no personal grievance with the Board. I am not airing my own unhappiness. The Commonwealth can never do more for me in the military service than it has done. I am saitsfied, and therefore have nothing to complain of. The Board consists chiefly of officers, who are the juniors of those to whom they give orders. We find that a company commander, for instance a Captain, gives orders to a Brigadier-General. But that is not the only instance of the kind. The State Commandants, who are in the position of either Generals of Brigade or Generals of Division, receive their orders from a Military Board that consists of civilians and officers, nearly the whole of whom are their juniors. That is a fact, and it does not make for discipline or for a feeling of confidence, without which we cannot run a citizen force in this community. I hold very strongly that some of the senior officers of the militia, and, if my honorable friends like, a member or two of the volunteer force, should be members of the Board. It would be better if, instead of meeting, perhaps, once a week, they met once a month, and the State Commandants had more authority than they have, for they cannot get a door painted or a fowl-house whitewashed without an immense amount of delay and red-tape. A State Commandant is one of the most helplessly crippled beings on the face of the earth.

                    <para>- When attention was very properly called to the state of the Senate, I was mentioning that, in my view, some of the senior officers of the citizen force should find places on the Military Board, and that the States Commandants should have a larger measure of authority than they possess. In some respects I doubt whether a State Commandant possesses as much authority in his sphere as does a regimental Commander in his smaller sphere. Having submitted these matters for the consideration of Ministers, I do not desire to delay the passage of the Bill, nor do I intend in Committee to make further reference to them. I have done my duty, and I do not think it necessary to elaborate the matters more in detail. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to bring forward a matter which is, I think, of considerable importance to the Commonwealth, and which, if dealt with, may relieve the Commonwealth from the possibility of serious happenings in the future. It will be remembered by honorable senators that on the 25th August, 1894, Great Britain and Japan entered into a treaty, which is commonly known as the Anglo- Japanese Treaty, and which provided for certain Colonies that were exempted from its provisions to become parties thereto on taking action within a certain time, and thus to get the advantage of trade relations with Japan. Article 19 of the Treaty reads - </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will perhaps have noticed that recently there was a serious influx of Japanese into British Columbia. Prior to this, the Dominion of Canada had become a party to the treaty with Japan, in the same way as Queensland had done. When the authorities of the Province of British Columbia took legislative action to prevent a further influx, it was vetoed by  the Dominion authorities, who have the power to veto provincial legislation. During the recent riots in British Columbia, the authorities of the Province approached the Dominion. Government with a request that they would make such representations as would have the effect of bringing about a cessation of the Japanese immigration. If honorable senators will remember, the reply of the Dominion Government was to the effect that it would be fatal to the treaty advantages which the Dominion was receiving in the matter of trade relations with Japan if such representations were made, and they, therefore, declined to make them. The Queensland Government, having become a party to the treaty, the arrangement still continues, because the twelve months&#39; notice provided for has not been given to the Japanese Government, either by the Government of Queensland or by the Commonwealth Government on their assumption of the control of External Affairs. My object to-day is to ask the Commonwealth Government  to induce the Government of Queensland, if the matter is within their province, to take the necessary steps, and, if it is not within their province, to take the necessary steps themselves to give the necessary twelve months&#39;  notice denouncing the treaty. </para>

                        <para>- I shall tell the honorable senator. I have here volume 4 of the <inline font-style="italic">Votes and Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland,</inline> for the session of 1901, which contains correspondence that took place between the Japanese Government, through their consuls and Foreign Affairs Office, with the British Foreign Affairs Office, and. through that&#39; office with the Queensland Government, and also correspondence between Japanese consuls in Australia with the Queensland Government, which discloses the fact that an immense amount of friction has already occurred between Queensland and Japan in connexion with the treaty. The correspondence, in my opinion, shows that the arrangement to which the Commonwealth Government have become a party in a secondary sense, at any rate, contains the seeds of trouble in the future if Japan should seek occasion to raise the question of the effect of our immigration laws. </para>

                        <para>- They are not. As I shall show when I deal with some of the correspondence, it is specially set out in the arrangement that, while the immigration laws were to be left to the discretion of the Queensland Parliament, an arrangement was come to under the protocol between the Government of Queensland and the Government of Japan, by which the proportion of Japanese then in Queensland was to be maintained. That is to say, if the population of Queensland increased, under that arrangement the Government of Japan had the right to demand the admission of more Japanese to the State to keep up the proportion. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly, but it has never been denounced, and continues in force to-day. Since the inauguration of Federation, the Queensland Government have taken no action whatever to put an end to it, and the Government of the Commonwealth have not abrogated the arrangement. What I say is that we have in this protocol &#39;a means to enable the Japanese Government at any time to raise the question of our immigration law. The Government, in their answers to my questions todav. have told the Senate that they made representations to Japan in order that the Common wealth might become a party to the treaty to secure certain trade advantages, but the correspondence they received from the Government of Japan was of such a nature that they took the matter no further. I venture to assume that if we could get it, that correspondence would reveal the fact that the Commonwealth Government did not complete the arrangement sought to be made, because the Japanese Government made it one of the conditions that our ports should be thrown open to Japanese immigration. We have only to read the current literature of the world, the extracts from time to time published from Japanese newspapers, and the statement of Viscount Hayashi, the Japanese Foreign Minister in London, regarding our immigration laws, to know that the Japanese Government only await a favorable opportunity to raise this question. I say that so long as the arrangement entered into with Japan by the Government of Queensland continues in force, the Japanese Government have a pretext to raise the question at any time that the Commonwealth Government are not carrying out the terms of the agreement, whilst Queensland continues to enjoy the! trade advantages afforded by the arrangement. </para>

                        <para>- That is not correct. T. have pointed out that an arrangement has been entered into between the Japanese and Queensland Governments to permit of the introduction to Queensland of such numbers of Japanese as may be necessary to keep up the proportion of Japanese to other people in the State existing at the time that the protocol was signed. That demand on the part of the Japanese Government was not .met with refusal by the Queensland Government, but with evasion throughout. At no stage of the correspondence have the Queensland Government denied the right of the Japanese Government to introduce Japanese in such numbers as might be necessary to keep up the proportion existing at the time of the signing of the protocol. I say that whilst the protocol remains in force, there will always be a pretext for the Japanese Government to raise the question of our immigration law. An agreement has been entered into by the Government) of Queensland with the Japanese Government by which that State enjoys certain trade advantages with Japan, and at the same time we are not carrying out the arrangement requiring the proportion of Japanese in the State to be kept up. I am sorry that I shall have to inflict some of this correspondence on the Senate. </para>

At all events, in view of. possible consequences, under the treaty, I deem it my duty to direct attention to the matter.

It appears in this correspondence as an inclosure in a letter from the Right Honorable Joseph Chamberlain, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, to the Governor of Queensland, and is dated from Tokio, 2nd June,  1899.  I quote the last paragraph. Speaking of Viscount Aoki, Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, and his representations, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Satow wrote - </para>

                        said i had no doubt seen in the papers a telegram from the Japanese Consul at Townsville, stating that about fifty Japanese who had landed in Queensland with passports in which they were described as merchants, having been found to .be labourers, were refused permission to land. On receiving this information, he had at once instructed the Governors of the places from which &#39;emigrants usually proceed to exercise greater care in the issue of passports, and he assured me of his desire to avoid any misunderstanding with  .the Government of Queensland. 5870

Consequently that Government had proposed that Japanese not belonging to the labouring classes should provide themselves with passports. I now understand from his memorandum that Japanese going out of the country were , no longer compelled to obtain passports which were only issued upon application. The Queensland Government were anxious to arrive at an understanding, but the wording of his memorandum, I thought, would not facilitate an arrangement. </para>

                    <para>It should not be lost sight of that, under the Protocol by which the adhesion of this Colony is given to the Treaty between Great Britain and Japan, it is perfectly competent for this Government to pass a law having for its object the suspension of immigration of this nature. The Government, however, do not propose to go to this length, their present policy being merely a provisional exercise in one direction only of the discretion expressly reserved to them under the recent arrangement with the Government of Japan, and I may add that in taking this course they are only carrying out the emphatically declared wishes of the vast majority of the people of the Colony. </para>

                <para>Bearing on this point I may state I have been informed by the Manager of &#34;Tyo Imin Kaisha&#34; (the company which supplies the chief number of immigrants coming to Queensland) that there are about 216 Japanese labourers returning to Japan about the end of this year, the terms of their engagements having expired, and that since the beginning of the year sixty men have already returned ; and, notwithstanding this decrease, I understand applications to indent Japanese labourers have, been refused by your Government. </para>

                <para>Apart from the foregoing, I beg you will permit me to remark that it is not agreeable to the Japanese Government to see their subjects included in the general category of Asiatic races, without any consideration being paid to their state of civilization.

                <para>Therefore Japanese alone are injured by the law. The action of Queensland disregarding the most favoured nation clause of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty, which is in operation, and to which it has itself acceded, and not allowing Japanese to be naturalized, is illegal and in violation of the Treaty. Queensland has no right at all to refuse to allow Japanese to be naturalized&#39; after allowing naturalization to Germans, French, Americans, Austrians, and the subjects or citizens of other Treaty Powers who emigrate thither. </para>
                <para>That shows that the Japanese in Queensland themselves had already made representations to their Government on this question.

In other words, there is sufficient occasion for the Japanese Foreign Office to protest to the Government of Queensland, and the more so as the war between England and the Transvaal furnishes reasons for and lends force to our protests. But owing to the incapacity and <inline font-style="italic">laissez faire</inline> of our Foreign Office, no protest has been made, and thereby great disgrace has been brought upon the Japanese. They attempt to drive Japanese away by refusing them permission to employ the aborigines of Australia. They levy telegraph rates beyond what are fixed by regulation on Japanese alone, and withhold from them the conveniences of communication. Moreover, the first person to pay the illegal telegraphic rales was Consul Iijima, the representative of the Japanese Government, who did so without any objection on the 5th . November, and since then Japanese have in consequence, following his example, paid the illegal telegraphic rates. Our Government has not yet made any protest at all with regard to the matter, and the result is that the Queensland Government despises Japan and publicly states that the Japanese Government is in the habit of taking no action. The successive persecutions which will arrive will, it is feared, be worse and worse, until in consequence the Japanese will have to withdraw from Thursday Island, which they have opened up with . very great trouble. Such are the views of the Japanese Association at Thursday Island. </para>

There are here a number of letters, including one from Baron Hayashi, dated 30th July, 1900, all contending that the meaning of the arrangement entered into between Queensland and Japan was that the proportion of Japanese then in Queensland was to be maintained, and that the Government of Queensland had the right to admit sufficient fresh Japanese to make up that proportion. Up to the last </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">I can find no record of the Queensland Government giving a straight-out refutation of that contention. They merely evaded it, and, towards the close of the correspondence, did so on the ground that, as the Colonies were about to federate, the question would be one to be dealt with by the Federal Government. If that agreement is still in force, and if we have become, so to speak, the proprietors of it, it seems to me, as a layman, that the Japanese Government could at any time make the same claim on us as regards Queensland territory, although I know that they could not make it as regards the whole Commonwealth. But there is the possibility of the Japanese Government again urging that the ports of Queensland should be opened to admit sufficient Japanese to make up the proportion that existed in that State at the time the arrangement was entered into. To prevent the possibility of any quarrel arising over this matter, I ask that the Government, if it is within their province - and if it is not they can make representations to the Queensland Government - should give the twelve months&#39; notice necessary to terminate the agreement. The only possible benefit of if is that there may be some trade advantages to the State of Queensland, but I do not think that they are very great. I believe that Queensland entered into it, in the first place, because the Government then in power were somewhat favorable to the entry of Japanese labour for the sugar plantations. But that day has gone by, and surely it would be well for us. to be on the safe side. The Japanese compare their position here with that of the Britishers in the Transvaal. It is a stern fact that, had there been no Britishers in the Transvaal, the British flag would not be waving over that country today. Seeing that there are Japanese here, that they have interests here, that they ha.ve already attempted to have an extended meaning applied to the agreement, that they evidently believe that they have a right to have that extended meaning applied to it, and that they feel that they have a grievance against the Government of Queensland for not giving it that extended meaning, it would be wise for the Commonwealth Government to take the course I have indicated. We should then be certain that if the Japanese Government wished to raise the question of our immigration laws they would have to do it directly. As it is, they can at any time say, &#34; We are being treated unfairly. Queensland is not reciprocating; she is getting an advantage from the arrangement, but she is not opening her ports to our labourers as she promised to do.&#34; That is a very foolish position to allow ourselves to remain in. I have made these representations because I wish no loophole to be left in our White Australia policy, and I know that the present Government want none. I believe that there is a loophole here, and, although Japan is not at present making any protest, yet, while the feeling is there, there is always a danger of the protest being made. If it is made, we are in an unsound position, because we shall get no sympathy from the British Government. If Japan could make representations to the British Government that a British Colony entered into the arrangement with its eyes open, and that it was not being carried out, the British Government, as a party to the treaty, would feel themselves bound to say to us, &#34; We ask you to carry out that treaty in its entirety.&#34; It would be far better for us to be on the safe side, by giving the twelve months&#39; notice necessary to terminate the arrangement, as we have the power to do. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps&#39; I misconstrued the honorable senator&#39;s words, but I am wondering when the declaration will come, or if it will come at all. On several occasions this session  .1  -have asked questions in order to elicit a statement from the Government of their real intentions in the matter of national defence. I have received replies which were certainly satisfactory for the time, but I hoped that before we reached this period of the session a definite announcement would have been made. When I first raised the question, the principal reason why a statement of the policy of the Government could not be made was the unfortunate illness of the Prime Minister. As he had been at Home attending the Imperial Conference, and in consultation with the Imperial Naval authorities, the Cabinet were waiting for him 5874 <inline font-style="italic">Supply Bill</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">{No.</inline> 3). to recover health and strength, so that he might give them the benefit of his experiences, and make a statement from his place in Parliament. I am glad that the Prime Minister has resumed his parliamentary duties, and I think sufficient time has elapsed for him, if not to have made the statement himself, at least to have given such information as would have enabled one of his colleagues to do so. I recognise that the Government are perhaps still waiting for information from the officers who are at present in England investigating the question, but I am not going to be a party any longer to the policy of drift in defence matters. The people of Australia are anxiously waiting for a declaration of the Government&#39;s defence policy. The matter is referred to at almost every public function. On Saturday last, at the Lord Mayor&#39;s banquet, in Melbourne, several important speeches were made, and those, irrespective of statements which have been made in both Chambers, should convince the Government that the people are anxiously awaiting the declaration of their policy. Vice-Admiral Fawkes spoke. Portions of his speech I do not agree with, particularly his statement that the greatest factor in the safety of Australia is the knowledge that an enemy attacking any part of the British Empire would always have to reckon with the whole strength of the Imperial Navy. Statements of that kind tend only to accentuate the evil that has existed so long. The people of Australia are living in a false sense of security in that regard. I do not wish to enlarge now upon the question of Australian defence. I simply emphasize the fact that the sooner the Federal Government declare their policy, the better it will be for them and for the people of Australia. I desire to refer to another matter connected with the appointment of a Board to inquire into the question of a uniform stamp for the Commonwealth. On 6th November last I asked the following questions - </para>

                <para class="block">To-day, a motion has been carried, at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> that the report be laid on the table of the Senate. It is a remarkable thing that the report was completed on  30th  October, and the Minister only received it on the  31st  of October, and yet it was published in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of  31st  October. I have no objection to the report being published in any newspaper so long as the Minister receives it before its publication. The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> which is a very important Australian paper, arrives in the Parliamentary Library on Thursday in each week. The  31  st of October this year fell on a Thursday. The paper, to arrive here on a Thursday, must necessarily leave Sydney by Wednesday night&#39;s express. Consequently, the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> must have had the information, at the very latest, on Wednesday,  30thOct-  tober. The report was only completed on  30thOctober.  It was an extraordinarily clever feat of journalism if the report of the Board which sat in Melbourne was printed in a Sydney paper, and circulated in Melbourne on the very day on which it was received by the Minister. It must be patent to every one that a leakage has taken place somewhere. I am not complaining of the publication of the report in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> If the members of the Senate cannot directly get the report of a Committee appointed by the Government, surely it is right that the Minister for the Department should have the report before it is published to the world by a newspaper. If the publication of such a report is to take place in that way before it is received by the Minister, why is it not supplied to all the newspapers? </para>

                        <para>- That is what I want to elicit. Did the Minister know what the report was going to be before it was received by him officially ? If he did, did he sanction the supplying of the information to the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> and if not, did any member of the Board do so? If no member of the Board furnished the report to the newspaper, did any officer in the Minister&#39;s Department do so? Those are points on which I want to be enlightened, and honorable senators generally ought to  share my anxiety. It is possible that in the past &#39;similar leakages have taken place. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened to complaints about various matters, to which I propose to refer in their order. In the first place, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has alluded to the legal proceedings which were instituted by the Commonwealth against the State Government or officials and others in New South Wales, in connexion with the wire-netting cases. Judging by the information which he gave to the Senate, my honorable friend must have been completely misinformed. In the first place, proceedings were taken against the carter for removing goods before the entry was passed, and with the object of proving the right of the Commonwealth to control the Customs. In the second case, proceedings were taken against the Inspector of Police, who forcibly prevented the Customs officials from recovering the goods and to prove that even State officials cannot move goods on which duty has not been paid. In the third case, proceedings were taken against the Attorney-General for New South Wales for the return of the goods alleged to have been illegally removed. All these proceedings were taken on the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gordon,</inline> K.C., <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cullen,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackett,</inline> and were fully approved of by the Commonwealth Attorney-General. It is alleged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that the proceedings were wrong from the beginning, and have had to be altered or corrected in some way or other. There is no foundation for a suggestion nf that kind. No irregularity has been discovered, and no step has been taken which would justify the assertion that the proceedings were in any way  incorrect as to procedure or otherwise. The fact remains that no proceedings have been set aside, and, so far as I am aware, no action in that regard has been taken. But a most usual course has been adopted. As the case against Sutton the carrier involves many legal points, which are common to all the cases, it has been agreed that a case shall be stated to the High Court. For that purpose the usual practice has been followed of adjourning the actions in the meantime. When the points of law involved in this procedure are settled, then the actions will .proceed, or otherwise, according to the decision of the High Court. . But it would &#39;be idle, indeed improper, te proceed with three actions, involving more or less, as they do, the same points of law, and at an expense which would be quite unjustified when there is a recognised means of having them settled. So that my honorable friend, who, I am sorry, does not happen to be in the chamber at the. &#39; present moment, was wrongly informed. Then he gave us a very long story in connexion with a- grievance that some members of the militia and volunteer forces of New South Wales are suffering in consequence of being called upon to contribute towards the expense of providing their boots. I believe that the answer to that complaint is that in the other States the practice has been for the volunteers to make that contribution. In New South Wales, however, the men have received a grant, and been provided with boots and uniforms. What has been done by the military authorities has been to adopt the practice of the other States, and to call upon the soldiers of New South Wales to make a contribution towards the provision of their boots. Mv honorable friend also referred to several grievances in regard to some officers. It  is quite impossible for me, particularly as I do not know their names, to deal with their cases on the floor of the chamber. &#91; can only promise my honorable friend that if he&#39; chooses to supply me with the names, I shall bring the complaints under the notice of my colleague, and endeavour to have them duly investigated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has brought forward a matter which is of very grave importance to the Commonwealth, and introduced it in a speech which I am sure was of great interest to honorable senators. When I was a member of the Government of Victoria I had a good deal to do with the question of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty in my capacity of Commissioner of Customs, but I could not see my way to recommend Victoria to do as Queensland saw fit to do, recognising that certain advantages would flow to that Colony. I do not pretend to be able at this moment to go into any details, but it appears that by 1900 it was practically conceded by both sides that Japan was to be at liberty to maintain the proportion of  3,000  Japanese within Queensland. In 1901 the Commonwealth was established, and afterwards our Immigration Restriction Act was passed, by which the Commonwealth took complete control over immigration. , The Commonwealth has not at any time acknowledged the treaty or permitted the admission of Japanese by virtue of its terms. The Government takes up the position that the Commonwealth is not legally bound or in any way controlled by the treaty. lt is quite true that Queensland has received certain trade advantages from the treaty, and has not seen fit yet to denounce it. The question submitted by my honorable friend is whether the Commonwealth is called upon to take any action. The position taken up by the Commonwealth namely, that of complete control over immigration - has not, so far, been challenged by Japan, If at any time it should be challenged, need I assure honorable senators as to what the attitude of the Government will be? We shall maintain the law on the statute-book. The question is whether we are called upon at the present time to take any action, or to permit the State Government to do so. I admit that a grave constitutional question is involved, and that is whether Queensland has a right to take any action. The question also arises whether the Commonwealth has a right to do so instead of Queensland. </para>

The existing arrangements have continued for six years, during which it has been quite competent for the Japanese Government to have prevented the entry into the ports of Japan of exports from Queensland on the favoured terms provided for, but they have not thought it worth while to take any action in that direction. Nor have they thought lt worth while to assert the privileges which they might perhaps have claimed to be entitled to under the arrangement or treaty with the Government. I .can only assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that I shall bring his representations under the&#39; notice of the Prime Minister.

                        <para>- Two matters were referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> I am sorry that the honorable senator thinks that the Government have been neglectful in not making an announcement of their defence policy at an earlier date. The honorable senator must know that the hands of the Government &#39; have teen very full and while the matter to which he has referred is one of vital moment, it is also a matter of grave policy, requiring full and very  careful consideration. He has had the assurance that before the session closes there will be an announcement of the policy of the Government in this connexion, and I ask him to restrain his impetuosity in the meantime. With respect to the publication of the report of the Stamps Board before it actually reached the hands of the Minister, I regard that as a matter of serious moment, and I fully sympathize with the honorable senator&#39;s denunciation.. Ministers endeavour, as far as possible, that Parliament shall be first advised in connexion with these matters before they are published in the press or elsewhere. </para>

                <para>I can assure honorable senators that this is a very ordinary Supply Bill, containing only the usual items. The total amount which we are asking the Senate to vote is &#163;787,496. There is a proposed vote of &#163;25,000 for refunds. I have on several occasions explained exactly what these refunds are, and I shall be only too pleased to give further explanations if necessary. The Bill also contains a proposal to advance the Treasurer a sum of ,&#163;50,000. Included in this amount is a sum of ,&#163;25,000, intended for payment to the New South Wales Savings Bank  Commission. -This is to cover a sum which was held by the Post Office for savings bank purposes when Federation was accomplished. That is to say, a sum of ,&#163;25,000 was being utilized at the time of Federation by the postal notes branch of the New South Wales State Post and Telegraph Department. This sum is now being repaid, but it will be debited to New South Wales as transferred expenditure. I think that, with the exception of two&#39; or three small items, no votes are exhausted by this particular Bill. I would point out that even if that were not strictly so, the matter would be of no great moment, since our practice in this connexion is different to that prevailing in the States, and our Appropriation Bill covers the whole of the items contained in all the Supply Bills passed, together, of course, with all balances due. I have said that this is a very ordinary Supply Bill. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that the monthly Supply Bill passed on the 3rd July included votes to the amount of &#163;365,243 ; and we propose in this two months&#39; Supply Bill to cover votes to the amount of &#163;712,496, which is less than double the amount covered by the month&#39;s Supply Bill to which I have just referred. Again, the Supply granted on the 3rd August for three months covered votes amounting to &#91;&#163;1,055,744. Two-thirds of that amount would be about &#163;704,000, whilst we are asking in this Bill for Supply to the extent of ,&#163;712,000. Honorable senators will therefore see that there is nothing unusual about this measure. </para>

                        <para>- Then I may say that, so far as the Tariff is concerned, the Government have no hope that it will reach the Senate before Christmas. If the House of Representatives finished the Tariff by Christmas, undoubtedly it would be the duty of the Senate to meet as soon as possible thereafter for the purpose of dealing with it. If, on the other hand, the . Tariff should not be dealt with in another place by that time, it would be desirable for the Senate to extend the short recess proposed to be taken to cover the time during which the Tariff is being dealt with elsewhere. Honorable senators will be expected before adjourning to deal with the Quarantine Bill, the Disputed Elections and Qualifications Bill, and, if the extended adjournment to which I have referred is found to be necessary, with a further Supply Bill. I intend, should the extended adjournment appear to be necessary, to ask for Supply to carry on the Government until the 8th or oth March next year. That is to say, an additional two months&#39; Supply. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators are aware of the position of business at the present time. They know that the Navigation Bill could not be effectively dealt with in this Chamber this session, and that even if it were, it is quite unlikely that, in view of the arduous labours honorable&#39; members in another place have been indulging in for a long time past, they would see their way to take up the Bill and deal with it. In the circumstances, it will be one of the earliest measures introduced next session. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia.) &#91;5.28&#93;. - I take advantage of the opportunity to refer to the announcement which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has made in very general terms. It is convenient that the Government should indicate what is in their minds with regard to the progress of business, and in that respect the honorable senator has pursued a desirable course. I gather that the Navigation Bill is not to be proceeded with, for the very excellent reason which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline>
                    has given, that, whatever views may be entertained as to its necessity, in view of the fact that at present, and for some time to come, the consideration of the Tariff will be the matter of absorbing interest, it is quite impossible, in the time which will be at our disposal, to deal with so huge a measure as the Navigation Bill, involving as it does many issues of grave importance and matters of great value from every aspect of the maritime interest. There is no doubt that after the Christmas adjournment we shall be face to face with the Tariff, which, I feel sure, will occupy our attention for the remainder of what will be a very long session before we have reached its termination. Then it will be necessary, perhaps, at the end of next week, or when we are in a position to adjourn, to pass a further Supply Bill. Otherwise, we should have to come back in the month of January, and &#34;that would not be desirable.

                        <para>- I am not complaining on that score. I admit that the honorable senator could do nothing else, for one reason, which I am going to mention. We might like to adjourn on Friday next or on the following Wednesday. But the Disputed Elections and Qualifications Bill is essential. We cannot adjourn until it is passed. It has to come up from the other place where it may be amended. We must, therefore, remain sitting. That, I understand, is what was in the honorable the Vice-President of the Executive Council&#39;s mind when he alluded to this particular Bill. But the only other Bill of importance on the paper is the Quarantine Bill, which may occupy some further time. There is also the matter of the new mail contract, which will have to be carefully looked into. As soon as those matters have been disposed of, and an additional Supply Bill has been passed, so far as I am individually concerned, I shall be glad to assist the Government in enabling the Senate to adjourn. I do not think that it would be fair to keep the Senate simply marking time close up to Christmas, when there is not the slightest possibility of the great matter of- business which is occupying the other House - the Tariff - being mit through before then. I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is exercising a wise discretion in so arranging the business of the Senate as to lead to its transaction in the way that he has indicated. </para>

                    <para>- - I entirely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> that it would be very unwise to keep the Senate marking time . while the other place is dealing with the Tariff. Up till now, we have assisted the Government as far as we could in carrying its business. We have got through our work very rapidly. We should have disposed of the Disputed Elections and Qualifications Bill before now, had it not been for a little misunderstanding. I am very glad that there is a disposition to expedite business. I trust that the Quarantine Bill will be disposed of as soon as possible. Of course, I do not object to opposition, but I hope that discussion will be minimized, so that there may be no unnecessary delay. Within the next fortnight, we ought to be able to adjourn until some time early next year. I can plainly see that unless we adjourn before Christmas we shall have very little chance of enjoying any respite. When the other House has disposed of the Tariff they can, of course, take an adjournment according to the length of time that it is considered. the Senate will be engaged upon that business. I am sure that all honorable senators will desire to assist the Government in getting business through rapidly. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that circumstances have compelled the Government to postpone the consideration of the Navigation Bill during the present session. But I can see quite plainly Chat in the interests of the Bill itself, it is advisable to leave it over. I only hope that the Government will put it in the forefront of their business next session, so that we shall be able to deal with it just as the Tariff is being dealt with during the present session, and so that it may be pushed through to a conclusion next year. Tt has - been before Parliament for a considerable_time. After discussion by the Senate, it was referred to a Royal Commission, which took a great deal of evidence. We have the Commission&#39;s report and recommendations before us, and they will assist us materially. But I quite realize that for the Senate to attempt to deal with the Navigation Bill this session,* and send it to the other House, would not be anything like fair to honorable senators, or to the Bill itself. I agree with the course sketched out by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and trust that we shall soon be able to clear the notice-paper. I shall be quite satisfied so lon? as the Government will give me an absolute promise that the Navigation Bill will <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> proceeded with as the most important business next session. </para>

                        <para>- I thank you, sir. I happened to be called out of the Chamber while the first reading of the Bill was being debated, and missed my opportunity. But I shall make my remarks very brief. A complete  survey  of the north-west coast is urgently required. The whole matter of the survey of the coast of Australia is a Federal concern. I understand that a survey vessel belonging to the Admiralty has lately completed some work on the North Queensland coast. The Admiralty are the only authority who have properly-equipped vessels and highly-trained officers for doing this class of work. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that a proposition has been made for dividing the cost. Communications have been entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the Admiralty for that purpose. I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be in a position to give us some information as to what has recently occurred in that regard. Unless something is done, there will continue to be grave danger to life and property. The traffic on the north-west coast is increasing every year. I urge the Government to push the matter forward. As I have already said, I have repeatedly brought it before the Senate, but up to the present nothing definite has resulted. I -hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be able, if not at the present moment, at any rate before long, to make a clear and satisfactory statement as to what is being done. </para>

I have nowhere to put them except a little box in the Club Room and another downstairs, which is not at all convenient, as I cannot run up and down stairs every time I want a paper. The House&#39; Committee should try to formulate some scheme which would give senators much greater conveniences in this regard. When the Victorian Legislative Council met here it was composed of men who merely played at legislation, and Parliament House to them was a magnificent club. where they came to amuse themselves. It has now become a House of business, where men come to do work. It is, indeed, an office, more especially to those members who do not live in Melbourne. Some attempt should be made to give them reasonable conveniences for sorting out their papers, so that they may be handy when wanted. </para>

                    <para>.- When the gardens were under the control of the State, there were more men employed in them than has. been the case since the Federal Parliament has met here. I know that at certain times in the year men were put on to do the work which was really, necessary. So far as I know, only permanent men have been employed since this Parliament assembled here in  1901.  There is no gainsaying the fact that they are hard worked, and no -one can allege that they are overpaid. I think that more men ought to be employed in the gardens, and that some of the present employes are inadequately paid. The gardens are no doubt a credit, but in view of the work which the men perform, greater consideration ought to be shown to them. I should like to hear how the present expenditare compares with that which prevailed when the gardens were under the supervision of the State. I understand that in a measure the gardens belong to the  President  and the  Speaker,  and that they have it in their power to employ additional hands if they think that it is necessary .to&#34; do so. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, it goes without saying that the Parliament would approve of any recommendation which they might submit in that regard. When the gardens were under the control of the State more hands were employed, and more expense incurred. At the. present time the employes are doing, if not more, as much work as they were previously called upon to perform, but their wages have in no instance been increased. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> I trust that the Government will look into this matter,, and see if more consideration cannot be shown to men who are doing all they possibly can to make the gardens a beauty spot and a convenience to those who are assembled in this building. </para>

                            is in error in regard to the remuneration which is paid to the men in the gardens. The head gardener receives &#163;14 a month, and the other two gardeners &#163;11 a month each, and all are State officers. When the State placed this building at the disposal of this Parliament, the State Government made certain stipulations with regard to the persons who should be continued as their employes, and the provision of the salaries which it considered adequate for their services. At times an opportunity is afforded to put on a temporary hand, but the vote has been cut down so much that virtually no power is left to the  President  or to the House Committee to employ additional labour. We all recognise the fact that the gardens are a beauty spot, and that we ought to do all in our power to keep them in first-rate order.

                            has talked about the gardens being the property of the  President  and the  Speaker,  but that is not the case. The gardens are placed under the control of the  President  or the  Speaker,  as the case may be, but the members of this Parliament are entitled to have every possible opportunity of enjoying such advantages as they may confer. And it is not in the province of any officer to refuse honorable members reasonable access to and use of them. There must, however, be some person in whom the control is placed, in order that there may be no conflict of authority, and no difficulty in managing matters.

There are other buildings in a bad state. There has recently been submitted to me a special report in regard to not only the gardens, but Parliament House generally, pointing out what is necessary to be done in order to put the building in the condition in which it ought to be kept if we observe the terms of the agreement with the State Government. I assure honorable senators that if I have their assistance they will have no reason to complain of the want of al sufficiency of labour, and that if I can do anything to maintain the gardens as a beauty spot they may rely upon my best exertions in that direction. </para>

I remember that on one occasion in New South Wales I was in close proximity to a Government wharf, on which there were seven men working. Six of them were foremen, but not one of them ever did a day&#39;s work. The maintenance of the Parliament Gardens requires the exercise of a great deal of skill, and skill for which we ought always to be prepared to pay fair and honest wages. But ours are not gardens in which fifteen or sixteen hands are employed, &#39; and the foreman ought to be ready to take a spade in his hand and put his foot on it. </para>

But I reckon that gardens which need the employment of only a few hands, as they do. do not require at their head a sort of fancy man, who does little or next to nothing, and draws the largest screw. I believe that, if the men were put on nearly a level footing, and each one did his fair share of the work, the gardens would be well kept, and probably there would be no need for extra labour to be employed. </para>

                    <para>. - According to a statement in the press, and statements made in other directions, there is a probability of this Parliament meeting in Melbourne for the next fifteen or twenty years. It is our duty to maintain the grounds surrounding this, building in as good order as they were kept in prior to its occupation by this Parliament. I scarcely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that any one of the gardeners can be neglecting to do a fair share of the work, I think that he scarcely understands the class of work which the different men ought to do. I ask him what sort of a coal mine he would have if every man were paid the same amount, and all were to do just as they pleased ? I think that very soon there would be confusion. It is necessary that some person should be in charge of the Parliament Gardens, and held- responsible, not only for what he does -himself, but also for the work done bv others. And in view of that responsibility, surely he is worth the few extra shillings which he receives ? But I contend that in order to keep the grounds in their present state, three men are insufficient, and they must work hard indeed.  1  know a little about gardening, as I do about many other things. Unless a sufficient sum is voted annually, all the skill and labour in the world will not keep the gardens in the condition in which they ought to be maintained. I understand that the vote is so small that it is impossible for the head gardener to procure the seeds, bulbs, and plants which are really required, or which he would like to have. There is another thine which is very essential to successful gardening, as I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent,</inline> Premier of Victoria, will advise honorable senators, and that is that a sufficient supply of manure should always be provided. If renewals of seeds, plants, and manures are not provided, no matter how many gardeners are employed, or how  hard they work, they will not be able to keep the gardens as they ought to be kept. I hope that when the Estimates are being framed the Government will have in view not only the wages and the number of the employes, but  also  the facilities with which they ought to be provided. They ought to be considered, because if we wish the gardens to be maintained in the best order, the money required for the purpose should be provided. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that the foreman has been a miner, and that it is those who are working under him who really do the work of keeping the gardens in order. I understand that he secured the position as being next in seniority of service at the time the previous foreman died. If there are to be three gardeners employed, each, including the foreman, should have a fair proportion of the work to do, and the work of the foreman should not consist merely of superintendence. I know something of gardening, and I believe there is work in the Parliament Gardens for no more than three men. There is a good deal of grass to be kept in order, but adequate appliances and a sufficient supply of water are provided. It cannot be called hard work to lay hose and cut the grass, and that is the chief work that has to be done just now. </para>

One honorable senator has said that the foreman is a. landscape gardener, but a sailor  might  be a landscape gardener. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> has said that the foreman is a miner. So am I. I know all about mining, but I ca&#39;n grow leeks, cabbages, and a few tomatoes. However, I should not like to set myself up as an expert gardener, and claim that I was worth ^3 or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4</inline> a month more than men who may have forgotten more about gardening than I ever learned. </para>

If the honorable senator is in possession of information to justify the remarks he has made, he should give it to the Committee.

On the other hand, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> is not prepared to prove what he has said, he has done the man referred to an injustice.

                    <para>.- Are we to take it that the steam-ship companies who undertake this contract will be in a position to please themselves as to whether they employ white or coloured crews? The policy of this country is that white labour shall be employed, and it ought to be made a binding condition on steam-ship owners to engage white crews. But it appears to me that an option is given to the companies to employ whatever crews they like. </para>

It will be within the recollection of honorable senators that some time ago loud complaints were made by various trade organizations throughout the Commonwealth on the ground that the Government was in a measure responsible for bringing a number of people into Australia - particularly into New South Wales - under what were considered to be false pretences. There was in existence then - and I believe there is still in existence - an organization calling itself the Immigration League of Australia, the  President  of which was <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Arthur,</inline> of Sydney. We were informed when a Supply Bill was before us on a! former occasion that the Government had granted to that league a certain sum of money. I forget the exact amount for the moment. </para>

The men on strike numbered about 600. Now I want to know - in what way is this money to be expended? The Commonwealth Government has no right to offer inducements to men to come to Australia unless it knows what is to become of them.. The Government has no employment to offer. It is said that Australia wants population. Every one is agreed- upon that. </para>

Every day we have circumstances brought under our notice, through the columns of the daily newspapers, showing that men are clamouring for land and unable to get it. At every Land Board their applications considerably out-number the blocks available. </para>

                        <para>- It is true that there are lands available for selection, but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> says, the eyes of the country have been picked out. The lands that are available are many miles removed from means of communication, either by sea or railway. Further, men would require some assistance in order that they might be placed permanently upon the lands of Queensland. But whatever may be said with regard to Queensland, that remark is not applicable to Victoria, nor, I believe, is it applicable to New South Wales. In Victoria, for a considerable period, we have been losing our rural population. Why? Because the estates are growing bigger and bigger, and farmers and farmers&#39; sons are being driven away from the land of their birth or their adoption because of their inability to get suitable land to  cultivate. It is true that Queensland offers inducements to people to settle there. </para>

                        <para>- &#163;200.000 to induce people to come to -Australia for the purpose of further lowering the wages standard and the comfort of the people of Australia. The workers in every part of Australia have to fight every inch of their &#34;-di, and pay heavily, too, in order to get a measure of justice and protection for their industry, while many thousands of landless men in every part of Australia are unable to get land. Yet it is proposed by the Government to spend &#163;1,000 under this schedule - and the Prime Minister says that if the States Governments co-operate with him he is prepared to spend &#163;200,000 in one year - in order to flood Australia with people who, when they  get  here, will be unable  to obtain either work or land. Recently in New  South Wales immigrants&#39; pockets have been so depleted that they have had to sleep in the Sydney Domain; they have tramped miles and miles of that State in the hope of obtaining work, but their efforts have been fruitless. I offer no objection to the introduction of suitable immigrants, free from any contract, but before I give assistance in that direction I want to see the needs and requirements of the people now in Australia met. </para>

                        <para>- I am not concerned about Canada. I am here as a representative of Australia. There are in Canada large tracts of country which the Government are placing at the disposal of new-comers. But in Australia there has been a tendency on the part of Governments in past years to assist in the aggregation of huge estates, and until the Commonwealth Government face the difficulty in front of them Australia will never be able to carry a big population. That difficulty is land monopoly, and the rapacity of the earth  hungerer  in every State. Australia will never be favorably looked upon in other parts of the world until the Commonwealth Government adopt a system of land values taxation to burst lip the big estates, and by that means enable those in search of land to get it. I desire to elicit from the Government some information as to the way in which this money is to be expended. Is it to be given to paid agents in the old country who know little or nothing about Australia, and who will write highly-coloured advertisements in order to lure to Australia people who, when they get here, will find themselves unable to obtain employment or land, or is the Immigration League to be further subsidized? If so, I shall be no party to agreeing to this item in the schedule. </para>

                        <para>- He ought to show it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> cure for the alleged land monopoly was the imposition by the Commonwealth Government of a land tax. I hold that the Commonwealth Government have no power to put on a land tax. But we are not here to discuss constitutional questions on this Bill. In face of the return which I called for recently with regard to the alleged monopoly of land in Australia, showing the land alienated and unalienated, any argument in that respect falls to the ground. About 94 per cent, of the land in Queensland is unalienated. It is attracting population, unfortunately not from the Old Country, but from the other States. The land is as fine as can be found in almost any part of Australia, cheap in price, and attractive in productivity. Western Australia is also attracting immigrants from the other States. &#39; That being so, in the case of those two great States and their land administration, what injury can be caused to a single worker in the whole of Australia by attracting the attention of the outside world, and especially of the people of our own kith and kin, to the vast riches and resources that still lie undeveloped in this great continent? Towards the end of his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> made a hostile reference to the statement reported to have been made at the Lord Mayor&#39;s banquet by the Prime Minister. That statement, which was made in, I think, a moment of the highest political sagacity, was that, if the Commonwealth Parliament would permit him, he would increase the grant in aid of immigration from ,&#163;20,000 to &#163;200,000 for the year. If the Prime Minister, with his knowledge of the financial resources of the Commonwealth, considers that we can spend .&#163;200,000 per year for the &#39; introduction of immigration, no money spent on any service of&#34; the Commonwealth will give such valuable results. Not a penny too much can be spent in advertising Australia and&#39; making its vast resources known to the world. I am not in the confidence of the Prime Minister, but I think that neither he nor any other member of this Parliament contemplates disturbing the labour market in the cities of Australia, or our&#39; settled industries. I have spoken to the Prime Minister privately upon this matter, and I believe that he has no wish to do so. I certainly have no wish to disturb the labour market. I know sufficient of my own State and of other States, although I am not personally acquainted with the other countries of the world, to say that vast portions of our 3,000,000 square miles of territory are equal to the land of any country on God&#39;s earth. What sort of an advertisement is it of Australia for honorable senators opposite to assert that we cannot spend the &#163;1,000 or &#163;2,000 asked for by the Government as a first instalment of a vote for the encouragement of immigration when we have that vast undeveloped territory ? </para>

                        <para>- It is not that. I do not mind an interjection made for the purpose of eliciting further information. No question of internal or naval defence, or even of the Tariff itself, is so important to the States and Commonwealth Parliaments as is the question of a well-devised system, of immigration for Australia. If Canada could take in an average of 125,000 to 130,000 immigrants yearly for the last six or seven years, why cannot Australia get some of them ? </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking impromptu because I may not have another chance of discussing this important question during this session. So far as the declaration of the Prime Minister on this question is concerned, I know no party. I hope that no influence or menace from the party, which in each Chamber keeps him in power, will cause him to depart one tittle from the policy which he has indicated. Every- worker in Australia is benefited by the introduction of every person who is capable and worthy of earning a decent wage. If we introduce men of the same type as our forefathers, who have helped to make this country what it is, that must prove of immense benefit, not only to ourselves, but also to the immigrants. The best statisticians in the world have been dealing with the problem of what is the economic value of one man to a country. The value is  put  down by some statisticians at as high as  &#163;200 per  year. Of course, that refers to a  man  who is capable of  doing  work  and  is  in  a country which can  afford  him work. If that be so, the annual introduction of  5,000  or  6,000  immigrants of a suitable and well-selected class would be not only no danger to the working classes here, but  would  provide  an  addition to that national fund from which they and other workers may draw either to increase or to maintain their rate of wages. Either we want people in this country, or we do not. If we want people we must pay for them, or give them some assistance to enable them to come. If the Committee does not want immigrants, if it is going to quarrel with this vote, let it say so straight out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> wishes to put the position in this way, &#34; I am very friendly to our own people in the Mother Country. I have no objection to them as they are a very fine people. It might be highly desirable, indeed, to bring such persons to this country, but before you do so I want to know whether the loafers and the parasites in the domain of Sydney or Melbourne, or somewhere else, are perfectly satisfied.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- It is quite possible that in the future, as in the past, we shall get some immigrants who will be failures. To-day, every progressive nation on the earth is competing for population, especially for British and European people, but it is not asking for the domains and parks to be scoured before it goes into the open market. What is to prevent our following the example of  Canada, Argentina, or the United States? Is every nation of the earth pursuing an unsound, unwise policy, and is all. wisdom confined to Australia? I ask honorable senators on the other side to declare themselves clearly on this question, to state the. conditions under which they &#34;think the immigration should be begun, or, when begun, should be continued. If they will not make that statement there can be only one reasonable inference drawn from their silence, and that is that the Socialist Party, or, if they prefer the term, the Labour Party, are opposed to a. system of immigration. How did the three great States on the Continent of America develop their territories? Each State threw open its territory freely to the people of Great Britain and Europe. Only a few years prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth we regarded Argentina as a mere geographical expression, as a hot-bed of revolution, as indicating everything reactionary to the modern spirit. Yet within the short space of ten years what do we find? Argentina has gone ahead by leaps and bounds as compared with Australia. If we can judge by reports and statistics, it is one of the most prosperous countries on the Continent of America. The people of Argentina are doing their duty. They have the common horse-sense to understand that  there is only one way in which to develop a great territory, and that is by opening it up to the people. Again, take the case of Brazil, which is also developing rapidly. It is competing for population from Southern Europe. It has not to think so much as we </para>

His  speech confirms us in the position we have taken up. If it is proposed to spend public money in introducing immigrants, we should first prepare for the information of applicants a true statement - of the exact position of affairs here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has called our attention to a return which has been laid upon the table at his instance, and which shows that 94 per cent. of the land of Queensland has not been alienated. In his speech, however, he said that  94 per cent. of the land of that State to-day is available, when he knows as well as I do that a large portion of that percentage has been leased to squatters, and thus locked up for a term of at least twenty-one years. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; on the condition that the State pays for all the improvements made. The lessees have a right to hold on to their improvements, and on reappraisement to secure a renewal of their interest for an additional twenty-one years. The return as to the area of unalienated lands in the various States, which has beep placed on the &#34;table of the Senate, is useless as giving any indication of the area of land available for settlement in Queensland. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger wishes to put himself right, he should move for a return showing the area of land actually available for settlement. On the general question, I am prepared to back the Prime Minister in spending as much money as he thinks necessary to bring immigrants to the Commonwealth. I realize their value to Australia as much as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, but the people we ask to come here should be told the plain truth. We should not bring them here under false pretences, and have them sorry for coming afterwards. &#91; remember that in the late seventies and early eighties, there was a regular system of immigration in operation in Queensland. Ships bringing immigrants were arriving at the rate of one a month, and I have myself assisted to . carry away from Queensland dozens of immigrants, who did not remain a week in the State, to New South Wales, Victoria, or South Australia. They were so absolutely disgusted with the prospects before&#39; them as to be only too glad to work their passages, beg their passages, and, in some cases, to &#34; stow away &#34; in order to get out of Queensland, because of the way in which they had been misled as to what they might expect, by immigration lecturers who were sent to the Old Country, and paid so much per head for every immigrant they could secure. To-day, according to the newspapers, captains of ships at Newcastle are complaining that the demand for men for their ships, in the shape of blood money, is so excessive that they wish to put an end to it. Immigration to Queensland was carried on in the same way iti the days to which I have, referred. The commission received by the immigration lecturers was really blood money, and they were prepared to send out any one and every one they could induce to leave the United Kingdom. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger desires to induce immigrants to come to Australia, he should tell them exactly what lands are available for settlement, and should not paint a rosy picture, leading them to believe that 94 per cent, of the lands of Queensland are awaiting settlement. I (particularly wish to enter a protest against the Government permitting the expenditure of any money voted for immigration purposes by any irresponsible body. If Commonwealth money is to be spent on immigration, let it be spent through Government officers. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable senator should tell the truth about Australia, and that is all I ask him to do. The Government should see that advertisements and circulars referring to immigration contain only reliable information, . and should carry out the work themselves. Then, if they circulate information which is not reliable, they can be put out of office, whilst, if the money voted for immigration be handed over to irresponsible persons, we shall have no .check upon the way in which it will be spent. &#39; </para>

                    <para>. - I somewhat regret that the debate should have proceeded upon a misapprehension. I wish honorable senators to understand distinctly that the vote now before the Committee is not for the purpose of subsidizing any immigration league. So far as <inline font-style="italic">&#163;600</inline> of the amount is concerned, the object is to purchase 10,000 copies of <inline font-style="italic">Australia To-day,</inline> a publication issued by the Commercial Travellers Association, for circulation in the Old Country. Honorable senators who have had an opportunity of seeing the publication to which I refer will have observed that it is not only well &#34;illustrated, but contains a vast amount of useful and most reliable information. If we are not prepared to rely upon a statement of the facts in relation to Australia, we must have but a very poor opinion of our own country. I do not think we can speak too highly of its prospects and its magnificent resources. The publication to which I have referred may be relied upon to supply most valuable information concerning the Commonwealth. The immigration policy of the Government can hardly be -fully discussed on this vote. It is quite true that on the Estimates there is a vote of &#163;20,000 for the purpose of advertising the resources of the Commonwealth, .&#163;500 of which has been already voted in Supply Bills. About ,&#163;400 will mainly be utilized in connexion with Reuter&#39;s cables to the Old Country, giving particulars of matters of great public moment to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Elaborate messages, for. instance, in regard to the Tariff, and giving information as to public affairs and  public  business in the Commonwealth. That is done not to subsidize Reuter&#39;s, but in order that useful information concerning Australia may be given publicity in the press of the Old Country. I can give honorable senators a good illustration  pf  the practice hitherto followed in giving the people of the Old Country information concerning Australia through the press. When I was in London two years ago there was a change of Government in the Commonwealth, which honorable senators will probably regard as a matter of grave moment. The only reference to the matter which appeared in the Old Country was a cable message, occupying about an inch of space, in two or three only of the London newspapers, intimating that a certain gentleman had proposed <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> vote of want of confidence, and that thereupon the Reid-McLean Administration had decided to resign. Some days later another small paragraph appeared stating that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> had accepted office, and had selected certain gentlemen as his colleagues. That information was published in only a few of the newspapers of the Old Country, and matters of public interest and information regarding the resources of Australia are seldom published at all. Consequently we have resorted to the practice of sending cables, and when we bear the expense we stand a better chance of securing their publication in the press of the Old Country. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that we do gain a certain advantage, because by. sending the messages by Reuter&#39;s the information is distributed to all the newspapers. I was asked for some information with respect to the vote of &#163;1.500 for the repatriation of Pacific Islanders. Honorable senators will remember that the vote for this purpose last year &#39;was ,&#163;12,500. The expenditure was ,&#163;8,or5. . So that we did not spend the whole amount. This year it is proposed to vote ai sum of .&#163;6,500. It is estimated that the total expenditure will be ,&#163;14,515- The expenditure to date is &#163;8,015, and a sum of &#163;1,139 has already been voted and expended in 1907-8, making a total of &#163;9,154. My honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> also asks for some information with regard to the New Hebrides. There was last year on the Estimates a sum of &#163;500, of which only ,&#163;73 was expended. That amount was granted to British settlers in the New Hebrides by way of subsidy on their maize to the extent of 6s. a bag. That only involved an expenditure in 1906-7 of &#163;73. Now it is proposed to make an alteration. From the first of this month assistance is to be given to British settlers by allowing them a refund which would be equal to half the duty. In order that British settlers may get this refund, it will be necessary for them to make a statutory declaration before the British  Deputy  Commissioner. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that the sum appropriated for the purpose of advertising the resources of Australia is as much as we ought to spend in connexion with so important a matter. The Prime Minister said in a public speech on Saturday night that he was prepared to spend  &#163;200,000  in this direction. I presume that. he meant  &#163;200,000  per annum. But further down in his speech I notice that he said that the Commonwealth is prepared to find the money if the States are prepared to find the land. If that is the position which the Prime Minister intends to take up, considerable time will elapse before the Commonwealth spends  &#163;2.00,000  a year. If the States continue to carry out the policy which they have adopted in the past, there is very little hope of extended land settlement. The States of Australia have not yet provided land for the settlement of their own people. I do not see, therefore, any prospect of an effort being made to procure land for people who may be brought from oversea. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has approached the question in his usual style, and has declared that any amount of land is available in his own State. &#39; I am not very well acquainted with Queensland conditions, but it is well-known that in Victoria to-day thousands of acres of the most fertile lands on God&#39;s earth <inline font-style="italic">axe</inline> locked up. No chance is given to any one to settle upon them. What hope have we of using the resources with which nature has blessed us in this country, unless we take steps to utilize those lands? If the Government of the Commonwealth intend to spend money in developing the resources of Australia and bringing people to the Commonwealth, their first duty is to insist that the land shall be thrown open. Even in the Northern Territory, where we certainly ought to place population, there is a most objectionable system of land tenure. If the Commonwealth Government took over the Northern Territory to-morrow, they would find considerable difficulty in throwing land open for settlement. Mention has been made of the policy of bringing men from English towns to work here. But when artisans and labourers have been brought from the Old Country in the past, what has been the result? They have simply entered into competition in our capitals with the workmen already in the country. . They do not go on the land at all. Nor are they well adapted for agricultural pursuits. I have no objection to money being spent on advertising the resources of Australia,. It is a splendid investment. But before the Government can embark on an immigration policy it will be necessary for them to face, fairly and squarely, the question of imposing a tax upon the unimproved values of land. The result of that would be to at once throw open vast tracts of territory which are at present lying idle. Then they will have some foundation for their immigration policy. I am not saying this in a deprecatory spirit. There is not a citizen in the Commonwealth who has a greater hope for the future of Australia than I have, nor is there one who has larger ideas of the possibilities of our country.&#34; But, still, I think that it is incumbent upon us to do something to provide constant employment for our own people, and give them a chance of settling on the  land,  before we bring in an indiscriminate influx from the Old Country. </para>

I have risen, not so much for the purpose of offering any observations of my own, but to quote a higher authority than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger can pretend to be. If the Government wish to know what ought to be done to develop the Commonwealth, and advertise its resources in the Old Country, let them pay attention to the extract which I am about to read. 1 shall not quote from the utterances of a Labour man. I have selected a Conservative, the Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent.</inline> These remarks were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> while he was travelling through the western district of this State, and was filled with a, spirit - I do not mean anything bad - of resentment at the fact that he traversed miles of land upon which hardly a house was to be seen, let alone a human being. 1 can quite understand a warm-hearted man like the Premier of Victoria giving utterance to the words which I am going to. content myself with reading. He asked his hearers, as reported in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age-</inline><inline font-style="italic">to</inline> conjure up the teeming population that would be settled if the estates were subdivided, the amount of work that would be provided and the wonderful prosperity. &#34; Instead of having this contemptible broken little Streatham,&#34; he said, &#34; You would have a large and prosperous town. If they had these large estates in other countries they would have taxed them up to the hilt long ago. They would have had a land tax. I am told that there is about 600,000 acres in the hands of trustees, who can do nothing with it. &#39; There is an area here fit to hold half the people of Canada.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The fact that there were 3,000 individual applicants makes the position even worse. Will not a part of this &#163;1,000 be spent to send that statement to the Old Country? I might refer to South Australia or New South Wales; but, above all, the case that has been put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> himself is proof positive that what we need is land reform. If the Government could wire  home to the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> and other newspapers that there was suitable land on fair terms for the people, no party in this Chamber would more gladly assist the Government in obtaining immigration than we would. I myself am an assisted immigrant. There is no disgrace in that. A nephew of mine wrote to me about two years ago from Scotland, asking me if I could recommend him to come to Australia. He said that he would like to get on the land. I could not honestly recommend him to come at that particular time.  5896 <inline font-style="italic">Supply Bill</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">(No.</inline> 3). </para>

                        <para>- Landlordism is rampant in Scotland, but I could not recommend him to come here to go on the land. If I could have done so, he would probably have been here. If a few immigrants from the Old Country could write to their friends at Home, and say &#34; We have arrived safely in Australia. We have plenty of work and reasonable pay,&#34; would not that be a grand advertisement? But when the people at Home read the telegrams from New South Wales, that some of the immigrants who arrived recently, instead of finding comfortable homes, and work to support themselves and their families, have had to camp in the Sydney Domain </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable senator is mistaken. No doubt he always makes out the best case he can for himself and his side. Until we have suitable land for the people who want it, it would be unjust&#39; and unfair to bring immigrants here to compete with those who are here already. In that view I am supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline> the only Labour Premier of Australia, who stated not long since that nearly 1,700,000 acres of splendid land in South Australia is held practically by a few men to the exclusion of many others. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator ought to know, if he does not, that South Australia has a Conservative Upper House which blocks reform. There are members in that Legislative Council, in which I spent six years, who are as conservative as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> They hold so firmly to their views, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> does to his, that the &#34; deil &#34; himself could not shift them.

The members of the Labour Party take exception only to the lying information that has often been sent from Australia to the Old Country with the object of inducing people to come here under false pretences. We think that a fair statement of the conditions under which people work in Australia, the probabilities of obtaining employment, the chances of getting land, and the different kinds of districts, land, and rainfall, should be given to the people on the other side of the world, with the object of inducing them to come here to better themselves, and at the same time to build up a large Australian population. </para>

                    Ledger to make a by-and-large statement that we have millions of acres of splendid land available for people to settle on. As
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline>
                    pointed out, a very large quantity of that land is locked up, because it is leased. It is still in the hands of the Government, but it will be locked up for a considerable time to come. The character of the land itself is really good. I do not suppose there is better land in the world than the major portion of Western Queensland, but I will show what chance men have Who go out to settle on it. It is not because the land is not good, but because there is not the rainfall. About six years ago, the&#39; land laws of Queensland provided that the maximum area of a grazing farm should be 20,000 acres. That was regarded by everybody as a reasonable area in a large portion of the State for a man to make a living upon. In some portions of the State the maximum is 5,000, 10,000, or 15,000 acres, but in the case of a large proportion of the land of which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline>
                    Ledger was speaking, the Parliament of Queensland, . on the recommendation of a Royal Commission, had to alter the land laws so as to make, not 20,000 acres, but 60,000 acres, the maximum for a grazing farm from which a man could make a living at all times. No one expects that sort of land to be opened up for closer settlement.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                    knows very well that a man who takes up a grazing farm in those districts needs to have at his back a large sum. To an ordinary immigrant, who lands here with i100 or &#163;200 in his pocket, that land is absolutely useless. It really requires a man with a large sum at his back to go out and take up the land. If it were fit for close settlement in blocks of 160 or 320 or 640 acres, -it would probably be within the reach of the average person who came along, because the Crown could afford to grant very reasonable terms indeed. I desire to acquaint the Committee with the position in Queensland. The fact that for the last few years there has been a demand for land in the State has compelled the Government to purchase a large area, so as to be able to supply land to applicants. In his last financial statement the Treasurer gives a list of the estates which have been purchased, chiefly on the Darling Downs, and the amounts which have been paid for them. It may be of interest to honorable senators if I read it to them -

                        <para>-  A large portion has been resold. The Government of Queensland has lately been concerned in a big arbitration case, in which no less than &#163;12,000 has been spent on law costs. The Government has taken Jimbour, which is, I suppose, one of the best estates in Queensland. It comprises an area of 150,000 acres, valued at &#163;450,000. The &#34;Government has also the right to spend annually <inline font-style="italic">&#163;500,000</inline> in the purchase of land to supply the demands of immigrants or other persons. In the face of such truths, what is the use of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger telling the Committee that in Queensland  there are hundreds of thousands of acres on which persons can settle? That is the sort of information which has been transmitted to the other side of the world time after time. People have been induced to come to Australia by lying statements until to-day Queensland and the other States are practically misrepresented in the old country as not having the land which it was stated they had available for people coming here. </para>

                        <para>- To some extent I admit the truth of. that contention. In North Queensland, where there is, I suppose, one of the finest scrubs in Australia, a demand arose for land to be cut up, but the Government were not in a position to get surveyors to do the&#34; work.. Why ? Because, for five or six years after 1897, there had been practically very little work for surveyors to do. </para>

                        <para>- I was only replying to the interjection, sir. Surveyors left Queensland, and now when their services are required they are not available, but that difficulty will, I think, be overcome. I do not believe in crying &#34;stinking fish&#34; about Australia. In my opinion, it is as good as, probably better than, any country on the face of this earth. In the Commonwealth, a man has a better chance and greater opportunities than he has in very many countries. At the same time, Australia needs to be governed in the interests of the whole people, so as to make available and accessible lands which are required for settlement. Then we shall have, not only the men on the land earning a living, but also work for a large number of persons in the towns, in fact, all over the continent. I propose to quote from a recent utterance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston,</inline> Premier of- Queensland, who, I suppose, is in a position to know as well as any one what is the condition of things locally. Replying to some remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Philp,</inline> the leader of the Opposition, on the 31st July last, he is reported, .on page 71 of the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> to have said - </para>

It is . said that men cannot be got in the State, and that somebody could not get a man at Longreach the other day to chop wood. Here is a remarkable thing : When the men engaged in the sugar industry came to see me some months ago urging me to bring in farm labourers wholesale for that industry, and pointing out that if I did not do so they would be thousands of men short this year, I arranged with them what they themselves admitted were fair terms for bringing out men for them, and I do not think we brought out more than 600 men. Although they were getting the men brought from Europe and landed on their farms without any cost except ^5 per head - the Government doing all the rest - yet the demand! for men, when it was limited by- that restriction,, petered down to 500 or 600. The half of those men are in Queensland now, and I should like to know where is the great demand for men ? </para>

We have passed a Closer Settlement Act. I don&#39;t know how to speak of that matter - whether it will work satisfactorily or not. We are now endeavouring to adopt some method of conservation of water. In a State like Queensland, where there is in some places a paucity of rainfall - an irregular rainfall - it behoves us, as custodians of the public welfare, to endeavour to do something in the way of looking after the conservation of water, so that when the times come - if they do come again - when there will not be a bountiful fall of rain, we may have a sure water supply. We have also a policy of immigration, and let me say, very shortly, what my views on this immigration policy are. I am not one who believes in the indiscriminate introduction of immigrants into Queensland. I will be no party to any policy which does not carefully scrutinise those people who are coming here, and which does not see that before anybody comes here there is work ready for each individual when he comes. (Hear, hear !) I do not believe in flooding the labour market by introducing people here, and so cutting down wages. I believe in a steady and a regular flow of immigration to those districts which need men of a certain type to develop them, and as long as I have any voice or say in the matter I will support any policy of that kind. But it should be under proper safeguards and restrictions, and I am glad to say the Government is prepared to give the same facilities to ordinary individuals who may want labour as they have already given to other individuals. I want to point out that, although there has been a great cry for immigrants, up to the present time the supply has practically more than exceeded the demand - that the demand, at all events, when put face to face with concrete proposals, with definite offers of contract, has so shrunken in its dimensions as to be almost normal. </para>

This is borne out by a return which was placed on the table of the Senate only a little time ago.

                        <para>- No; I do not. I believe there is room in Australia for millions of people. But we cannot dump millions of people down here to-day or to-morrow and expect to place them all at once. There is plenty of good land in Australia, although, unfortunately, much good land is locked up from settlement. In proof of that statement, I have only to remind honorable members that in nearly all the States the Governments have spent large sums of public money in repurchasing the land in order to sell it again to people who require it for closer settlement. In addition to this in -Queensland, a number of estates on the Darling Downs have been subdivided by their owners and sold to persons desiring to settle on the land. A considerable amount of settlement has taken place in that way. There are extensive areas of good land in other parts of the State still in the hands of the Crown. It is at some distance from railways, but railways are being built, which, I believe, will be the means of opening up a very considerable area of land, which the Queensland Government will throw open for settlement as soon as they can. We are not opposed to people coming to Australia. As a matter of fact, the members of the Labour Party have never objected to people coming to Australia on the same terms as others who came here, whether at their own expense or with the assistance of the Government, prepared to accept whatever work they could get. But we do object to public money being squandered wholesale in the circulation of misrepresentations and lies in the older countries of the world concerning Australia, to induce people to come here. Shortly, the history of immigration in Queensland is that in that State we have spent <inline font-style="italic">, &#163;3,000,000</inline> of public money in assisting immigration, or more than has been spent for the same purpose by all the other States of Australia put together. In the eighties we were bringing out large numbers of immigrants at the public expense, and the bulk of them, instead of remaining in Queensland, went south in the  belief that they could better themselves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> smiles, because he knows that a very considerable number of people brought out at the expense of the Queensland Government, went to New South Wales and Victoria in those days. We do not believe in continuing that system. Public money may be spent in various ways in letting people on the other side of the globe know the resources of Australia, and the opportunity afforded to better their condition bv emigrating to the Commonwealth. There will shortly be an exhibition held in London, and I have no doubt that public money will be spent by all the States Governments in advertising at that exhibition the resources of the several States. That will further the immigration policy quite as much as expenditure by the Commonwealth Government, whilst the States will have the advantage of being able to offer facilities which the Commonwealth Government are unable to offer, since they own no land. We have no objection to expenditure to secure the publication of reliable information concerning Australia in the older countries of the world, but we believe, at the same time, that no effort should be spared to see that the information given to the people whom we desire to attract to Australia is reliable, and not misleading. </para>

                    <para>. - We are all agreed that Australia possesses great and important resources, that her population is much smaller than it. ought to be, and that we should strain  every  nerve to increase the number of our people as rapidly .as possible. We know that Australia cannot be properly defended, nor can her resources be properly developed, unless her population is very much augmented. For that reason it is desirable not only in the first place to make the resources of Australia available to people who are already here, but then to advertise those resources in other parts of the world. It appears to me, however, that if we are to publish statements in Europe with regard to Australia, they should be as near the truth as possible. Nothing should be suppressed; nothing should be exaggerated. The plain, honest truth should be told, and no one should be able to complain afterwards that he was brought here under false pretences. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has told us that it is the intention of the Government to purchase &#163;600 worth of copies of a publication, a specimen of which 1 hold in- my hold. I do not know how this publication is to be circulated - whether it is to be placed in public libraries or handed round to people who wish to come to Australia. We have had no information on that point. But it is extremely desirable that we should know. It is an elaborately got up publication, but it is not one which the average immigrant would be likely to look closely into. It is not &#34;a very handy document for circulation. </para>

                        <para>- It is only fit for a library, or some place of that kind. My experience in the Old Country was that only a small proportion of the people whom we wish to attract to Australia either visit public libraries or have an opportunity of doing so. So that the probability is that if we buy a large number of copies of this publication, it will find its way into the hands of only a comparatively few people. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt there is that difficulty.&#39; But I think the Commonwealth Government ought to be able te issue a publication about the truth of which we should all be pretty well agreed. It is not wise to cry stinking fish. Australia is probably the finest country under the sun. But, whilst I say that, I have to admit that we labour under disadvantages peculiar to this country. We hear a great- deal about Canada, but I have just read in the <inline font-style="italic">Statesman&#39; s Year-Booh</inline> that over 5,000,000 acres of free land were granted to immigrants by the Dominion Government last year - land, 160 acres of which would support a man and his family. Have we in Australia to-day 5,000,000 acres of land that we can cut up immediately into farms of 160 acres and hand over free of charge to immigrants, except as to the fee of  about a dollar for transfer? The land is not available. What we need to do, as I said at the beginning, is to make available a very large proportion of the land that is at present lying idle. </para>

                        <para>- The Dominion Government is in a much better position than is the Commonwealth Government in regard to promoting land settlement. The Commonwealth Government does not own an inch of land. But the Commonwealth! Parliament holds in- its hand the key which can open the door to every acre of unused land in the Commonwealth. It is a key which can open millions of acres of land for settlement. All it has to do is to turn that key in the right direction and the thing is accomplished. Let us take the case of Tasmania, that tight little island which is so efficiently represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> Tasmania has been losing population for a number of years. </para>

                        <para>- With all due respect to you, sir, and with every desire not to get out of order, I suggest that we are now discussing the voting of a sum of money to be used for the purpose of purchasing copies of a publication, a specimen of which I hold in my hand. It is intended to circulate this publication in the United Kingdom. I am contending that the whole truth about Australia&#39;s resources should be told in any statement which is made in Europe. I find a great deal in this publication about the huge areas of land available for settlement iii Australia. I think I am perfectly justified in pointing out that several States are losing population because of the artificial scarcity of land caused by a few persons monopolizing huge areas. </para>

                        <para>- From 1891 to 1901 Victoria lost by emigration 111,577 persons. In 1901-2-3-4. she lost 45,885 persons. That is to say, in fourteen years the total loss was 157,462 persons. It was not the old men and women who left Victoria, nor was it the young boys and girls. It was the flower of her population. Why did they leave? Simply because they could not get land on which to settle in their own State. </para>

                        <para>- The fact remains that a very large proportion of the agricultural population of Victoria, men and women who were born and bred on farms, and who were accomplished in all the arts of agriculture, were compelled to leave their native State because land became so scarce that they were not able to buy it. Such is the case with regard to three States - Tasmania, South Australia, and Victoria. New South Wales is a very much larger State, about four times the size of Victoria, with huge areas of land not yet taken up. Yet, reading in the newspapers recently a report with regard to an estate called Brookong, I discovered that for fourteen small farms there were no fewer than 1,100 applications, and, on another occasion, 101 four farms there were 260 applications. That sort of thing has been repeating itself call over the State of New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- - Those facts prove conclusively that something very like a land famine exists in New South Wales as well as in the other States. I believe that Queensland, from the agricultural, pastoral, mining, and timber points of view, is the premier State of Australia, but even there we find the trail of the land monopolist over all, blighting our progress, obstructing the development of the country, and clinging, like an old man of the sea, around the neck of the State. And all the while representatives of Queensland come here and tell us of the millions of acres of unalienated land there ! No doubt there are many millions of acres unalienated, but are those lands situated within the pale of cultivation? Are they near railway lines, or within the rain-belt? Are they such lands as men, more especially men from Europe, without experience, and probably with little capital, would care to settle upon? They are not, and every one of our Queensland representatives knows it just as well as I do. The following is a list&#34;, on the correctness of which honorable senators may rely, of large estates in one small corner of the Darling Downs : - Jondaryan, 150,000 acres; Ellangowan, 90,000 acres; Rosalie Plains, 24,000 acres ;  O.K.,  near Dalby, 1:1,000 acres; .Bowenville, 6-,000 acres; Daandine, 43,000 acres ; Harrow, 24,000 acres; Yandilla, 89,000 acres; Wyobie, 48,000 acres; Bon Accord, 35,000 acres; North Devon Park, 6,300 acres; Rosalie Plains,. 45,000 acres; Felton, 41,000 acres; Callandoon, 90,000 acres; Cecil Plains, 121,226 acres; and Kurrowale, 55,000 acres. In addition, an estate of 150,000 acres, named Jimbour, has recently been resumed by the State Government at an extortionate price. </para>

                        <para>- They are all in the one district. The information I have &#39; given has been taken from the records of a Select Committee appointed in Queensland to obtain all the information possible when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kidston&#39;s</inline> Land Monopoly Tax Bill was before Parliament. It can therefore be relied upon. Although we have in Queensland a very large area which has not been taken up, it is land which we could not ask immigrants from Europe to settle upon. It would practically be condemning them to failure to send them out, new to the country, into those districts without experience and without capital. If we are really in earnest about adding to our population, and about getting our- land settled, the first thing we ought to do is to break up the land monopoly which undoubtedly exists in every one of the States. In Queensland the Government have been compelled to buy back from private owners nearly &#163;1,000,000 worth of land. All, or a very large proportion, of that land has been resold in small areas, and the Government last year obtained power from Parliament to spend no less a sum than ,&#163;500,000 per annum in repurchasing land from private owners upon which to place settlers, without any further reference to Parliament. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the serious situation which these facts disclose. Here we have a country practically in its infancy, with only  4,000,000  people, and a territory of between  3,000,000  and  4,000,000  square miles, or not quite a square mile to every man, woman, and child in it, and yet in every settled portion of the. Commonwealth we find the hand of the land monopolist holding in an iron grasp the resources of the country. I read with very much pleasure one portion of the speech of the Prime Minister at the Lord Mayor&#39;s banquet. He said that if the States would provide the land, the &#39; Commonwealth would find the people. I quite agree with the Prime Minister </para>

                        <para>- -There is no doubt about that. When the States provide sufficient land for immigrants, no party in the Commonwealth will be more ready to spend public money, if need be, to bring the immigrants here than will the Labour Party. But we insist upon the first condition that the lands must be thrown open. Not a single State is preparing to throw open the land. The authority which- the Queensland Government have obtained from Parliament to spend &#163;500,000 per annum in buying back land, instead of being likely to promote settlement, will rather have the opposite effect. What is the result when you find a buyer with half-a-million in his hands coming into the market every year? </para>

                        <para>- The policy of closer settlement has an immediate bearing on the question of the development of the resources of Australia. The Prime Minister has announced his willingness to spend &#163;200,000 a year in introducing immigrants if the States find the land. That ought to be made a condition precedent. When the States find the &#39; land, I shall be prepared to assist in finding the money to introduce immigrants, if money is necessary, but until the States do find the land, then, so far as I am concerned, not a single farthing will be voted by the Commonwealth Parliament for that purpose. The Prime Minister might have gone a little further, and said, &#34; This is a great national question; although the Commonwealth does not own any land, it has the power to unlock the land if the </para>

The truth ought to be told about, not only the advantages, which are many, but also the disadvantages of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Nor do I, and that is exactly why I am advocating the policy of taxation. The community-created land values are now being taxed by private enterprise, and I should very  much like to. see that state of affairs put an end to. We all wish to see Australia&#39;s population increased, her land settled, and Australia placed in a position to defend herself against a possible invader. That can only be done by largely increasing our population, and the highway to an increase of population is to burst up the land monopoly, and multiply the means of getting employment for such persons as may come here. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. There was no rush of buyers then. A vast number of those who bought the land from the Government had to sell it back to the Crown, and even if they were to charge interest, they would not get back what they paid originally. But, take the districts in north and central Queensland. If it is proposed to advertise Australia in the Old Country, let me point out that in the Burnett district there is a very large area of which a great portion is Crown land. Up to the present time, we have no railway through the district. It has been stated here to-night that all the pastoral lands are locked up. Year after year, leases comprising very large areas - as much as 200 or 300 square miles - are falling in. One-half of each area is allowed- to the lessee, while the other half, if not applied for by any persons, is held under an occupation licence from year to year. At the present time, millions of acres of land are held under that tenure in Queensland, But, aa <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley</inline> has stated, it would be of no use to bring out from the Old Country immigrants with ,&#163;100 or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;200</inline> apiece, and expect them to go on that land and make a living, because it is necessary for a man. to have a capital of .&#163;5,000 or &#163;10,000 to take up such land. The Government get from 18s. to 25s. per square mile for land in that district.  All the land which is held under occupation licence could be &#39;handed over to immigrants, but I am sorry to say that a large portion of it is not suitable for agriculture, and is  only  suitable for dairy farming. In the Burnett district a few years ago - from Bundaberg to Gladstone, and from Gladstone to Rockhampton - no such thing as a dairy farm existed, but at the present time there are hundreds of them, and there is room for thousands more of them. The district has a fair rainfall, but the further one goes north or west, the less the rainfall is. We want to induce immigrants to come to this country, but not to flood the market. An immigrant has to put up with hard times to a certain extent, because he is new to the climate, and to the conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has spoken of the immigrants who came out in the seventies. Long before the seventies, there were shiploads of immigrants arriving in Queensland every month. A great number of those persons were induced to come out by means of advertisements, in the Old Country. A great number of  them went through very  hard times. They could  npt  go and get work  at so much per day. Some of them had to go on the land with very small means, and for the first five years they experienced great difficulties. But to-day I guarantee- that they are the backbone of Southern Queensland. We ought to be able to do something like that for the Commonwealth. I do not think that there is an honorable senator, no matter on which side he sits, who wishes to flood the country with immigrants, and leave them to shift for themselves. I believe that we would all like to see more people in Australia, and perhaps to have more liberal land laws. But we cannot get everything at once. It has been stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and the records prove, that in Queensland there has been a .want of men to survey the land as rapidly as it- has been required by the people. There are a great many applications for large areas. </para>

                <para class="block">Queensland to try to open up its lands as quickly as possible. By the construction of a few railways on the. border of the central and southern districts, millions of acres of land would be made available for farming. In my opinion, the State has done very well indeed in having opened up its territory as it has done within a period of forty years. The squatter, who did not buy but leased the land, has had his use and his day. In those times it was very hard indeed to get persons to take up land. I remember the time when Rockhampton, in central Queensland, was the farthest outpost. Those who took up vast areas west and north used to . provide themselves with rations and go away for twelve months with* a few sheep. But they have had their use and their day. I believe that not only the Government of Queensland, but also the Government of the Commonwealth, will do their best to bring out persons to settle on the land, but not to allow them to flood the towns. No inducements should be held out by advertisement to bring out men for the latter purpose. If we can only create a slow but steady stream of immigrants who will settle on the lands, towns will grow up, and artisans and others, if the wages and conditions are favorable, will come out here at their own expense. When I was in the Queensland Parliament, I said I was prepared to go even farther than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is now. I said I would give the land to the immigrant if he would settle upon it, and establish a- home. That is the only way in which I think we shall get people to come here. Canada and other countries are pursuing that policy. In my opinion, Australia has better country than has Canada, but the climatic conditions are altogether different here. In Canada they have a regular rainfall, but we have not, and that is one of our drawbacks. I can remember the time when it was stated, not only by individuals, but by the press, that the land on the famous Darling Downs would not grow even a cabbage, and that it was of no use, except for depasturing sheep and cattle. The same thing may be&#39; said of country in Queensland on which very few persons are settled to-day. But in the course of twenty-five or thirty years all that country will be turned to a useful purpose. The proper way in which to induce persons to come out to the Commonwealth is for the States Governments to resume the land required at a fair rate, and to allow the immigrants to pay the money in the course of twenty or thirty years. Let no lies about the States be published in the Old Country. Let every fair inducement &#39; be offered to persons to come here, but let the truth be told all the time. </para>

                        <para>- Such a measure has been passed in Queensland, where we have a nominee Legislative Council, and I believe that in time South Australia will fall into line with the other States. We have heard a good deal about persons leaving one State in the Commonwealth and going to another. We know that from Victoria thousands have gone and are still going to Queensland and New South Wales, because in those States they can get land equal to that which they are leaving in Victoria for about one-tenth of the money ; that is, if I can believe what I have read in the press. AH the facts should be put before the people  of . the Old Country by the Commonwealth Government, so that intending emigrants may know exactly the conditions with which they Will have to put up if they come here. Every possible care should be taken in order to insure that no false statements concerning the States shall be published in the Old Country. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the Bill is read a third time, I wish to call attention to a matter which is, I think, of great public interest. I saw an announcement in the newspapers the other day that it was proposed to make certain additions to the building known as the Commonwealth offices, at the corner of Spring and Collins streets. I had rather serious objections to the Common  wealth  Government improving the property -of private individuals, and I intended to raise the question when the votes for the Department concerned were under discussion ; but I made inquiries so as to shorten time, and I have been informed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council and&#39; the Secretary to the Treasurer that the building referred to was bought by the Government of Victoria for the use of the Commonwealth. Therefore, any arrangement made for additions to the building will be made between the Victorian and the Commonwealth Governments. I think it  Tight  that the public should know this, and that is why I have referred to the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I have been astonished that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did not do so. I thought that probably the Government had been in consultation with the honorable senator, and that that accounts for the attitude they are at present adopting. I think that everything should be done decently and in order, and before we are asked to take the responsibility of voting for the expenditure &#39; provided for in this Bill we should be given an opportunity to study the items. I protest against the third reading of such an important measure being passed when there are so few members of the Senate present. I do not say that there is not a quorum present, but I should say that there is barely a quorum. In the circumstances, I protest against honorable senators being asked to take a leap in the dark, and to deal with public money in a way in which we would not deal with our own. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has evidently been in consultation with the leader of the Senate, and decided upon the policy of jettisoning the Bill that we may all get to bed. I think we should be given an Opportunity to discuss the Bill to-morrow. I have no desire to stonewall the measure. I hare never done that kind of thing, and could not do it if I would, but I complain that good reason has not been shown why this Bill was not introduced earlier, in order that the &#34; clodhoppers,&#34; as men who come from the country have been described to-night by one honorable senator, should be given time to understand what it contains. Men who have worked on farms and have followed the plough, naturally take longer to understand these questions than . those whose education has fitted them for work at the accountant&#39;s desk. Why should &#39;we not be given an opportunity to fully consider every measure before it is passed into law ? The Government has refused the opportunity in the present instance, and I am, therefore, opposed to the third reading of the Bill at the present time. </para>
