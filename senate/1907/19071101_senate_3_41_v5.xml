                        <para>- I desire to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council a question, without notice, with regard to the statement he made yesterday that before the end of the session the Government will give Parliament an opportunity of dealing with the question of Naval Defence. I desire to know whether they will make their statement of policy as soon as the information which they are now seeking is made available, whether the Tariff is out of the way or not - in other words, whether they will give us an undertaking that they will state their policy to Parliament as soon as they procure that information, without respect to the progress made with other legislation. I do not ask the honorable senator to say whether they will give Parliament an opportunity of dealing with the question, but simply whether they will state their policy as soon as the information for which they are waiting is made available? </para>

Russell, who unfortunately is not present, denying that he wrote any. word of the letter in question.

                    <para class="block">This is a Bill to amend the law relating to parliamentary elections and to provide for the settlement of questions relating to the qualifications of members of the Parliament and to vacancies in either House of the Parliament. The facts relating to the South Australian election for senators on the 1 2th December last, the subsequent proceedings in the Court of Disputed Returns, the proceedings in the High Court, the application for a mandamus and likewise the proceedings in the form of a petition presented to the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Vardon, are matters well within the knowledge of honorable senators. On the occasion of the consideration of the petition to which I have referred the Senate unanimously passed a resolution to the effect that as a particularly complicated question of constitutional law was involved it was desirable that the petition should be referred for consideration and decision to the High Court. On that occasion I undertook to introduce the necessary Bill to carry! out the desire of the Senate. Having regard to the very pronounced feeling which existed amongst honorable senators, especially as to similar questions which might arise in the future, I also indicated that the measure to be introduced would cover all similar . cases that might hereafter arise. I hope that honorable senators will not be under the impression that the Bill now introduced is unnecessarily complicated in its form. It may appear' to be so because of the limitations imposed by the Constitution, and the circumscribed area of our powers in dealing with questions of this description. But if honorable senators will favour me with their attention I think I shall be able to make it perfectly clear to them, and to satisfy them that I have at least endeavoured to carry out consistently the wishes of the Senate. In the first place, and as a foundation for the legislation that I am now introducing, I invite the attention of the Senate to the 47th section of the Constitution, which says that - </para>

                    <para class="block">That, of course, is a well-known expression, giving us full power within the limits of the Constitution -  any question respecting the qualification of a senator or a member of the House of Representatives or respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed election to either House shall be determined by the House in which the question arises. </para>
                    <para class="block">So that there are three special contingencies provided for in this section in regard to which Parliament has power to legislate; namely, as to the qualifications of senators, as to any vacancy which may occur, and as to any disputed election. As to our powers in this connexion we have been somewhat enlightened by the judgment delivered by the High Court on the occasion of the mandamus proceedings. The judgment sets out - </para>

                        <para>It seems to be clear that the question whether there is or is not now a vacancy in the representation of South Australia in the Senate is one of the questions to be decided by the Senate under section 47, " unless the Parliament otherwise provides." Parliament can no doubt confer authority to decide such a question upon this Court - </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That, of course, is the High Court -  whether as a Court of Disputed Returns or otherwise. But until the question is regularly raised for decision we reserve our decision upon it. </para>
                    <para class="block">So that not only have we .the reasonably explicit terms of the  47th  section to guide us, but also this express statement by the High Court as to. our powers. The Bill which is now presented may be said to resolve itself - into three parts. The first part deals with the petition immediately before the Senate. In wide and comprehensive terms it provides that by virtue of this measure that petition shall be transmitted to the Court of Disputed Returns - which, of course, is the High Court. It also' goes on to provide that all requirements which under ordinary circumstances and under the Electoral Act would be necessary for the purpose of placing a petition formally before the Court shall be taken to have been complied with. Then in wide terms it prescribes the procedure which is to be adopted by the Court of Disputed Returns and enables the Court to say as to what that procedure shall be. A very important feature of the measure is sub-clause  4 of  clause <inline font-style="italic">2:</inline> It says that on the hearing  of  any petition to which the clause applies, the Court of Disputed Returns shall have the powers conferred by section  197  of the principal Act so far as they are applicable. I will content myself by that reference to the sub-clause for the present, and will refer honorable senators to the  197th  section of the Electoral Act in regard to the powers with which the Court will be endowed in dealing with this particular petition. The sub-clause to which I have alluded says that, so far as the powers contained in section  197  are applicable, they are to be made to apply, and it is only fair to explain to honorable senators that the whole of the [paragraph of section  197  will not be applicable in the special circumstances of this case. That section says that - </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to say definitely, but it is probable that that provision does not apply. As I have already said, it is probable that paragraphs  4A 5, 6  do not apply. Because honorable senators must bear in mind that when an election is referred to in the Electoral Act, that election does not include the choice of a senator in terms of section  15  of the Constitution. But that matter is fully covered in a way which I shall afterwards explain. It will be observed that under paragraph  7  of section  197  of die Electoral Act it is provided that the Court of Disputed Returns shall have power - </para>

                        <para>Your petitioner therefore humbly prays that the choice of election by the said Houses of Parliament of the said the  Hon.  James Vincent O'Loghlin to hold the place of a senator for the said State of South Australia may be declared null and void, and that it may be further declared that the said the  Hon.  James .Vincent O'Loghlin has not been duly chosen or elected as a senator or to hold the place of a senator for the said State of South Australia, and that the said the  Hon.  James Vincent O'Loghlin has no right or title to sit, vote, or act as a senator in your honorable House, and that the seat of one senator for the said State of South Australia is vacant. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators, therefore, have to consider two contingencies which may occur. It is quite clear that if that petition is dismissed by the Court of Disputed Returns, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> will be confirmed in his seat; in other words, it will be held that the procedure of election by the State Houses was properly resorted to, and that SenatorO' Loghlin was duly elected. But the other contingency is that, in the event of the petition being upheld, it will be declared that the choice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> by the State Houses was null and void. The seat, under those circumstances, would be declared vacant; I want honorable senators to realize those two contingencies quite clearly- first of all that if the petition is dismissed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin's</inline> election will be confirmed; if, on the other hand, the petition be upheld, it is equally clear that the seat will be declared vacant. At this juncture, I point out that sub-clause  4  of clause 2 of the Bill incorporates those powers of section 197 of the Electoral Act which are applicable. The sub-clause goes on to say that the Court shall, in addition thereto, have power to make any declaration or order, which the nature of the case may require. So that, in addition to paragraph 7 of section 197 of the Act, there is given to the Court the additional power to make any declaration or order which the case may require. </para>

                            <para>- The effect of the Court declaring a vacancy would of course be that the procedure of the South Australian Parliament in this case would be rendered invalid. We have then to resort to the Constitution for guidance as to what takes place in the event of the vacancy. There are three modes of filling a vacancy. The first is popular election, prescribed by sections 7 and 12 of the Constitution ; the other two are contained in section 15 of the Constitution, which prescribes that the election shall take place by both Houses of the State Parliament sitting together, or, in the event of the Houses not being in session, by the nomination of the Governor in Council. Section 21 shows what must take place whenever a vacancy arises in the Senate - </para>

                    <para class="block">Constitution is at once closed to the State Parliament, and therefore the only other mode which can be followed is a popular election in terms of sections 7 and 12 of the Constitution. We are guided again in this matter by the High Court. It was pointed out to the Court that the Constitution contemplated that' " the election to fill vacant places shall be made in the year at the expiration of which the places are to become vacant." It was therefore urged that it was necessary that the popular election in this case should have taken place prior to the expiration of 1906, but the High Court said that that was not necessarily so, as, if a vacancy occurred, and a popular election had to take place, the election could take place "now as for then." I have shown that the two modes of filling the vacancy included in section 15 of the Constitution would be closed to the State Parliament if the Court of Disputed Returns declared the vacancy to exist. The only resort therefore would be to popular election. Section 7 of the Constitution provides that - ' ' The Senate shall be composed of senators for each State, directly chosen by. the people of the State, voting, until the Parliament otherwise provides, as one electorate " ; and also that " The senators shall be chosen for a term of six years, and the names of the senators chosen for each State shall be certified by the Governor to the Governor-General." I have already drawn attention to section 21, dealing with the notification of the vacancy to the Governor of the State. Then section 12 of the Constitution provides that " The Governor of any State may cause writs to be issued for elections pf senators for the State." The whole responsibility, once the vacancy is declared, is cast upon the Governor of the State acting with the advice of his responsible Ministers. </para>

                            <para>- He could not, because in the event of the Court declaring the seat vacant, the law would be declared to be that that particular class of procedure does not apply in a case of this kind: I have now endeavoured to make clear that portion of the Bill which refers to the pending petition. One or two honorable senators, after reading the clause,- have  kindly  suggested that it might be made a little clearer bv the introduction of a few words, which I shall be only too happy to add, in order to carry out the expressed wish of the Senate, and more conclusively to identify the particular petition referred to. As the petition has been to some extent dealt with by resolution, and by the return of the deposit, it might be suggested that it was no longer " pending." I propose therefore, by adding a few words, to make the identity of this petition absolutely clear. Clauses 3 and 4 are purely formal. The Electoral Act has been so cut up that the introduction of a consolidating measure at an early date will be necessary. Clause 5 is the second part of the Bill. Its object is to provide that when any cases of the character involved in this petition occur again under section 15 of the Constitution, they are to be dealt with by the Court of Disputed Returns. It came somewhat asa surprise to many honorable senators to find that it was not competent for the Court of Disputed Returns to deal with this particular case. But the word "election" used in the Electoral Act has a strictly technical meaning, and was deemed not to include the word " choice," which is used in section 15 of the Constitution. Clause 5 provides that the choice under section 15 of the Constitution shall be deemed to bean election within the terms of the Electoral Act, and will have the effect of making applicable to "choice" under section 15 the whole of the provisions of the electoral Act relating to disputed returns. Section 192 of the Electoral Act provides that "the validity of any election. or return may be disputed by petition addressed to the Court of Disputed Returns, and not otherwise." Consequently under clause jj the validity of the choice under section 15 of the Constitution could be disputed in the same way as could any other election. Then part 16 of the Electoral Act, which relates to the Court of Disputed Returns, would become applicable. </para>

                        <para class="block">The spirit of the section is that a candidate for either House must be discharged of these disqualifications at the time his election takes place, and in the case of any question arising with respect to any of these qualifications or disqualifications, we provide that the Senate or the House of Representatives shall have power, by resolution, to refer the matter to the High Court. Honorable senators may ask why such cases should not automatically be referred, and why we propose to reserve a discretion to the Houses of the Parliament to refer them. The reason is that there are many cases where, for instance, a man is an undischarged bankrupt, or has been guilty of a crime, or holds an office of profit - obvious cases involving no possible question of law - and it would be absurd to send such cases to the High Court for decision, as they would depend on facts easilv ascertained. </para>

It would be absurd to refer such questions to the High Court, but where any question of law is involved, the Bill provides machinery whereby, on the passage of a resolution in the House of Parliament concerned, the case will at once be transmitted to the High Court. The proposed new section 206BB provides that in these circumstances, when such a resolution as I have referred to is passed, it will be the duty of the  President  of the Senate, or of the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, to transmit to the Court of Disputed Returns a statement of the case, together with any records or papers which are at the disposal of Parliament connected with the matter. Then it is provided that any person interested in the question may appear before the High Court, or the High Court may direct them to appear. The powers of- the Court are made as ample as possible in the proposed new section 2o6dd. In order that there may be no possible doubt about it, we propose to specially confer on the Court all the powers contained in section 197, to which I have already referred; and, in addition, we provide that the Court shall have power - </para>

It may be suggested that we have proceeded with excessive caution in the proposed new section 206DD, in endowing the Court with powers in addition to those contained in the Electoral Act, but we have thought it well to use the words of the Constitution itself. Then we provide that when a decision is come to by the High Court it is to be transmitted to the Senate. I think I have made clear the terms and provisions of the Bill. One suggestion, for which I am thankful, has been made. It will be in the knowledge of honorable senators that the High Court is the Court of Disputed Returns, and power is provided under the Electoral Act for one member of the Court to sit alone as a Court of Disputed Returns. I propose, in dealing with this Bill in Committee, to provide that the petition with which we have been dealing shall be referred to a Full Court of the High Court, consisting of riot less than three Justices. I think that honorable senators will agree that, in all the circumstances, that will be more in consonance with the general desire. I submit the Bill to honorable senators, with confidence that it will be unanimously and expeditiously carried, so that this unfortunate question, which has been raised in connexion with the seat held by my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> may be settled by the High Court one way or the other. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia) [11.30]. - It will be recollected that last evening we got rather into a tangle, which the gallant effort of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> was not quite successful in unravelling. The question was whether the omission of the words " State or," to which the Government assented as a drafting amendment, would in any way interfere with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane's</inline> desire that there should be a power given to prohibit removals from State to State, but not from one part of a State to another part of it. It will occasion my honorable friend no inconvenience and not interfere with his object if he will assent to the omission of those words, and then raise the issue which we all desire to raise in accordance with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> suggestion, and that is the retention or omission of the paragraph. It does not seem to me that we shall gain anything by eliminating the words "State or." If that amendment is made, and the words "or part of the Commonwealth," which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> wishes to delete are omitted, the effect will be exactly the same as though we had negatived the whole of the paragraph, because the paragraph would be unintelligible and ineffective. It would be only wasting time, I think, to deal with a verbal amendment when we can get at the heart of the thing by dealing with the paragraph itself. Therefore, in order to save time, I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> that we should debate the general subject on a proposition to omit the paragraph. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that the honorable senator recognises now that it is bad policy to protect the products of one State as against those of another State by means of quarantine laws. If we omit the words " State or " it will be impossible to build up a quarantine law against the products of any one State as compared with those of another State. The next amendment which will be moved will, if carried, enable the Commonwealth to proclaim any particular part of a State a quarantine area, from which goods cannot be removed. In the matter of quarantine laws, we ought not to recognise State boundaries. If we omit the words "State or ' ' the Commonwealth can quarantine a square mile within a State. We are charged with the responsibility of insuring the health of not only human life, but also animal and plant life. Unfortunately, under the quarantine laws, when the authorities in a State know that their trade is going to be harassed in some way, they try to smother up all knowledge of diseases for the purpose of securing for themselves free ports. This Parliament has to legislate in the interests of six States, and not in the interests of one State as against those of another, as, unfortunately, has been the case in the past. To my knowledge goods have often been kept in a port which was infected. ' During the period of quarantine the goods were stored away ; but so soon as the port was declared uninfected they were shipped, thus carrying 'disease to other parts of the world. That has been a common occurrence. By retaining this provision the </para>

                        <para>- I want to support the paragraph with the amendment suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> and adopted by the Government, because I consider that a law of this kind ought to be administered in the interests of the whole Commonwealth. The intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> is to confine the power of the Commonwealth, whether the law is administered through Commonwealth or State officers, to the quarantining of a whole State as against the other States. The idea of the present amendment is not to confine the quarantine operations to a single State as against the others, but to any portion of the Commonwealth. Let me put the position in a practical way to the senators from Queensland. Suppose that a very dangerous and virulent disease in plant or animal life broke out on Thursday Island, and that that island were declared infected. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane's</inline> proposal, if carried, Queensland would be proclaimed a quarantine area. Do honorable senators want that state of things to be brought about? It would be quite sufficient to quarantine Thursday Island as against the rest of the Commonwealth. Again, suppose that the same disease broke out near the southern boundary of Queensland, and extended northward for a distance of 50or 60 miles, and southward to the New England district of New South Wales. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane's</inline> proposal, if carried, Queensland and New South Wales would have to be proclaimed quarantine areas. </para>

                        <para>- Would not the quarantining of those areas prevent the removal of plants, or animals, or goods from those States to any other part of the Commonwealth? Under the intelligent proposal before the Committee, if carried, the Commonwealth could declare the infected areas in New South Wales and Queensland quarantine areas. That alone would be a quarantine area in respect of the rest of the Commonwealth instead of the two States. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> and his friends will see the benefit of adopting an amendment of this description. I am sure that none of us desires to quarantine the goods, cattle, and persons of a whole State because a part of that Statesman be affected. The possession and administration of this power by the Commonwealth would be of greater benefit to the States than the existing conditions. I will give an instance. A certain portion of Western Australia has been affected by a terrible disease especially afflicting camels and horses. That disease was brought clown from India with some imported camels. It affects only a small portion of the State of Western Australia. Under the existing laws of the States, the whole of Western Australia would have to be quarantined. A State could not quarantine a portion of Western Australia. South Australia, therefore, desiring to prevent the admission of that disease, and administering her quarantine laws for the benefit of her own people, would have to quarantine the whole of Western Australia, as indeed she has done. That is the condition of things which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> seems to glory in, and wishes to perpetuate under this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I feel sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> thoroughly understood the position, he would alter his opinion, because I believe that he really desires to have our quarantine laws administered in a manner beneficial to the Commonwealth as a whole. He would not like Queensland to be quarantined against the rest of Australia simply because there was a disease in one portion of it. He would not like to see the whole of Tasmania quarantined against the rest of Australia because codlin moth got into the apples in one part of it. I am in favour of whatever law we pass in connexion with quarantine applying not only to human beings, but to animals, plants, and goods. The question has been well argued regarding human beings, animals, and plants. I wish to say a word or two as to the quarantining of goods. The Minister has said that horns and hides are goods, but they are also parts of animals. In the part of Western Australia where surra has been life, the camels and horses affected bv it have worn saddles and other gear. It is necessary to prevent the transport of such goods to any other part of the Commonwealth. It is just as necessary that proper care should be taken to prevent the transmission of disease through the instrumentality of goods as through human beings, animals or plants. I sincerely hope that honorable senators will agree to the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - The question that we have to settle regarding this amendment is : Is the Commonwealth going to rule or not? If 'the Commonwealth is to rule, how far is its authority to extend? T think that its rule should extend throughout the whole of Australia. If we do not make our rule universal the power of the Commonwealth will be ineffective to stop disease wherever it may occur. We may have persons escaping from quarantine. We may have goods or animals affected bv disease removed from nne State to another. It will be a lopsided law that we pass. Unless we take sufficient power, the Commonwealth will not- be able either to lift or to impose quarantine in the middle of a State. I point out, however, that if this provision is carried we shall require to alter subclause 3 of clause 13. </para>

                <para class="block">I1 1-S3]- - It is desirable ' in passing this Bill to wipe out as far as we can the geographical boundaries of the States. Hitherto they have exercised their authority in respect of quarantine in their own interests, sometimes to the detriment of their own consumers, and frequently to the detriment of the producers of other States. The Victorian authorities, for instance, have kept up their regulations respecting anthrax in the winter time, when that disease is not active. It should be our endeavour to secure that the free flow of commerce between the States should be interfered with as little as possible. The Bill has been objected to on the ground that it is too wide in its scope. Expressions of dissent have been heard against its application to animals and plants. An amendment has been suggested which would have the effect of forbidding the removal of animals, plants, and goods which have been quarantined from one part of a State to another part. Now, it will surely be agreed that the Commonwealth should exercise to the full the quarantine powers that were exercised by the States prior to Federation. Take the case of Tasmania. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> desires that the Commonwealth shall exercise to the full the powers that were exercised bv that State prior to Federation. Let us consider what the State laws were. According to the New South Wales Act of 1897, section 4- </para>

                <para class="block">So that the Government of New South Wales being endowed with the power to appoint stations for the quarantining of vessels, persons, and things, it necessarily follows that the Commonwealth Government must be endowed with power to regulate the movements of vessels, persons, and goods from one station to another. Section 11 of the New South Wales Act reads as follows - </para>

                <para>Power was given to the State authority under that section to exercise powers affecting goods after they were landed from the ship.

                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOSIAH</inline>SYMON (South Australia)  [12.8].  - Undoubtedly there is very great room for difference of opinion as to the extent of the Commonwealth's powers under the Constitution. Some honorable senators may be of opinion that all the health laws of the States are put within the compass of the Commonwealth jurisdiction. Other honorable senators, of whom I am one. think differently. There is great scope for difference of opinion, but, in my view, we are not entitled to take over, under the plea that we are dealing with the powers of quarantine, those particular spheres of activity which are within the ambit of State health jurisdiction. There is a strong line of demarcation between what is known as quarantine, properly so called, and intended to be taken over as such by the Commonwealth, and the health laws of the States, power to deal with which was to be retained by the States. It is peculiarly the function of the State to control its own social affairs and its own health. It is impossible for us in this Chamber to settle that constitutional question. I therefore take the course which I took in connexion with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, saying that it is a matter to be determined at the proper time by the High Court. I do not profess to rest the views to which I now seek to give effect upon that constitutional position. In view of the difference of opinion that may exist, it is largely an idle waste of time to debate or vote upon the subject from the point of view of the elasticity or extent of the meaning of the word " quarantine " in the Constitution. But the other aspect, on which I do not think there is such room for difference of opinion, is whether it is politic on our part to extend the arm of the Commonwealth so as to interfere with all the State health laws. Undoubtedly the States are entitled to regulate and control their own. measures for the health of their citizens, and also for the animal health and plant health of the States. </para>

                        <para>- Upon that point the honorable senator and myself might, well be agreed. The States are much better fitted to deal with health matters than the Commonwealth can possibly be. Even if it were otherwise, unless we took away from the States the power to deal with their own health matters, great possibilities of collision would be introduced. ' State and Commonwealth authorities might deal differently with different diseases, and that would lead to constant controversy and trouble. No man desires more than <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do to extend the powers of the Commonwealth as far as is- possible, but it is exceedingly impolitic to run the risk by this Bill of encroaching upon the domain which is properly within the more municipal jurisdiction of the States. Is this to be a Quarantine Bill, strictly so called, or is it to be a Health Bill under the guise of a Quarantine Bill ? It ought to be restricted to what are admittedly matters of quarantine. If we leave in it a provision such as we are now discussing, we shall be empowering the Commonwealth to enter into any State, and prevent plants, for instance apple trees affected by the codlin moth, being transferred from one district to another, or from one side of the road to the other. The position would be intolerable. </para>

I ask honorable senators whether they are prepared to arm the Commonwealth to. enter the State of South Australia and prohibit the removal of vines from one side of a road to another, because they have oidium or phylloxera or some other disease? To do so would be inevitably to invite a hopeless condition of confusion, and to provide a fruitful source of conflict between the Federal and State authorities. It is entirely unnecessary to do anything of the kind.

                        <para>- It might not lead to a relaxing of efforts in this direction, but it would lead to an interference in matters which are essentially within the jurisdiction of the States authorities. I cannot understand the Commonwealth interfering in matters of this kind, unless it is shown - and we have had no evidence of it - that the States authorities have been remiss or neglectful, or have abused their powers in some way which has not been made plain. Some reference was made, I think by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley,</inline> on the second reading of the Bill, to a conceivable misuse of these powers by the States authorities to prevent the importation of plants from one State to another in competition with local nurserymen. I admit the possibility of such difficulties arising, but there should be some solid evidence of the evil suggested before we legislate in the direction here proposed. Besides, the answer to all that is that we have another remedy, as I pointed out, against a State which seeks by indirect methods to prevent the freedom of trade between the States which is a fundamental part of our Constitution. Reference was made during the debate on the second reading to differential wharfage rates. All such things are in the same category, and this is not the method which we should adopt to deal with them. I am not dealing with the point of constitutional law which may be involved, but I say that as a Commonwealth we shall be doing what is most impolitic if we arrogate to ourselves the control of all these matters, which can be much better regulated by, and which it was the intention of the Constitution to leave to the control of, the States authorities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> pointed out what he thought would be the effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane's</inline> proposal, and referred the Committee to section11 of the Quarantine Act of New South Wales, which says - </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It would be perfectly futile if, when a ship was placed in quarantine in respect of some virulent disease, we permitted goods from that ship to be landed or, if landed, to be taken away to some part of the State where the disease might be propagated. We must give power, not merely to quarantine a ship, but to prevent the landing of goods, and to prevent goods being surreptitiously taken away by some person who may expect to sell them at a profit in another part of the State. </para>

                        <para>- I take the view that a system of inspection, observation, and surveillance is preferable to quarantine. The disease we have most to dread is smallpox. It has frequently happened that after <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> ship has arrived and passengers have gone into the interior, they have developed smallpox there. In South Australia a number of such cases have occurred, involving the State in considerable expense which necessarily had to be incurred in attending to the patients in the interior. What is our position? The States say to the Commonwealth, "You have the right to quarantine at the seaports, but you must not allow any cases of disease to pass the ports." If we allow any cases to pass the ports, are the State authorities to say that we must bear the brunt of the expense incidental to the treatment of such cases in the interior of a State? There at once will arise a cause of friction. The same thing applies to diseases affecting animals and plants.' As regards diseases affecting man let me cite an instance which occurred at Petersburg, in South Australia - </para>

                    <para>A child was reported to be suffering from small-pox on 2nd December, 1892. She had landed on 12th November, from the s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Karlsruhe,</inline> on which vessel a woman had suffered from an eruption stated to be prickly heat by the ship's surgeon and another medical man on board, but afterwards at Sydney diagnosed to be small-pox. </para>

                <para class="block">The ship had called at Fremantle. Adelaide, and Melbourne, but the disease did not develop itself until the patient reached Sydney. </para>
                <para>This vessel was inspected at Largs by the M.O.H. on account of danger arising from cholera, and was granted pratique. Seventeen passengers landed here, but as twenty-one days had elapsed, no steps were taken in regard to them ; the relations and others who had come into contact with the patient .were, however, strictly quarantined. </para>
                <para class="block">That case cost the local authorities at Petersburg a very considerable sum. Then take the case of a man who went overland from Melbourne, landed at Border Town, and was found looking for work, but in a state of delirium. He was arrested, with the result that two policemen who had come in  contact with him were afflicted with small-pox before it was discovered that he was so diseased. They had to be strictly quarantined in order to prevent a further spread of the disease. That case cost the local authorities at Border Town nearly £500. Friction must of necessity arise under a system which admits of leakages. If we allow diseased persons to land at our ports and pass into the country t surely the responsibility devolves upon us to follow those persons into the interior and take charge of them, and not to throw the burden of their care upon the local authorities? </para>

                        <para>- What applies to persons also applies to animals and plants. So, no matter what we may do, unless we assume the full control of quarantine, there is bound to be friction between the States and the Commonwealth. I think that, as the lesser of two evils, the Commonwealth should accept the responsibility of dealing with any leakages which may occur in consequence of the arrival of any ships in our ports. </para>

                        <para>- That is exactly the point. I believe that if we accept complete responsibility for quarantine in respect of persons, animals, and plants, there will be less friction. I should have liked our system to be based on the same lines as the British system. In Great Britain the ship is examined and sick cases are not sent to a quarantine station, but to the isolation wards of the established institutions. In regard to quarantine, two important Acts were passed in 1896 - </para>

                        <para>- That does not follow., because if the words " State or " were omitted, and my amendment, carried, it would make the paragraph meaningless, and it would have to be recast. The omission of the words, therefore, would not affect the issue I have raised. It seems to me that we are bound to uphold the rights of the States, as long as those rights are properly exercised. It has not been proved that the States have not looked after any cases which have' occurred within their boundaries. It is for that reason I do not support the amendment for -the elimination, of the words " State or." The discussion has gone so far as to show that this is to be a Health Act as well as a Quarantine Act, and that the Commonwealth proposes to interfere with everything. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. I would go so far as to allow the Commonwealth to prohibit the removal of animals or plants from one State to another. As a general principle, I object to our interfering with the control of animals or plants except at the ports, but still, if it is deemed necessary to interfere with them at all, let that interference be confined to the prohibition of the removal of animals or plants from State to State, and leave to the States the control of internal quarantine. Surely they may be trusted to act upon the first law of nature- self preservation. I feel quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> overstated the case a little when he suggested that if a disease broke out at Thursday Island" the whole broke  Queensland "would have to be quarantined. </para>

I believe that the States are competent to look after these cases. There will be a considerable amount of friction if we interfere with quarantine matters inside a State. Where are we to get the necessary officers from? We propose to employ the State officers, but the State Premiers object to our doing so. By means of letters the latter have asked us to leave the control of internal quarantine to them, and yet we are asked by the Government to legislate in face of that request. I do not quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie's</inline> position.

                    <para>. - I think that honorable senators will see by this time that so many issues have been brought into this discussion that the whole matter is somewhat fogged. The amendment before the Chair is as clear as noonday. It is merely a drafting amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> has stated his position in his last speech. He is entirely against Federal interference with quarantine regarding animals and plants. He is trying by a side-wind to defeat the principle of the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> takes up a different position. He is against any quarantine but what he calls real or oversea quarantine. The methods great minds adopt for the purpose of prejudicing people against other ideas than their own are very peculiar. We have heard expressions about "tyranny" and "arrogating powers to ourselves," and " asserting undue authority," as though it were proposed that the Commonwealth should do something desperate towards the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has told us that this is an attempt to interfere with the Health Departments of the different States. It is  nothing of the kind. The Health Departments of the States will not be interfered with unless under very exceptional circumstances. Those circumstances, so far as animals and human beings are concerned, are set forth in the Bill. So far as relates to plants, unless some blight or disease of a serious character breaks out, and it is found necessary to prevent that disease from spreading to another area, the Commonwealth will not intervene. If, for instance, phylloxera Broke out amongst vines, and the Commonwealth authorities came to the conclusion that it would be wise to declare a portion of a State a quarantine area, the effect would be that no vines, nor anything that had come in contact with them, would be allowed to be removed into any other portion of Australia. Surely that is a wise precaution and a proper power to be exercised by the Commonwealth. We are told that the States have been very vigilant in the past in the exercise of their quarantine powers. Why should not the Commonwealth be just as vigilant in the future, with the difference that instead of the whole of a State being made a quarantine area in relation to other States, the Commonwealth would have power to quarantine only the affected portion of the State? If in Queensland there were an outbreak of tick, red-water, rinderpest, or any other terrible disease, or if  in Western Australia there were an outbreak of surra, surely it would be wise for the Commonwealth to have power to declare that the particular area in which the disease occurred should be quarantined rather than that an individual State should be able to declare the whole of the State in which the disease occurred a quarantine area. If honorable senators consider the matter from that point of view they will see that it is in the interests of the whole of Australia that the Commonwealth should have this power rather than that it should remain in the hands of the States. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> wants a disease to spread beyond a State before the Commonwealth shall have power to intervene. Those who wish to see the least friction, the greatest efficiency, and something done to prevent diseases from spreading, and those who wish to prevent the outbreak of a disease in a particular portion of a State, made an excuse for interfering with the free exchange of goods, animals and plants, between States, will vote for the amendment and for the paragraph after it is amended. </para>

                    <para>. - Those who fear that the Commonwealth may unduly interfere with the powers of the States appear to me to have misconceived the situation. As it is now, the Commonwealth having no powers as to quarantine, if an infectious disease breaks out in stock or plants, the States not affected have  practically  to quarantine the whole' of the States affected. The effect of that is, that though there may be only a small infected area in a State, the whole State is made to suffer. </para>

                        <para>- This Bill is an attempt to counteract that jealousy. Assume, for the sake of argument, that a disease breaks out amongst the stock of Tasmania. Being a native of that State, I am proud to say that Tasmania is probably the cleanest of all the States in reference to infectious disease. But suppose there was a virulent disease amongst Tasmanian sheep. Under existing conditions, and under the conditions that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> desires to maintain, the other States would have no option except to taboo the whole of Tasmania with respect to sheep. </para>

If he wishes me to withdraw my amendment in order to allow his own to be moved, I shall do so, but I object to his saying that I know what he intends to do. I have heard him talking now for two days, and I do not believe that a single honorable senator has understood a word of what he was saying. Not a single man here could glean the smallest meaning from the voluminous remarks that he has been pouring out, and I believe that if he went on for two weeks longer we should understand just as little. If the honorable senator wishes to move an earlier amendment, I shall not propose mine until his is disposed of. </para>

                <para class="block">I desire first to enlarge the powers of the Commonwealth with regard to quarantine, if that is in any case desirable. I think we should exercise quarantine powers first of all with regard to arrivals from oversea of persons, goods, animals, and plants, and in the next place with regard to InterState transfers ; that is to say, the transfer from any one State to any other of persons, animals, goods,, or plants. My amendment would not in any way interfere with that. It has been suggested that if we alter this clause we shall endanger the power of the Commonwealth' to prohibit the removal of infection, from a specified part of one State to any other State, but my amendment would not affect that in any way. For instance, it would not affect the power to prohibit the removal of animals, goods, or plants from an indicated area around 'Brisbane to the State of Victoria, New South Wales,, or any other State in the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth authority would still have full power to carry out that prohibition. The effect of my amendment would simply be to remove from Commonwealth  control the prohibition of the removal of infected animals, plants, or goods from one part of a State to another part of the same State. Beyond that it would not go, and I cannot see how its "acceptance by the Government would injure the Bill, whilst it would do much to prevent conflict between the Commonwealth and States authorities. I point out, further, that the amendment refers  only  to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of the clause, and so would not be applicable to persons. It would provide merely for a reservation to the State authorities of the power to deal with the question of the removal of animals, plants, or goods from one part to another of the same State. I have heard it said that it is desirable to give the Commonwealth Government an over-power in connexion with this question, and make it a kind of Court of Final Appeal, to which matters of this kind can be referred. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> regards the power conferred in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> as providing practically an additional Court of Appeal from a local health authority. I believe that is not necessary. Under existing conditions, in nine cases out of ten, these matters are dealt with by some local Board of Health, deriving its powers under a State Act of Parliament, which reserves to the State Government an authority over the local Board in case it does not discharge its duties properly. I think that appeal is all that is necessary to secure the efficient operation of internal quarantine. The further Court of Appeal desired by the Government in these matters would, I think, for many reasons, be undesirable. A practically analogous con,dition of things has  already  given rise to a certain amount of friction in the Commonwealth, in the opportunity afforded to litigants to appeal over the head of a State Court to the High Court- What the Government  propose  would enable a local body to ignore the State authority from which it derives its powers and appeal directly over the head of the State authority to the Commonwealth Government in connexion with quarantine in respect of animals, goods, and plants. That is certainly not a desirable provision, if we wish to promote harmony between the Commonwealth and States authorities. I should not submit my amendment if I thought that it would render our quarantine powers in any way less efficacious. I think that the cases to which the amendment would  apply  might, -with perfect safety, be left to the control of the local authority, and, should there be any failure on the part of that authority to properly discharge its duty, to the authority of the State Government itself. </para>

I point out that this is a quarantine measure; and notwithstanding the fact that one honorable senator who anticipated the present amendment suggested that provisions of this kind would be more appropriate in a State Health Act, it is for us to give the Commonwealth Government the fullest and amplest powers to prevent not only the introduction of disease into the Commonwealth, but also its spread if it is introduced. In paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> power is sought to be given the Governor-General to prohibit the removal of animals, plants, or goods, or parts of animals or plants, from any part of the Commonwealth in which any quarantinable disease or disease affecting animals or plants, exists, to any other part of the Commonwealth in which the disease does not exist. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has moved as a proviso - </para>

It might be that it would be possible in some way or another to prevent- the introduction of animals, goods, or plants, or parts of animals or plants, from, say, a certain area of the State of Queensland in. and about Brisbane into the State of New South Wales, or any other State. But, as I said in introducing the measure, and have since said in Committee, it should not be the part of the Commonwealth authority to wait, so to speak, upon the border of any State, and say", " Until there is a concrete attempt to transfer infected animals, plants, or goods from' one State across the border line to another, we shall hold our hands." We should have the power if the need arose to go into a State and prevent a disease from spreading gradually - not necessarily by any actual operation on the part of man in the nature of a transfer of animals, goods, and plants, but by the ordinary processes of contagion - to the border line of another State, if there was danger that it would do so, and would cross that border line into that other State, whether with the intervention of any human agency or not. </para>

                        <para>- I Could give honorable senators a parallel from the Health Act of every State in the Commonwealth. Under every State Health Act the' central health authority reserves to itself the power to .enter the districts intrusted to local health authorities whenever a sufficient  occasion  arises - of which the central authority must be the sole judge - and the condition of affairs in the district is such as might lead to disastrous consequences in the district itself, or menace adjoining districts. I can quote an instance from Tasmania. Not long ago there was an outbreak of small-pox in one portion of the State, and whatever might be the merits or demerits of the system adopted for stamping out the disease, some little time afterwards the Parliament of the State passed what is known as the Public Health Act, in which, after providing for local Boards of Health for districts throughout the State, a chief officer of Health for the whole of the State was provided for, and in section 22 of the Act it was Provided that - </para>

                <para class="block">That provision was debated at length in the Tasmanian Parliament, and the reason which commended it to the majority of the members of both Houses of that Parliament was that there might, at  any  time, arise a very grave emergency in which a local authority charged with the responsibility of administering health matters might be either unable or unwilling to do what was necessary, and its inability or unwillingness in the emergency might produce disastrous consequences within the district itself, and menace other districts. </para>

                        <para>- But we make a proviso that the power to prohibit shall not extend to the removal of any animal or plant to any other part of the same State. Take Queensland, for instance. That State has generally been regarded as consisting of three divisions, northern, central, and southern. Suppose that central Queensland were an area which the Commonwealth Government decided to make a quarantine area so as to prevent the exportation of animals, plants, or goods to any other State. We might, for our own purposes, declare the boundaries of that quarantine area; but, "riot having the power to quarantine, central Queensland as against northern and southern Queensland, the very articles which we desired to prevent might pass from central Queensland into the north and the south, and come thence into the other States. </para>

                        <para>- I am guided in my opinion bv what I know of what has been taking place in the States. New South Wales complains bitterly that South Australia has excluded her fruits. South Australia complains of Western Australia, and Western Australia of South Australia, in regard to the transfer of animals. This kind of thing has been going on for a considerable time. Each State - motived, no doubt, by the desire to protect its own belongings - rigidly excludes what are considered to be suspected animals, fruits, &amp;c. If there were one authority to deal with these matters, we should regard the whole area of the Commonwealth as undivided, and should  carry  out quarantine on uniform principles. That, I think, would conduce to the better interests of the Commonwealth at large, and make for the maintenance df that freedom of trade and intercourse throughout Australia which the Constitution is supposed to guarantee. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know enough about the merits or demerits of any of the cases to which I have referred. I have simply referred to them as illustrating the fact that the States themselves have not worked in harmony in the administration of their quarantine laws, but that recrimination has been going on between them. I am not in a position to speak as to the merits of any particular case, because I have not been able to go into them sufficiently. I do know, however, that the administration of quarantine law by. the States has been the cause of recrimination, and I think that a great deal of that would be avoided if the States knew that there was a reserve power in the Commonwealth that could be exercised for the maintenance of that great principle of the Commonwealth - freedom of trade and intercourse. </para>

I interjected that that analogy was by no means a fair one, It overlooks our circumstances entirely. It would be a perfectly sound analogy if the power that the States at present have to deal with quarantine had been created by the Commonwealth. But we know that that power has not been given to them by the Commonwealth. It is a power that they possess independently of the Commonwealth. I will, admit that if there are members of the Senate who think that unification is desirable,, this is one step towards it. If we take away from the States every power to deal with their own purely internal affairs in matters of health and disease, whether affecting animals, plants, or human beings, we are rapidly approaching a state of unification. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that it only deals with quarantinable diseases, and that we cannot entirely supersede the local health authorities. But the clause will enable us to supersede them in part &gt; and my argument still holds good with regard to the broader question of unification. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> also argues that if we adopt this amendment whereby the States would have power to deal with "the removal of infection from one part of a State to another, while we reserve to the Commonwealth the power of dealing with the removal from a State to another State, we shall find that our power of preventing removal from one particular part of a State to another State is practically of no use - that in the end it will be simply a power to prevent the removal of animals or plants from one State to another. But let me point out that in practice that will not be the result. Suppose that a quarantinable disease has broken out in North Queensland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> says that because the Commonwealth has not the power to deal with the removal of that disease from North to say Central Queensland, it will spread until it reaches South Queensland, and that in the end we shall have to exercise our power in order to prevent the removal of the trouble from one State to another. But what will be the real position? If my, amendment is carried the Commonwealth will still have the power to proclaim that particular area in North Queensland a quarantine area. It can declare by proclamation that nothing shall be removed from a specified area in queensland to any other State. What will oe the position of Queensland? It will know that if precaution is not taken to prevent the spread of the disease from the north to any other part of its territory the Commonwealth will extend its proclamation, and that its next communication from the Commonwealth will be a prohibition against the removal of anything not merely from the north but from the north and the centre, and so on until the disease reaches the south. In practical politics, when these questions come to be tested, I do not think that any honorable senator will deny for a moment that the very fact that the .Commonwealth has said to Queensland, " Your northern part is a quarantine area," will impel that State, for its own sake, to make every effort to prevent that area from being increased, in fact to prevent its whole territory being declared infected. That will be the practical result of the operation of my amendment. As a matter of fact, by reserving this power to the States, we shall be offering them a strong encouragement, or if my honorable friends like, a strong determining reason, why they should grapple  with the infection at once. Each State will know that, if it does riot deal stringently and determinedly with a particular area which the Commonwealth has proclaimed to be infected, it may have the whole of its territory so proclaimed. No State wants that to be done, because it would involve injury, loss, and suffering to itself. The very fact that this power will be reserved to the Commonwealth is likely to operate as a strong inducement and encouragement to every State authority to prevent the spread of infection. Instead of my amendment doing any harm to the Commonwealth, I believe that it will do good. Instead of its weakening or impairing in any way the efficacy of State action, I think it will strengthen such .action in every direction, and the reasons I have given are such as will appeal to' any State. That being so, I cannot see whyl the Government do not accept the amendment. The only reason I can imagine is that they still desire, so to speak, to be the overlord in everything. I want them to take complete control where they can, and where it is desirable, but I do not wish them to stand aloof waiting until they can intervene and assert their superior position not merely against a local authority but against the whole of the State. I do not care to put the Commonwealth- in a position tn which it can hold itself in terror, so to speak, over a State. </para>

                    <para>. - By his amendment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has, I think, raised the whole crux of ' the Bill, and that is whether or not the Commonwealth shall deal with quarantine administration in the States. In one part  of clause 13 we have agreed that the Commonwealth shall have the power to prevent the removal of goods, animals, and plants from one part of the Commonwealth to another. If the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> is carried it will put the Commonwealth in rather a curious position. Whilst the Commonwealth will have the power under one provision to prevent the removal of vehicles for the conveyance of disease from one part of the Commonwealth -to another,, presumably from one State tq another, it will not have the power to prevent the removal of such vehicles from one part of a State to another part of a State. That I suggest is rather an anomalous position in which to place the Commonwealth. Surely one part of a State is one part of the Commonwealth ! If we empower the Commonwealth to prevent the removal of animals and plants which we know are infected with disease from one part of the Commonwealth to another, how are we going to delineate or draw a" line of demarcation in a particular State? Suppose that at Maryborough, in Victoria, a farmer has pigs  which are infected with a disease, and which he desires to sell -at once. If this amendment were carried the Commonwealth cannot prevent the removal of the animals from Maryborough to Geelong, in Victoria, but it can prevent their removal from Victoria to Western Australia. Victoria. is 'one part of the Commonwealth and Western Australia is another part. Surely, on the same line of reasoning, we can say that Maryborough, in Victoria, is one part of the Commonwealth and Geelong another part. Why should we cripple the Commonwealth in that direction? </para>

                        <para>- That is a drastic remedy to which it might not be necessary to resort. Again the question of reserved powers has cropped up. I believe that if the clause is passed as it <inline font-style="italic">is,</inline> the Commonwealth will not at any time unnecessarily interfere with State administration of health affairs. But if it considers that the authorities of a State are not taking proper measures to prevent the- spread of a disease, it ought to be in a position to intervene and assert its rights. At the present time, one State can set itself against another State, and you, sir, in your second-reading 'speech, illustrated that very forcibly in connexion with the alleged introduction: of the disease of surra to Western Australia. Why should one State have the power to ostracize any other State? </para>

                        <para>- If the Government refuse to accept the amendment, than, in this clause, they want to take at one sweep all expressed, implied, and reserved powers. Let me point out the consequence of doing that.. If the Bill is passed, the Commonwealth will have taken over all its express powers, and will have machinery to apply at any moment its reserved and implied powers. The control of health matters will have been practically taken out of the hands of the States, and for that reason they may throw  up  the machinery for the regulation of health. That is the position in which the Government want to put the States. In answer to my argument on some constitutional points, it was made clear by the Minister of Home Affairs that in this Bill the Government wish to take every tittle of power they can get.  The object of the amendment is to convey to the Commonwealth only the express powers, and to indicate that some powers are left to the States. The effect of the amendment will be to prevent the Commonwealth from interfering with the administration of health affairs by the States. If the Commonwealth Government desire to take express, reserved, and implied powers, to be exercised against the health administration of the States at any time they may choose, surely the Committee is entitled to hear from the Minister a strong reason why the health and quarantine powers which, under local Acts, are reserved to the States, should be withdrawn. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has asked the Government to state what charge they have to make against the health administration of the States. Although the debate has been continued from this side, and the Minister has had more than one chance to reply to that challenge, he has not been able to bring forward one charge of negligence against the States. </para>

                        <para>- When the Government are seeking to get, with the express and implied powers, a drag-net provision, they are practically saying to the States, " We do not care two straws about your Health Acts or health administration, your elaborate appliances and machinery, your scientific investigation, and at any moment we chose to intervene we shall do so." If the Government can constitutionally exercise under the word " quarantine " express, reserved, and implied powers of every kind as against the Health Acts of the States, we are entitled to know from the Government why they seek to be allowed to diminish at any time they choose the powers of the States. I shall give an instance to show how worse than dangerous, how utterly stupid, it would be to allow the Federal Government to exercise extreme powers of the kind. They might be called upon to deal with a case with which they really could not .deal. A few years ago a most virulent form of bubonic plague broke out in a town in Queensland, .some distance from Brisbane. The local health officer and doctors at once diagnosed the disease correctly. That crisis had to be dealt with in less than twenty-four hours. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ham,</inline> the health officer in Brisbane, when the particulars were communicated to him, said " If we do not stop this at once it may spread not only throughout Queensland, but over the whole of Australia." </para>

                        <para>- I shall show how effective the health machinery of Queensland was, and how dangerous it would be to leave a case of that kind to be' dealt with by an authority in Melbourne. If the outbreak had escaped the notice and vigilance of the Queensland authorities, Queensland, and in fact all Australia, might have been exposed to a most dangerous form of bubonic plague. The Brisbane health officer called his nurses together and said to them, " This is a matter of life or death for the patients. The cases will require the greatest skill and attention. If you undertake the cases you will be taking your life in your hands. If you go, you must go at once, for the sake of the health, not only of that town and of Queensland, but of Australia. Will you undertake the duty ?" One nurse - I do not know her name, but she is entitled to be enrolled amongst the heroines of Australia - said, " It is my duty to go. ' ' She went straight away, the patients were isolated, and I believe all of them were saved, but the nurse paid for her devotion with her life. The health administration of Queensland is as efficient to deal with diseases of human beings, stock, and plants as even the Commonwealth Government could reasonably expect it to be. </para>

As there is vigilant, strong and intelligent exercise by the States of their health powers, what need is there for the Commonwealth to step in at this stage? All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons'</inline> amendment asks is that we should respect the existing State machinery. The States have at their command more Acts than we can pass, and can deal with health matters as we cannot deal with them. They can use their Stock Acts and Vegetable Diseases Acts, with regard to which they have exclusive powers. Why, then, should the Commonwealth step in and say, "No, we shall pass an Act which we can put into force at any moment and thrust your machinery aside?" What will be the condition of affairs if the States anticipate the Commonwealth and say, " Take the whole matter over and do what vou like with it?"

                        <para>- That remark is quite irrelevant. We are quite right in passing uniform legislation with regard to quarantine. While seeking to protect the health of the whole of Australia by means of quarantine, we can be perfectly consistent in insisting at the same time that the Commonwealth should respect the elaborate machinery of the States, and recognise the successful work which the States have done in preserving their own health within their own borders. I hope that before the amendment is rejected, the Committee will take into most careful consideration the probable results of adopting that course. I fear that if the amendment is rejected the States will throw the whole of their machinery into the hands of the Commonwealth Government. Is that to be desired ? The Minister has stated more than once that we may take it for granted that the Government will not use these powers except in some extremity. </para>

                        <para>- It is australian to think that that will be so. In any case, the present Government will not always be in office. We have no right to assume that, if the administration of quarantine is handed over to the Commonwealth, it will always be in the hands of a hostile Government, or of a Government which would be constantly endeavouring to lessen the powers of the States. </para>

                <para>SenatorMULCAHY.- Australia has always a remedy by turning that Government out and getting a better one. In a great many cases the Commonwealth will have to depend absolutely upon immediate local administration, and must be prepared to devise some kind of machinery which will be promptly applicable to sudden epidemics. We must have the means , of immediately applying the laws which we make. The only way in which that can be done is by showing proper and friendly consideration to the States 'Governments and the local authorities working under them. If we are to hand over to the Federal Government only half of the question of quarantine, and only half of the responsibility of its administration, we had better not hand over any of it. We have had cases even in Tasmania where an epidemic in a particular locality has resulted in the quarantining of the whole island. Queensland is twenty-six or twenty-seven times the size of Tasmania, and does it not seem monstrous to perpetuate the farce of practically isolating the whole of that great State because of a local epidemic in some remote corner of it ? Is not that really what it is now proposed that we should do? It is the duty of the Parliament of Australia to see that the Government of Australia exercise their powers judicially and with proper respect for the States. If we are not capable of doing that, let us declare that we do not believe that Australia will ever have a Government which will administer these powers fairly, and let us vote against all such Bills as this. I like the Bill, although in certain parts of Tasmania powers previously taken under the Commerce Act have made the people suspect that the Government would sometimes be disposed to ride roughshod over local interests. But be that as it may, quarantine is one of the legitimate subjects which ought to be handed over fully, and with it the responsibilities attaching to it, to the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - Two days have been taken up with the discussion of this question, and a large number of honorable senators have refrained from taking part in the debate in order to allow a vote to be taken <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger rises this afternoon and gives us a whole rigmarole about what happened in Queensland at the time of the bubonic plague. I was there, and know a good deal of what happened. I know that the central authority had to step in, in spite of the protests of local authorities that were charged with the responsibility of doing the work, and put men in to carry out the law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger tells us that a particular place was struck with bubonic plague, that the health officer in Brisbane was wired to, and that a terrific commotion ensued. I do not deny that some people had a considerable amount of work during that epidemic, but, at the same time, where the local authorities would not do the work intrusted to them, the State authority had to step in. It is exactly the same in this case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger has said that if we conferred on the Commonwealth Government the power proposed under this Bill, in all probability the State Government of Queensland would absolutely decline to have anything further to do with the regulation of health matters in the State, and would throw the whole of the responsibility upon the Commonwealth. That can hardly be said to be a compliment to the State authorities of Queensland. I do not believe they would do anything of the sort. I do not believe that they are so mean and contemptible as to do what would stamp them as unfit to occupy a public position in any part of the civilized world. It is absurd to say that the States authorities' would seek to evade their responsibilities simply because the Commonwealth Parliament, in pursuance of a power intrusted to it by the whole of the people of Australia, sought to provide, by legislation, for a reserve power to enable, the Commonwealth Government to carryout the necessary work for the preservation of public health, in the event of a State authority neglecting to do so. I know something of the people ' engaged in the administration of the Health Act in Queensland, and I am sure* that, whatever provisions we may include in this Bill, they may be trusted to carry out the duties imposed upon them by the people whom they represent. But let us deal with this question from a practical point of view. I have already explained that, not very long ago, .we had the New South Wales Government cutting the State of Queensland up into sections, and imposing quarantine in the State just as they thought fit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has said that they dealt merely with, the country just beyond the border between the two States, but as a matter of fact they cut up the whole of the State into sections, and declared that no stock from Queensland should be allowed to cross the border into New South Wales unless they had undergone quarantine for a certain time within the sections which had been marked out. </para>

The 'tick pest was spreading down the coast of Queensland, and although the Queensland Government, by the expenditure of public money, did their best to check the spread of the pest, there was a scare on the subject in New South Wales, where the people thought that the Queensland Government were not doing all that they might, and an effort was made to induce the Government of  New South Wales to practically quarantine the whole of the State of Queensland. They did not do all they were asked to do, because that would have had the effect of injuring their own markets, but they divided the State of Queens land into certain areas, and insisted that stock intended for New South Wales, even though they came from Cape York or the Gulf country, should undergo a certain period of quarantine, in the different districts they had marked out, before being taken- into New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>. - I opposed the second reading of the Bill, because I thought that the Government were proposing to go too far. I was quite prepared to support a Bill which would give the Commonwealth Government power to control oversea quarantine, but this Bill goes very much further than that. I should .like to know what State in the Commonwealth has asked that these powers should be given to the .Commonwealth Government. I do not know of any State in which such a measure as this has been asked for. We have been told that the powers proposed to be given to the Government are provided for in the Constitution. Thar, may be so, but because we are given the powers we are not therefore bound to exercise them. I object to the power proposed to be conferred under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of this clause. Many representatives of the different States have spoken strongly against this Bill, and it would appear that the Senate is going to force upon the States a law which they do not want. How that can be said to be working amicably with the States authorities, I am at a loss to understand. As honorable senators appear to be anxious to adjourn, I shall not further detain the Committee. I intend to vote for the amendment. </para>

                        <para>I desire very briefly to make a personal explanation. It was charged against me yesterday - by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> of Victoria, I think - that a letter which I read here was not from the Agricultural Implement Makers Society, but had been prepared by their solicitor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Woolf. I have in my hand a copy of a letter sent to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Woolf,</inline> the original being addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> who, unfortunately, is not present, denying that he wrote any word of the letter in question. I wish to make that statement in refutation of the accusation made against me that I had read a document which had been prepared by a solicitor, and improperly represented to the Senate that it was prepared, as this letter now positively affirms, by the society whose stamp it bore. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>I inquired also by whose authority the stamp of the Implement Makers' Union had been put upon it. It was for that reason that, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> commenced to quote from the document, I asked him who had signed it; because I think that, when a senator quotes from a document which professes to be issued by a great union of workers, we have a right to know whether he has satisfied himself of its genuineness. The agent who approached me with regard to this matter last evening requested me to try to get a certain clause in the Bill recommitted. When I inquired who had written the circular which he handed to me, he informed me that it was written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Woolf. I have not the slightest doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> obtained his copy from the same source. The press cuttings which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has quoted were also sent along to other senators by the same gentleman or his agent. </para>

                        <para>.- This morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> made a statement in support of the assertions which he made yesterday in regard to the non-collection of Excise on harvesters. I also rose, and made an explanation upon the same subject. When we met this morning three letters had been received by members of the Senate - one by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> one by myself, and one by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. .Russell. The letter was addressed to me. I opened it hurriedly, read it, and came to 'the conclusion that it was intended for me. Knowing that the statements which it contained respecting myself were incorrect, I made certain assertions concerning a solicitor whose name has been mentioned in connexion with this business. Subsequently, in handing over the document to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, I found that it was not an original letter intended for me, but a copy of an original document which was intended for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell, although it was addressed to me. In fairness to the honorable senator, who has been criticised, I desire to make this explanation, and also to say that I have since received a communication from the legal gentleman in question in which he finds fault with my criticism of yesterday in regard to what I considered an unfair action upon his part. Whilst I do not wish to be unfair to this gentleman, I was not aware that he had done so much in certain directions as he asserts that he has done. In respect to some of the matters mentioned in his letter, perhaps my remarks were unfair, but I do not agree with all that he has said in his communication in respect of my having unjustly reflected upon his recent action. </para>

I do not exactly know why that picture presents itself to my mind at this juncture. Of course, I can quite understand the desire of members of a certain party to make things as unpleasant for me as possible. I. have made things sufficiently unpleasant for them, and they naturally desire to repay me in my own coin. If I were to remain silent upon the present occasion; it might possibly be thought that I had been stricken speechless under the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline> J. Russell. I merely rise to say that, while doubtless he thinks that his assertions are true, of my own knowledge.I know that several of them are so singularly inaccurate that it would unduly delay the rising of the Senate if I were to expose them. </para>

                            <para>- It is not necessary for me to say who has " fallen in," because, after all,' that is merely a question of one's personal view. But I think I have satisfied honorable senators that I quoted from the document in all' good faith. Certainly, until I have definite reason for believing that I was misinformed - and I have no reason for thinking so at present - I shall maintain that the document, which is a very remarkable and important one, is as genuine as I have represented it to be. Beyond that, I make no charge against any honorable senator, except that I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> is under a misapprehension upon a number of points. I make no accusation reflecting either upon his honour or his reputability as a member of this Chamber. </para>
