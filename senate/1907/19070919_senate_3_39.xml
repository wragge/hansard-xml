If that were done, Victorians . would support justice then being done toTasmania. and if so, willbe explain what is meant by the term &#34; Customs leakages &#34; by the parliamentarian who desired information from the Premier of Tasmania, and state the amount which the Tasmanian Government is claiming from the Federal Government for alleged Customs leakages? Also, can he state what Victoria has done to Tasmania to call forth such language and what is meant by the threat that unless they get justice they will retaliate upon Victoria by getting their goods from other parts of the world ? </para>

I am aware that for a little time negotiations havebeen going on in consequence of certain claims made by the Premier of Tasmania upon the Commonwealth in consequence of its being alleged that certain Customs leak ages had been caused by reason of the purchases made by the people of that State - and other States of course - in Victoria and New South Wales. </para>

              <para>- And to some extent acknowledged. It is quite impossible to gather the extent of the alleged leakages . I think it is a matter for negotiation. The Government is distinctly sympathetic in regard to the claims which have been made, but before any definite figures can be arrived at it is necessary to consult the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria, because those are the States which are chiefly interested. The negotiations are &#34;proceeding, and, in the circumstances, I hope that the most generous consideration will be accorded to Tasmania in respect of its claims. </para>

May I put it to my honorable friend for his consideration whether it would not be a matter then for the States to deal with? Would it not be only by virtue of its being within the scope of the Navigation Bill that the Federal Parliament would have any control over it? </para>

            <para>Sydney, Sunday. - Some, time since the Military Department was furnished by the Council of the National Rifle Association of New South Wales with a report in regard to the defective ammunition supplied to cadets. No steps have apparently been taken to investigate the matter. The council made arrangements to submit the ammunition to an exhaustive trial at Randwick yesterday. Three cadets fired ten shots each at 200 yards, with the result that with the ammunition as previously supplied to the cadets, they made 46, 44, and 40 respectively, but with the colonial ammunition, as now served out, they could do no better than 10, 10, and 5 ;  and to ask the Minister, <inline font-style="italic">upon notice -</inline></para>

          <para>. - I think we ought to have furtherinformation from the Minister in regard to this item. The question of rice cultivation has already been discussed in connexion with previous items, when we were told that rice can be grown successfully in Australia. I expressed the opinion that so far as Queensland is concerned there is not much, if any, land available for rice growing. I believe that in the Northern Territory, by a system of irrigation, rice can be cultivated along the. big flats on each side of the Adelaide River. I was talking some time ago to a Chinaman who had been growing rice there. He said that it would grow readily enough, but the objection to its cultivation was that the growers could get only one crop per annun off the land, whereas in Canton and other places two and sometimes three crops are obtained. </para>

            <para>- I take it that it would be costly. Several thousand acres would have to be put under rice by one individual who would control the irrigation business. If that be so, the amount of the bounty does not seem to be sufficient to make it worth while for a man to enter upon rice cultivation under such conditions. What facts are there to make it appear that the bounty is sufficient to enable the industry to be conducted on a large scale, and in what part of the country is the product likely to be cultivated? </para>

          <para>.- If we were confined to the methods of rice cultivation that prevailed until about ten years ago, there might be reason to doubt whether it would be advisable to offer a bounty for the promotion of rice-growing in this country. But the developments in this branch of agriculture during that period have been absolutely (phenomenal. In the United States, until about ten years ago, it was considered to be absolutely hopeless to think of growing rice by their labour in competition with rice grown in the East. But it has been found from experience that it can be successfully cultivated. I understand that there are now in the United States vast areas of land which are devoted to the cultivation of rice. They are able to grow rice in accordance with American ideas and methods in regard to the employment of labour, and have been able to outstrip foreign competition completely, and to put upon the market a &#39; very much superior article to that which they previously consumed. I hold in my hand a book issued in 1906, called <inline font-style="italic">The New Agriculture : A Popular Outline of the Methods which are revolutionising Farming and Farm Life,</inline> by T. Byard Collins. It contains illustrations, both in the form of letter-press and pictures, of the new methods which have been adopted in relation to various branches of farming in the United States; and a perusal of the chapter regarding rice production opens one&#39;s eyes to the possibilities of the application of new methods in this regard. I have some doubt, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> sitting opposite to me, as to whether I ought to quote from any authority, but I cannot speak personally with regard to rice cultivation&#39;, nor do I suppose that any other honorable senator can. Very few of us know much from personal experience as to these products. </para>

        <para>Though the negro labour employed by our southern planters was cheap, the coolie labour of the orientalist was cheaper, and so American growers were constantly and hopelessly beaten in competition with the eastern supply.

          <para>An immense aggregate number of acres will this year be planted with rice, but the new interest is at present only well under way. The belt especially adapted to this industry varies from twenty, to fifty miles in width, and extends from the banks of the Mississippi to and beyond the Brazos River, a distance of more than 400 miles. Moreover, in many sections of Florida a little capital judiciously expended would bring profitable returns. In Southern Mississippi also there are large tracts of land suitable for rice culture which may still be had at merely nominal prices. </para>

            <para>- Louisiana has been a rice-growing State for some time. It was unsuccessfully competing with the cheaper labour of other countries prior to the introduction of new methods. In any case, what I wish specially to draw attention tois the fact that the whole process of cultivation and preparation for market of rice has undergone a complete revolution during the past ten years. If we have anything like reasonable grounds for believing that any part of the land of the Commonwealth can be turned to profitable account in theproduction of rice, it is our clear duty in providing bounties to offer an inducement to some of our people to turn their attention to the industry. Seeing what has happened in the  last ten years, it is  quite possible that a still greater revolution may take place within the next ten or twenty years. Those of our people who may be induced to give attention to the cultivation of rice will no doubt give the fullest and most careful consideration to the possibility of even improving upon the methods already adopted in the .United States. </para>

            <para>- I do not know that I now can. I am not now going into that question. The view the Government take in &#39; regard to this and all other items is that we have established, and are committed to, a White Australia policy, to which Australia will, I believe, always show unswerving loyalty. ^Relieving that that is the established policy of the Commonwealth for all time, we have to consider&#39; how many industries the white people of Australia can carry on under our natural conditions of soil and climate. The more industries we can induce them to give their attention to, with the hope of permanently establishing them, the better, because thereby we shall be providing greater opportunities, for employment, and giving the. Commonwealth a chance to get that population which is essential to its maintenance and defence as a white country. The fact that certain articles had not been produced by white labour in any part of the world before, confronted many people in entering upon various industries in Australia in the past. But it did not deter them from going forward, nor should it have that effect in the future. Are we, in this new country, with only a century&#39;s history, and/, indeed, a far shorter period of history so far as its industrial development is concerned, to accept the existing condition of things in the world to-day as final and irrevocable? Are we to say that Australia must be for ever governed by present conditions? Have we reached finality ? I venture to say that we have not, and that it will yet be found that the white man is quite capable of doing economically many things that some people have, for seemingly good reasons in the past, thought must be necessarily done by coloured labour. </para>

            <para>- That is exactly the position. All we do in this item is to offer to people some encouragement to give serious consideration to the possibility of growing rice in Australia under the conditions laid down in the Bill. Honorable senators will be well advised to keep that fact in mind. We are not recklessly and extravagantly committing ourselves to an absolute expenditure. We simply hold out to people a monetary inducement to give serious consideration to the possibilities of. this industry. It is a matter of serious moment to Australia that we should have a large, contented, and thriving population. The more industries we can bring into being in the Commonwealth, the more likely we shall be to achieve that desirable result. </para>

            <para>- Not much of that sort is grown. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway&#39;s</inline> second question was whether we were really playing at giving bounties or offering them seriously with a view to encourage production. He said it would be impossible to grow rice successfully except in a large way. We must feel, looking at this particular line in the schedule, that we are really amusing ourselves, and that there is nothing serious about it. It is ridiculous to offer a bounty of only &#163;1,000 a year. Assuming that we are to give bounties at  all, is this two-penny-halfpenny proposal likely to encourage the enormous production of rice which the large language of the Minister has pictured? </para>

            <para>- Of course, we are careful, but what is the good of putting a line on the Estimates of a note for the encouragement of rice-growing? A proposal to give ^1,000 a year for five years is just as ridiculous as the offer of  a  note. Who is going to invest capital in the Northern Territory or the northern parts of Queensland to establish great rice-growing areas on such an inducement? It is  a  mere paper bounty. </para>

            <para>- .We have been told that we cannot increase the amounts. The Government in submitting this proposal is simply trifling with the subject. We. all agree with the Minister that it is desirable . to encourage as far as we can new productions throughout this great country, but the two parallels which he alluded to are entirely inapplicable. He told us, truly enough, that wheat has been grown in the north-west of Canada, where people predicted that it could not be grown, but I can&#39; give him a much nearer parallel. Not many years ago it was predicted that wheat would be grown successfully away in the far north of South Australia. Areas were opened up which produced, not wheat, but the ruin  of every man who went there, and the country had to be abandoned. </para>

            <para>- I am not speaking of that part of the country. It is a notorious fact that an enormous tract of the northern &#39; country to which I refer had to be&#39; abandoned, and the unfortunate people who went there had to come away penniless and starving. In the north-west of Canada there was a great production of wheat, but in some parts it was impossible to grow it. It was all a matter of experiment. That was not a very good example for the Minister to set before us to induce us to encourage the growth of another product. That is no reason, of course, why we should not try to encourage rice-growing or tempt people - I was going to say to their destruction, but I will say - to ma&#39;ke experiments. There is no doubt that there is land capable of growing rice in this country. It is grown in northern Italy, but that is because-the land there is highly capable of irrigation. Those facilities we do not possess. Irrigation is a costly process in this country. That is the reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> pointed out that it could only be undertaken by people possessed of large capital. If &#39;those are the persons we are going to invite to . undertake this industry, which we all agree should be encouraged if it  can  be, we must offer a better inducement than a bounty of &#163;1,000 a- year for five years. With respect to the other parallel which my honorable friend sought to draw, it is not too much to expect that- in Louisiana, Florida, and other southern States of the United . States, where .the climate is subtropical, if not tropical, and where cottoncan be produced, given the conditions of water&#39; supply and facilities for irrigation, rice can also be grown. I point, out that rice-growing in those States has affected wheat-growing in Michigan and: other States where wheat-growing had been profitably pursued. I direct attention, also, to the extraordinary effect which the expansion of the wheat-growing industry in .Canada has had upon such States as Michigan, Illinois, and Ohio. The people previously engaged in wheat-growing irc those States have been pouring into Canada, and now form the largest proportion of the people settled in the north-west of Canada. . It may be that the wheat lands in the American States have become exhausted, or are not producing the same quality of wheat ; but there can be no doubt that last year 50,000 or 80,000 of the people engaged in the cultivation of wheat in those States went to the Canadian north-west country, where there is virgin soil, and they can produce the magnificent hard grain which is claimed to be the best wheat in the world - though I deny the claim, and say that Australianwheat is just as hard as Canadian wheat. It seems to me that in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway</inline> has said there is matter for the consideration of the Minister, arid it is  a.  question whether this item should appear in the schedule at all. Another point I make is that wheat-growing in the northwest of Canada, and rice-growing in thesouthern States of the United States, have not been brought about by the payment of bounties. To give assistance of this kind for the establishment of an industry where the soil is suitable and capital is available, is simply to throw away money. Sofar  as  I am aware, no bounties were ever given for the production of wool in thiscountry, and certainly none were ever given for the production of wheat. We should1 seriously consider first of all whether any reason has been shown for the inclusion of this item, and secondly whether the fact that the bounty proposed -  ^1,000  a vear for five years - is not, on the face of it, its own condemnation. If we are to give. a bounty for the production of this article, let us ask ourselves what evidence we have before us to justify the granting of a bounty. Then I come to my bible on this subject - the report of the Conference of States Experts. When I want guidance or illumination, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> fall back upon that report. What do I find in connexion with this item? The experts tell us that rice has been grown largely in the swamps of the southern States of the United States, and in Carolina in particular, and that the industry is partially worked with white labour. We all know very well that the whole of the agricultural labour of the southern States of America is black labour. </para>

          <para>- No, but we could pick our land as we do our representatives; though I admit that sometimes we might make mistakes. This item appeals to me, because my wife told me before the Tariff was introduced that the price of rice had gone up considerably. If we can cultivate rice here to advantage, can in that way fmd employment for white men, and cheapen the article to the people, we should do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and some of his followers on the other side, in dealing with these proposed bounties, say, &#34; The amount- proposed is &#163;1,000 a year for five years, or  .&#163;5,006,  and that is only a trifle - the amount ought to be &#163;20,000,&#34; and yet at the same time if &#163;20,000 were proposed they would say that we were going to throw the money into the sea. Yesterday afternoon I made some references to the land in the north of South Australia, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has condemned wholesale.

            <para>- We have land in South Australia divided by what is called Goyder&#39;s line of rainfall! It is a very reliable division of the country.  I  have cultivated land inside the line, and also outside of it. In country outside the line we have sometimes produced splendid crops, but when years, of drought came disaster followed to the farmers. The country inside Goyder&#39;s line of rainfall, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has condemned, comprises some of the best land in South Australia, and is to-day carrying a large population. I do not like to hear these things said.  I  have entered the Senate pledged to support the primary-producing interests of South Australia. Another thing I have to say is that the Northern Territory is a wonderful country, and as a representative of South Australia, I cannot afford to indulge in the conservatism involved in the statement that the land in that Territory is useful only for the purpose to which it is devoted at the present time. I believe that by assistance in the shape of bounties we can secure the cultivation of land in the Northern Territory for rice and many other products. Perhaps it would be  3470 <inline font-style="italic">Bounties Bill.</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bounties Bill.</inline> better if honorable senators opposite were to move the  Chairman  out of the chair. Their object would then be clear. </para>

It contains a reference to the effect which the growing of rice has had upon the value of land in the southern States of America. We know that one unalterable test of the profitableness of an industry has been the value of land, whether it be high or low. In Australia when the pastoral industry was at a low ebb, the value of stations, both per acre and in the aggregate, went down. As the products increased and the industry became profitable the value increased in a corresponding ratio. The same thing applies to every other industry. I feel that I am safe in asserting that as an industry becomes profitable the value of the land on which it is carried on increases in a corresponding ratio. From this book, which is called <inline font-style="italic">&#39;The New Agriculture,</inline> let me quote this passage - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>When it is remembered that lands devoted to new purposes have frequently shown multiplied valuation within a comparatively few years - wheat lands that were bought for $r.25 per acre and others that were obtained merely for settling upon them have, wi.thin a generation, risen to $100 an acre, and other lands, obtained at the same terms, and planted as orchards, now selling at $1,000 an  acre-it  seems safe to say that the man who is adapted to the occupation of rice raising will hardly make a mistake in the acquisition of these new lands. </para>

        <para class="block">It is plainly set forth there that in the United States the introduction of ricegrowing has had an effect upon the value of the land. No honorable senator who is opposed to the item will contend that wheat-growing is not a white man&#39;s occupation. According to that extract we see that, owing to the expansion of the rice industry in that portion of the United States, the value of land has risen from $1&#188; to $1,000 per acre. </para>

            <para>- When the land was taken up for fruit-growing its value was $1&#188; per acre, but owing to the expansion of rice cultivation its value has risen to $1,000 per acre. It is not disputed that wheat-growing is a white man&#39;s occupation. My point is that rice production is a highly profitable occupation as compared with wheat raising. It clearly demolishes thecontention of the Opposition that rice is not produced in the United States without the assistance wholly or partially of cheap and coloured labour. This book demonstrates the very salutary effect which rice production has had on the value of land. If the value of our lands which are suitable for rice production should increase in a similar way, it would be a very welcome thing to Australia. If, for instance, in the Northern Territory or North Queensland, areas which are sometimes submerged in the wet season could be profitably devoted to the cultivation of rice, the people in every part . of Australia would benefit in a. proportionate degree. I think I have proved from the pages of this book that in the United States rice-growing is more profitable than wheat cultivation, and can be conducted profitably with white labour. </para>

          <para>.- It appears to me that the Minister and his colleague could scarcely have read the report of the experts on this item. At any rate, if they did read the report carefully, they did not allow it to influence their minds. If there was one item more than another which on its very face ought to have been discarded, it was&#39; this item. Can it be wondered that I criticise the experts in every speech I make when in regard to each item I find a substantial inconsistency between their advice and the evidence? How, for instance, can we accept this evidence? - </para>

          <para>It is open to doubt if it can be successfully exploited under Australian conditions. The industry, however, is sufficiently important to deserve encouragement, and the Conference recommends a bonus on uncleaned rice at the rate of 20s. per ton, for a term of five years. </para>

        <para>The Minister read something new to-day, but he failed to prove the application of what he read to the conditions prevailing here. What I objected to before was that, in answer to a thirst for practical information, he kept reading page after page of this report, which we have all read. I may say that last year I read the report once or twice, and this year three times. </para>

What we&#39; want to know is this - what are the facts which go to. show that the passages which the Minister has quoted have any relation whatever to any land that we have in Australia or in the Northern Territory? In the last paragraph which my honorable friend read, it was stated that wheat landsare obtained in America for a dollar and a-half. That shows how utterly unlike the American conditions are to ours. Did my honorable friend ever hear of wheat lands in Australia being worth only 5s. per acre ?

Does not the book which the Minister has quoted deal with rice cultivation, where two crops a year are obtained ? Will he point out how we can possibly obtain two crops a year in the Northern Territory, where the whole of the rainfall occurs between  January  and April, and where during the rest of the year there is no rain at all ? </para>

            <para>- I ask my honorable friend to _ satisfy himself on this point, and as to whether we can under any circumstances make rice a payable crop in Australia with the labour that is available, unless we do get two crops per annum. Surely that is an important point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway,</inline> who was the first to take exception to the smallness pf the proposed bounty, believes that &#163;1,000 per annum would scarcely pay the  interest  charge incurred by one man for irrigating his land, getting it into working order, and obtaining the necessary machinery with which to treat the rice. If those are facts which cannot be contradicted, what is the use of leaving this item in the Bill? The evidence is absolutely against it. Furthermore, is it not worth while for us to reduce the amount of &#163;412,000 a little, in order to keep some of the money for the development of the Northern Territory later on ? The experts tell us that the cultivation of rice opens up an entirely new field. Is not this one of those items to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl&#39;s</inline> admirable criticism exactly applies? He argued that before we go into the &#34;growing of rice we ought to make experiments, determine whether we have suitable land, whether our rainfall is adequate, and whether we can produce two crops a year. We are all in favour of the taking over of the Northern Territory. Why not conserve some money for the purpose of developing it later on? I have from the first advocated that we should do so. </para>

          <para>. - I find myself partly in agreement with those who are opposed to this item, and partly with those who intend to vote for it.  1  believe that rice- is one of the best items in the schedule. It is a product that we ought to do our best to have cultivated in Australia, It is a highly profitable crop. Rice is a splendid article of food. It is well known that half the people in the world to-day are almost entirely dependent for their food on the growth of rice. But the way in which the matter is put before us is supremely ridiculous, because of the small amount of the bounty proposed to be paid. If it is a commodity that is worth cultivating, our people should be encouraged to enter upon its production in a proper way. We propose to spend .&#163;5,000 a vear on items which are not nearly so important, whilst only &#163;1,000 is to be paid on account of rice. I think we ought vo ask the Government to be good enough to reconsider the matter; or the Senate should adopt a request that a fresh Governor-General&#39;s message should be brought down, recommending the increase of the amount from <inline font-style="italic">jQi.,000</inline> to &#163;5,000 per annum. The growth of rice in the United States has undergone remarkable changes. Before the great Civil War it was grown largely in the Carolinas, and I think in one or two other States also. There they had an orderly system of cultivation with trained labour, which had been accustomed to the growth, of the product. It was slave labour certainly, but the rice was cultivated at great profit to the growers. ButAfter the war was over, when the owners went back to their estates, they found their machinery destroyed, their plantations in ruins, and their labour absolutely gone. In many instances the cultivation of rice was given up. There have been other causes affecting the production of rice in the United States. In many places the streams that formerly came down to the sea have been used for irrigation purposes. The water has been stored, and has not come down ; and consequently the sea has encroached on much of the land where rice was grown. In consequence of the incursion of the salt water the soil has been made absolutely unprofitable for the growth of rice. Under those conditions, experiments were made to ascertain where rice could be cultivated under different conditions in other States; and as we have been told to-day, some of those experiments have been found to be very successful. Rice has been grown in Louisiana, and in Texas, on land which, as We have been told, is of poor quality. Instead of cultivating the crop in natural swamps, the growers have made artificial swamps. They have taken land near to rivers, have banked it along with a levee, have put in pumps, and have brought the soil into such a condition as to be favorable to the production of rice. There is a double advantage &#39;attending the adoption of that method. The growers have not been dependent, as they were when- they utilized the swamps, on the water drawing off when that was required,&#34; but have had it absolutely at their command. Rice is a peculiar product to cultivate. It has to  d2  grown in water at the commencement, and when the crop has advanced a little that water requires Vo be taken off. At a later stage the water has to be put on again, and drawn off once more, and then the crop has to be grown in :i.o or  12  inches of water. In order that rice may be cultivated profitably, the water has to be under control. I have here several <inline font-style="italic">Bulletins,</inline> containing information relating to the cultivation of rice, and reproducing a number of photographs showing the process in all its stages. In Texas it is grown with white labour, and the cultivators use ordinary harvesters, just as they do in the wheat fields. Of course, cultivation under those conditions is not very costly, -but the plants must be fairly high before the pumps are put on. because they have to get the water on very quickly when once thev start to do it. They must also have channels leading from the rice fields in order to get the -water off as quickly as it is put on. Rice is being grown in several of the American States - in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida. Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. The total cultivation is 662,006 acres. The average yield per acre is 31 bushels. The total .production in 1904 was 21,096,038 bushels. The average farm price was 65 cents per bushel, and the average value per acre was $20 98c, or something over &#163;4 5s. per acre. </para>

            <para>- That is the average. I. consider that if we are to attempt to grow rice at all we ought to do it in a proper way, and to offer such encouragement as would induce people to go into the. enterprise effectively. It is a very costly thing to do. As I said in my secondreading speech on this Bill, I should very much prefer to see a number of these items treated differently. The Government might proceed b.y experimental scientific work to ascertain how the products could be grown in this country. If the Government did that on a small scale and were successful other people would soon be prepared to enter into these industries more largely. If I cannot get what I desire, I am prepared to go as hear to it as I can. But to ask our people, for the sake of a bounty of &#163;1,000 a year, to enter into this costly industry is simply to make a screaming farce of the whole business. We ought to show our sincerity and our belief in the prospects of rice cultivation more thoroughly than this. I. quite agree that we should try and bring about&#34; the cultivation of these products. We cannot protect  out  farmers very much, but we can encourage them to enter into the cultivation of fresh products, and so find employment for our people. Therefore, I think that this item ought to be increased, and intend to test the feeling of the Committee upon the matter. I therefore move - </para>

          <para>.- I should like honorable senators to understand the position before that question is put. This is a request that the House of Representatives should increase the amount proposed to be appropriated for a bounty for a particular item. I understand that in another place, it has been already ruled, and is an accepted practice, that when a measure of this character comes before them, it is not possible for them to increase an- item. If that be so. then our request would be perfectly futile, and the honorable senator&#39;s object would be absolutely defeated. However willing another place might be to fall in with the views of the Senate, they would find themselves unable to increase the amount. Apart from the question as. to whether it would be competent for this. Chamber to deal with a motion of this kind, it is hopeless for the honorable senator to attempt to achieve what he has in view, by the course he has taken. I was very glad to hear him say that there is good warrant for the Government&#39;s offering a bounty for the production of rice in the Commonwealth. I was pleased also to bear his testimony, born of experience and observation at close range, that rice is an article to the production- of which the Commonwealth might well turn its attention. If the honorable senator has any fault to find with the amount proposed by the Government, he ought to be prepared to accept it now as a small instalment, and lay himself out to Induce action to be taken hereafter to supplement it. </para>

The Minister in charge of the Bill has stated more than once that that cannot be done. But is he not really taking away some of. the financial powers given to the Senate by the Constitution? We have nothing to do with the practice of another place, or the position they have taken up, but if their attitude curtails the constitutional powers of this Chamber, we have a great deal to do with it. The Minister, in giving way to another place, is really assisting them to deprive us of some of our powers. When . a sum of over &#163;400,000 is to be appropriated for seventeen items, it is almost certain that the Senate will not agree with another place as to the exact sum to be applied to each item. It is almost inevitable that we should desire to strike out an item here and there, and increase the bounties on others. If we have not the powers which we claim now, then we have not the powers which we have hitherto thought that the Constitution conferred upon us. </para>

          <para>. - I hope that honorable senators will be very wary about receiving a motion of this kind. It is all very well to raise the question of the constitutional rights of the Senate. In the terms of section 53 of the Constitution it is not competent for this Chamber to increase &#34; any proposed charge or burden on the people.&#34; The Bill was introduced in another place in the usual way. Subject to the exceptions set out as regards the origination of financial measures, and increasing the burdens on the people, the same section provides that &#34; the Senate shall have equal powers with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.&#34; What are the powers of the House of Representatives in this connexion ? They have, first of all, to receive a message from the Governor-General. That message is referred to a certain Committee in accordance with the terms of section 56 of the Constitution. In this case, the GovernorGeneral recommended that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a Bill for an Act to provide for the payment of bounties on the production of certain goods. </para>

            <para>- There is a clear and well-defined practice in tills connexion. The message is brought down for a certain sum of money. In the terms of that message a Bill is introduced. That Bill, in this case the Bounties Bill, appropriates the money in the way set forth in the schedule. I may say that the question raised by this proposed request has been dealt with in another place. An attempt was there made to strike out one item and substitute another. </para>

            <para>- I am prepared to give my ruling on the question. If it be dissented from, thewhole question will have to be re-argued, and perhaps it would therefore be just as well that I should give my ruling now. I rule that this is a motion which can be received by the Committee as a request to the House of </para>

        <para class="block">Representatives. I do so for reasons which I propose to give. I wish to say that, although several honorable senators directed their remarks, at different times in the course of the proceedings on this Bill, to the question of the power of the Committee to alter the destination of votes in the schedule, that question has not yet been formally raised, and it is not raised by the request now proposed. It, therefore, has not been decided so fan as this Committee is concerned. The point raised at this juncture is : Can we make a request in connexion with a Bill which we can amend? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has pointed out that there are two classes of Bills dealt with under section 53 of the Constitution. These are the ordinary annual Appropriation and Taxation Bills which we cannot amend, and there is another class which we may not amend so as to increase any charge or burden on the people. But there is a third class of Bills which includes both these features. There is a class of Bills which we can amend, in the direction in which we have already amended this Bill, by decreasing the. amount of the appropriation - by striking out items - but we may not so amend them as to increase any proposed; charge or burden on the people However ,. I point out to honorable senators that it is perfectly competent for the Senate to exercise its power of request in connexion with Bills of&#34; this class. According to the Constitution, we can in connexion with the same Bill move an amendment striking out an item so as to decrease the amount of the appropriation, and if in the opinion of the Committee it is desirable that a. proposed vote should be increased, thus increasing the charge or burden on the people, we can request the House of Representatives to do what we cannot do directly. I feel on safe ground in rulingin this way, because I have had occasion to look the matter up, and I find that my ruling is supported by a ruling given by no less an authority than the Vice-President of the Executive Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> himself, when  Chairman  of Committees. In the first session of the Federal Parliament, this question was raised for the first time in connexion with the Audit Bill. Some honorable senators present will probably remember the occasion. The Acting  Chairman  of Committees at the time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> ruled that section 53 of the Constitution did not permit the Committee to amend the Audit Bill so as to- increase the salary proposed for the Auditor-General; but_ such amendment could be requested. That ruling -will be found at page 3238 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.,</inline> for the first session of the Federal Parliament. Later on, another Bill came before the Senate, dealing with the sugar bonus, as it was then called. The Senate made an amendment in that Bill in Committee, extending the term of the bonus, and thereby increasing the charge or- burden on the people. That amendment came before another place, and was there rejected on the ground that the Senate had not the constitutional power to make an amendment in that Bill, so as to increase the proposed charge or burden on the people. That reference will be found at pages 2013-4 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 14th July, 1903. The Prime Minister of the day. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, speaking on the alterations proposed by the Senate in the Bill referred to, accepted some, and objected to the amendment extending the area of the bonus, contending that it should have been submitted to the House of Representatives by request. I direct the special attention of honorable senators- to that. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton spoke as follows- </para>
        <quote>
          <para>If then this is a law imposing a charge or burden upon the people by means of an appropriation, it is a proposed law which may be amended by the Senate - </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline>Barton was very clear on that point. He went on to say -  inasmuch as it is not an annual Appropriation Bill ; but it is also a law which they may not amend so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. </para>
        <para class="block">Now I come to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best&#39;s</inline> ruling as  Chairman  of Committees of the Senate. At page 1695 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> for 2nd July, 1093, it will be found that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> as  Chairman  of Committees, contended that the alteration extending the area of the bonus should be made the subject of a request. That was after we had made amendments in the body of the Bill in Committee. At pages 1696-7 it will be found that he contended _ that on this class of Bills requests could be made involving an increased charge on the people, and further that requests could be made as to one part, and amendments as. to another part of the same Bill. So that my ruling is in accordance with what has been the practice of the Senate, as laid down bv <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> whose ruling was not challenged. The matter never came before the  President.  In the circumstances, I rule that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> is in order in moving that the House of Representatives be requested to increase the maximums amount of bounty payable annually for uncleaned rice to &#163;5.000. </para>

          <para>. - I have, so far, voted for every item but one in the schedule. It cannot be said that I have in any way harassed or obstructed the Government in. the passage of this measure. On the contrary, I have assisted them . as far as I&#39; possibly could. I am in favour of the bounty principle, as I said on the second reading of the Bill. But I also said1 that I would reserve to myself the right to criticise certain items in Committee. So far as this item of rice is concerned, after due deliberation, I thought that I should&#34; have to oppose it, because I think &#163;1,000 a vear is a ridiculous sum to offer for the encouragement of such an industry in Australia. But in view of the request submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> I think, there may be an opportunity afforded to encourage the industry in a practical manner. I am very glad that the request has. been moved.&#39; My reason for speaking in this strain is that during the recess, in company with other members of the Federal Parliament, I visited the Northern Territory. I do not -believe that it is possible to grow rice successfully in any other part pf this vast island continent. </para>

            <para>- To a very small extent. We must recognise that in the Northern Territory there is a big field for the establishment of the rice growing industry. But if we are to establish this industry in that part of the Commonwealth, we must be prepared to spend a large amount of money there on irrigation. I&#39; went along the Adelaide River, and I saw there a great tract of country which, although it is at certain seasons of the year well watered by the natural overflow of theriver, would not be suitable for the growth of rice, without a large expenditure on irrigation. If we are- to encourage the industry at all, we should vote a reasonable sum, and ,&#163;1,000 per annum &#34; is, in mv opinion, a ridiculous bounty to offer for this purpose. It may be said that if the industry is not started, the money will not be spent. But if we pass this item, &#163;1,000 of our revenue.  3478 <inline font-style="italic">Bounties Bill.</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Bounties Bill.</inline> will be annually ear-marked for this purpose, and can be used for no other purpose. It may be, that during the five years over which the bounty is proposed to be paid, it would be possible to spend the money to advantage for the assistance of some other industry dealt with in the schedule, under items to which we have already agreed. But this money, being locked up, could not be used for the purpose. No honorable senator can contend that a bounty of &#163;1,000 a year would be of any practical use in developing the rice industry. I have the report of the Conference of Experts before me, and I find that they say - </para>

          <para>Upland of hill rice which, as its name implies, grows on dry lands, is, perhaps, more within the scope of Australian producers. So far as climate and soil is concerned, there is no reason why it should not beextensively cultivated in Australia. but they add &#34; under Australian conditions.&#34; It also mentions the fact that it can be grown on irrigable land. If we hope to establish the industry in the Northern Territory, we must allow a considerable increase on &#163;1,000 a year for the purposes of irrigation. That is the reason why, if the request had not been moved, I should have voted against the item. It would be worse than useless to attempt to encourage the establishment of the industry with the paltry sum of &#163;1,000 a year. If we can induce the other House to agree to the request to increase the amount to &#163;5,000 a year for five years, I believe that even then </para>

From my observations, I feel confident that, in the northern portions of the continent, any tropical industry can be established and worked by white labour. I returned from my visit confirmed in my adherence to the policy of a White Australia ; but I recognise that, in order to put that ideal into practical operation, a certain expenditure is necessary. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to name&#39; any one, but it is well known that certain honorable senators sitting on the other side have condemned the Bill &#34; lock, stock, and barrel.&#34; .Some of them have said that to sanction bounties for the encouragement of industries in Australia is like throwing money into the gutter, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that they will resort to any proceeding in order- to secure the defeat of the Bill. Whilst I think that a. larger sum for this item, in fact, for many items, would be justifiable, still, believing as I do that it would eventually mean disaster to the Bill, I do not feel that I would be justified in supporting the request. I am very certain of what will happen if it is carried. It cannot do any possible good from the point of view of the Bill. On the contrary, it will probably mean, unless some honorable senators alter their votes when the Bill is returned, that it will be lost. In those circumstances, I have decided to support the item as it stands. </para>

You have given a &#34;ruling. It may be quite true that you did not give the ruling on a specific point of order, but that, to my mind, is immaterial. The point which was brought under your notice involved the interpretation of a section of the Constitution, and you gave a formal ruling that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was in order in submitting the request. The Standing Orders provide, clearly and beyond controversy, that if the decision of the  Chairman  is to be brought into question notice must be immediately given. No such notice was given. Other business has intervened. Senators Needham and Findley have spoken, and it is only at the eleventh hour that the Minister desires to bring your decision under review. I submit, sir; that it is too late for him to take that course. </para>

            <para>- The usual practice when a proposition is submitted is for those who think that it is out of order to appeal to the Chair. In this case that step was not taken, but I intimated to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that in my opinion his request was in order. I think that since a point of order was not raised at the time it is competent for any honorable senator now to ask whether the request is in order. I shall allow a point of order to be raised, and give a ruling in accordance with the opinion I expressed previously - that the request is in order. </para>

        <para>The  Chairman  of Committees. - It was not regarded as an invasion of the powers of the other House or as an exaltation of the powers of the Senate. I draw attention to the fact that in the first session of the first Parliament, when the Senate was dealing with the Audit Bill, which contained a number of machinery clauses, and also a clause providing for the salary of the AuditorGeneral, various amendments were made. When we were dealing with the clause relating to the Auditor-General a proposal was submitted to increase the salary. The Acting  Chairman  of Committees at that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> thereupon ruled that the amendment could not be received, and that the proposal should take the form of a request. That decision was not challenged. Therefore, what I have described became the practice of the Senate. In the year 1903 the Senate had before it the Sugar Bounties Bill. Certain amendments were made in. it affecting the machinery of the measure. One amendment was made which had the effect of extending the time over which the bounty  should be paid. When that Bill came before another place it was contended that the latter amendment could not be constitutionally made, and that the wish of the Senate ought to be signified by way of request. But the other place showed no disinclination to accept the other two amendments which the Senate made in the Bill. It sent back a message to the Senate expressing the opinion that the third proposition increasing the area of the bounties increased the proposed burden on the people, and therefore should have been sent down in the form of a request. The Senate agreed to that course. 1 have before me the ruling given by the then  Chairman  of Committees, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline> It is reported in , <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1903, pages 1694 to 1697. He said that the alteration extending the area of the bounty should be made by request. He also said, on page 1696, that on this class of Bills requests could be made involving an increased charge on the people ; and, further, that requests could be made as to one part and amendments as to- another part of the same Bill. </para>

But I submit to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> as the ultimate guardian and custodian of the rights of the Senate, that we should not allow the procedure of another place to affect our course of action, which should be based upon our own constitutional powers. </para>

            <para>-  Of course, we are all desirous of establishing a reasonable and satisfactory practice with regard to what I admit to be a most troublesome and complicated matter. I am sorry that the  Chairman  of Committees has raised a point which has not been immediately submitted to you, namely, as to whether we should have regard to the practice of the other Chamber and regulate our practice accordingly. That question is not before us, although it may be considered as a matter of expediency. My colleague tells me that he dissociated that point from the point of order. The sole question now submitted to you is this - whether on a Bill which is not a Bill imposing taxation, and which is not a Bill appropriating the ordinary annual services of the Government, we have a right both to amend and make requests? Section 53 of the Constitution must be our guide in this matter. That section provides that -  </para>

The Bounties Bill, which is now under consideration, is a measure that we have a right to amend. Of course, we have no right under it to increase a burden upon the people, but, nevertheless, we have a right to amend the measure ; and I submit that, it being a class of Bill that we have a right to amend, we have not, at the same time, the right to make a request in regard to it.

          <para>- The proposal submitted in Committee was that the House of Representatives be requested to increase the amount of bounty payable in any one year in respect of rice from &#163;1,000 to &#163;5,000. The  Chairman  ruled that that request could be received. The VicePresident of the Executive Council dissents from that ruling, on the ground that it is contrary to section 53 of the Constitution. The question is one that is, in some respects, novel. If it were not for the peculiar wording of section 53 of the Constitution in regard to the powers of the Senate to request amendments, there would not be much difficulty. I take it that the real question raised is whether, in one Bill, the Senate can make both requests and amendments. The Minister&#39;s contention is perfectly clear, that &#34; the Senate may, at any stage, return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend,&#34; it toeing provided earlier in section 53 of the Constitution that &#34;the Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government.&#34; There is no question as to the meaning of that provision. It applies to taxation measures, and also to measures&#39; dealing with the annual appropriation. But all Bills beyond those two classes of Bill we undoubtedly have the right, under the Constitution, to amend. The question then arises whether that right is lessened by the further provision that - </para>

Where the Senate admittedly could not make an amendment to increase the burdens of the people, it can, as in other cases, make a suggestion which, if adopted by us and carried into effect, would increase- the burdens upon -the people. </para>

        <para class="block">It was decided, after very keen discussion in both Houses, that the true &#34;construction of the provision of the Constitution was that a proposed law might be of such a character that in one direction it could be amended, and in another direction, where the power of amendment did not exist, a suggestion could be made, and that this  class of Bill became practically a composite class, in dealing with which two powers could be exercised by the Senate. The question now arises whether any distinction can be drawn between the Sugar Bonus Bill of 1903 and this Bill.  .1  have searched the records to ascertain the procedure followed in both cases in another place, where these Bills have to be initiated, for we cannot initiate them. The procedure appears to have been the same in both cases.

Honorable senators opposite must toe <inline font-style="italic">in extremis</inline> to resort to appeals of that kind. The last thing this Chamber ought to consider, at any rate at the preliminary stages of a Bill, is the attitude likely to be adopted elsewhere. The obligation is thrown upon us, both individually and as a Committee, to determine every proposal on its merits. The responsibility of accepting or rejecting a proposal submitted to them by this Chamber rests with the other branch of the Legislature. But to saythat there is a possibility, if we adopt an amendment, of our action being resented elsewhere, and that, therefore, we ought to refrain from even considering it, amounts to an invitation to this Chamber to forsake its responsibilities and obligations, and even the distinct powers which the Constitution confers upon it. </para>

            <para>- No, I certainly do not wish to see any struggle between the two Houses, because if carried sufficiently far - it would mean a double dissolution. On this  point, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> will accept my assurance that I have no desire to see a deadlock between the two Houses. Apart from the mere constitutional right of the Senate to take the course proposed, there is an obligation upon honorable senators to determine every proposal upon its merits. There is not the slightest reason for assuming that in this or in any other matter in connexion with which we make a proposal or a request, &#39;the other House will resent our action. If honorable members in another place do not approve of what we do, it will be open to them to return the measure to us, and when their views are before us we can decide whether we should press our request or retrace our steps. If there be&#34; any force in the si &#60;&#187;- ment used b&#39;y Senators Lynch and Findley, I would say that it has been advance^ rather too late in the day, in view of the fact that we have already made more important alterations in the Bill. We have absolutely struck out two of the items which appeared in the schedule. </para>

          <para>- I am not dealing with the constitutional question, which has been settled, but with the view put forward by Senators Lynch and Findley, that the proposed request might, if agreed to, jeopardize the Hill, because honorable members in another place would resent our alteration. There is always a stage in the relationship between the two branches of a bi-cameral Legislature, at which one House is called upon to consider how far it should decide to press its own views and how far it would be reasonable to give way to the views of the other branch of the Legislature. In this matter we have not yet reached such a stage. We are at a stage when, irrespective of the view which honorable members in another place may take, we should impress on this Bill the judgment of the Senate. Later on, if honorable members in another place are not prepared to give way to what we propose, it will be time enough, for us to consider whether we shall stand by the request we have made or withdraw it. </para>

            <para>- That is a little unkind. I am innocent enough to be anxious to secure the passage of this Bill, and to invite honorable senators <inline font-style="italic">not to</inline> legislate in a blindfold manner. It has been pointed out that there is a reasonable prospect of achieving the end at which we are aiming by the proposals made in the Bill. It is all very well for some of our honorable friends in a light and airy way to introduce questions affecting the constitutional rights of the Senate, with the object, if possible, of working up some conflict between the two Chambers, as a result of which there would be a very fair prospect that the Bill would not pass this session at all. But that is not exactly what I desire, nor is it what those who are sincerely supporting the measure would like to see occur. Certain proposals have been submitted in the Bill, and it is considered that by an expenditure of &#163;1,000 a year for five years&#39; we shall have a prospect of insuring the cultivation of this particular product. If it is to be the great success suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> who is now taking such a deep interest in this particular item, honorable senators may be perfectly satisfied that if any further encouragement be required the Government will be prepared to ask Parliament to grant it. </para>

            <para>- Just so; when gifts are brought by the Greeks we should beware. As a bounty for the encouragement of the growth of rice, the amount submitted in the schedule is reasonable. I ask honorable members who support this measure to remember that it is not to be passed by promoting a constitutional conflict. Our rights are laid down by the Constitution, and honorable senators may be assured that we shall uphold them on all occasions. At the same time, we should not provoke a fight, and if we can secure the passage of the measure without a conflict with another place, it is not likely that we are going to invite such a conflict. In the circumstances, I urge that the request should be rejected, and that the item as it appears in the schedule should be accepted. </para>

            <para>- I am going to vote against the request that the annual vote should be increased to &#163;5,000, because I do not believe that the expenditure of even &#163;1,000 in connexion with this item would be justifiable. I cannot see any prospect that rice-growing will become an Australian industry worth the trouble and time we are wasting upon this item this afternoon. It is like an industry with which we dealt yesterday, that elsewhere is largely carried on with cheap labour, and we cannot in any circumstances hope to establish it as a paying industry in Australia, unless we are prepared to bolster it up for all time. Therefore, whether the proposal is for an annual bounty of &#163;1,000, &#163;5,000, or &#163;50,000, I am strongly against it. I am not entirely against the principle of the Bounties Bill, although -  1  paired against the second reading on financial grounds, but I point out that honorable senators who have voted against certain items have, by doing so, saved the Government an aggregate expenditure of &#163;95,000, for which, according to my view, they should be very thankful. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South Wales) &#91;5.27&#93;. - Like the previous  speaker, 1  rise to say that I do not intend to vote for the request, but I wish to add a word or two to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> has already aptly said with reference to what must be regarded as the very unfortunate attitude assumed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. It is absolutelydeplorable that speeches should be made here, in advance of any possible difficulty, which have the effect of deprecating the discharge by the Senate of its duties under the Constitution, and the claiming of the rights granted to it by the Constitution. I consider that I should be recreant to my position as a member of the Senate if I were to adopt the attitude suggested by the VicePresident of the Executive Council. The honorable senator pleaded that the Senate should abrogate its functions, pull down its flag, and pitifully crawl at the behest of another place. I am not built that way, and I do not think that the majority of the members of this Committee are built that way.&#39; I should be the last to go out of my way to look for a fight, but I am not going to run away when one comes along. </para>

            <para>- I am not going to suppose that there is any necessity for a retreat until the enemy is at least as near as the horizon. In this case, he has not appeared on the horizon, and is somewhere in the Never-Never of parliamentary possibilities. I do not see that there is any suspicion of a difficulty with the other Chamber over this matter. As has been pointed out by the  President,  all that is sought to. be done is to follow the course of procedure which honorable members of another place themselves suggested. How, therefore, can it be wise to talk about the possibilities of conflict and of double dissolution? We should require halfadozenof these Bounties Bills to induce some people I wot of to go electioneering at the present juncture. </para>

          <para>- - I have not spoken previously on the Bill, and I desire to say a few words now because I intend to vote against a principle in which I believe, when it is applied under different conditions. I sympathize with the object of the request, but the chief  consideration with me to-day is whether we are to have the Bill or not. I believe that the bounties system is the best method of establishing an industry in a country. It has been attended with success in the past, and I believe it will be equally successful in the future. But there are other questions which we have to consider, apart from the &#34; constitutional crawl &#34; as it has been designated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> If the Bill is returned to the other House with a number of debatable amendments or requests, I believe that the Government will feel very much inclined to drop it, and small blame to them if they do. I have an idea that in the other House fifteen or sixteen honorable members would be prepared to delay more important measures to the extent of six months by debating our amendments or requests on this Bill. I do not think that this request can be supported by </para>

If it were submitted under ordinary conditions I have no doubt that a majority of those who believe in the bounties system would feel inclined to agree to it, thereby increasing the amount of bounty payable. The Government have now before the other House perhaps the most important measure with which it has ever been asked to deal. The Bounties Bill, if it is returned to that House with a number of debatable amendments or requests, will be seized upon for the purpose of delaying the consideration of that most important measure. That will leave the Government with only one alternative - to withdraw the Bounties Bill. If I thought that there was a reasonable prospect of carrying the request through both Houses without delay or without delaying more important matters, I would willingly support it. I, therefore, rose to explain that I have no desire to vote against a bounty of  &#163;5,000  upon the production of rice, and should not do so except in the circumstances I have stated. </para>

          <para>. -  The Vice-President of the Executive Council has insinuated that this request has been submitted from an ulterior motive, and that it is a specious device to wreck the Bill. I absolutely repudiate his. statements. I have expressed my views in regard to the Bill. I have said that whilst I am in favour ofbounties I think that something else ought to precede them. I adhere to that opinion. So far I have not offered any opposition to the items in the schedule. I was absent last week when some items were passed. Out of ten items eight have been passed, and two rejected,  and the cry is now raised that if the Bill is returned to the other House with this request probably it will be lost, or the delay will be so great as to seriously hamper the Government in carrying out the legislation of the country.. Surely if what I propose is desirable it may be regarded by the other House in the same way as we regard it. Any delay which might be caused would not be unwelcome to the Government, because it is not showing, in another place, a great desire to push on with its business. </para>

            <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council has seen fit to go back upon his former decision given as  Chairman  of Committees. I amglad that the ruling of the  President  has been obtained, because it has very clearly defined the position which the Senate occupies in regard to this class of Bill. I do not think that the time which has been spent in discussing the constitutional point has been wasted ; but the insinuation that we on this side desire to delay the Bill is unworthy of its authors. I believe that if the request be made, there will be a fair chance of getting an experiment made; otherwise the bounty will be utterly valueless. </para>

            <para>- Is the Committee going to declare that education and practical experiments ought not to precede the grant of the bounty ? I contend most emphatically that the Government are pursuing the wrong course. We are virtually asked to declare that we, as a Senate, ignore the means by which every practical farmer makes his way in life. This is the one item to which we ought to apply the principle laid down in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> &#39;s amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. There ought to be more experiments, more education, more analyses of soil, and more reports on the land before we think of passing a bounty and entering upon an entirely new experience. </para>

          <para>. - No one has yet answered the point which I raised at the beginning of the dehate, and that is that there is no reason to believe, and no evidence to lead us to suppose, that in any part of Australia with which we are acquainted, there are places where rice growing will become a small man&#39;s industry. If, on the other hand, it is to be a big man&#39;s industry - and that is obviously the only alternative - the bounty is quite worthless as a means of establishing a big man&#39;s industry, even for the time being. &#39;Suppose, for instance, that rice growing is to be established on the Adelaide River, in the Northern Territory, and by means of irrigation. Speaking with a little knowledge of irrigation and those districts in Queensland where it has been established, I assert that the proposed bounty of &#163;1,000 a year would not pay the interest on the capital which would have to be sunk in the irrigation plant to carry out the industry on a large scale. </para>

          <para>. - Now that the Committee has decided by an overwhelming majority not to agree to a bounty of &#163;5,000 a year upon the production of rice, it follows, I think, almost inevitably, and certainly to some extent logically, that to grant a bounty of &#163;1,000 a year would be, to use the words of an honorable senator, practically to throw the money into the gutter. It has been pointed out that unless a larger sum is voted for the bounty there can be no prospect of success. The Committee has shown itself unwilling to increase the grant. I take it that the reason is that on the evidence submitted it was considered that not even &#163;5,000 a year would be sufficient. But if &#163;5,000 a year would not be sufficient to make the rice industry a success, it is fairly reasonable to assume that &#163;1,000 would be utterly inadequate. The Government might as well, therefore, consent to the omission of the item. This is not the way to deal with public money. C know one young man who, having &#163;5,000 or &#163;6,000 to invest, went into rice cultivation in North Queensland under favorable climatic conditions. But he came out with almost nothing left&#39;, and had to begin life over again. </para>

            <para>- That was because there was a duty on rice, which protected the Chinaman as well as the white farmer. But in 1893, when the Queensland Government advanced &#163;100,000 to encourage the people to engage in the sugar industry, many of the rice growers considered that there was more money to be made out of sugar than out of rice. The result was that a considerable quantity of the land which had previously been tilled for rice was put under sugar. Wherever public money is devoted to the assistance of a particular industry, the tendency is naturally for people to enter intothat industry to the neglect of others. </para>

            <para>- I am giving reasons why it not only did not make headway, but was practically wiped out. The area was reduced from a few hundred acres, producing thousands of bushels of  rice, practically to nothing, because the Queensland Government gave such assistance to the sugar industry. Another reason was that the Federal Tariff reduced the duty on rice below the rate at which it previously stood in Queensland. This took away the protection which the rice growers had enjoyed. But it is a fact that a considerable quantity was grown in Queensland prior to 1896-7. They were growing rice on the Mosman, on a number of other rivers, and as far south as Pimpama Island. I voted to increase the amount of the bounty to &#163;5,000 a year because it appears to me that people ought to be enoouraged to enter into an industry in connection with which a certain measure of success was undoubtedly obtained in Queensland a few years ago.

          <para>. - I oppose this item on the same grounds as I opposed that of copra. Whenever I have thought that there were .reasonable prospects of establishing industries in any part of Australia under this Bill, I have voted for bounties for them. Thanks to ex-Senator Staniforth Smith and others, great efforts are now being made to establish the rubber industry in New Guinea. It is an industry natural&#39; to the islands. Raw rubber is now imported free into the Commonwealth from those places. The only part of Australia where it can probably be grown with a reasonable amount of success is along the north-eastern coast, of Queensland, where there is a reasonable amount of settlement, and where complete settlement can be secured by the extension of the sugar industry, and cotton and sisal hemp-growing. It is advisable that we should leave to New &#34;Guinea and the South Sea Islands some industries to develop; otherwise we shall find them before very long developing the very industries that we have already established in Australia. In view of the present shortage of rubber, constant endeavours are being made by chemists to find a synthetic substitute for it. That may at any moment be discovered, and knock .out the industry in precisely the same way as those of indigo and cinchona were knocked out. Attention is also being directed, now to a large number of other rubber-producing plants, some of which are growing absolutely wild in other parts of the world. There are something like a thousand different classes of rubber plants. Within the last eighteen months or two j-ears, there has been discovered in northern Mexico and Arizona, a plant growing at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet. It is now being harvested in very large quantities. Six or seven large factories have been established to treat it, and are now producing the very best rubber, from it. In view of the efforts being made by chemists, and the steps being taken by people all over the world to utilize other plants for&#39; the production of rubber, it is quite reasonable to suppose that within the next few years, long before any rubber plantations which we can create reach a state of com,.mercial usefulness, the demand for rubber will be supplied. In the last available issue of <inline font-style="italic">Chambers&#39;- Journal,</inline> a .very useful publication, which is generally  recognised  as giving accurate information, there anpears amongst the monthly notes the following - </para>

        <quote>
          <para>We are dependent, in these days of modern progress, so much upon rubber, which is now used to a very large extent indeed in the arts, that any diminution in the supply of it would be viewed with serious concern. It is of very great interest, therefore, to find from a report which has been  received  from southern Mexico that the discovery of a new rubber-producing &#39; plant has been recently made in that country. This plant, which is known by the name of <inline font-style="italic">guayale,</inline> is low and bushy, and grows very extensively at altitudes of five thousand feet in northern Mexico and Arizona. It is gathered, roots included, dried, and packed in bundles weighing about one hundred pounds each. Each bundle is worth about thirteen pounds at the factory. About 15 per cent, of the dried plant is rubber. Six large factories for treating the plant have been erected in the vicinity of San Luis  PotosiSaltillo,  &#38;c. The first operation in the process of extracting the rubber is to cut the plants into very fine pieces. Solvents are then applied to the mass to extract the rubber. The solvents which are employed are highly volatile, and after, the solution is filtered away the remaining solvent is evaporated and recovered by condensation. In one of the factories, however, the rubber is separated from the dried plants by mechanical means, the process consisting of &#39; the agglutination of the particles of rubber between revolving metal discs through which the finely cut plants are fed. </para>

          <para>One of the drawbacks of the industry, according to well-informed authorities, is that it will probably have but a short life, as the <inline font-style="italic">guayale</inline> is of very slow growth, as are most desert plants. </para>

        <para class="block">I take the last sentence to mean that as the plants have to be pulled up by the roots, it will be necessary, after the first few. years, to wait some time before the young plants grow up to ..a stage at which they become usable. I quote this information to show that the present shortage of rubber does not. justify a demand that we should suddenly establish the industry in Australia, seeing what is being done by chemists and botanists the world over. In view of these- facts, and the inevitable competition &#34;&#34;from New Guinea and the South Sea Islands, with raw rubber admitted free into the Commonwealth, the money we propose  to  spend on this item will probably never be claimed. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> properly  remarked on a previous item, the money will be ear-marked and tied up. Then, if some much more important industry,  with  great possibilities, such as the cotton industry, is found to need a greater amount of bounty, we shall be met by the reply - probably as much from this as from the other side of &#34; the . chamber - that so </para>

            <para>- It may be that Papua is eminently adapted for the production of rubber, but are we, because of that fact, to impose a self-denying ordinance on the Commonwealth, and say that no steps shall be taken to cultivate the article here? That is the logical conclusion from the proposition submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chataway.</inline> Apparently it is contended that inasmuch as other places that may at some time be associated with the Commonwealth can produce this article, and are eminently adapted for its production, we should not adopt any course which would bring our people into competition with those who take up these industries in the places referred to. I hold the contrary view. I say, &#34; Good luck to Papua, and all other parts of the British Empire that can produce rubber,&#34; but we wish to take a hand with them in supplying the world&#39;s demand for this particular article. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has referred to the fact that the experts have reported that Papua is preeminently adapted for the cultivation of the rubber tree. But there are other circumstances associated with Papua which should not be overlooked. To a large extent native labour would have to be relied upon there, and the experience of the past has shown that native labour is a rather slender reed on which to rest. Notwithstanding the great and constant efforts put forth by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir WilliamMacGregor</inline> to induce the native&#39;s of Papua to work, it was found almost impossible to getthem to apply themselves continuously to any class of labour. That has been one of the difficulties which in the past have prevented a more rapid development of the Territory. It is easy to understand that the natives who have been able to obtain sustenance without doing very much work should be disinclined to apply themselves to work for others, especially when they realize that the benefit and profit derivedfrom their work would not go to themselves, but to others. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator makes a reference to the transfer of natives from one part of Papua to another, but what has been the result of the adoption of that plan? It was confidently hoped that by transferring natives from one part of Papua to another, and thus removing them from the environment to which they had been accustomed, the difficultye xperienced in getting them to continuously apply themselves to work would be overcome. That plan may be to some extent  successful, but so far it is only an experiment, and it has been found that as soon as the transferred natives become accustomed to their new environment the habits which characterized them in their old environment are resumed. Are we to impose upon ourselves a prohibition, and say that we will not go in for the cultivation of this article because it can be produced in Papua ? I  should like to direct the attention of the Committee to some information which has appeared in print in recent issues of journals with which we are very much more familiar than we are with some of those from which quotations have been made. I can refer honorable senators to two articles upon this subject which appeared quite recently in the two Melbourne morning newspapers. It is not often that they are found in agreement on any matter of Commonwealth policy of this character.

I desire to pay a tribute to the honorable senator for the extraordinary amount of research and diligence which he has brought to bear upon the subject, and the ability with which he introduced the measure. Whatever may foe his motive - and I know that it is an exalted one - and whatever may be the desirability or otherwise of providing for criminal appeals, the fact remains that we, as a Commonwealth Parliament, are not possessed of certain legislative powers which we might desire to have. It will be observed that the object of the Bill is - - </para>

              <para>- We have the assurance, of my honorable friend that the Bill is practically a reprint of the English Bill except in regard to five provisions which he referred to, and which do not materially affect its object. What I desire to impress upon honorable senators is that the Bill is unsuitable to Federal conditions. The legislative power of the mother country is practically unlimited.. It may legislate according to its own sweet will. I think it was Lord Holt who observed that the British Parliament was competent to make Malta in Europe, and a woman a mayor or a justice of the peace, but not to make a man into a woman, or a woman into a man, by legislation. The Commonwealth, however, is strictly bound and circumscribed by the limits of the Constitution. Another important feature is that in the United Kingdom they have a uniform criminal law which forms part of their system of .justice, and in connexion with which they may make advances from time to time as they think proper. But so, far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the administration of criminal justice belongs <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the States. </para>

          <para class="block">Although it is provided in section 73 that the High Court&#39;s judgment shall be final, yet that is subject to the qualification which I have. quoted. It will be observed, therefore, that all that the -High Court is authorized to do is to hear and determine appeals, from sentences amongst other things. In the Judiciary Act we have attempted to exercise some powers of regulation. But it must be borne in mind, as practically a fundamental principle in connexion with our legislation, that the only jurisdiction which we have is derived from the Constitution, and we have no power to confer additional jurisdiction. The power vested in the High Court to hear appeals from sentences does not mean that it has the right to review the facts,- because, according to the State law, in criminal cases the verdict of the jury is first given, and upon that verdict is based the judgment or sentence of the Court. It is from that judgment or sentence that there is given a right of appeal to the High Court. There is no power in the High Court to re-try a case,, or by any means to bring about a re-hearing of it, but simply power to deal with the sentence of the Court. It has no power to alter the verdict of the jury. That is one of the first principles which honorable senators must bear in mind. </para>

              <para>- The fact is- and it has occurred time after time in the Courts - that where a verdict has been returned by a jury, but evidence has been admitted wrongly, or there has been a misdirection on the part of the Judge, an appeal is always permitted to the Full Court of the State. Take as an illustration of what occurs in the State of Victoria. On a case going to the Full Court, the Judges may say &#34; The verdict may be&#39; all right in itself, but the Judge at the trial admitted certain evidence which he ought not to have admitted.&#34; The Full Court thereupon quashes the conviction, and the situation is as though the trial had never taken place. A new trial is ordered. </para>

              <para>- It is a matter that is essentially within the province of the States, and each State has its own criminal legislation in that regard. In Victoria if the Full Court is satisfied that there has been abundant evidence to convict a pri soner, but a mistake has been made on the part of the Judge in the course of the trial, they quash the conviction, and .order a new trial. This procedure is followed, if I remember rightly, under section 482 of the Victorian Crimes Act, which is founded upon the Criminal Law and Practice Statute of Great Britain, passed in 1864. Chief Justice Griffith, in his judgment, proceeds - </para>

            <para>It follows that, according to the practice of Courts of common law, which, in the case of South Australia, is emphasized by the provisions of section 15 of the Act of 1878, the only way of taking exception to a verdict of a jury was by application for a new trial, and that a party who did not adopt that method was not in a position to dispute the facts as found by the jury. The verdict in the present case, which was a general verdict for the defendants, must be read as if the specific facts which established their freedom from liability had . been found by the jury. By those findings, this Court is bound, and, as upon them the judgment is right, the appeal fails. </para>

Throughout this Bill that principle is enunciated, as clause 10, for instance, directs the &#39; High Court, on an appeal against conviction, to allow the appeal if it thinks that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on any ground on which a verdict of a jury may be set aside in an appeal to the High Court in civil proceedings.  3496 <inline font-style="italic">Criminal</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Appeals Bill.</inline></para>

What this clause provides for has already been provided for in the Judiciary Act, and the States themselves have already made similar provision. The State of New South Wales is probably the most advanced State in this respect. New South Wales has a system whereby a prisoner can have any point of law reserved for consideration by the Full Court, and the Full Court has power conferred upon it by Statute to increase or reduce the sentence. The State law even goes further than that, and provides certain machinery whereby, in certain circumstances, further evidence can be admitted on oath at the appeal.

The evidence may have been conclusive as to the guilt of the prisoner, and it would be a most unreasonable state of affairs that simply because of a mistake on the part of counsel or on the part of the Judge, the prisoner should not be made to suffer for his crime. Therefore this section, which is founded on British legislation, provides for a newtrial in those circumstances. Other States, as my honorable friend himself mentioned, have equally excellent legislation on the same subject. </para>

          </quote>
          <para>I  do not profess to be able, at this moment, to realize exactly what is meant by &#34; mixed law and fact.&#34; I assume that the words are used in the section in the English Act. Every crime has its own elements and in gradients. Evidence is called with the object of establishing that particular crime. The Judge reviews the evidence, and says, &#34; Such and such facts have been proved, and if you, the jury,, believe that evidence to be true, you will find that that particular crime has been committed.&#34; But there is a great differentiation between this and the condition of affairs in civil cases, where mixed questions of law and fact are frequently met with. In criminal cases, as a rule, the facts stand by themselves, and the law part of the case stands equally by itself. If the Judge has gone wrong in his law, by misdirection or by the wrongful admission or rejection of evidence, that, of course, is a proper ground for appeal. In a civil case, such, for instance, as a suit for damages for malicious prosecution, the question arises as to reasonable and probable cause, and that involves mixed questions of law and fact. </para>

          <para>These words are extremely vague, and will prove very embarrassing. Even if we had power to confer such jurisdiction on the High Court, I am sure that they would find very great difficulty in ascertaining what was actually meant. They know where there has been a misdirection, and can ascertain whether there has been wrongful admission or rejection of evidence, and give judgment accordingly.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>emphasized very strongly the alarming hardship it is to a prisoner when new facts are revealed after the trial. I have already referred to what is done in New South Wales in that case. All the States have their own procedures. No doubt one of the chief causes for theintroduction of the Bill in England was the outcry which took place with regard to appeals to the Home Secretary to review decisions of the Courts, and variousincidents which have from time to time occurred in the Home Office. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> complained that when subsequent facts came to light, there was no power, once the trial was completed, to give relief to the prisoner, except by&#39; the exercise of the Sovereign prerogative. But in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Regina</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Brown,</inline> reported in 24 Q.B.D., a man was charged with a heinous offence ; he pleaded guilty, and Lord Coleridge recorded sentence against: him. Lord Coleridge left the Assize Court, and was going home after the whole trial had been completed. Some one reminded&#39;&#39; him during the journey of a certain unreported case. He looked it up, and saw. that the law was laid down in strong terms by a learned authority. He, there-, fore, stated a case for the Court of Criminal Appeals, and it was heard. The judgment in the unreported case was reviewed, with the ultimate result that thefirst conviction of the man by Lord Coleridge was re-affirmed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;</inline> said, &#34; Look at the hardship it is to a prisoner if ,&#39; during a trial, some important point escapes the attention of counsel or of the Judge himself, but when once the man is convicted he is done for.&#34; .My object in mentioning that instance was to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> argument is not strictly correct, because, even apart from the. exercise of the Royal prerogative, there is the power to review. I have already mentioned the power of review that exists in New South Wales. In Victoria that power&#34; rests with the Attorney-General. These matters are attended in many cases with much danger, for in the majority of instances a number of unscrupulous men, having heard the full disclosure of the evidence given on the trial, and so gained a knowledge of what might be suggested in answer, fake up by fraud and wrongdoing all sorts of evidence, contradicting that given upon the trial, and seek a retrial upon that fraudulent basis. </para>

              <para>- Of course not. Clause 23 provides that the Judge, that is a Judge of a State Court, shall furnish certain reports, but we have no power to compel him to do so. From what I have said before, it will be admitted that clause 24 is hopelessly unconstitutional. It refers to certain supplementary powers under which the High Court might, if it thought it necessary or expedient in&#39; the in&#39;terests of justice, order the production of documents, and so on, and in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> the clause provides that the High Court may - </para>

          <para>Honorable senators must see that there is no possible constitutional justification for that provision, which would confer an absolutely new and original jurisdiction on the High Court for the re-trial of a case, not only by the Court, but before a commissioner, who might be appointed for the purpose. Even if it were constitutional to enact such a provision, I am by no means satisfied that it would be wise to permit the investigation of a criminal matter to take place before a commissioner. Honorable senators must be aware that the demeanour of a witness is of the gravest moment, and particularly in a criminal trial. If I remember rightly we have in the Insolvency Act of Victoria a provision under which it is competent for a Judge, if he so desires, to delegate the important duties of an investigation in insolvency to a commissioner. I am aware that there are many Judges in the State who deem that such a provision is fundamentally wrong, and refuse to exercise their powers under it. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of clause 24 is also be- &#39; yond the powers of this Parliament under the Constitution. Clause 25 enables; the High Court to assign legal assistance of counsel and solicitor to a prisoner. That is a power which, the High Court already possesses. Then in clause 26 we have a provision entitling the appellant to be present on the hearing of his appeal if a question of fact, and not a question of law alone, is involved. Let us apply that provision to our own conditions in Australia, which is described as a place of magnificent distances. We have but one High Court, consisting of five Judges. Under this provision, it would be possible for the prisoner to have &#34; a high old time.&#34; </para>

              <para>- There is no room for any doubt on the point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> must know as well as I do, that the course of procedure is that a prisoner is found guilty or otherwise by the verdict of the jury, and following upon the return of the verdict the Judge passes his judgment or sentence. Even on the merits of this proposal there are very great difficulties in the way: In the United States of America, where a right of appeal, such as is proposed in this Bill, exists, some of the most glaring cases of the wrongful and unreasonable exercise of the power thus provided have occurred. The effect in the United States of such a provision has frequently been to indefinitely postpone theexecution of sentences, and unfortunately it is in many cases recorded that the man with the longest purse is able to delay the execution of sentence by processes of this kind for an indefinite time. This goes to show that the question is essentially one to be dealt with by the States authorities. They can be trusted to see that justice is done, and that the most complete code is enacted that is demanded by the circumstances of each State. It may fairly be said that in Australia the inclination and desire of juries is to acquit. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will pardon me; I never suggested anything of the kind. I suggested that where, on a point of law, a prisoner gets the benefit of the doubt, and that may involve injustice, a re-trial may take place.. The point I was making is that no man has a right to be tried twice for the same offence if he has once been acquitted, but if in such a case as that to which I have already referred a case is reserved on a mere point of law, and the Judges find there is any doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner, apart from the technicality, a re-trial would, of course, take place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will, I am sure, accept my assurance that my anxiety is not to in any way discourage the consummation of what he&#39; desires. I have spoken only in the performance of what I conceive to be a duty, to show exactly &#39; what our powers are, and that, however desirable the enactment of such a law may be in Great Britain, we should find it impossible to apply it to our Federal conditions in Australia, which are totally different from those existing in Great Britain. In the circumstances with much regret, and while commending in every way my honorable friend&#39;s efforts in this connexion, I have to say that I cannot see my way to support the Bill. </para>

              <para>- The pairing system is almost a necessity in a Parliament whose members come from great distances, especially in the States&#39; House, where there is equal representation, and if, through illness or the pressure of business, or the break-down) of a train or a steamer, a senator cannot be in his place, his State suffers materially, much more &#39;than is the case in a Chamber with a larger number of members and proportionate representation. It is a parliamentary custom that anything which lies upon the table of a House is its  property.  A special book, prepared at the public expense, lies upon our table, an&#39;d is used by <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as well as by the press. If <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is not strictly a publication of the Senate, it is, to all intents and purposes, a public record. If it is not the <inline font-style="italic">Journal</inline> of the Senate, it contains the particulars without which, according to our modern views, parliamentary institutions would be almost impossible. We have this book, provided at the public expense, lying upon our table as a public document, and it is used for .public .purposes, and for the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record. While I do not want to facilitate discussions about entries of pairs, I think that* where a difficulty arises under the circumstances I have named it ought to&#39; be a matter with which the Senate&#39; can deal. If this motion were passed, and it became a recognised principle of the Chamber that the parties to an entry were under certain obligations, there would be, perhaps, a little more care and forethought displayed in making original entries, and certainly a good deal more care in making alterations. I think it would be an advantage that the pair book should be regarded as an official document/ <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith</inline> expresses his dissent by a movement of the head. </para>

              <para>- It should be regarded not, perhaps, as an official record but as a record which might be referred to in a reasonable manner when misunderstandings arose. I think that the carrying of the motion would have the effect of limiting misunderstandings and mistakes. I submit the motion with a view to utility. I will not mention any individual cases. I suppose that we have all had some misunderstandings, or have been the subjects of misapprehensions at one time or other. &#39; I do not wish to go into any matter of the kind. I hope that the motion will commend itself to the support of honorable senators. </para>

            <para>- - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> invites the Senate to declare a certain act on the part of a senator a breach of its privileges. Suppose that we make the declaration, and that afterwards it is infringed, I presume that it will be a contempt of the Senate, and that possibly the offending senator will be placed in the position of receiving censure, or being punished by fine or imprisonment. Suppose, however, that an alteration were made in the pair book accidentally, what would be the position of the senator concerned? Would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> insist upon the offender being subjected to all the pains and penalties in that behalf provided? Would the offending senator be turned out of the chamber, and then brought to the bar, or what would be done ? The offence, if committed knowingly, is such a gross breach of good manners that the offender would be regarded as unfit for social intercourse with his fellow-senators in respect of any matter relating to the business of the Senate. We have very many privileges, both individually and collectively, but I think it is unnecessary to declare them. I do not believe that the alteration of a pair can be declared to be a breach of the privileges of the Senate, or that we can look upon the pair book as an official record. It would be far better not to be always declaring our privileges in regard to what a,re comparatively speaking petty matters. We have among ourselves the most effective way of dealing with a member of the Senate who would intentionally do such a discreditable act as to alter a pair. He would be sent to a place to which he would richly &#39;deserve to be sent, and that is Coventry. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that it is not wise to press the motion, because if it were passed we might involve ourselves in ludicrous actions and results. I hope that he has not sufficient grounds to go so far as to press it. </para>

            <para>. - I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will be induced to withdraw his motion, and to have the subject handed over for consideration by the Standing Orders Committee. Honorable senators are probably aware that in England one of the most interesting columns in the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> and other newspapers, is that in which the votes of members of the House of Commons are recorded together with pairs. It is very interesting to the public to see how members are divided upon important questions. But of course it is manifest that the pair book must be honestly kept. The pair book is not an official record, but it is a very useful one. Personally I have never refused a pair to an honorable senator opposite who has been unable through illness or some other cause to be present at a division. I have been treated very generously by honorable senators opposite when I have been unable to be present. It is purely a matter of kindly feeling to give a pair to a fellow senator. Whether the pair book is officially recognised or not, it is a very convenient institution for senators who may be ill or who may be kept away by urgent business. </para>

Its use is, of course, dependent upon the good sense, good taste, and honour of honorable senators.

              <para>- It is, and I do not know why it is that pairs are included in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> unless it is for the purpose of publishing for the information of the constituents of honorable senators the fact that although sometimes compelled to be absent when certain divisions take place, they take sufficient interest in the questions at issue to secure the absence of senators who would otherwise have voted on the opposite side. If it is desired that pairs shall be officially recognised, let us appoint some responsible officer to see that the pair book is properly kept, and let us insure that no pair is transferred without the knowledge of the officer responsible for the record. I know that mistakes have occurred which have caused a great deal of ill feeling, but, speaking from personal knowledge, I am sure that they have been pure mistakes, made with no absence of honest intention in any case. As a matter of fact, a pair is simply a matter of convenience between two senators. A senator foresees that there is a possibility of his not being able to be present when a certain division is taken. He therefore arranges with another senator to pair with him on the question. The arrangement is made entirely between themselves, and the Senate ought to take no cognisance of it. If, however, it is considered desirable that the Senate shall take cognisance of pairs, let us instruct the Standing Orders. Committee to preparea 3504 <inline font-style="italic">Entries in</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Pair Book.</inline> standing order dealing with the subject, and let. the pair book be placed under the control of a responsible official. </para>

The names recorded in it are not reckoned as official votes on any question upon which a division is taken. That being so, the  President  has no control over the book. If he has no control over it, will the passing of this motion give him authority to supervise pairs? If so, suppose that an honorable senator unconsciously makes an error in recording a pair.

          <para class="block">I ask myself two questions with reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> motion: Does he propose that pairs shall be officially recognised, or does he not? So far as my experience has gone, if has been that Houses of Parliament do not officially recognise pairs. A pair is simply an honorable arrangement between individual members of Parliament to suit their own convenience. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> desires to bring about a practical result, the motion ought to go further. It ought to provide that the Senate shall in future recognise pairs. If the motion had been couched in that form I should have supported it. Since I have had the honour of being a member of the Senate I have had reason to feel a certain amount of irritation on account of the non-observance of. pairs. Perhaps if I were to pursue that theme it might lead to renewed irritation. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> at a future date, feels inclined to move a motion which will be the means of securing the official recognition of pairs, and of insuring that a senator who breaks such an arrangement shall submit himself to the will of the Senate, I shall support him. But if we carry the motion now before us it will make no difference in the matter ofthe arrangement of pairs, according to the practice that has been in existence since the establishment of the Senate. Therefore, ft would be well for the honorable senator to withdraw his motion with a view to submitting another at a future date, with the object of arriving at a determination which would be binding upon the honorable senators . who consent to make pairs. </para>

              <para>- Before calling upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> to reply, I wish to say a few words. It will be within the knowledge of the Senate that a desire was expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> a few days ago to allude to the fact that some misunderstanding had occurred with regard to pairs. He desired to take action as a matter of privilege. I pointed out, however, that he could not take that course, because the Senate has no official cognizance of pairs ; and because the pair book is simply provided for the convenience of honorable senators who are unable to be present when a division takes place. They are afforded an opportunity of having their names recorded in the pair book, so as to indicate unofficially the way in which they would have voted had they been present. But the Senate as a </para>

          </continue>
          <para class="block">Senate knows nothing about pairs. So clear is that rule, that if two honorable senators chose to enter their names in the book as having paired, and ohe of them nevertheless saw fit to vote, the Senate Could not interfere with his determination. No House of Parliament of which I have any knowledge recognises pairs as. official records. In May&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> it is stated as to pairs - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There can be no parliamentary recognition of this practice, although it has never been expressly condemned; and it is therefore conducted privately by individual members, or arranged by the gentlemen known as &#34; the Whips,&#34; who are entrusted by their political parties with the office of collecting their respective forces on a division. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That puts very clearly and succinctly the position with regard to pairs in Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> proposal is that we should place on record our opinion that any unauthorized entry or alteration in .the pair book should be regarded as a breach of privilege. In the first place, the proposition, cannot be recognised by Parliament, as matters stand at present. The pair book is not in the custody of the officers of the Senate. If we did- regard this question as having the importance which the honorable senator desires to attach to it, it would become necessary to place the pair book absolutely under the control* and disposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> and the officers of the Senate. Honorable senators would then only have access to it by approaching the  Clerk  in the first instance. It has been suggested that the question be referred to the Standing Orders Committee for consideration. There are very strong reasons why we should take no such action. The effect of the raising of a question of privilege in this Chamber is shown by standing order 112 - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whenever a matter or question directly concerning the privileges of the Senate, or of any Committee or member thereof, has arisen since the last sitting of the Senate, a motion calling upon the Senate to take action thereon may be moved, without notice, and shall, until  decided,  unless the debate be adjourned, suspend the consideration of other motions as well as Orders of the Day. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Consequently, the raising of a question of privilege is regarded as a matter of serious import, and one that may lead to lengthy debate. I ask honorable senators to go a step further. Neither this Senate nor the Standing Orders Committee can make a matter a question of privilege. Under the </para>
          <para>Constitution, our privileges are defined. Section 49 of the Constitution provides - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members and the Committees of each House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That means by legislation passed by both Houses -  and until declared shall be those of the Commons Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members and. Committees, at the establishment of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para class="block">Our privileges having been clearly laid dawn, we cannot extend them until Parliament sees fit to legislate in that direction. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> gives a general view of the privileges of Parliament, the privileges of each House collectively, breaches of privilege, punishments, and privileges attaching to members of both Houses, and others. All these privileges are of serious moment and concern, because they are claimed by the Parliament in order to enable it to legislate without let or hindrance, and to prevent members of Parliament from being arrested or interfered with in any way while they are called upon to exercise and are attempting to exercise their duties. To invite Parliament to legislate in such a way as to make this a question of privilege appears to me unnecessary and undesirable. There is a power now, which the honorable senator exercised the other day, and which other honorable senators can exercise, of making a personal explanation, if they think that there is any necessity for it, with regard to any mistake or error that has occurred in connexion with the pair book. They are at liberty to make such an explanation so long as it is within the bounds provided by the Standing Orders, and by the practice of Parliament. I therefore suggest to the honorable senator that he will be well advised to withdraw the motion after haying had this discussion. I should have spoken earlier in the debate, but I desired to give an opportunity to honorable senators to express their views on _ the proposal of the honorable senator, who, of course, had no other object in view than to see that the interests of honorable senators were, properly protected and cared for in connexion with the pair book. He has now achieved his object. If he insists upon the motion being put, it will become my duty to put it. But what would happen afterwards, if an attempt were made to discuss the subject of the motion as a question of privilege, would be a matter for the consideration of the  President  when it arose. </para>

That being the case, the honorable senator may havethe motion put if he so desires. </para>

              <para>- I do not ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> to withdraw the motion, but my opinion is that he ought to withdraw it as a matter of duty, because I am sure that he does not wish to do any honorable senator an injustice. What we have to do is to see that pairs are correctly entered in the pair book. Speaking; from my six years&#39; experience, I think we may congratulate ourselves that the pair book has been admirably managed. During that time &#39;no honorable senator has ever been found guilty of a desire to do anything wrong or improper. The motion would give the impression that honorable senators have wilfully and deliberately made unauthorized alterations in the pair book. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> knows that that is not the case.. &#39; How such an idea entered into his mind I do not know. The motion is a reflection upon honorable senators. It dealswith a matter of which the Senate takes no cognizance, yet we are discussing it. For reasons of justice it should be withdrawn at once. </para>

Question of pairs can be dealt with by the Standing Orders Committee. You gave as your reasonsthat the pair book was not recognised bv the British House of Commons, and that the powers, privileges, and immunities of this Chamber were limited by the Constitution to those possessed by the British House of Commons at the establishment of the Commonwealth. But we have standing -orders </para>

              <para>- If the honorable . senator will refer to section 47 of the Constitution, he will see that the. Senate has the right to deal with questions of disputed elections until the Parliament otherwise provides. By section 50 of the Constitution power is given to each House to make rules and standing orders. </para>

But that section does not give us power to confer upon ourselves other powers, privileges, and immunities. In thatregard we are otherwise restricted by a previous section. </para>

              <para>- Of course it is not possible for me to maintain an argument with the Chair. Because of your  dual  position, to do  so  would necessarily be awkward for you, sir, and very much more awkward for any honorable senator who proposed to argue&#39; with you. I certainly do not intend to obey the ukase of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> because I do not think the honorable senator had any right to address the as he  did in  the matter, or to make the reference he sought to make, seeing that, in the most emphatic manner in which a man could speak, I had repudiated the suggestion that the action I had taken to-night was intended to reflect upon any member of the Senate, or to have any application to any particular matter, case, or person. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> demands, sa far as I am concerned, have been wafted out through the door with the honorable senator&#39;s coat-tails. But I  do  recognise a very general desire on the part of honorable senators that I should adopt  a.  certain course. I should not be a reasonable man, and should not be qualified to give good public service here, if I were to lightly disregard an expression of opinion coming from all parts of the chamber. I think that, notwithstanding the possible constitutional difficulty to which you, sir, have referred, some more simple method of dealing with this matter, if it is to be dealt with, might be discovered than anything so cumbrous as legislation. In view of the way in which some honorable senators have expressed themselves to me, I am prepared to live in hope that pairs may yet find a place in the journals and records of the Senate, as they now do in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I believe . that, as the result of some betterconsidered form of motion, the Standing Orders Committee may have an opportunity to conside this matter at a future  time.  In view of an engagement between the VicePresident of the Executive Council and myself, that  as  I had the whole of the private business on the paper in hand I should! surrender to the Government so much of my time as would equal the time which the Government very courteously gave up for the purpose of permitting me to submit a motion relating to our first President at the beginning of yesterday&#39;s sitting. I wish now to bring the present debate to  a  close. For that and other reasons which I have given, I ask the leave of the Senate to withdraw my motion, still hoping  that  some more satisfactory way may be found for dealing in  the  future with this somewhat vexed question. </para>
