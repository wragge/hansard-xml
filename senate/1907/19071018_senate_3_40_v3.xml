                            <para>- I take it that the petition of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vardon</inline> has not yet been finally dealt with, as the Senate, instead of adopting the recommendation of the Committee,has thought it better that the matter should be remitted to the High Court for the purpose of determining the legal questions involved. With the concurrence of the Senate, I propose to inform the petitioner of the determination which has been arrived at. That, I think, is the proper course to pursue. As honorable senators know, a motion was passed last night authorizing a refund of the deposit which had been made by the petitioner. </para>

                            <para>- I understood that the Government wanted to push on with the business, and I think that 3 o&#39;clock is quite late enough for the Senate to meet on Wednesday next. Some very strong reason ought to be given before honorable senators are asked to adjourn until 5 o&#39;clock on that day.I protest against this proposal to delay the business of the country, for that is really what it means. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> ought to tell us why he asks the Senate to adjourn until an unusual hour. Is there any public reason for taking this course? Has some King or Emperor or other person of great importance died that the Senate should delay its meeting on Wednesday for two hours? Again, why should the Minister, if there is to be a special adjournment, ask the Senate to meet at the inconvenient hour of 5 o&#39;clock on Wednesday? The business of the Senate will hardly have got into swing before the dinner hour is reached. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sure that honorable senators generally are grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> for asking the Senate not to meet on Wednesday next until  5  o&#39;clock. But I rise to ask him whether he cannot see his way to delay the meeting until after the dinner-hour. Every senator has received an invitation to- attend the ceremony of .the opening of the Australian Women&#39;s Work&#39; Exhibition, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> must know that this Exhibition is unique, not only in -the history of Australia, but of the world. It is, in a sense, an international Exhibition. We ought to attend the ceremony, especially as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> knows that women are voters. </para>

                        <para>. - I am m favour of the motion. I utterly repudiate the insinuation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> made just now, in reply to my interjection. I assumed that the&#39; interest in the Exhibition would be so great that very possibly some senators might linger on, and the Ministry would find themselves without a quorum at  5  o&#39;clock on Wednesday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> utterly mistakes my view if he for a moment- assumes that I come here with the idea- of stopping business. That is exactly the opposite to my wish. My understanding is that we assemble to transact business, but it is impossible to proceed unless we have a quorum. My interjection was not open to  the interpretation which was put upon it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best.</inline></para>

The Australian Women&#39;s Exhibition is so unique, and so deserving of encouragement, that I hope that the Minister will not ask the Senate to meet on Wednesday until after the dinner-hour. If he will accede to my suggestion, I believe that the business of the Senate will not be materially affected, and certainly he will be doing justice to a great Exhibition. </para>

A  suggestion was made  that a  steam launch should be purchased for the purpose of patrolling the port, but it was considered that the expenditure would not be justified, nor were the prospects of attaining the desired result at  all  certain. A sailing cutter is in use by the Customs. It is anticipated a report of the case from the sub-Collector, Port Darwin, will be received  in a  few  days. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister would get over the difficulty perfectly well, and at the same time meet the wishes of the Committee by making the item read &#34; Coffee, Raw, as prescribed.&#34; I can quite see the mistake that was made. The item as it stands in the amended Bill would enable the bounty to be paid upon roasted coffee. That is not intended. But if we make the item read, &#34;Coffee, Raw, as prescribed&#34; it would be perfectly clear. Regulations would have to be made in regard to the payment of the bounty. It would&#39; not extend the amount. In some parts of Queensland the people pulp their coffee, hull it, and roast it on the premises. In other places they pulp and hull it, and send it away to be roasted. In other places, again, they pulp it, and then send it in what is called the parchment form to two firms in Brisbane, or to Melbourne, where there is hulling machinery. Parchment coffee is raw coffee just as much as what is generally understood as raw coffee, except that there is a thin skin over the bean. In that form it may be held by merchants for a considerable time before it is hulled. The result might be that the growers would be kept out of their bounty very likely for months at a stretch, while the parchment coffee was held prior to hulling. If the word &#34; raw &#34; were inserted after &#34;coffee&#34; the regulations would prescribe the kinds of raw coffee upon which the bounty was to be paid. </para>

                <para class="block">This is the item as it&#39; originally appeared in the schedule. It was struck&#39; out on division. The circumstances attending the taking of that division and the misunderstandings that arose are known to honorable senators. A lengthy discussion took place as to the advisableness or otherwise of stimulating the growth of tobacco of this kind by the offer of a bounty. I do not propose to traverse that ground again, but the Government think that, owing to the unfortunate misunderstanding that arose through the taking of the division immediately on the resumption of the sitting after lunch, the mind of the Committee was not properly-reflected in the vote. For that reason, we desire to give the Committee an opportunity to restore the item. A general feeling was expressed at that time that it was advisable to encourage the production in the Commonwealth of tobacco leaf of high grade, but some honorable senators doubted whether the bounty would have that effect, and believed that it would be to the advantage, not so much of the grower as of third parties. I believe that they opposed the item or abstained from voting for it for that reason more than any other. I think honorable senators generally will recognise, not only that it is desirable that this kind of leaf should be grown in Australia, and that we should encourage those who are capable of growing it to use the land suitable for it, but also that there is, in different parts of Australia, land eminently suitable for its growth. We have the benefit of the advice and instruction of _ experienced tobacco culturists, especially in Queensland, whose opinion is that Australia affords in many places a good field for its cultivation. All that we ask is that a vote shall be taken on the item in circumstances which &#93; can leave &#39;little doubt as to the exact feeling of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- That makes my argument all the stronger. It shows that the local cigar manufacturer can obtain under the Tariff an enormous advantage if he uses leaf grown in Australia. If this bounty comes into operation, and tobacco fit to be manufactured into cigars is grown here, I do not suppose that the cigar manufacturer will have to give the growers more than is. a lb. for the leaf in any circumstances. It is very difficult to ascertain what buyers will give. The prices given for Australian-grown tobacco have ranged from a minimum) of 5d. to a maximum of about is. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- That tobacco was sold in Hamburg twenty years ago. With&#39; due regard to accuracy, and with a fair amount of confidence, I assert - and my assertion is based on evidence given to the Tariff Commission, and on other information which I have gathered elsewhere - that no one can reasonably expect tobacco grown here for cigar making to be sold to any buyer in Australia at more than is. a lb. That being so, look at the enormous advantage which the growers of that tobacco will have under the Tariff. Translating that protection into percentages, it must be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 200 per cent. If that does not do away with the necessity for a bounty, is there any virtue in protection at all? Surely it is not necessary to superadd a bounty of 2d. per lb. to a protective duty of 200 per cent. ? It is singular that whenever the tobacco question arises in this Chamber, we see strange divisions. The question of a bounty on tobacco seems to be necessarily intertwined with the operations of a Combine. I am against the Combine1, and even&#39; opportunity that is offered in this Chamber to deal with It, I shall take advantage of, without the slightest regard to what is usual in legislation, or otherwise. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that there are not other buyers in, a few isolated cases, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> will admit that if the growers of tobacco leaf have to rely on any purchaser outside the Combine, they &#39; will never find a profitable market, and never earn the bounty. If that is so, why play into the hands of the Combine bv offering this bounty? If the money is ever paid by the Commonwealth, it will go to a large extent to the very Combine to which we all object. For that reason, I shall vote against it. I object to the Combine, and I shall&#39; not omit any opportunity, directly or indirectly, of opposing it.&#39; Seeing that the growers of tobacco leaf have already under the Tariff a protection of 200 per cent., it is extravagant folly to superadd the bounty. . </para>

                            the item, and also with regard to the Combine. I do not propose to say anything with respect to the Combine, or the effect which the offering of the bounty may have upon it or upon the growers in relation to it. It will be time enough to consider the question of what steps, if any, should be taken with regard to the position of the Combine, when that matter comes before us. It is not fair to say that we should not agree to a proposal for a bounty which is to go to the grower of tobacco leaf, because some honorable senators think that it will play into the hands of a particular firm. That consideration is beside the question. Personally, I do not favour bounties upon the various products that we may grow or may desire to grow in Australia;, but this Parliament has specifically declared in favour of adopting a system of bounties, and consequently it is reasonable that we should ascertain in what direction we think the bounties, if they are to be granted, can fairly be given. We know that tobacco cultivation is an industry that has been established in this country for a. great number of years, and has gone on with, more or less success. We are not now asked to grant a bounty for the growth, of tobacco leaf

                            tobacco leaf, but only for a particular class of leaf of high-grade quality, fit for making into cigars. It is a matter of notoriety that so far our people- have not been able to produce a class of leaf which is considered to be fit for use in. the making of a very high-class cigar ;. but we have it on the authority of experts that there is country in Australia suitable for the growth of leaf of this class, and, if that be so, it is right that, having adopted, the bounty principle, some encouragement should be given to people in the cultivation of this product. Those engaged in the growth of tobacco have, so far, not been-, able to develop the industry as we should like. I am told that the Combine, or the predecessors of the Combine, have spent a great deal of money in endeavouring to secure the growth of the better classes of tobacco leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars, but without success. That mav be urged as an argument against the bounty, but as the bounty principle has been determined on, and I am informed that we have country which will produce leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars, I am prepared to vote for this item so that the matter may be put to actual test.

                            - The Government are advised that the proposed bounty will induce growers to cultivate leaf of a high quality, and, in &#39; the circumstances, I am prepared to give the! proposal a trial. Apparently, it comes with a shock to some of our free-trade friends to find that certain honorable senators are prepared to assist in this matter, and I have, therefore, thought it due to myself and those who think with me that I should say two or three words as to the reasons which will guide me in giving the vote I intend to give, should a division be called for on the item.

                        <para>-That leaf is imported into Australia, and what is the object of proposing this bounty, or imposing a duty giving preference to leaf grown in the Commonwealth, if it is not to encourage our growers to grow tobacco of the very best quality? If they attempt to grow tobacco of the quality contemplated in this item, it will be a tobacco that will fetch from 2s. to 5s. per lb. If they do not grow a leaf of that quality they will not be entitled to the bounty. It should be remembered that for the manufacture of ordinary pipe tobacco, a leaf can be grown which will give a heavy crop to the acre, whilst a leaf suitable for the manufacture of high-class cigars will involve a reduction in the weight of the crop of about. 50 per cent. Where men can grow half a ton of leaf suitable for ordinary pipe tobacco they will not be able to grow more than from 3 cwt. to 5 cwt. of the class of leaf required to earn this bounty. Some special encouragement should, therefore, be offered. </para>

                        <para>- Is that any reason why they should not get all the encouragement that may be necessary? In my opinion the bounty proposed is not nearly sufficient, but I am prepared to support the item, seeing that I can do nothing to increase the proposed bounty. With respect to the bounty playing into the hands of the Tobacco Combine, it is sufficient merely to mention the word &#34; combine &#34; to draw certain honorable senators. I say that a bounty on cigar leaf of high quality will play into the hands of the small cigar manufacturers, rather than into the hands of the Combine. The Combine are at present in a position to buy locally or import in very large quantities, whilst the small manufacturers must be content with such quantities as they can pay for from time to time. But if this high-class leaf can be produced in Australia there will always be a source of supply at the command of the small manufacturers of cigars. It is known that these men go in largely for the manufacture of the best quality of hand-made cigars. The Tariff gives a preference to hand-made cigars which will be an incentive to small manufacturers to undertake their manufacture. Cigar-makers will be able to make these cigars in their own homes, and if by the payment of the small bounty here proposed we can insure the growth of a leaf suitable for the manufacture of high-class hand-made cigars, we shall be doing something, not in the interests of the (Combine, though they will reap a certain amount of advantage no matter what we do, but in the interests of hundreds of cigarmakers who, if they had the material at hand, would be able to start the manufacture of high-class cigars on their own account).It is for that reason that I am prepared to support the item. </para>

I direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that in the annual report of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock for the year 1906-7, there is a report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> S. Nevill, the official instructor in tobacco growing. At page 92, of the report, it will be found that on the subject of &#34;Cigar Tobacco,&#34; and that is the tobacco dealt with in this item, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> says - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>We have progressed&#39; far enough with our efforts to stimulate the production of cigar tobacco to have every confidence in its future. The prices realized have yielded an average of something like &#163;60 per acre, and there is now a prospect of several farming centres becoming principally tobacco-growing. If we succeed in producing as good an article as our efforts indicate, the tobacco will return handsome profits to growers for export, and they will not have to depend altogether upon local markets. In the &#39;meantime, the local demand will take all we can produce for several years to come, and at prices that will be more remunerative to the small farmer than any other crop he can grow. </para>

                <para class="block">I believe that in framing the Tariff, and in submitting this item, the Government have been, to a considerable extent, guided by the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill,</inline> who is recognised as absolutely the best authority on this subject in Australia at the present time. If he has laid down distinctly in his official report to his Department, written, be it remembered, before anything had been said about giving, bounties for the production of cigar leaf, that a good cigar leaf can be grown in Australia for export, there is no reason to suppose that any benefit accruing from the proposed bounty will go into the pockets of the Combine. </para>

That is the only point I wish to make at this stage, as the whole question&#39; was thoroughly threshed out before. </para>

Further than that, he is so optimistic that he says that, in all probability, markets will be found abroad for the tobacco leaf grown Sn Queensland. If the growers were doing that in Queensland with a Customs duty of  is.  6d. per lb., they ought to receive an additional stimulus now, because under the new Tariff they will get a protection of 2s. 6d. a lb. </para>

                            points out that it has been a success with a Customs duty of  is.  6d. a lb. If it has been a success with that duty, an additional protection of  is.  ought .to be sufficient. The statement that markets will be found abroad for cigar leaf of high quality makes one laugh. In the first place, every one free from bias knows that up to the present time the best- cigar leaf has been grown in Cuba. For many years attempts have been made in many parts of the world to grow a&#39; similar kind of leaf-, but so far they have not succeeded. If Australia can produce cigar leaf of a very high quality - and I do not say that it is impossible - there is in Australia an immense market for the leaf, without talking about finding a market abroad for it.

                        <para>- Where are they going to find abroad a market for Australian cigar leaf? We impose a Customs duty on cigars for two reasons - first, for revenue purposes ; and, secondly, to protect Australian workmen against over-worked and poorly-paid labourers in other parts of the world. In most countries tobacco leaf is grown by coloured men, who work long hours, and whose wages are very small. Yet we are told by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> that if we grow tobacco leaf in Australia under white-labour conditions - reasonable hours and decent wages - it will be of such high quality that we can compete with countries which have been engaged in the industry for many years. </para>

                        <para>- I have argued in favour of the White Australia policy, and at times it has been proved that white labour is cheaper than coloured labour. But I have not made the general statement that, in every sense and direction, white labour is cheaper than coloured labour. I have merely made these remarks in reply to the evidence tendered by Air. Nevill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has stated that if this encouragement is given to the tobacco-growers, it will be a help, so to speak, to the men who are making cigars to-day under a <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> licence from the Commonwealth. If their opinion is worth anything, _ they want the best leaf, and the best cigars are those which they make from imported leaf. I have not yet heard any one say that Australian leaf is of a quality suitable for the making of cigars. Whilst I am anxious at all times to encourage Australian industries, especially primary industries, I am guided to a very large extent on this occasion by men who know more about the matter than I do. They say that in Australia the elements are not favorable to the production of high-class leaf. They admit that leaf suitable for pipe smoking can foe grown here. We know that the pipe tobacco is not of the finest quality, because if it were, less imported leaf, and more Australian leaf, would be used. According to the statistics the manufacture of tobacco from Australian leaf is on the decrease. I would not have risen but for the statements in the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> to the Queensland Government.  His  opinions are altogether too optimistic, and, in my judgment, ought not to be taken too seriously. </para>

                    <para>. - I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> the possibility, of an export trade in tobacco leaf. He has recognised that it is very difficult to grow tobacco leaf of the highest quality, and he has said that, so far, Cuba is the only country in which it can be grown. Consequently, whatever kind of labour may be employed, Cuba has a market all over the world&#39; for its leaf. If by means of a bounty we can develop the production of tobacco leaf equal or, possibly, superior to that raised in Cuba, we shall, no matter what kind of labour we employ, have_ a market all over the world. That, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> suggests, is impossible, because he has had from experts in the trade- a declaration that there never has been produced here a leaf sufficiently good for making cigars of medium quality, and because there never has been, therefore there never can be. I remind him that things which are common-place now had, at their initiation, to stem the tide of the declaration that it was impossible to produce them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that it is not sufficient. I hold that up to the present time it has not attracted sufficient attention. My view is that protection means completely shielding. I believe in a protection that will protect. I am not frightened by percentages if the object sought can be achieved in the interests of the Commonwealth. I urge that no harm can be done if the tobacco leaf is not produced. If the bounty is not earned, no one is injured, and if contrary to our expectations, contrary to the probabilities, we should develop the production of tobacco leaf equal or superior to even that which can be produced in other parts of the world, what an enormous advantage it would be to this community. Therefore, to use a sporting phrase, it is &#34; all to nothing.&#34; If we succeed, it is an immense advantage, and if we fail no harm is done to anybody. </para>

                    <para>-  It appears to me that the only evidence upon which the bounty is based is that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill.</inline> He has had a large experience in the growing of tobacco leaf. For many years he has been experimenting, and, according to the evidence given before the Tobacco Commission, he has been very successful. The reasons which he gave why superior cigar leaf can be grown appear to me to be more theoretical than practical. For the last five years he has had an opportunity to grow cigar leaf on the State Experimental Farm, which he  controls in Queensland. He has had every means placed at his disposal by the State Government to apply his practical knowledge to the production of cigar leaf. He could have made a practical test of the wisdom of giving further encouragement to the industry. The States Tobacco Company, I believe, manufacture one-half of the cigars which are made in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Whether made by machine or by hand they are cigars, and I assume that the bounty, if sanctioned, will be paid upon the production of cigar leaf, whether it is to be treated by machinery or by hand. Every one must realize that the States Tobacco Company would be greatly advantaged if cigar leaf could be grown in Australia. They have not only expressed the opinion that it could be grown here, but, at very considerable expense, they have encouraged its growth. On a farm at Cairns, and at a salary of ^400 a year, they have employed a gentleman to make experiments, but so far have not succeeded. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacobs</inline> states that Dixson&#39;s have spent ^30,000 on experiments in the growth of a superior class of tobacco and have tried to the best. of their ability to encourage the growers in other parts of the State, as well as in the northern parts of Queensland, where it was believed that these tobaccos could be grown. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curran,</inline> an expert who was brought directly from America to give the benefit of his knowledge to the tobacco-growers, stated that the Australian leaf is lacking in aroma and flavour. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> also expressed the opinion that, so far, Australian leaf has not been grown equal to the imported leaf as regards flavour. I am not a smoker, but I take it that flavour is one of the essentials in relation to tobacco. If the leaf could be successfully grown here it stands to reason that the manufacturers would be willing to purchase it at a good price rather than import their leaf. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> states that good leaf can be grown in Australia, and although he has been experimenting for many years, he has not yet completely  succeeded. It is questionable whether leaf can be grown in a commercial sense. </para>

                        <para>- The money should be applied to the encouragement of industries which we have good reason to believe will be permanent. I have from the first contended that instead of paying these peddling little bounties, it would be better 10 devote the whole of the money proposed to be spent in this way to the building of our own torpedo boats. It&#39; would be far more advantageous to do that than to pay bounties to industries as to which there is no prospect of stability. I decline to vote  money  &#39;to be placed in the hands of irresponsible people, who will be likely to spend it without regard to whether the industries which it is hoped to establish will be permanent. As to the Combine benefiting materially from the bounty, I think every one realizes that such will  be  the case. But that in itself is not a danger that I should consider for a moment. If the industry in question could be  fairly  expected to have a prospect of being established, I should not care where the money went. But I do not think that there is any likelihood of a permanent industry being established, and therefore I shall vote against the item. </para>

                    <para>. - I am rather astonished at the attitude taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray.</inline> He admits that it would be a good thing for the industry of growing cigar tobacco to be added to those which we already have in the Commonwealth. But he appears to have come to the conclusion that it is impossible to grow good cigar leaf in Australia, and that therefore there is no need to attempt if. No doubt this industry has been established in Australia in a more or less ineffective fashion for a number of years. But during the last few years a complete change has taken place in the taste of the people of Australia in relation to tobacco. . A few years ago only strong, rank, black tobaccoes  were grown and consumed- When the taste of the people altered, light tobaccoes were more in demand. Consequently, the growth pf the Australian article fell off. The growers are only now getting into the way of producing the lighter classes of leaf. The industry may therefore be said to be in a sense in its beginning. I think it desirable to afford encouragement to the growth of cigar leaf. If we do no more than improve the quality of our ordinary tobaccoes &#60;ve shall do something for the benefit&#39; of the industry. I should not like to say whether we shall ever be able to produce a leaf equal to that grown in Cuba. That could only be determined by experience and experiment. In any case, it is worth trying. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">We cannot Jose very much on an experiment of this kind, and if we succeed we shall produce a commodity which, has a world-wide market. &#39; Some honorable senators seem to be afraid that any bounty which may be paid will ultimately find its way into the pockets of the Combine. I went very closely into this matter during the time when the Tobacco Commission was sitting, and came to the conclusion that the more tobacco we grow in Australia, the more we cut down the power of the Combine. While all the tobacco consumed has to be imported, the Combine can beat any other competitor out of the field.. But if tobacco leaf is grown in Australia, a number of other manufacturers will enter into the market, competing with the Combine, and thus destroying its power. So that&#39; if we really desire to clip the wings of the Combine, the best way of doing that is to encourage, bv all means in our power, the growth of leaf in Australia. That is what it is proposed to do bv means of the bounty now under consideration. </para>

                <para class="block">The ratio of the cost of making cigars by machinery to the cost of making them by hand is, according to the same witness, about 1 to 8. He states, that it costs about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;j</inline> 10s. to make 150,000 cigars by machinery, as against &#163;62 10s. to make the same quantity by hand. Therefore, in that case, as in every other branch of industry, the machine must necessarily knock out the competition, of hand labour. It has been stated here that hand-made cigars are superior to machine-made. While thin witness mav not be an authority on tobacco growing, he. is at least an authority on cigar manufacture and public taste, and he gives the following evidence on the subject of public taste with regard to hand-made as against machine-made cigars - </para>

                    <para>There is a wonderful difference between a hand-made and a block, or machine-made, cigar. The best cigars made in the world are 1-lavanas, and they are made entirely by hand. </para>

                <para class="block">But that statement does not vitiate the fact that he had a doubt as to the relative merits of the two cigars. That evidence entirely destroys the objection that has been raised to machine-made cigars on account of their inferiority. That manufacturer, engaged in the hand-making process, does not lean, as one would naturally expect him to do, to his own particular class of trade, which makes his evidence all the more valuable when he expresses a doubt as to the merits of the two classes of cigars, and adds that the general &#39;public are not able to tell the difference. I do not wish to vote against the item on general grounds, but the very liberal protection which is to be bestowed upon the industry of the growth of cigar leaf in Australia should be -ample for all purposes. There are further reasons in the monopoly of cigar-making machinery by, and the steady falling of the trade into the hands of, the Combine. &#39; It it unnecessary to argue that any corporation with command of capital, and, consequently, command of machines, can oust from competition every small man who is using primitive methods of production in the trade. I am not so foolish as to argue against the use of machinery, but I am arguing against the folly of paying public money which will eventually find its way into the hands of people who have already too much cash. That would be altogether against the principle of the Bill, which is that the money must be paid directly and without diversion to the primary producers of the commodities specified. I have given the Bill a rather liberal&#39; support so far, but I absolutely refuse to sanction the payment of the taxpayers&#39; money for the purpose of greasing the already fat pig. </para>

                    <para>. - I believe that the arguments which have been used, based .on the evidence of the witness quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> really strengthen the position put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> who pointed out that, at present, the&#39; small manufacturers are unable to obtain their raw material except through the Combine. That witness, in all probability, has to buy his raw material from the very Combine with which he is competing. Practically, none of the small manufacturers are indenting at present. I know two or three of them, and their difficulty is that they are unable to obtain small quantities of leaf on the market, but have to go to the Combine for leaf for wrappers, fillers, &#38;c, and must take whatever the Combine chooses to sell them. If we can demonstrate by the expenditure of a limited amount of public money the fact that cigar . leaf can be grown in Australia, the small man will always then be able to buy in the market small quantities of the material that he requires. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that point directly. The encouragement &#39;of the growth of leaf capable of being manufactured into good cigars will place the small manufacturer in a better position than he is in to-day. He will have to compete with the Combine in the market for the material, but he will not be absolutely at the mercy of the Combine, as he is now, before he can get any material at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gray</inline> asks why this has not been done before, and states that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> has been employed for a number of years in Queensland, but has not yet demonstrated that it is possible to grow this leaf on a commercial basis. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> was engaged by the Queensland Government some time before Federation, because of the poor quality of the tobacco then being grown. The Government recognised that it was necessary to give growers the assistance of a man of experience, to induce them to cultivate a superior class of tobacco, and also to adopt different methods of curing the leaf. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> was engaged, and established a small Government farm at Texas, where he demonstrated to the growers what could be done in the way of superior production and preparation of the leaf. I was in- the district a couple of years ago, and some of the growers told me that they had received a great amount of assistance  from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill,</inline> who ha3 ha,d experience in the industry before he came to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- In the first place no one has contended that the country about Texas is good country for the growth of cigar leaf. It is suitable for the growth of tobacco, and a considerable area in that district is devoted to its culture, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nevill</inline> has never said that it is good country for cigar leaf. He has endeavoured to induce settlers at different places along the coast - at Cairns, Cardwell, and Bowen - to try if they could not make a success of the growth of a leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars. Some time ago he induced one or two men at Cardwell to undertake the growth of -cigar leaf. I believe that he also induced some men at Nerang to go in for its cultivation. One man planted a few acres, and a manufacturer of cigars in a small way told me that leaf he got from that district was the best local cigar leaf that he had so far been able to obtain in Australia. If the men who have been induced bv the experts to experiment in the production of a leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars find that they can secure a good price for the leaf which they produce, they will extend their operations. In the Bowen district a man who was induced to go in for the growing of a high class cigar leaf produced leaf for which he got is. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- That does not follow. When it is demonstrated that a leaf of good quality can. be grown in small patches, the Government may well be asked to afford some additional assistance to encourage its cultivation. Those who undertake the cultivation of such a leaf will then be aware that if they succeed they will have a market at a certain price, and if they can produce a still better leaf, it will command a higher price in the market. I propose to quote from the report of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock. I do not care about mentioning Queensland so prominently in connexion with this matter, but it is the only State of which I have special knowledge. I do not know what is being done in connexion with the tobacco industry in New South Wales or the other States, except from reading the report of the Tobacco Commission. </para>

                    <para>The special tobacco experiments carried out last year, and fully reported on, were not repeated in the season just closed. The tobacco obtained - of the cigar variety - was very favorably reported on however, and these experiments have amply demonstrated that with judicious working an excellent . quality of cigar tobacco can be grown in the north. As a result, therefore, it has been decided that a practical experiment on a reasonably large scale shall be conducted, for which purpose an area of seven acres of selected land is being fenced in on the banks of the Barron River, and arrangements made for a. tobacco curing shed to be erected under the direction of the tobacco expert of the Department. </para>

The land has only just been  fenced in for the purpose of the experiment, but the manager of the State Nursery at Kamerunga has already grown tobacco of the cigar variety which has been very favorably reported on, and the experiments made at the nursery have demonstrated that tobacco can be grown there successfully. In the statistical part of the report I find this statement made - </para>

                <para class="block">I have no doubt that in other .States there is country as suitable for the growth of cigar leaf as that in Queensland, but when it has been practically demonstrated that we have soil and climate suitable for the production of this class of leaf the Government might well spend a limited amount of money to encourage people to go into the industry. Those who take it up must at first undertake a good deal of experiment, and cannot at once expect to produce the highest class of leaf. I understand that the bounty will only be paid on leaf of a fairly high quality. I think that our growers will be able with the advice of the experts to produce a cigar leaf of sufficiently high quality to earn the bounty, and that will be some inducement, to them not only to&#39; extend their operations, but to endeavour to make a commercial success of the cultivation of even a still better class of leaf. As we are prepared to assist people engaged in other industries, and we have people engaged in the industry of tobacco growing, there should be no objection to the proposed bounty as an experiment, to discover whether we cannot in some part of the Commonwealth &#39; grow a leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars. </para>

                        <para>- I have always understood that the best cigar leaf came from Cuba, but that does not prove that a good&#39; leaf suitable for the manufacture of cigars cannot be grown in other parts of the world. We do not know the possibilities of the  Commonwealth for the growth of cigar leaf, and I think the proposed bounty will induce local growers to endeavour to cultivate a better quality of leaf than they grow now. There is a world-wide market for tobacco. We have a high duty on the article, and it would be to our interest te*  induce local growers to cultivate the quality of leaf on which it is proposed to pay a bounty. I hope that the Committee will pass the item. I am sure that it is being supported by honorable senators in the conscientious belief that a better class of tobacco leaf can be grown in Australia, and that its production will be a benefit not merely to one section but to everybody in the community. I believe that, if the experiment is a success, the bounty will be the means of settling a large number of persons upon the soil. </para>

                    (New South Wales) &#91;12.31&#93;. - With reference to the cigar trade, I have some rather interesting and. instructive information which I think it is pertinent for me to quote as showing the necessity for .material alteration&#39;s in the existing conditions, and one of those alterations, I take it, the proposal before the Committee will effect. The figures I am about to quote have been supplied by the Department of Trade and Customs. It appears that last year we collected &#163;116,000 on  imported cigars, and &#163;40,000 on colonial-made cigars. As regards the consumption of cigars, the proportions were about equal. While the cigars made in the Commonwealth paid &#163;&#34;40,000 in Excise duty, an equal quantity of imported cigars paid &#163;116,000 in Customs duty, showing a difference of &#163;76,000 against the revenue. Assuming that there had been no colonial-made cigars, and people had smoked an equal quantity of imported cigars, it would mean that for a single year the cigar industry had cost the Commonwealth &#163;76,000. That is rather a tall price to pay for the luxury of smoking colonial cigars,&#39; and would be, .1 understand, sufficient to buy out every colonial -made cigar factory in Australia. Therefore, we could buy them out. with the loss of one year&#39;s revenue, and be in pocket at the end of that time.- One of the reasons why the colonial_cigar has been- very largely a failure is the fact that hitherto appropriate leaf for its manufacture has not been grown.

                        <para>- I am not sure, so that I cannot answer the question. But I am instructed that one of the .reasons) for the unsatisfactory condition of the local tirade is that a really good cigar leaf, has not yet been produced in Australia. The present proposal is made with a view &#34;to assisting the production of suitable leaf. As a majority of us have voted for a bounty upon the production of a number of articles, I think I should not be justified in voting against this proposal, because it certainly does promise the possibility of success and offers conditions more appropriate to Australian environment than do some of the proposals with which we have been dealing. </para>

                        <para>- The honor-, able senator asked a question, but does not wish to  hear  my answer. Whether it is that he asked the question, which he now recognises was an undesirable one, or he is afraid that the answer may be too effective, I do not know. I think I can accommodate him by not answering the question, though I could give a very good answer if it were needful. I think that a lower bounty upon the production of tobacco leaf would be desirable and more reasonable, but at this stage of the Bill I do not propose to move* an amendment to reduce the rate, because, in the first place, it would lead to a great consumption of time, and, secondly, because I do not think it would be carried. But because I cannot reduce the rate of bounty, I am not going to vote against the proposal <inline font-style="italic">in toto,</inline> as I regard the culture of tobacco leaf as one of the few industries in Australia for which bounties are proposed that give a promise of success. </para>

                        <para>. - Prior to the debate being adjourned last Friday, we listened to a speech from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> who, as you are aware, sir, is the present  President  of the Senate. Now I shall venture, before proceeding to address myself to the Bill, to offer some remarks, not only upon the substance of that speech, but also upon the manner and the circumstances in which it was delivered. In my opinion and I believe I am expressing the opinion of many other honorable senators, though they may not have openly declared it, such an exhibition as we had then - a speech from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> who at the same time was  President  of the Senate, delivered in a partisan spirit from the Presidential chair - was not conducive, either to the dignity of the Senate itself, or to the possibility of the proper and decorous conduct of our proceedings. The position is this: The  speaker  addressed nobody, whereas we have to address the  President.  He was subject to no one who could call him to order, as every other senator is when he addresses the Senate. The position might have become absolutely intolerable. A repetition of such an occurrence would, I venture to say, do more to demoralize and disorganize the Senate than any procedure that any one of us can imagine. I therefore have no hesitation! in expressing my opinion, openly and clearly, that not only was such a procedure unwarranted and unwise, but that we ought, if necessary to take absolutely certain measures to prevent a repetition of it. Now, I shall venture to offer some criticisms upon the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> apart from the circumstances under which he delivered them.  His  one contention with regard to this Bill was that we were being asked to treat the persons or combinations who might come under its operation as if they were criminals.  His  whole argument was based upon a confusion between civil and criminal law. Running through it was the continual question. &#34; Would you ask a man in a Criminal Court to give such answers to questions as might incriminate him ? &#34; He instanced the case of a man charged with murder, and appeared to imagine that it would be wrong to treat a person charged with an offence under this Bill as a man charged with an offence under the criminal law would not be permitted to be treated. But there is a very broad distinction which entirely differentiates the two classes of cases. I can conceive of no more fallacious argument being addressed to any Legislative Chamber.  We were reminded, as a parallel to this, of provisions to be found in our Customs Act. Now, I venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> will recognise that between procedure under the Customs Act and criminal procedure in an ordinary Court of law there is an enormous difference. The same difference applies with equal force and intensity to the present Bill, and to the cases of persons who would be penalized under it. I may as well say at once that my one desire is to strengthen the hands pf the Government in this matter, and if I offer any criticism upon the Bill, it will only be with that object. If any attention is paid to my criticism, T hope it will be understood that it is intended to make the power of the Government stronger. Possibly I may be wrong in what I say, but, at any rate, that is my desire. </para>

You made an assumption before I had concluded the sentence.. I do not wish to pursue that point any further. When I was interrupted I was dealing with the parallel between the Customs Act and the present Bill. Parliament has deliberately decided - and every one of us agreed that it was right to do so - that in order that the Customs Act maybe properly administered powers must be given to the authorities in excess of the powers which are given in other Acts of Parliament. That is an elementary principle &#39;in connexion with Customs administration. </para>

                            <para>- It applies, not merely in Australia, but all over the world. We may have our various points of view as to how the Customs Act should be administered, but that is beside the question of the power to be conferred upon the Customs authorities. That such powers should be given, I do not think is disputed by. any sane man inside or outside Parliament. To what extent does that parallel hold good in this case? It holds good entirely. Am I to assume that while we give power to the Customs authorities to deal with the importation of goods, we are going to deny to the authorities within the Commonwealth itself an equal power to deal with manufacturers who carry on operations locally? At any rate, that is a position which no one who occasionally professes free-trade . principles ought to support. The only remark which I have to offer with regard to the administration of this Bill, and especially as to the powers proposed to be given to the Comptroller-General, is that I think we -should carry out our desires more effectively if we intrusted the powers to a Court. I am going to support the Government, and, as I said before, shall endeavour to strengthen their position. We have put our hands to the plough in regard to these trusts and combines. We cannot afford as a Parliament to allow our legislation to be ignored. We cannot afford to allow ourselves to be told that  Ave  are unable to control these bodies. And there is practically no limit to  which  I am not prepared to go in the effort to get them under our control. But the question arises - Shall  we  do it by intrusting these powers,  which  are parallel to the powers conferred under the Customs Act, to the Comptroller-General ? At present. I have doubts about that. I am inclined to think that if we were to intrust these powers to a Court of law, they would probably be more effective. And for this reason : We all admit that in the administration of justice - and that is what we&#39; are pursuing at the present time- we shall be more likely to achieve our ends if we intrust the responsibility to the best possible men that we can obtain for the purpose. We are, therefore, forced to this conclusion : Would such an Act be more effective if enforced by a Court of law or by the Comptroller-General of Customs? In other words, would it not be better to intrust it to those men who are trained and equipped so as to fit them for discharging such duties, who possess our greatest confidence, and as to whose purity of motive in the carrying out of such legislation there can be no suspicion? Personally, I have no doubt about it. The Comptroller-General of Customs is not, from this point of view, a more highly skilled man than is a Justice of the High Court. I feel that if we were to empower the Court, just as it is proposed under this Bill to empower the Comptroller-General, we should be likely to achieve far more satisfactory results. The Court is absolutely unimpeachable, so far as its integrity is concerned. I cast no slur upon the present Comptroller-General, nor do I suggest any doubt as to officers who may in future hold that position, but I feel that if these powers were intrusted to a Judge of the High Court, we should have an absolute guarantee of the rigorous as well as the honest administration of the measure. I am well aware that so far there has not been the slightest suspicion with regard to the administration of the Customs Act. There have been no reflections upon its administration since this Parliament has been established; but. nevertheless, I think that the suggestion.I have made is worthy of consideration. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to add one other parallel as to the respective positions of the Comptroller-General and the Judges of the High Court. When we give the Comptroller-General power with regard to Customs administration, it is recognised that he has to deal daily with a multiplicity of detail, and that his work never ends. For that reason, it is obviously desirable that such a permanent official should be invested with extensive powers. But when we come to deal with this anti-trust legislation, which has for its object interference with large trusts and. combines whenever they are to be found doing anything illegal, it must be obvious to the Minister that the over-looking by some responsible person cannot be of daily occurrence, and that investigations into the wrongful acts of those trusts and combines must be on a large scale and occur only at long intervals. I hope that the Minister, if it is possible to amend . the Bill, will so amend it that, while he gives to the Comptroller- General this power, he will also bring in the Court to strengthen the Comptroller-General. </para>

                            <para>- No. I am not going to be a party to weakening this measure in any way whatever. I am sure that  the Vice-President of the Executive Council recognises that in any suggestion or criticism of mine, my only desire is to strengthen the Bill. I think it might possibly be strengthened by giving fuller powers to the Court, as well as these additional and comparatively unusual powers to the Comptroller-General. If that cannot be done as a matter of practical politics, I am not going to quarrel with the Bill. If it can be done, I shall cordially join with the Vice-President of the Executive Council in adding that strength to the measure. I wish to add a word as to the desirability of the Bill generally. We all recognise that these trusts are in existence in Australia to-day. I know of two - the Tobacco Combine and the Shipping and Coal Combine - that I should like to see controlled and regulated at once. No intelligent observer of public affairs in Australia can have any doubt that we are confronted there with two evils which require legislative interference and regulation. If it is incumbent upon any persons in this Senate to endeavour to put down these combines in Australia, it is incumbent upon those who sit on this side of the Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- I do not need to assume that they are doing an injustice. I know it. I have made up my mind about the -injustice. If I were not so sure of my ground, I should not be speaking in this way in regard to the Bill. There is every reason why honorable senators sitting on this side should co-operate with the Government in this case, and not leave the Government alone for a moment, if they have any fear that the Government are not doing their utmost to deal with trusts and combines. I am sorry, in a sense, that on the other side of the Chamber there is a feeling that legislation of this sort is comparatively useless. But I credit honorable senators opposite, no matter what their views are with regard to the nationalization of industries, with sincerity in attempting to cope with the evil now. I firmly believe that,&#39; although some of them may feel very doubtful with regard to the possibilities of this legislation, they are not going to relax their efforts to enable the Senate to pass such an amendment of the existing Act as will be operative and successful. I hope, and, so long as I am in the Senate I shall endeavour to bring that hope to its fruition, that the Bill will have a decisive and valuable effect for the good of Australia in the direction in which, it is&#62; aimed. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has anticipated one very important comment which I intended to make. I agree most cordially that honorable senators who belong to the Labour Party are entitled to the frankest approbation for the warmth of their support of this measure, recognising, as they do, that if these combines and trusts succeed, great force will be added to the arguments for the nationalization of the industries concerned, which they are constantly urging. They are content that in the meantime those organizations should be controlled, and, if they can be effectively controlled by legislation&#39; of this character, then, no doubt, the complete fruition of the aim of the members of that party will be delayed. In those circumstances, their support of the measure is entitled to the highest commendation. But the attitude of honorable senators opposite, with two or three exceptions, simply amazes me. If they are in earnest - and I am sure they are - in saying that they desire the promotion of the public good, and that they recognise in the development of combinations of this character a serious menace to the Commonwealth, they should&#39; be amongst the most vigorous supporters of any legislation which has for its object the proper regulation and effective control of those organizations, whose development, if we. are to be guided by the experience of another country, must be alarmingly serious to the public welfare. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator agrees to it in such a way that he would practically maim the Bill. I appreciate, also, another suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> in his whole-souled support of the measure. He is not prepared to weaken the powers which it is proposed to give to the Comptroller-General. If we are to achieve the object of the measure, it is of&#34; the utmost importance that the greatest freedom and power should be intrusted to&#39; an officer in. whom we have confidence to carry out his duty in the interests of the &#39; public. I quite appreciate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator demon&#39;s</inline> desire that there should be an alternative means of achieving the same end, so as&#39; to provide for the contingency-  of laxity on the part of the Comptroller-General. Fortunately, we have had experience of that officer in. the discharge of his duties, which enables us to. anticipate with some confidence that the duties which we propose to impose on him will be carried out with the utmost integrity. In these circumstances, realizing the difficulty of giving effect to the suggestion which has been made, all that I can say at this stage is that it is entitled to the  fullest consideration. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> would place it within the power of any person, with the consent of a Judge of the High Court, to exercise the powers of inquiry which are, by proposed new section 15 a of clause 4 of the Bill, to be reposed in the Comptroller-General. That is an important suggestion, the object of which is to provide for a contingency, which I trust may never arise. In other words, if the Comptroller-General happens to be under Ministerial or other control, it should, it is suggested, be open to any member of the general public whose suspicions are aroused .with regard to any combine or trust to go to a Judge o: the High Court and produce <inline font-style="italic">-Arima facie</inline> evidence that an offence is being committed. Then the Judge should have power to authorize such inquiries as he thought proper to be made, with a view to sheeting home the offence. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not exaggerate. Several honorable senators opposite distinctly mentioned the Judges of the High Court. They may &#39; be scattered, but altogether apart from that difficulty, it must be seen that inquiries of this character may be made from all sorts of sources. They will probably have to be prosecuted with great cafe and secrecy, and, if what we seek to achieve is to be effective, we must repose in the Comptroller-General the fullest- powers, with the confidence that he will not abuse them. In the event of any abuse, those who know what has occurred can complain to Parliament, or to any member of it, and the matter can be ventilated in either Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- In no circumstances can the Government regard with equanimity any suggestion to shackle the .powers of the Comptroller- General in the way so freely suggested bv honorable senators opposite, when &#34;they urge that . the Comptroller-General should be required to go to a Judge of the Court &#39; and  make  out a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case to satisfy the Judge before he is allowed to prosecute inquiries. That might involve considerable delay and a degree of publicity. The matter might be bruited abroad, and thus the object we have in view might be frustrated. Why should honorable senators opposite be so apprehensive when they must know that what we propose is the only recognised method of making legislation of this kind effective? I have pointed out the extraordinary powers given in America to the Commerce Commission, where, in connexion with carriers they have the right to prescribe the method of bookkeeping to be adopted, to make any inquiry they think proper, to obtain answers on oath to any questions they choose to ask, and where there is the most ample provision for  publicity </para>

                            <para>- Take the Commissioner of the Bureau of Corporations. He is given the power to demand from any corporation  all the information he thinks proper. He has the right to prescribe how these combinations shall keep their accounts, that they shall, record every agreement, contract, or arrangement they make, and they are bound to supply all the information that he demands of them. The result of this legislation in America has been the conviction and punishment of a trust of gigantic proportions, which previously had been successful in evading the law. My honorable friends who are opposing this Bill must not jump to the. conclusion that if we give these powers to the Comptroller-General of Customs, some extraordinary abuse must follow which is unknown in the history of the exercise of similar powers, in the States and in the Commonwealth. </para>

This class of legislation is vital to the administration of the Customs Act. From personal experience of the working of the Customs Department, and from the experience of others who know much more on the subject than I do, I am satisfied that were it not for the application of these powers a large percentage of the convictions which have been recorded under the Customs Act would never have been secured and many criminals would have escaped punishment. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the&#39; kind. Everything under this Bill must be relative to a particular offence, and the offences are prescribed by sections 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 of what is known as our Anti-Trust Act. As a matter of fact, there is only one provision in this Bill against which what I may be forgiven for describing as genuine criticism has been urged. I refer to the proposed new section, which deals with the burden of proof and which can only have been objected to, as the  President  conclusively pointed out, by honorable senators who have not read it. If honorable senators will refer to that provision they will see that what is proposed is that where it is alleged that there is a certain trust or combination and that certain persons are interested in it - </para>

                            <para>- I am endeavouring to give honorable senators some idea of the character of the averments that the defendant may be called upon to refute. For instance, it may be alleged that a certain trading organization is a trust or combine within the meaning of the Act, that the defendant belonged to it, and that he acted with or in connexion with it, without proving other members who belonged to it. If allegations of this kind are made, the onus is thrown upon the defendant of proving that they are not true. In America, in nearly all of the States, the law goes so far as to say that - </para>

Some honorable senators seem to ignore &#39;the marvellous ingenuity displayed by these trusts in evading the law. .1 am certain that no matter what legislation we pass, if the experience of America is repeated here, we shall find that every species of ingenuity will be exercised to evade it, and it will then be the duty of Parliament to relentlessly follow up its legislation year by year, if necessary, in order ultimately to secure the regulation and control of these trusts. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the kind. To show how eminently fair is the provision which has aroused the indignation of certain honorable senators, let me say that intent is the essence of an offence against the anti-trusts law, and in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the proposed new section 15a, the onus is thrown upon the prosecution of proving intent. There really has been no genuine criticism urged against this measure, and, in the circumstances, I ask honorable senators to pass it in its present form. I promise to consider the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> as to an alternative means of strengthening the Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - The Sydney Chamber of Commerce have supplied me with some objections to this clause, which I propose to read. I will then see whether we cannot induce the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who is, as a rule, a reasonable man, to consent to a modification of it. The proposed new section 15a is so repugnant to justice, they say, that it should be excised. They point out that the complaint dealt with in the proposed new section 15c should be made on oath or statutory declaration. And they suggest that an addition should be made to the proposed new section 15b dealing with the impounding of documents, to the following effect - and until such certified copy shall be furnished, such person or corporation shall be allowed full inspection of any such books and documents during all business hours, and at such other times as the Comptroller-General may in his discretion allow. </para>

It is nonsense for the honorable senator to make such an assertion. It is not creditable to his, high sense of intelligence and experience. I intend to vote against the provision. </para>

                        <para>- The exceptions are so very few as only to more deeply emphasize the general correctness and acceptation of the principle. The reason for the exception in the case of mines is a most obvious one. A manager is responsible for the conduct of a mine, and if an accident happens, it is his duty to show that he was in no way responsible for its occurrence, so that the position in that case is very different from the position in this case. Again, if a ship runs on a rock her captain is called upon to prove that it was not owing to his negligence that she went out of her course on t&#169; the rock. </para>

If the principle laid down in this provision were applied in that case, I would be haled before the Police Court, the accusation would be read out to me, and the Court would say, &#34; You robbed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> of &#163;100 in Bourke-street on such a date&#34;.

                        <para>- What does it Sn\ f If I were haled up on that accusation, the burden of proving that I was not guilty  would  lay upon me. It would be extremely difficult for me to prove that I was not guilty, unless I could show that at the time mentioned I was not in the company of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> but somewhere else, and that circumstances pointed strongly to the impossibility of my having committed such an offence. But let me assume that on that day I was down the street in the company of the honorable senator when he was robbed, and that I had an opportunity of stealing from him. Just imagine what a position I should be placed in, and how difficult it would be for me to prove t*t I did not take the money out of his pocket. The ridiculousness of the situation appears clearly when I state the case from that point of view. Everybody recognises that it would be exceedingly difficult, if I were treated in that fashion, to prove, if I were called upon to do so, that I had not committed a certain offence. But a number of honorable senators, apparently, do not see that when the same principle is applied to a combine, it is just as far from being right as it would be in my case. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator mean to insinuate that the possession of friends and money can protect men who violate the law against the consequences of the law? If so, it is a serious attack upon our system of justice. I do not believe a word of it, though I do believe that if people have plenty of money, they can delay the course of justice. But when an accusation of having broken the law is made against a combine, it is not right that it should be held to be guilty until it proves its innocence. </para>

                        <para>- A single individual may be at the he.ad of such a business just as easily as a dozen individuals. He may be like the thirteen rats that got into the barn, and ate each other up until only one was left. I plead with honorable senators not to subvert the principles of justice with which our system of jurisprudence has hitherto .been associated, simply because they find that combines are difficult to con-&#39; trol. We have heard much about the authority of the Customs. But surely a dis.pute about a small matter of  duty  cannot be placed upon the same level as a question of this character. It is right and proper that the Comptroller-General should be given authority to decide in trivial matters having relation to the payment of duty. He has power to demand the production- of invoices, is able to follow the goods, and is given all the powers that are necessary to enable him to administer the law. That is a very much better arrangement than the one which previously held good, whereby an offender might be invited into the private room of the Minister of Trade and Customs and might settle his difficulty there without publicity. It is extremely undesirable that a great number of the cases that arise under our Customs legislation should be brought before the Court. But because we clothe the Comptroller-General of Customs with certain powers of that character in matters which affect individuals only, is it therefore desirable that in great matters of national importance we should clothe him with the same powers&#39;? No reason has been shown for departing from one of the foundation axioms of justice that every accused person shall be held to be innocent until proved to be guilty. Why should we drag the members of a combine into Court and say, &#34; Certain charges are made against you, and unless you can prove your innocence we shall impose a penalty upon you&#34; ? It  reminds me of a chapter out of ancient history. I have read of times when individuals were haled before a Judge and accused of offences. They might be requested to confess, and if they refused they were put upon the rack until they did, when the reward of the confession was, &#34; Ah ! you have admitted that you are a witch, and therefore you must be burnt at the stake.&#34; This is a revival of a system that I thought was dead and buried, and done with for ever. </para>

I suppose he wishes to have a nutter, or to do something, or at least to appear to be doing something. In our anxiety to do even the very best thing, we ought never to depart from certain principles, which have been laid down as right and just from time immemorial. Suppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was put in the dock and accused of murder, and the Judge said to him, &#34; Prove your innocence.&#34; Would he not say, &#34;Let the accuser prove me guilty &#34;? Every man and woman would support him in doing so ; and if any Judge attempted to act in the manner I have indicated, Australia would ring &#34; from Dan to Beersheba&#34; with denunciations. Yet here is a proposal to do the same sort of thing with regard to combinations. I was very much surprised to hear the Vice-President of the Executive Council refer to combines as criminals. I cannot see that there is anything criminal in their action. </para>

The wind and the sunshine are each good or bad as they serve the purpose of the moment. The mere fact of the formation of a combine does not constitute an offence against the public.

Suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen, Senator Chataway,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger were three grocers in Bourke-street. Suppose they were competing so keenly that profits were reduced to vanishing point, that, instead of making money out of their business, they were losing, that they were under-paying their employes, not meeting their bills, that their bankers did not get their interest, and that their landlords were not receiving their rents. Suppose that, recognising the seriousness of the situation, they said, &#34; Why should we cut each other&#39;s throats; let us agree together,&#34; The result would probably be that their business would flourish, and they would make good profits. </para>

                        <para>- The trusts may be wicked, iniquitous, vile, diabolical, but that is no reason why the community should brand itself as of the same vicious character. We ought to give the members of a trust, however vile it may be, equal justice with every other citizen. Even if a man is seen by a dozen witnesses to commit murder in the light of open day, he must be charged  in proper form, and found guilty before he is sentenced. No man need think that I am an advocate of trusts, because I speak in this fashion. It would be very much more popular in certain circles to talk the other way. But I am laying before the Committee my ideas of the administration of justice. After all, our social system hangs together because of the sense of fair dealing which exists between man and man. But for that, it would fall asunder like a rock blasted by dynamite; confidence would be gone; man&#39;s faith in his brother man would disappear; society would dissolve- </para>

                        <para>- It is not an expedient to get evidence. The clause says &#34;in any prosecution.&#34; When you are prosecuting a combine, you are past the stage of getting evidence. The evidence must have been found and the charge made. The Government do not propose to rely upon the evidence that they have collected, but wish to say to the man in the dock, &#34; Unless you can prove yourself innocent you will be found guilty.&#34; The charge would be that something was being done in restraint of trade. How could any man prove that he was innocent of restraining trade or that he had done nothing to injure some Australian industry ? </para>

                        <para>- That shows how hollow the Bill is. The duty of a prosecution is to show not only that the act was committed, but that it was done with intent. To use again the illustration of the crime of murder, if I stab a man with intent to kill, him, that is murder in the first degree. But if I have a knife in my hand, and, by an accident, the knife runs into the man and kills him, that is not murder at all. It might not even be manslaughter. </para>

                    <para>. - I could see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> had not read the whole of the proposed new section 15 a, or had utterly misconceived its meaning. In prosecuting a trust for any of the offences under sections 4, 5, 7, 8, or 9 of the AntiTrust Act, a great number of preliminary things have to be proved. It has to be proved first of all that it is a trust or combination, that that trust or combination exists, that the defendant belongs to it, and that he has acted for or in connexion with it. We say that if those things are averred, they can be proved without proving all the members belonging to the trust, or proving or producing any article of agreement, or any written instrument upon which it may have been based. Those are preliminary features before you get at the real offence. Similar legislation exists in nearly every State of the American Union. So careful are we to avoid all the dire contingencies feared by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> that we say in this clause that - </para>

                <para>The honorable senator will see that the intention is the gravamen of the whole charge, and we simply provide in the proposed new section now under discussion that where intent is involved it is incumbent upon the prosecutor to prove the intent. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> must therefore see that he has been labouring under a serious misapprehension in the matter.

Could anything be more reasonable? Let me go even further to assure my honorable friend that we are not doing anything un-British or novel. I. will ask him to compare the proposed new section  15A  with section 255 of the Customs Act to which he agreed as essential to the . effective working of that Act. I shall ask the honorable senator then to admit that if such a section is essential to effectively deal with offenders against the Customs Act we are justified in making use of similar machinery to cope with the equally heinous offences dealt with in this Bill.

                    <para>. - I have heard as one of the arguments against the adoption of this provision the claim that it enters upon an entirely novel line of legislation: I am prepared to deal with that statement first of all on the assumption that it is correct, and then on the assumption that it is not correct. Let it be assumed that it is novel, and I say that the justification for it is that we are dealing with novel circumstances. The mere fact that there is not to-day in existence upon the statute-book of Australia or any other country, a particular law proves only that no special circumstances have arisen to call it into existence and to direct men&#39;s minds to the only means of coping with the evil of trusts and combines. No one would deny that these combinations  of capital are, comparatively speaking, later-day growths, the outcome of economic conditions seen operating in their full force only during late years. It is natural that as the evils of these combinations present themselves we must at some time or other reach the stage at which it is found  neces-   sary to take the first step in the direction, if honorable senators please, of experimental legislation to control them. That is dealing with the objection on the assumption that this is novel legislation. Let us see now whether it is novel. Surely honorable senators who make the statement overlook the provisions of the very Act which we are now engaged in amending. The Australian Industries Preservation Act itself assumes certain things to be proved. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will correct me if I am wrong, but I have no recollection that the honorable senator became eloquent and indignant when that measure was before the Senate. * Under that Act the allegation that a trust exists is taken as proved, but I do not remember the honorable senator protesting against that provision. He may have overlooked it, but unless he is prepared to admit that he gave his vote for the passage of the Australian Industries  Preservation Bill when it was before the Senate last year in entire ignorance of what it provided for he lays himself open to the charge of some inconsistency in the attitude which he takes up to-day. The principal Act, for instance, takes the averment that the defendant is a commercial trust to be proved. The mere fact that certain people have entered into combination .to some extent throws them out of the class of ordinary defendants and into the class of defendants who, if I may use the expression, stand guilty, or upon whom the onus of disproving the charge alleged against them is thrown. There are four classes of such defendants referred to in section 6 of the principal Act. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> did not protest &#39;against that provision how can he turn round to-day and invite honorable senators to throw out the provision embodied in this clause on the ground that it is novel, seeing that he helped to pass the principal Act, and we are to-day merely asking him to extend the same principle a little further. Let me direct the attention of the Committee to another matter. By agreeing to pass this proposed new section, we are not asked to say that any idle person who goes about the street is to .have it in Ins power to make a charge against people which would put them to serious inconvenience. -It begins with the words &#34; In any prosecution for an offence.&#34; It must be admitted that something will precede a prosecution. It is not competent for any man in the street to&#39; set the machinery of the law in motion merely because of some idle rumour. A certain procedure must be gone through, and the Attorney-General or the Comptroller-General must look into matters before a prosecution can be launched. We may take it for granted that there will be under this Bill no unrestrained liberty&#39; to beset certain classes of individuals. It will be recognised that there will have to be some careful inquiry into each matter before any prosecution is started. That is in itself a safeguard. I ask honorable senators to say what is the complaint we have been making against the Government lately ? It is not that they have been unduly meddling with or looking into the affairs of trusts generally. We have not charged them with any great anxiety to put the law into operation against these trusts. The complaint has been that the Government have been rather slow to move. Many of us, and myself amongst the number, have believed that the Government might have shown a little more energy and activity in trying to enforce the Anti-Trust Act. </para>

                        <para>- I do not hesitate to say that there is a coal combination in . existence in Australia to-day. The Minister has admitted that other combinations are engaging the attention of the officers of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department. As to whether or not they are transgressing the law, it is not for me to say. That is for the Law Courts to determine. All that a senator can do is to bring before the Senate and the Government cases which he thinks demand inquiry.  His  business ceases there. I was pointing out that the complaint against the Ministry has been that they have displayed a want of sincerity and a lack of energy in enforcing the existing law. That being so, when the Government ask for additional powers, which  1  may or may not think necessary, it ill becomes me to criticise them for doing nothing if, at the same time, I refuse to place them in a position to give effect to the law. Whilst I may believe that this Bill might have been drafted on different lines, I think it is the duty of the Government to carry out the policy of the law of Australia in this connexion, and we should give them all the reasonable power for which they ask to enable them to do it </para>

                    <para>. - Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was very properly directing attention to the drastic nature of the proposed new section  15a,  he was subjected to interjections intended to assure him that it was not so drastic, nor would it inflict so much injury as he anticipated. The Vice-President of the Executive Council asked to be allowed to give the honorable senator an explanation, and apparently the explanation has been considered satisfactory. It has no doubt made more or less clear points which might not have been clear to a layman, and which certainly required some explanation. I noticed that the Vice-President of the Executive Council seems to think, as do other honorable senators opposite, that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> had read on a little further and more closely, it was possible he would not have anticipated all the dire evils and gross injustices which he apprehended might be inflicted upon the mercantile community under the proposed new section. The Vice-President of the Executive Council asked the honorable senator to read a little further on, and directed his attention to some matters in a later part of the clause. I wish to take the honorable senator at his word, and I ask him to read a little further on. </para>

                        <para>- Notwithstanding the fact that very drastic powers were given in the principal Act, and it has not yet been tested in a Court of law, the Government are appealing . to Parliament for further powers. When one looks at the proposed new section  15a  it is apparent that the Government are asking for remarkably drastic powers. In his explanation to Senator Stewart, the Vice-President of the Executive Council pointed out as a justification for the provision the precedent that similar provisions are in force in the United States. I was anxious to hear from the honorable senator, whether exactly the same provisions as are comprised in the proposed new sections  15a  and  15b  are contained  in  any United States Act. </para>

                        <para>- On that point there may be a difference of opinion, but I think I am justified in pointing out that it is a most important provision. It affects any combination of persons engaged in trade whether good or bad, throughout the Commonwealth. We are clearly entitled to call upon the Government to prove the necessity for every provision in the Bill. For Ministers to preserve an attitude of either indifference or irritation suggests to me that they are conscious of some weakness in the administration of the principal Act. Notwithstanding the fact that trusts and combines have existed in the United States in a form which is without a parallel in the world&#39;s history, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> cannot tell us that in that country a, provision of this kind has been enacted. I take it that the Americans possess average intelligence, and are animated by the same desire to do a fair thing as we are. In that country, if we can give any credence to facts in connexion with trade and commerce which have been certified toby newspapers and magazines, there are trusts and combines which &#39;have been highly prejudicial to the interests of the public. </para>

From both points of view we are entitled to get from the other side the strongest possible reasons before we assent to the proposal. We are entitled to demand from the Government the strongest reasons why they need the drastic powers which are contained in the proposed new sections isa and 15B. With the large powers given to them in the principal Act. how is it that they have failed to deal with the alleged combinations? We have had nothing but the baldest statements from the other side. If the Government can give us an assurance that they have taken certain action in regard to alleged  combines or trusts, if they will indicate what they have done- </para>

The Committee is now dealing with a principle involved in one of the proposed amendments, and I ask the honorable gentleman to confine his remarks to that principle.

                        <para>- There certainly is, in my opinion, sufficient power under the existing law. When an Act has been passed with the greatest care to achieve a certain object, and when the Government say that it. is not sufficient, why should we be required to give them such additional powers as are contained in this proposed new section ? We have had no satisfactory explanation as to why the existing Act is insufficient. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to direct the attention of the Government to the great necessity, particularly in the newly developed agricultural areas of Western Australia, for extended postal facilities. While I and my colleagues have been treated most courteously by the Postmaster-General and his officers when we have brought requests before them, they have failed to recognise the different position in which the people of Western Australia are placed as compared with those of other States. A fast increasing population makes it necessary for that and other Departments to depart a little from red tape methods, and provide greater facilities than have been enjovyd in the past. The Midland Railway Company, who for many years have been in possession of a large tract of country along the western coast, extending from the direction of Perth in the south to Geraldton in the north, have recently sold a great deal of the land. Thousands of people have purchased their own farms there, but can get no facilities from the Postal Department. A special complaint comes from Moora, which is a hundred odd miles from Geraldton, on the line to which I have referred. If an inhabitant of Moora expects a telegram or a letter, he has to wait at the post-office and take delivery himself. No attempt is made in that large town to deliver letters or telegrams. If a letter is sent to a resident of Moora from Geraldton, it is carried through Moora by train to Perth, and then brought back to Moora, and even then is only delivered if the person to whom it is addressed calls at the post-office. No blame is attachable to the local postmistress, who gives every attention possible, but she cannot do what the Department will not allow her to do. I propose to bring the necessities of the settlers in that large district more directly under the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs, in order that he may give the Postmaster-General an idea of the conditions existing there. There is such a rush for valuable land in the coastal areas of Western Australia when land is thrown open that a whole district which formerly had no people on it quickly becomes populated. In such a case, the Department should at once step in and provide postal facilities, but the same old red-tapism prevents anything being done, and the Department is still conservative in its treatment of the people. I ask the Minister to take notice of what I have said, and to try to induce the Department to have some regard for newly populated districts in order to advance the development of the Common wealth . </para>

                        <para>- A reply was received from the  President  and  Speaker  of the Western Australian Parliament to the letter that was addressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself to them in reply to the protest which they forwarded on behalf of the Houses of Parliament of Western Australia with reference to the Tariff. The original letter that we sent pointed out that we had no precedent for receiving the docu-ment in the way that it was forwarded by those two Houses ; that there was the immemorial right of petition; and that there were representatives of that State in this Parliament whose duty it was to attend to the question of the Tariff, that question having been specifically taken out of the jurisdiction of the State Parliaments. In reply, to that letter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself received a joint letter, in which, while admitting that the exclusive control of Customs and Excise had passed to the Federal Parliament, they nevertheless contend that the State Parliament has the right in its collective capacity to enter a protest against any legislation proposed in this Parliament. They point out the power that exists wherever constitutional government obtains for every subject to bring forward a petition, and indicate the method of approaching the Governor by means of an Address with regard to any matter before the Houses. They contend that similarly they ought to have the power to make an Address of this character to our Houses. They also point out that during the short period of existence of our Parliament there has not been sufficient time for precedents of the character we mentioned to have been established. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself, after consultation, have sent a reply, in which we state, that we cannot subscribe to their contention that a State Parliament has a right to protest against legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament any more than the Commonwealth Parliament has a right to protest against legislation which comes properly under the jurisdiction of a State Parliament. We point out, with regard to&#39; the question of precedents, that we were guided by&#39; the practice of the United States of America, Canada, and other Federated Dominions, as well as the state- of affairs which has prevailed in this Commonwealth. We furthermore observe that the representatives of the State in this Parliament are the proper people to bring matters of the kind before Parliament. It may possibly be necessary at a later period for Parliament to offer an opinion with regard to the matter, but the position which the  Speaker  and myself take up is that we represent our respective Houses and are the mouth-pieces of those Houses, and that what we do is always subject to their approval. In a matter of this character, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> must take the initiatory steps in order to protect what they believe to be the rights and privileges of these Houses, and to prevent any possibility of their infringement. </para>
