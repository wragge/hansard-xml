            <para>- In pursuance of  oral notice which I gave to the Vice-President of the Executive Council yesterday,I beg to ask him if he will confer with his colleagues to see whether an arrangement cannot be made to send up to the Senate for its consideration any groups of items in the Tariff which may have been dealt with in another place ; that is, to send up the Tariff in divisions or sections? I also ask my honorable friend if he. does not think that we ought to let the public know as soon as possible what the duties on various items are to be? If we do not expedite business, we shall be asked to come back early next year, practically to hold another session, and any proposal of that kind I shall oppose. I hope my honorable friend will be able to give me an assurance that this matter will receive the attention of the Government. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel NEILD</inline>(New South Wales)  [10.35].  - I only rise, sir, to submit for your consideration, and that of the Standing Orders Committee, a question of parliamentary practice, as I think it may be more convenient to take this course than to raise it definitely at another time. It is with reference to the power exercised by the Senate to amend Bills in the Chamber after they have been reported from Committee of the whole. If our practice was analogous to that of the House of Commons - and I propose briefly to show that we ought to have the same power - it might be that this morning an honorable senator would propose an amendment to correct something which he might regard as an anomaly in this Bill. I do not know that such is the case, but I have risen to show what is the power exercised by the House of Commons in that regard, and with a view to the question being considered by yourself and the Standing Orders Committee, if they think well. Briefly, I submit that our standing Order, which apparently prevents any such action, is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution, because section  49  gives to each House of the Parliament the powers, privileges, and immunities of the House of Commons. It is a power of the House of Commons to amend a Bil], after it has1 been reported from a Committee of -the whole, and that I am not wrong in that view is, I think, shown by your . own ruling from the Chair on the 19th September last, in which - it is reported on' page 3505 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - you said that the powers privileges and immunities of the Senate are laid down in the Constitution, and " can only be varied by legislation, that is, to use your own words, "by legislation passed by both Houses " - the phrase of the section being " shall be such as are declared by the Parliament." You went on to say that - </para>
      <quote>
        <para>Our privileges having been clearly laid down we cannot extend them until Parliament sees lit to legislate in the direction. </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">I submit, sir, that if we cannot extend them we cannot curtail them. That seems to me a positive proposition which cannot be refuted. , I do not for a moment question the opinion which you expressed on the 19th September, that under the Constitution we possess the powers of the House of Commons until, by legislation adopted by both Houses, they have been altered. I submit, with great respect, that our standing order, which professes to curtail our right of action, is <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution. </para>

          <para>- Necessarily so, but my honorable friend will recollect that in the well-known case of <inline font-style="italic">Taylor</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Barton</inline> it was held by the Privy Council that words in a standing order of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales - certainly similar in import to those in section 49 of our Constitution - represented the powers of the House of Commons as existing at the date on which it was adopted, just as I am sure any lawyer will recognise that the phrase in section 49 of  our Constitution represents the powers of the House of Commons as existing at the date on which it was enacted. We are not bound by what the House of Commons has done since that event. We are entitled to the powers existing at the date of the establishment of the Constitution, To show that I am not in error in the view I take in reference ' to the power of the House of Commons, I will quote from </para>

      <para class="block">Page 573 of the 9th edition of <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> the following passage, which I may say appears in the later editions :- </para>
      <quote>
        <para>When the Bill, as amended by the Committee,' is considered, the entire Bill is open to consideration, and new clauses may be added and amendments made, whether they be within the scope and title, or even relevant to the subject-matter of the Bill or- not. The vicious practice of adding provisions to Bills, quite foreign to their object, which was formerly not uncommon, is now very rarely tolerated ; but the House has not imposed any formal restraint upon its own discretion, in admitting whatever amendments it may think proper, though not within the title, which may be afterwards amended, on the third reading. </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">There another point of practice crops up. Under our standing order we cannot amend the title of a Bill on the third reading, yet the House of Commons does it, and we profess, under the Constitution, to enjoy the powers of that House. This is the particular part to which I ask the attention of honorable senators - </para>
      <quote>
        <para>The House may exercise, directly, the same power which it sometimes grants to Committees, by way of instruction. Thus, on the nth July, 1853, on the third reading of a Stamp Duties Bill, an amendment was made, providing that drafts on bankers payable to order should be sufficient authority for payment, without proof of endorsement. </para>

          <para>- My honorable friend thinks that he is right, but he is really wrong. That section does not authorize any restriction or extension of our powers and privileges. It merely provides that each House shall have the right to frame rules and orders; not to add to or restrict powers and privileges, but merely to exercise those which it possesses under section 49 of the Constitution. My honorable friend shakes his head, but that does not alter the facts. If the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> which I have quoted, be correct - and it has not been challenged, nor do I think that the honorable senator will challenge it - then my contention is correct, because I am following his statement of the law. Let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> look at section 49 of the Constitution. It is there laid down that the powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate shall be such as are declared by the Parliament. The Parliament has not declared them at all yet. My honorable friend cannot hold that Standing Orders adopted by one Chamber of the Legislature constitute a decision of the Parliament. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> has said a declaration by the Parliament can only be by Statute or by some similar authority adopted by both Chambers. </para>

          <para>- I can quite understand that some honorable senators who do- not possess legal experience or legal minds fail to appreciate the distinction between power and its exercise. But I cannot help that. If there is anything in mv honorable friend's contention it implies that the two sections 49 and 50 mean the same thing. But they do not and cannot mean the same thing. One  of them deals with privileges and the possession of powers, and the' other with the exercise of powers. We cannot alter that fact.

I have simply thought it convenient to raise this question, which must be of considerable importance, because if I am right, it would simplify our procedure a great deal, inasmuch as it would not be necessary to go through the process of recommitting a Bill to consider amendments which were not of very much importance. I have raised the point at a convenient time, in the hope that it may receive consideration, and so that, if my view be correct, there may be an amendment of our Standing Orders. That is my only object. I am not interfering with the transaction of Government business, or seeking to delay the passage of the Bill now before us. </para>

          <para>- The question that lias been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is, no doubt, one of very great interest to the Senate, and it would be one of considerable importance if we were considering the amendment of the Standing Orders. I did not interfere with the honorable senator in addressing himself to the point, for the reason that I considered it to be of interest. Moreover, he could, had he seen fit, have submitted an amendment which would have required a ruling from the Chair. I thought, therefore, that it was better to give the honorable senator an opportunity of expressing his views now. I shall take the opportunity of saying what I think in regard to the point, and of indicating the difference between the contention raised by the honorable senator and the ruling which I gave the other day, to the effect that we have no power to increase or to alter the privileges of the Senate except by an Act of .Parliament. The present position, to my mind, is essentially different from the position that arose at that time. It will be remembered that the question then was as to whether a breach of privilege would occur if any trouble arose in connexion with the pak book. I then held that we had no power to determine that any alteration of the pair book constituted a breach of privilege, because we have certain privileges conferred upon us under the Constitution, and any alteration we desired to make in those privileges or any addition to them could only be made by Parliament, and not by one House' of the Parliament. We possess the privileges which are conferred upon the members of both Houses of Parliament, and which are possessed in order to enable members of Parliament the more effectually and independently to exercise their functions. But the- case now raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> relates to the conduct of the business of one House of the Parliament. I take it that the conduct of the business of each House of Parliament is provided for by its own Standing Orders. It is perfectly within the competence of the Senate to pass Standing Orders governing its conduct in relation to the passage of any Bill. Privilege applies to both Houses of the Parliament, but each House of the Parliament has power to conduct its own business independently. Privilege of Parliament is conferred to enable members of Parliament to exercise their functions without fear of interference, and in one direction extends to a period both before the commencement and after the close of a  session, so as to enable members of Parliament to attend in their places absolutely free from danger of arrest. These great privileges are conferred upon us under section  49of  the Constitution. But in regard to the internal affairs of Parliament, each House has power to regulate its own conduct under its own Standing Orders. If one House saw fit to make a standing order to the effect that, instead of dealing with a Bill in Committee in a certain way, it should deal with the Bill in the House,Iapprehendthatitwouldbeacting within its power. </para>

The provision in section 49 of the Constitution is that our powers, privileges and immunities shall be " those of the Commons House of Parliament. . . . and of its members and Committees at the establishment of the Commonwealth." The Commonwealth was established on the 1st January, 1901, and on that date the practice in the House of Commons was not to make other than purely verbal amendments upon the third reading of a Bill- and I take it that the. stage of the adoption of the report which we have reached in this case would be similarly regarded. If we are bound by section 49 of the Constitution, we are bound by the practice which existed in the House of Commons at that date. At the same time, it is clear that it would be within our powers, if we saw fit to adopt such a course, to amend a Bill upon the third reading or adoption of report stages, but we know perfectly well that the great object of sending a Bill to the Committee for the purpose of amendment is to give to honorable senators a fuller and freer opportunity of discussion and of reply, one to the other, in order that they may beat out a clause into such a form as will be most acceptable to the Senate, and best adapted to carry out the views and objects of Parliament. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator has reminded me of a question with which I was about to deal. Of course the power of the House must be greater than the power of the Committee. The House creates the Committee, and must, therefore, be the paramount body. But the House refers matters to the Committee, not  because it wants to magnify the position of the Committee, but because it is the more convenient way to determine certain questions that come before it for consideration. The House says, " instead of adopting this plan in the House, we will go into Committee of the Whole., where we believe the matter can be threshed out much more effectively and effectually." The Committee reports to the House, and if the House is dissatisfied with the report of the Committee, it adopts whatever course it sees fit. lt may send the Bill back to the Committee for the purpose of further consideration. There can be no question that the House is greater than its Committee, for the creator is greater than anything which it creates, and what it creates it can destroy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has raised an interesting question, and no exception should be taken to the fact that it has been raised, because in these early stages of our Commonwealth life, it is well that all these points should be considered, so that if it be deemed necessary to make any change in the practice which we have hitherto followed, we may have the. opportunity of doing so. I do not wish the matter to be debated at the present stage. If, however, any honorable senator will take the trouble to propose to amend the Bill at this stage, I shall be prepared to give a ruling. If honorable senators wish the question to be referred to the Standing Orders Committee they have only to express a desire that that should be done, and., of course, the Standing Orders Committee will give the matter consideration, but of course I cannot say what action they would take. </para>

I understood that it was the intention of the Government to move for the recommittal of the Bill with that object. The item was about the most important in the Bill, and was left out through mismanagement on the part of the Government in allowing a division to be taken immediately after the dinner adjournment, when a number of honorable senators who intended to support it had not time to get' back to the Chamber. </para>

            <para>- It is the easiest thing in the world for a little "ripple of laughter to be started by some thoughtless person, but ' the place where that sort of thing is most efficacious is the circus, not a House of the Legis'lature. If the Bill does pass its second reading, as I am afraid it will, I shall vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> if he proposes, as- he said last night that he would, to provide for a Judge to act as the chief in.... in place of the Comptroller-General of Customs. The only excuse -which the members of the Government in this Chamber can offer for the Bill is that somewhat similar powers are to be found within the four corners of the Customs Act. We  have only .to ' look at the manner in which the Customs Department frequently administers the powers given to it under that Act to find every reason to refuse to admire the possession or exercise of those powers, and to see no excuse for their further extension. There is every reason, on the contrary., for objecting to their extension," or even retention. We find officers of the Customs Department refusing to accept entries, seizing goods, books, and invoices, retaining them from November till the following July, refusing to listen to all representations, declining to take any action whatever., and finally the Commonwealth being mulcted in damages at the instance of the State Court, confirmed by the High Court, for their outrageous proceedings. I have to say " The Customs Department," but, of course, we know that it is the Minister, and this phrase, " the Comptroller-General " in the Bill does not mean the Comptroller-General at all. It means the Minister of Trade 'and Customs., because the Comptroller-General is only a servant, and under the direction of the Minister, and has to comply with the- Minister's instructions. We find in the case of a law suit with one of the States over the imposition of duties upon State imports that the Department sustained defeat, and refused to admit it. It refused to allow goods to be introduced under the order of the Court, whose decision has not been appealed against. This has gone on for years, and the State in question has had to pay something like  -^"300,000,  contrary to the decision of the Court., which was empowered to settle the matter, and did settle it, owing to the lawless doings of the Department, which refused to be bound even by the decisions of the highest Courts in the community.  Those powers have been, exercised with such absolute lawlessness, such utter carelessness of legal decision or equity, that one does not feel satisfied that there is any sufficient reason for putting them into yet another Bill. I have looked up this morning some of the High Court decisions in these very outrageous Customs cases. I could not quote little bits from -them, but should have to quote at length.. and, therefore, I refrain. I ask honorable senators to look them up to ascertain' whether there is anything in the doings of the Customs Department to encourage this Chamber to grant similar powers under this' Bill, which the Vice-President of the Executive Council very properly called an amendment ; of the "Australian Industries Prevention Act roo6." It was a very happy mistake on his part, because it was an extremely accurate description of the Act. Sub-clause  4  of proposed new section 1  SB,  which is embodied in clause  4.  of this Bill, provides that - </para>

        <para class="block">So that this extraordinary power of inquisition is not confined to the Comptroller-General. It is to be extended to any one he chooses to name. He may say to anybody he pleases, " I name you to make these _ investigations." One reads such a proposal with a sense of shock. I do not know where this kind of thing will end. We might have the principle involved in this Bill extended to the whole of our criminal procedure, and a man arrested for a crime may be called upon to prove a negative - that he did not do it. That is what is proposed here. </para>

            <para>- That may be so, but I do not know that any Britisher would be' willing to accept French methods in preference to the well-known provision of British law that a man is held to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty. The principle on which this measure is founded reverses the British precedent. If the Senate intends to pass this measure, no member of it who supports the second reading can possibly claim to believe in the principle- ''embodied in British law - that a man is to be held innocent until his guilt is proved. If no one else calls for a division on this Bill, I shall do so, because I do not think that such a measure should be placed on the statute-book without any better reason given for it than the statement that similar legislation is contained in the Customs Act. I should like to know what sort of draftsman we have, or what sort of tinkering by Ministers goes on, when we find that in twenty-four hours two Bills have been introduced to amend Acts which were passed only last year, and which are recognised as failures, because the Government have not the courage or the will to attempt proceedings under them. This, I suppose, is to. be an excuse for doing nothing for another twelve months. The passing of a certain measure last year has been an excuse for doing nothing for nine months in connexion with the collection of Excise duty. This Bill may be another excuse to do nothing to interfere with the operations of obnoxious combines. As an honorable senator said yesterday, some combines operate in the interests of the people, whilst there are others that are entirely mischievous, and ought to be suppressed. I am not here to say a word on behalf of any combination of people who improperly raise prices or straiten the conditions attaching to the product of any industry, but I do not for a moment contend that every combination of men is evil. What about the combination in another place a little while ago, to secure an increase of the emoluments of members of Parliament? According to the view which honorable senators will take of the question, that was a decent or an indecent parliamentary combine. </para>

            <para>- I think I am perfectly justified in that qualification, because the law Courts of the country have decided that certain trade unions have not conducted their operations in a legitimate manner, and some of them have been practically destroyed as the result of such a decision by the law Courts. Human nature is not perfect, and so long as men live, there will be those who do right, and those who do wrong. That the majority do right is clear, because we could not continue as a civilized community if the majority were bent on wrongdoing.- There are cases where unions of employes have done wrong, and there are also cases where unions of employers have done wrong. </para>

            <para>- I think I did pretty plainly. Let us consider the enormous and reprehensible combinations that are formed in America. It is a remarkable and significant thing that we never heard of combines in Australia until we imposed heavy Customs . duties. In America, which is the country in which combinations of an evil character flourish, it is notorious that they flourish chiefly on account of heavy protectionist duties. There .are combinations in England, but we do not hear that they exercise the malign influence on the public that the American combinations do. The higher the Customs duties, the greater the number of combines. We heard of a lolly-pop combination only the other day, and now we hear of an infants' food combination. The most that was alleged a few years back was that there was a Tobacco Trust, but even that might be traced to the influence of increased Customs duties. A Sugar Trust has been spoken of, but it has never been shown to be an institution of a malignant character. I do not know that it has not done a lot of good, since I imagine that there are hundreds of farmers carrying on sugar-planting to-day who could not possibly have continued in the industry had it not been for the operations of the so-called Sugar Combine. Whilst we have had a lot of wild allegations about the wicked Tobacco Trust, it has never been shown that that Trust has done anything hurtful. On the contrary, the Government have clearly shown, by their unwillingness to probe the charges made against the Tobacco Combine, that there is nothing whatever in them. </para>

            <para>- We have only to read the morning newspapers to see that in Sydney the Government are laying a train of powder under this Bill before it is passed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> knows that in Sydney the Government have a gentleman engaged on the preliminary stage of an action against the Coal Combine. The question of the recovery of the ,£25,000, in connexion with the cancelled mail con-, tract, is no more <inline font-style="italic">sub judice</inline> than is this question of the Coal Combine. Is this Bill really wanted - and that may be the  explanation of its introduction - to get at some mysterious phase of the cancelled mail contract, or is it wanted in connexion with the Coal Combine in Sydney ? If, as we have been told over and over again by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> the question of the recovery, of the ^25,000 is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and that therefore he cannot answer a question on the subject, is not the matter of the - Coal Combine <inline font-style="italic">sub judice?</inline> No legal proceeding has been begun in either case, and one is just as much <inline font-style="italic">sub judice</inline> as is the other.* Then, if we come to the matter of the Harvester Combine, there is no doubt that some part of the business is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> because certain (proceedings are pending in the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. If I was wrong yesterday in talking a bit about the matter, my honorable friend must be infamously wrong in bringing in a measure to alter the law regulating the very proceedings which are now undergoing legal investigation. One could speak at even greater length on this Bill than I am doing now, because it is a most preposterous and objectionable proposal. I am very sorry that my honorable friend will insist upon bringing in Bills which I cannot support, because nothing gives me greater pleasure than to find myself sitting alongside of him, voting against a miserable minority, and pushing on with the business of the country. But he does not often give me a chance to do that. He keeps me girding at these un-British, objectionable proceedings. I hope that he will drop them as quickly as possible, and let us get on with some measure in respect of which we can be at one. </para>

            <para>. - recognise that we must approach the consideration of this Bill with a great deal of care. So far, the debate has ranged round what may be called the charges that have been levelled against the Government in connexion with the principal Act. It has been stated that they have been guilty of sins of omission inasmuch as they have not exercised the powers contained in that Act. In my opinion, there is a certain amount of weight in those statements. I believe that the Government have been somewhat lax so far as the collection of Excise duty is concerned. It would have been better "if they had put the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Excise (Agricultural Machinery) Act in force, and collected the Excise duty from the various makers of agricultural machinery. Other statements have been made which are not altogether correct. For instance, it has been asserted, both here and outside, that the Government have taken no action under the latter Act, and that no certificates of exemption have been granted. What has been prominent in the minds of most senators has been the. case which is agitating the minds of the people of Victoria, and which is now before the Arbitration Court. Possibly, it. has escaped .their recollection that on the 1 st August, and, at my instance, a return was tabled showing that the Government have taken action in at least one direction - that certain firms of agricultural implement-makers had applied for, and obtained, certificates of exemption. </para>

              <para>- Various objections have been offered to the Bill now before the Senate. The provision that has been most objected to is that which vests the power to ask questions in the Comptroller-General of Customs. Those who have criticised the provision have failed to make any suggestion for its improvement. They have merely suggested that that power 'should be vested in a Court, or in a Judge of a Court. I thing that our experience of the principal Act has taught us that that procedure has been a failure. While I should like to see in that position a gentleman who would be independent of the Government, still I think that the clause provides the only way in which the case can be met at the present time. The provision in the principal Act has proved to be a failure, and if the clause in this Bill were deleted, I think it would practically make the Bill a dead letter. If the critics of the clause had suggested any practical way out of the difficulty, I believe that I should be inclined to oppose its enactment in its present form, but I do not consider that they have suggested a better way of eliciting information. It has also been said that, in certain respects, the Bill is a travesty on British justice, inasmuch as it seeks to compel a suspected person to prove his innocence. That, I venture to say, is no new departure. I think that a similar provision will be found in certain Acts of the British Parliament. I have worked in an industry where, in the event of a man being injured or killed, the onus was laid upon the employer to prove that he had taken every precaution to avert accident. </para>

              <para>- Let us assume for a moment that in Australia there are no trusts, combines, or monopolies. Does the honorable senator wish the Parliament to hold its hand until the evil in created, and has that grip of Australia which I am sorry to say it has of America? I do not believe that that is his wish. There is no denying the fact that in this young nation there are trusts and combines. It is our duty to take time by the forelock, and arm ourselves with weapons tr prevent trusts and combines from increasing and being that menace to the community which they are in America. An- casual student of the history of monopolies and trusts will know that the United States has practically been in their grip for years. It has only been the courageous attitude of  President  Roosevelt in attempting to grapple with the situation which has focussed the attention of the world on the question. </para>

              <para>- In deference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl's</inline> age, I shall not reply to him as I should do if any other senator made such a statement. I do not believe that even this Bill will remedy present evils. But it is an honest attempt to cope with such evils as exist or may arise. Even in the United States several measures have had to be passed in the attempt to cope with trusts and combines. We may have to pass amendment after amendment of the Law in order to place upon the statute-book a perfect set of machinery. This Bill is a step in the right direction. But, after all, I agree with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that no matter how perfect an Act of the Legislature may be. it will not effectually cope with trusts and combines. The trend in nearly all civilized countries is in the direction of the nationalization of the industries that are the subject of such organizations. Not until nationalization be achieved shall we have a perfect remedy for the evil. At present let us utilize such means as are at our disposal. I chink the Government are taking the right step, and I shall give the Bill my support. </para>

            <para>.- When the Australian Industries Preservation Bill was introduced last session, many of its supporters were very enthusiastic as to the good effects that would flow from it. But when attempts were made in Australia similar to those which have been successful in the United States, to establish combines, pools, trusts and monopolies, I, in common with other members of the party to which I belong, expressed the opinion that there was only one true solution.  That was that the Commonwealth of Australia should own and control the industries held by these institutions, or otherwise, in the course of years, the institutions would control the people of the Commonwealth. Since the placing of that Act upon the statute-book, matters in relation to certain monopolies, especially those concerned with1 tobacco, oil, shipping and coal, have been prominently brought under the notice of the public. I myself, on more than one occasion, have called the attention of the Government to complaints made at public meetings and through the columns of the press. There is one combination doing business in Australia that, in the opinion of those well qualified to express an opinion, is conducting its operations in contravention of an Act at present on our statute-book. The Government have been asked to initiate a prosecution. The Vice-President of the Executive Council promised me that the fullest inquiries would be made as to the manner in which the Standard Oil Company is conducting its business in Victoria. After the Government had apparently made the fullest inquiries, we were informed that the present Act would not enable them to prosecute successfully. </para>

              <para>- No; the Government have done so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> when speaking yesterday, made some general remarks in respect to combinations. Incidentally, he said that he was satisfied that if prosecutions were initiated under the present Act, and the Government were in earnest, they should issue fifty subpoenas. He stated that out of the number thus subpoenaed there would be at least some who would candidly admit that they had signed agreements in contravention of the Act, and that, therefore, evidence could be obtained which would enable the Government to carry the prosecution to a successful issue. Now, I venture to say that if the Government adopted that course, and brought men to Court to prove their own innocence, the first to make complaint would be <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> He would say that the Government had done wrong in taking such drastic steps as to subpoena citizens in order to establish the Government's case. </para>

There seems to be a difficulty in preventing their operations under the present law. Consequently, the Government propose that a certain course shall be adopted. Because they propose to follow the course laid down in our Customs Act, exception is taken by those who strongly supported that A':t. We are told that any Dick, Tom or Harry will be able to place- business men in such a position that the whole of their business might be exposed, and serious wrong done to them. I do not think that anything like that will happen. Under proposed new section  15c,  clause  4  of the Bill, it is provided that - </para>

If it was, the Comptroller-General, vested with these powers, would make the fullest and most careful inquiry, and would then report to the Ministerial head whether, in his opinion, a prosecution ought or ought not to be initiated. If that course is followed, endless trouble and unnecessary expense will be avoided.

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> wants to get at these combinations, some of which are getting at the public in a manifestly unfair way, he is not proceeding on right lines to accomplish the object which he and others have in .view. Immediately  after the passing of the principal Act, the Standard Oil Company, which has for a considerable time been carrying on business in Australia, and granting rebates to its customers, ceased issuing agreements, and to-day it would be well nigh impossible to obtain in any of the States a written agreement issued by that company. Knowing as we do that these people, who are without doubt violating the provisions of the principal Act. are making every effort to shield themselves, why should we hesitate to give what may be considered drastic powers to the Government in order to stop the operations of institutions that are inimical to the interests of the Commonwealth ? </para>

Having taken some interest in the question of the operations of certain combinations, I know that the Crown Law authorities have, for a considerable time, been active in their desire to prosecute persons who, in the opinion of many, are acting in contravention of the Act.' But some of those officers have told me that they have not sufficient power under the Act. </para>

              <para>- I am not dealing with the Excise. In order that they may be vested with sufficient power, they, and the Government, desire an amendment of the Act. I believe in the Bill absolutely. I believe that if it is carried it will prevent in Australia many of the evils that have grown up in America. I do not want to wait until the evils attain their full growth. They do exist in Australia to-day, but to a limited extent. Wherever encouragement is given to their growth, we know what follows - millionaires on the .one hand and mendicants on the other. That the Act can be evaded is shown by the fact that, instead of its discouraging monopolies and combinations in Australia, as a matter of fact additional combinations have sprung into existence since its passage. As additional combinations have sprung 'up and have established monopolies, while those which previously existed have continued to carry on their businesses since the passing of the Act. on lines . almost identical with those which they followed prior to that date, it is time that we recognised the necessity for an alteration of the law. The Government ought to receive the unanimous support of every well-wisher of the Commonwealth in their desire to clothe the authorities  with  greater power in order to successfully prosecute those institutions. </para>

            <para>. - I have to say, with certain reservations, that I give the' Bill a reasonable support. I am not quite sure that the Government have made a great effort to ascertain whether the existing Act is faulty. After a measure has passed this- Senate, and received the careful attention of legal minds, it seems to me impossible that it should be suddenly pronounced to be unworkable before it has been given a trial run. If a machine is made to pattern or design, and allowed to stand idle in a shed he must be a very bold man who will venture to pronounce it unworkable, not having given it a trial to show where the weakness lies. I say frankly that I am not sure that a better effort could not have been made by the Government to test the efficacy of the existing law. Seeing, however, that the Government do entertain a doubt of its workableness, I am prepared to support this amending Bill, not that I believe it will be an effective weapon for the repression of trusts, but because it represents another effort to deal with this growing, pressing, every-da.y problem, which exists not only in this country but elsewhere. It may be contended that we have nothing in the nature of trusts in Australia, but those who take that view must be compelled to admit that, if trusts have not appeared here in the outrageous forms in which they are found in other lands, if they have not started to bite in Australia, they have certainly shown their teeth. It is a question whether we should wait until they -assume that formidable shape, capable of producing such wide-spread havoc and injury to the public good, which they have assumed in other lands, or whether we should start in time to prevent the evil from growing to those proportions. The Bill has been criticised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who, I believe, has given a very worthy and laudable support to the original measure, but the honorable senator should remember that trusts axe not an evil of present-day growth. Their existence has not been confined to this country, nor even to this century. One of their striking features is that, so soon as a law is passed to deal  with their present-day actions, or with a particular method in which they make themselves objectionable, hurtful, and obnoxious to the well-being of society, they drop that particular form of action which would bring them within the four corners of the Act, and resort to another method by way of subterfuge to evade the law. </para>

              <para>- I believe that trusts and combines can go one better than O'Connell. In my opinion they could drive not merely a coach and four, but a whole camel team, through the Act which has been passed by this Parliament. If the Government have good reason to believe that the Australian Industries Preservation Act, although they have never given it a trial run, is likely to prove ineffective, they are quite justified in asking this Parliament to confer on them the power to make it effective, and without which it will be absolutely useless for the purpose for which it was passed. One critic of the Bill referred to this legislation as being unique, inasmuch as it will . impose harassing conditions upon the citizens of" the Commonwealth. But it has already been explained that the particular provision which is objected to as unique has been taken in a modified form from the Customs Act,' where it is already in operation. As it is admitted that such a provision is absolutely necessary in the Customs Act, it is well that we should consider the class of persons again'st whom the provision in the. Customs Act is directed. This leads me to ask the question : Who is the greater evil doer, the man who seeks to escape the payment of ordinary Customs duties by the adoption of devious methods, or the industrial combination that seeks to limit supplies, reduce wages, and make the lot of thousands of people harder? </para>

              <para>- That is so, and I regard a combination that limits the means of livelihood of thousands of people as a. greater evil doer than an ordinary Customs defaulter. The loss caused by the action of the man who evades the. payment of Customs duty is shared by the community, and is not so grievously felt by any one as are the results of the operations of the unscrupulous combinations to whom this Bill is intended to apply. Although the provision complained of has been borrowed from the Customs Act, I find that in the transfer it has" lost half its severity, because, under section 234 of the Customs Act, a person refusing to answer questions asked to secure evidence necessary for a prosecution renders himself liable to a fine of £100, whilst under this Bill a person refusing to answer questions asked for the preparation of evidence to enable the prosecution of a combine is liable to a fine of only <inline font-style="italic">£50.</inline> It would appear, therefore, that under this Bill combinations of manufacturers are not to be treated with the same severity as individuals dealt with under the Customs Act. </para>

              <para>- Let me admit it again if it is necessary to do so. I believe that it is absolutely suicidal for the employers of labour to continue a system of cut-throat competition, and I am in accord with combinations to prevent undue competition in trade. The- difficulty is that when that stage is arrived at the immediate tendency is to go to extremes in another direction, and use the position of exclusiveness obtained to increase the price to the consumer, to interfere with trade, and to reduce the wages of employes. The happy medium is never maintained. I believe that it cannot be truthfully said that no monopolistic institution that has succeeded in preventing cut-throat competition has not subsequently made use of its powers to tyrannise over producers, consumers, and employes. This Bill is largely based on the Sherman Act and other American laws. Very recently pronouncements have been made against the Standard Oil Company, which belongs to the class of combinations this Bill is intended to deal with. I find that Judge Landis, of Chicago, has but a very poor opinion of the persons who constitute these combinations.- In giving his decision in . the case in which he fined the Standard Oil Company nearly ^6,000,000, he said that - </para>

          <para class="block">This eminent Judge, in giving effect to the American law, placed these monopolies in the same category, or even lower than counterfeiters or mail-bag thieves. It would be well for honorable .senators who contend that this legislation is unique to consider the laws which are in force in America. The Elkin Act was passed in America to suppress the giving and receiving of rebates, a most mischievous system,, which is in operation in Australia. Judge Landis was administering the Elkin Act when he passed his severe condemnation on the monopolists -of America. Where combinations use their power to inflict injury upon society, we should not hesitate to pass legislation to circumvent them on the ground that it is unique. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> described the provisions of the Bill as mischievous, but there is an old maxim which might be quoted in this connexion - that it is better that a dozen criminals should escape than that one innocent man should be hanged ; and I hold that it is better that one person, or a dozen persons, should be harassed in the exercise of the powers vested in the Comptroller-General under this Bill than that thousands of persons should continue to suffer from the action of these combines. </para>

              <para>- But the responsibility will still, rest upon the Comptroller-General. I do not believe that in actual practice the Bill in this particular matter will be administered entirely by the Comptroller-General. I believe that it will be found necessary to appoint some special officer, whose whole time will be devoted to this work of preparing evidence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> amongst others, referred to the Bill in severe terms, and earned the applause of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> by his suggestion that it is opposed to the principles of British justice. But, as has been mentioned  by another honorable senator, the principle of holding a person guilty until his innocence is established in a Court of justice is in certain cases already a principle of British law. </para>

              <para>-My point is that the principle has been recognised in British as well as in Australian legislation, and that, therefore, the provision in this Bill is not novel. Daily in our Courts persons are placed in the dock, and called upon to explain how they became possessed of certain goods found in their possession, and if a satisfactory explanation is not given they are convicted. In other words, at the instance of a citizen a person is apprehended and treated as a criminal until such time as he can establish his innocence in a Court. The provision which enables one citizen, by signing a warrant, to place upon another citizen the onus of establishing his innocence, is equally necessary in the cases which this Bill seeks to remedy. It has been said that America is <inline font-style="italic">par excellence</inline> the land of monopolies. Al- though the American Government* has been struggling with this industrial trouble for a long time, yet they have not found a remedy. That indicates that there is only one remedy to put an end to the trouble. No' matter what statutes we may pass those who are standing behind industrial combinations can very easily discover loopholes through which to slip. Such an inherent dread of monopolies prevailed in certain States in America that they actually planted in the Constitutions a- warning to citizens against their encroachments. For instance, the Constitution of Maryland says - </para>

          <para class="block">Since the establishment of their Constitutions the people of those' States have been striving perennially to deal, with this industrial evil. The question is whether we intend to allow any tinkering legislation to take place, or to apply the only remedy that can' be effective in eradicating this pest which has found a root in our industrial system. Time has disclosed several weaknesses in the Australian Industries Preservation Act. But those weaknesses have been discovered in the administration of a similar measure in the United States. Under the principal Act- ,proof of the existence of a contract is required before its provisions can be- set in motion. In America the combines and monopolies have got over that difficulty by substituting an oral contract. The Inter-State Commerce Act and the Sherman Act have practically been turned into waste paper bY the ingenuity of the members of corporations and monopolies. While the successful operation of the law depends upon the establishment of the fact that a contract in restraint of trade exists, it is easily possible for combinations to make a mutual arrangement, and show that no contract does exist. In <inline font-style="italic">Bossism.and Monopoly</inline> - a work which was published only last year - Spelling shows that the Sherman Act is found to be altogether ineffective., because, the existence of a contract in restraint of trade cannot be proved. He points out how unworkable and futile the Act is - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It seems to be settled by these cases that the mere manufacture and sale of a commodity, upon however extensive a scale, and though the sales are largely for delivery to citizens of other States, and though one manufacturing and selling company have a virtual monopoly, yet that does not render it a violation of the provision directed at those who " monopolize or attempt to monopolize Inter-State commerce." It seems that to constitute a violation of the statute there must be a precedent agreement in restraint of Inter-State trad'e, and that no amount of actual monopolization, in the absence of such agreement, will constitute persons or corporations violators of the statute. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That quotation relates to a monopoly. Later on he refers to the ease with which combinations can escape the provision which requires proof of the existence of a contract. He says - </para>

            <para>There are just as stringent prohibitions and just as detailed a method of procedure for the discovery, prevention, and punishment of discriminatory agreements and contrivances in the present Inter-State Commerce Act as Congress can enact by exercising its utmost ingenuity, aided by the legal acumen of the best lawyers. And yet, not in a single instance that can be cited, in the eighteen years since that Act was placed among the laws of the nation, has the Standard Oil Company been deprived of the benefit of a discriminatory agreement. The reason is that such agreements are secret - gentlemen's agreements - the exact terms of which cannot be ascertained as a result of any efforts of which the Inter-State Commerce Commission is capable. Such agreements are not of record - they are not reduced to writing. They are not even made on behalf of either "high contracting party" by a recognised official. They are made by counsel or by secret agents, whose names are never divulged, even if known to the chief officer of the shipping and railroad companies. For that reason investigations have thus far borne no fruit, and will bear none in the future, no matter what additional laws are enacted. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So far as- requiring proof of the existence of an agreement is concerned, our Act is wholly inoperative if we are to judge by America's experience of the Inter-State Commerce Act and the Sherman Act. There is a second objection, namely, that a trust must be in existence before the case can be proved. The first quotation which I made clearly proves how easily that difficulty can be overcome-. I have mentioned that I have very little faith in the Comptroller-General of Customs being able to give effect- to the Act, because his duties in the administration of the Customs Act will leave him very little time in which to attend to the enforcement of this measure. The officer charged with the administration of the Bureau of Corporations in the United States, when he came to inquire into the doings of the famous Beef Trust  in Chicago, actually reported that it was almost a charitable institution, and one in no sense transgressing the statute laws of America. Apparently- this functionary shirked the task of exposing the Trust. The authorities which I have consulted go to show that when an officer is over-laden with duties, as the Comptroller-General of Customs will be, he is not inclined to show so much zest in the administration of a particular Act as would an officer charged with its administration and with no other duties. It is unnecessary to impress upon the Senate the awful mischief done and hardship caused by the Beef Trust in the United States. Yet we find a public officer there describing it as almost a charitable institution. The name of the officer at the head of the Bureau of Corporations is Garfield. I suppose he is a relative of a former  President  of the United States. </para>

I desire now to say a word or two to show the evil effects which monopolies and trusts have upon citizenship and individual character. It has been long contended by those who are opposed to the Labour Party, or the Socialist Party as it is sometimes called, that if our doctrines are finally accepted as  a national policy, advancement by the individual will be prevented, 'and that there will be no scope for men of ability to push forward on their own account, and to make themselves independent. That is one of the standing objections to the adoption of our policy. It has been urged over and over again that by the control of monopolies in the way we propose, and by the ultimate taking over by the Commonwealth of the means of production- </para>

              <para>- I do not like secret inquiries. It is strongly against the English feeling of justice that any man or body of men should be able to call upon one to disclose all one's business, to get hold of all the secrets of his trade, and possibly to injure him by that _ very fact, and then take no further action. Under this Bill, a person who has been unjustly called upon to produce his books has no remedy. According to new section  15A,  in clause 4, the charge is to be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary. That, to my mind, is one great blot. The other blot is the provision which shows the tendency exhibited lately by the Government, in all these Bills, to copy the French method of presuming that a person  is  guilty unless he can prove that he is not. It sounds to me very like the Russian method of imprisonment by administrative process. The Russian method is for Government officials to arrest a person on suspicion of holding opinions subversive to the public good. The accusation may not be true, and yet that person is arrested and imprisoned, and no inquiry is made. Here exactly the same thing is proposed on a modified scale by the Government of the day. They are to control other people'sbusinesses and to presume people to be 'guilty whenever they choose. The old English principle that every man should be considered innocent until he is proved to be guilty should be upheld in the Commonwealth. This is a very serious matter, and great injury is likely to accrue to the public unless the public realizes the present tendency of our legislation and protests against it.  </para>

I have come to the conclusion that the Bill is necessary. It is on right lines, and I intend to vote for its second reading, and to support it . in all its stages. There is one particular argument which has been often trotted out, and which I want to combat. The Comptroller-General of Customs is continually referred to as if he were a specially naughty man. Is it not a fact - does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> know it well - that in connexion with income taxation there is a Commissioner with large powers? A dreadful man, by the name of Russell, holds that position in South Australia, and has those powers, not only for himself, but also for those whom he employs. He may appoint men to visit the various parts of the country and make inquiries. I know it by experience, because such an officer visited my farm on oneoccasion. </para>

              <para>- I am not speaking about my own case at all. What I want to explain is that he had the power  by Act of Parliament, being deputed by the Commissioner, to enter upon my farm, or anybody else's farm, and ask questions such as these: - "How many machines have you ? " " Have you got a new one? " " Was it to replace an old one? " " If you got a new one and it was not to replace an old one, you will have to show it in your return, and be taxed for it." That is the law of the country. I have read a great deal about these combines and trusts, although, personally, I have had little to do with them, but I would remind those honorable senators who profess to be the farmers' friends of something that happened in South Australia about thirty years ago. The manufacturers combined to raise the price of the ordinary reaping machines to about £70 each. They formed a ring. It was an understood thing that none of them dared sell a machine under that price, and the poor farmer had to grin and bear it. At the same time, it was conclusively proved that those machines could be, and were eventually produced and sold at£25 a piece less than the price which the ring had fixed. I think that is conclusive evidence of the injury that is done to the public. A Bill of this kind is necessary, and I intend to support it most warmly. </para>

            <para>. - I am willing to give the Government practically any power they choose to ask for, if it is to be exercised to prevent trusts from using their powers to the injury of the public. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson</inline> that the Government may get all those powers, and that we may put what law we like on the statute-book, but the ingenuity of the best legal talent in the Commonwealth, which is always at the disposal of the trusts, as it is practically always employed by them, will be exercised in such a way that we shall be simply driving the combines into new methods of transacting their business. Combines are a necessity - a necessary evil, if you like - of the present methods of conducting industries. Honorable senators opposite talk a great deal about the individualist, but he is practically non-existent to-day. The old idea of the individualistic system has been superseded by the large industrial undertakings which have been taken up. The result has been that the individual has not had the necessary capital to establish industries and maintain them successfully. A number of people come together and form a company. When a number of companies have been formed, other companies, seeing an opportunity of making money by entering into a certain industry, start competition. Our friends opposite may say that they are very fond of competition, but I do not think they are. They are only fond of it so long as there is a possibility of all the competitors being able to make something out of the general public. As soon as that is no longer possible, the various companies come together with an agreement, or, if it is against the law to have an agreement, they have what they call a gentlemanly understanding, whereby they fleece the public to the utmost of their power. We are told that there is nothing of this sort in Australia, and practically nothing of the kind in England, because England is a free-trade country. But I suppose that there is no stronger combine in the world than that of the English railway companies. From one end of England to the other, their history shows that they are prepared to take, at the rates which they all agree to charge, produce from foreign countries, and carry it over any of their lines at less than half the price in many cases which they charge the local producer. </para>

              <para>- All that has been done here has been to give preferential rates whilst there was competition, but the English railways combine permits absolutely no competition. Whilst they have, perhaps no regular written agreement, it is common knowledge that the companies have fixed rates for certain goods, especially on certain lines, and give preference to the foreigner as against the local producer. That is certainly the action of a combine. Power has now been given to some extent, although not so much as it should be given, to the Board of Trade to deal with the railway authorities in England to-day. We have combines in Australia just as other countries have. We have, for instance, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I do not propose to say anything against that company, except that it is proved that in Queensland they are paying, and have paid ever since the  central mills were established, from 2s. to 5s. per ton' less to the growers of cane than the central mills have been able to pay. . </para>

              <para>- What I say is proved by the balance-sheets of almost every central mill in Queensland. I can refer the honorable senator for proofs to the prices paid by two mills in the Mulgrave district. The Mulgrave central mill paid 21s. 7d.. per ton, while the Colonial Sugar Refining Company paid only between 15s. and I6s. per ton. This is because the Colonial Sugar Refining Company have control over a certain area, and are able to compel the growers within that area to sell their cane to the company. </para>

              <para>- Yes, within a particular area. Beyond the area one or other of the central mills is able to compete with the company for the purchase of cane, and gives a better price than that given by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Who is it that has fixed the price of sugar in Australia? It is the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Not long ago I was speaking to a man who is running a plantation., and manufacturing sugar himself. He is making a fairly good white sugar, and has sent it to the Sydney market, and he told me that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has the trade so organized that, although he was prepared to sell his sugar at 10s. per ton less than the price demanded by the company, he could not get into the market. We have other combines in Australia. I can refer honorable senators to the Shipping 'Combine. If they read the evidence taken by the Shipping Commission they will find that traders throughout Australia complained of the system of granting rebates to merchants snipping their goods by . certain shipping companies, and that if they failed to do so they might lose rebates that had accumulated for twelve months. Instances were given in which traders lost rebates which they had earned by availing themselves of opportunities to purchase goods cheaply, and ship them by some small boats that did not belong to the shipping companies giving the rebates. </para>

They would then have been in a position to say that they required greater powers than are provided for in the existing law. </para>

              <para>- That is possible, but it is also possible that a case might have been decided almost at once on a technical point. If a prosecution had been instituted, and it had been shown that the evidence which the Government were able to obtain was not sufficient to secure a conviction, the Government would have had a right to ask Parliament to give them power to secure the necessary evidence in these cases.  The Bill is objected to because power is given under it to a Government official to examine books and documents. We always hear the old cry that this kind of thing is an interference with  private enterprise. </para>

I can refer honorable senators to the case of a Queensland banking institution that went down during the financial crisis, and appealed to the Government to save it. The Government used their power to save the institution, but they made it a condition that they should have the right at any time to send auditors to audit the books of the bank in the interests of the public. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I refer to the Queensland National Bank. That institution is working under an agreement with the Government to-day providing for the audit of its accounts, and so far from this provision doing the bank any harm it has improved its position in the estimation of the public. People recognise that they have some grounds for confidence in the institution, inasmuch as there is Government as well as private money in the hands of the bank, and the Government 'have the right to send an auditor to audit the books of the bank, and let the public know how its affairs are being conducted. My point is that when this banking institution sought Government assistance they had no objection to the appointment of a Committee to examine the affairs of the bank. </para>

              <para>- It is not at present paying any dividend, for the' reason that it has to make good some £2,0009000 or £3,000,000 of public money, and a very large amount of private capital which people had to leave in its charge without any interest at all. Under the agreement with the Government the bank is called upon to pay off these liabilities within a certain time, and the institution is making sufficient profit to gradually meet them., and is thereby being placed in a position of solvency in which the directors were unable to keep it without Government assistance. We have heard, amongst' other combines, of the Coal Combine. The organization of industry is absolutely necessary in the interests of the people carrying it on and those employed in it, and often in the interests of the public. The public do not often get a cheap article, and when they do it is often particularly nasty. Competition in trade has led to the use of light weights, and to, adulterations inimical to the public health, and has rendered the regulation of industry in some way a necessity in the interests of the public. There has never .been any great outcry when it has been the other chap who has been the victim of inquisitorial investigation. We have been told that trade unionism is combination, and that it has done some good. It is only lately that we have, been able to get that admission from honorable senators opposite. Trade unions have heretofore had to fight for every inch of ground they have been able to gain. They have had no support from the people who now admit that they have done good work. It is only during the last few years that' with the spread of education trade unions have been able to show that they are possessed2 of some power, and are in a position, to exercise it. The people who object to this legislation being applied to capitalistic combinations have never objected when it has been directed against trade unions. Not long ago a Bill was passed by the Victorian Parliament which is a disgrace to any statute-book. </para>

              <para>- To the Act passed at the time of. the railway strike in Victoria. An Act was passed by the Queensland Parliament under which men who had nothing to do with trade unionists found police at their camps in the morning ; everything they had was examined ; they were taken to the nearest township, and imprisoned for three or four days before being brought to trial. In some cases they were not brought to trial at all, and after being in prison for four or five days the authorities said to them, " We do not require you any more; get out!" and they were passed out of the door of the prison, and had no redress under the law. The people who passed that law belonged to the class who strongly object to the application to capitalistic concerns of legislation that is not nearly so drastic. Many of the persons who suffered under the Queensland law did not interfere with the public in any way. That law was passed by a Parliament which represented not labour, but . other interests, and was intended to 'deal with unionist organizations. In the Bill -before the Senate the Government are not asking that people shall be put into gaol without inquiry, or that there shall be any publication of any one's private or trade affairs. Inquiries are carried on by officials of the Customs Department every day, and the public know absolutely nothing about them. ' We are told that the inquiries provided for- under this Bill would interfere -with a man's business. Nothing of the sort. The Comptroller-General would have" the power to say to an officer', " You go down to such-and-such a' place and see their books." It would not be published that the official had gone there. He would look through the books and make a report to the Comptroller-General. If that officer. found nothing in the report on which a prosecution could be based no more would be heard of it, and no man's business would be prejudiced. But if as a result of the inquiry there was evidence secured to justify a prosecution, the Attorney-. General could institute proceedings, and if he could prove his case the offender would be liable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> objects that 'this power should be given to a Judge, and not to be Comptroller-General, who has too much to do already. Granting the latter contention, it is no reason why we should give this power to a Judge, because, in the first place, a Judge does not come directly in touch with the trade and commerce of the country. He has no knowledge of what is going on unless it is brought before him in his official capacity.  His  duty is to hear and weigh evidence, and to give a decision. But to require a man who has to try a case to instruct persons to go round and collect evidence- </para>

              <para>- Senator Stewart contended that a Judge should be intrusted with the power which the Bill places in the hands of the Comptroller-General of Customs, on the ground that the latter has too much work to do. There is no reason for selecting the Comptroller-General of Customs, except that he is in a better position than any other official to know what is going on in the world of trade and commerce.  His  officers are established at various points throughout the Commonwealth. Trade and commerce have to be carried on more or less in connexion with his Department, and through his various branches he. obtains an insight of business matters which no other person could secure. Suppose that the power is intrusted to the Comptroller-General of Customs, he can appoint his deputies to do the work. No one dreams that he will personally make the inquiries. But the main consideration is that he is in a better position than any one else to judge where to send persons to inquire. And when the inquiries have been made, there are other officials who. when they believe that they have obtained sufficient evidence for that purpose, can lay the evidence before the Attorney-General, who will decide whether or not there shall be a prosecution. I do not see any harm in collecting the evidence in that way. </para>

          <para class="block">It has been proved, I think clearly, that in America it 'has been found quite impossible to get the necessary evidence to convict persons. It has been generally admitted that in that country the combines' have been doing a great many things which must be inimical to the public interests. I recognise that in our present state of industrialism, combines are absolutely necessary, because they are able to pick up the threads of an industry and organize it thoroughly ; but after its organization has been effected, their only idea is to wring from the public just as much as they can. Years ago, when the railway people in America were starting their big organizations, they used to go to persons who had produce to send away and say, "We demand to see your books before we will make an arrangement with you for the carriage of your produce." The officers of the railway companies examined the books and decided practically what prices they would charge for the services to be rendered. If they were not able to gain their point by that method, they would prevent the goods from getting on to the market by side-tracking them, or by resorting to any device they could think of without bringing themselves within the law relating to common carriers. It seems to me that every part of the civilized world will go through the same experience as America has done. England has its trusts and so has Australia. The parties spend all their ingenuity, money, and time in organizing an industry, but once that is done they squeeze all they possibly can out of the public. It has been stated here that the Standard Oil Trust has not only increased its capital tenfold during the last few years, but has also paid practically that sum in dividends. It has been robbing the public in every conceivable way. Some honorable senators may say, " That is all right, but you see in America they have a different system of transport, and it was through that means that men were able to fix up big trusts and combines, and make enormous profits." That is undoubtedly true, but it is simply because the railways have been in the hands of the States - and I think the idea is generally entertained by our anti-Socialist friends, that nothing should be in the hands of the State- </para>

The people will realize that what is protecting them from the growth of trusts is the control of internal means of transport by the Government. Otherwise, we should have such an enormous combination in connexion with transport, trade and manufactures, that no power on earth could protect the people unless the Government intervened. That is the only thing which is to some extent protecting the public against being fleeced more severely by the combines. I support the second reading of the Bill, and will give every assistance I can to the Government to bring our legislation on this subject into working order as soon as possible, so that it may be demonstrated whether it is effective or not. </para>

My honorable friend was quite justified in complaining yesterday that the Excise duty has not been collected. The Government ought to have taken some action in that direction, and for their inaction they are to blame. I also recognise that this legislation is somewhat novel. The new protection is rather a novel proposal . </para>

              <para>- I assure you, sir, that I have no desire to transgress the rules. I hope that our legislation on this Subject will be more successful in the future than it has been in the past. The introduction of this Bill is ample proof that the Act has been a failure. I hope that in the future any practical proposal to get rid of this evil will receive more cordial support than has hitherto  been extended to any effort in that direction. It is, I admit, a very slow way in which to proceed, but, though it is slow, it is none the less sure. I feel that every failure on the part of the Parliament to deal with this evil will furnish an argument in support of the proposals which have been submitted from time to time by various members of our party. I recognise that the present measure does not go to the root of the evil. It is like applying ointment to a sore. It eases the sore for the time being, and no more. Therefore, I have very little faith in the Bill as remedial legislation. But when I compare this proposed remedy with that suggested from the Opposition benches, I must necessarily choose what I believe to be the better of the two. </para>

              <para>- I can assure the honorable senator that, so far as my vote goes, his party would not remain long in opposition were I sure that they would formulate a better remedy than this. We have before us a mere choice of sticking-plasters. The sticking-plaster that the Government offer is, to some extent, a remedy. That which the Opposition offers is of no use whatever. Consequently, I am obliged to choose the sticking-plaster prepared by the Government. Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> referred to the .position of the Labour Party in regard to this class of legislation, and uttered a warning against doing anything which might have the effect of driving capital out of. the country. If the honorable senator wishes to retain the respect of his fellow senators, which he undoubtedly enjoys at present, he must cease trotting out that old "wheeze," the use of which is neither creditable to him as a senator nor indicative that he has taken recent lessons to heart. </para>

              <para>- Of course they do. The American trust of which we hear most, namely, the Standard Oil Trust, was not created by the fiscal policy of the United States. It was formed quite independently of Customs duties. The Coal Trust does not owe its existence to the protective system. The. Newcastle Coal Vend in Australia has nothing to do with fiscalism. There are other considerations affecting the formation of trusts than fiscal policy. I can best reply to the arguments advanced regarding the Labour Party's attitude towards trusts by quoting from a recent work by that very entertaining writer, Upton Sinclair. In his work on <inline font-style="italic">The Industrial Re-public,</inline> he shows that the aim of the Socialist Party is simply to improve trust methods by the Government. He shows very neatly that Socialists do not desire to destroy the trusts and to throw industrial methods back to the condition prevailing twenty or fifty years ago, but that all Socialists propose to do is to nationalize the trusts, or the industries which they control, for the public good. I cannot do better than read this passage, to show the drift of his argument - </para>

The trusts are marvellous industrial machines, of power the like of which was never known in the world before ; they are the last and most wonderful of the products of civilization - and we .must destroy them. We have been a century building, them - you, and I, and the balance of the American people have toiled for three generations night and day stinting and starving ourselves so that we might get these trusts finished ; we have taxed ourselves ten, twenty, thirty per cent, of our incomes under the disguise of a protective Tariff to maintain and develop, them, and now that they are complete we must destroy them. </para>

          <para class="block">That clearly puts the position of the Labour Party so far as the trusts are concerned. We do not wish to destroy them, or to throw industrial methods back to a primitive state. It could not be done with any degree of convenience and success. It would not tend to the welfare of the people to destroy them. But we do wish to destroy them as private monopolies, in order that the system- which they control may be worked by the Government- for the general good. That is the position of the Labour Party regarding trusts. I am prepared to support the Bill as it stands. So far as I can see, it needs very little alteration. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> as to the officer who is to administer the measure. I think the Government official, pointed out in the Bill as the person who will be responsible for taking action and preparing evidence, is the man best fitted for that work. The officer at the head of the Trade and Customs Department - if the office is well filled, as it is at present - is more familiar with our industrial affairs than is, perhaps, any other man in the community. Consequently, he is the best official to administer this Bill. As far as I can judge, there is very little .need for any serious amendment of the Bill, and I shall vote with the Government. </para>

            <para>- - It is my intention to vote for the second reading of this Bill, and to support it in Committee in its entirety. But I do not wish it to be assumed that I am any great lover of the measure. I do not believe that it is possible, by any means likely to be adopted under 'parliamentary institutions, as' they are at present conducted, to do more than regulate trusts. I doubt whether it is within our power to control them effectively. I think that the Government have been sadly at fault with respect to the administration pf the existing law. They can hardly be congratulated on the courage they have 'shown, or on the quickness with which they have acted when required to do so. The Act was passed nearly twelve months ago, and the Government was possessed of information, sworn to by witnesses who gave evidence before the Tobacco Commission, as to the existence of a trust. I have read the report of that Commission, which shows that not in one, but in five or six different cases, witnesses swore that a trust existed in that line of business. </para>

              <para>- I am well aware of that. But the Government, possessed of such knowledge as the general public had, should have been well aware that that trust has acted in a manner detrimental to the best interests of the public. Despite that fact, the Government did nothing to put the Act into operation. They have now brought forward an amending measure, with the object of giving them larger powers in regard to trusts. Apparently) they have at last been brought to a proper recognition of the actual position ; and though I have no confidence that the Bill now before us will accomplish all that is intended, still, it may do some good, and, therefore, I shall support it. I am not going to restrict the power of the Government <inline font-style="italic">la</inline> accomplish anything that they desire in this direction. I was struck by the confusion of thought existing on the Opposition side in regard to this matter. It is amusing to one who is rather taken up with the collectivist idea to find honorable senators opposite so ready to restrict the logical outcome of private enterprise. The formation of trusts or combines only commenced when private enterprise had practically throttled itself. In nearly every case trusts originated in the desire of men, possessed of large capital, to prevent themselves from  competing with and ruining each other. Where a combination is obtained for that purpose it is perfectly justifiable. </para>

              <para>- Trusts did not come into existence until private enterprise had crucified itself. Originally formed to prevent cut-throat competition, it was found that trusts, owing to their superior organization, had also the effect of eliminating waste labour. By means of superior organization, they were also able to produce more cheaply, and their great power enabled them to drive competitors out of the market. When they have come to their full power, in every instance they have used it in a manner detrimental to the best interests) not only of the trading community, but of the public generally. It has been stated that we have no trusts in Australia, such as there are in America, and that there is no danger of our getting into a similar position. But I would remind those who hold that view of this : That there was a time when the patriotic Americans prided themselves upon the cleanness of their public, trading, and commercial life. We heard nothing of all this terrible corruption in America prior to the rise of the trusts, and we have no guarantee that results similar to those which have taken place there will not follow the establishment of trusts in Australia. Assuming, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> says, that the trusts are only in their infancy in Australia, are we to assert that we, the Australian people, are in any way superior to the American ? </para>

              <para>- We do not yet control transportation in Australia. We have no control over the Shipping Ring or the Coal Vend, which are very necessary factors in the question of transportation. I hope that we shall not assume that we. are in any way superior to the American people. I believe that they are quite as good and quite as smart as we are. All the corruption existing in America to-day has been the result of the rise of the trusts, and that only happened when private enterprise had throttled itself. We are not in a position to prove in detail the existence of trusts in Australia, but it is generally admitted and believed by the public of Australia that there are combinations or trusts in the following lines - oil, coal, boot machinery, sugar, bricks, confectionery, tobacco, shipping, meat, insurance and breweries. The recent combination formed by the breweries of Melbourne is an illustration of the power of trusts. As a result of their superior organization, they have been able to eliminate a certain amount of waste labour in the shape of travellers and general employes, but, realizing that they were in for a scoop in the near future, they rather generously pensioned the employes with whose services they dispensed. Does any one think that if the future had held out to them no other prospect than that of continuing on the old lines, struggling one against the other, and paying no dividends, they would have generously pensioned men whose services they had no longer any use for? Of course they would not. The reason why they pensioned the men was that they saw that it was necessary to placate the public by inducing it to believe that they were a generous combination actuated only by a desire to benefit it. It is common knowledge, however, that although the combine have only been in existence a few months, there has already been a large increase in the price which they charge for their commodities, and, as their power grows, they will no doubt still further increase the price, until they are able to bleed the public. When a trust reaches that stage it is detrimental to the community generally, and it is time to control it. I have no objection to a trust if it is legitimately carried on, and not charging excessive prices to the public. I believe that it is absolutely hopeless to expect to prevent the formation of trusts, because in nearly all lines of industry, wherever there is free competition, there is an almost complete absence of dividends. The only people who are making any profit out of manufacturing or commerce are either indirectly or directly connected with some trust. The other people are not able to make progress at all. With regard to the large powers proposed to be given to the Comptroller-General of Customs. I candidly admit that I am not a lover of the principle' of assuming any man's guilt until he is proved guilty, but at times special circumstances arise which make one accept the inevitable. In this case we have to accept the inevitable conclusion that there is no other way of obtaining the evidence necessary to secure convictions against trusts or combines. But it is not such a dreadful thing after all, because it was discovered that it was practically impossible to make various other Acts effective without assuming the guilt of the person accused. Three times in "Victoria during the last twelve months that principle has been recognised. It has been necessary in the cases of the Licensing Act, the Gaming Suppression Act, and the Police Offences Act - the Vagrancy law - to assume, for the purpose of securing evidence, that each of the classes of individuals aimed at was guilty. There was no objection on the part of the anti-Socialist party, to which a number of honorable senators opposite belong, to the proposition in the Victorian Coercion Bill - the Railway Strike Suppression Bill - to assume the guilt of the men concerned. . </para>

              <para>- The object of the Bill is to enable the Government to do all that possibly can be done to bring the trusts or combinations before, not the Comptroller-General of Customs or anybody else, but a Court of law, properly constituted, where they will get all the fair play that a Court of the Commonwealth can give them. They can employ as many lawyers as they like, and all that they have to prove - I think honorable senators opposite will see that in many instances it would not be difficult to prove - is that their action has not interfered wilh any Australian industry. Tt is not what they have done to the consumer, not what they have done to the general public, but the question is what effect their action has had on some Australian industry, taking into consideration the interests of the employes and the consumers generally. </para>

              <para>- They could be, if it could be shown that that restraint of trade interfered with an Australian industry, but not otherwise. I am only giving that as my own opinion, which I have had very good reasons for arriving at. The very inability of the Government to do anything in the past has confirmed me in that view. I desire also to point out to honorable senators opposite that even the original Act or this Bill cannot interfere with any trust or combination so long as they are carrying on legitimate trade, and doing nothing to the injury of the public or of an Australian industry. Consequently they have really nothing to fear while they act fairly. With respect to that awful provision in the Bill to enable the Comptroller-General of Customs or somebody under him to obtain information, there is no intention of endeavouring to obtain information unless some complaint is made or some substantial reason exists in the mind of the Comptroller-General that something wrong is being done. </para>

              <para>- Yes, because we take' the Comptroller-General of Customs to be an intelligent man, who will not accept the word of any interested party that something is being done in restraint of trade. If a complaint is made he will make preliminary inquiries, and, if he is a reasonable man, he will come to the conclusion either that there is something in it, or that there is not. If he feels convinced beyond doubt that there is something in it, he will take steps to get the necessary" information. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and others that when he does come to that conclusion he cannot inflict any punishment on any one that resists his inquiries or his endeavours to get information. When he makes the attempt to obtain the evidence that he thinks necessary to establish a case, if the trust or combine, or any other party against whom action is being taken, are doing a legitimate and fair trade, and dealing fairly with everybody, they will have nothing to fear. They ought to be prepared to give the information, but if they are doing wrong, then no doubt they will not think it to their interests to do so. If they refuse, then/ although the Bill provides a penalty of ^50, the Comptroller-General will not have the ultimate power. The matter will have to be brought before a Court, and it will have to be shown before the trust can be punished that they have refused to the Comptroller-General or his officers facilities for obtaining information. When the Comptroller- General has obtained the information, he can take no action to the detriment of the trust. He will report to the Attorney-General who will decide whether it is advisable to proceed against the trust. The Attorney-General must take into consideration the Australian Industries Preservation Act and the provisions of this Bill before he can decide whether the action of the trust has been detrimental to the public by restraining trade so as to interfere with an Australian industry. </para>

              <para>- The Comptroller-General or his officers, and the Attorney-General will be acting in the interests of the public. If the Attorney-General comes to the conclusion that there is a case against the trust, he will take action under this legislation, and the result may be that he will avail himself of the vast legal knowledge of our honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator St.</inline> Ledger, and get him to take up the case on behalf of the Crown against the trust. It is possible that the Attorney-General may decide that there is no case against the trust, and then no further action will be taken. But honorable senators must see that, all these preliminary stages having to be gone through, no action is likely to be taken against any trust except on very substantial grounds. Then when at last a case against a trust gets into Court the trust can be represented by the best, legal talent to be obtained in the Commonwealth, and in the same way the interests of the public can be represented. The members of the legal profession should have no objection to the passing of legislation of this description.  They should hail it every time. It is for this reason that, in common with many of my friends, I have very little faith in it, because I feel that in connexion with the ultimate proceedings under it there is likely to be too much law, and, possibly, not enough justice. Combines or trusts acting fairly towards the public have nothing to fear. It is only when they act in restraint of trade, or to the detriment of the public in restraining trade in connexion with Australian industries, that they run any risks under the law. Honorable senators opposite have all declared that they are prepared to support legislation of this description to assist the Government and the public to put a stop to the injurious practices of foreign trusts, but their cry is, " For heaven's sake, do not interfere with trusts or combinations in our own country, because they have not yet reached the same stage of development that trusts and combines have reached in America and other parts of the world." </para>

              <para>- I hope they never will, and it is by passing legislation of this description that we will show our anxiety to prevent it. I do not say that we shall be successful any more than the people of the United States have been successful, but every one of these measures, that we pass stands in the same relationship to the trade of the Commonwealth as the policeman does to the traffic in our streets. They will indicate to trusts and combines the necessity for moving on. The Acts we  have passed, and which I suppose we shall have to pass for years to come unless the right thing is done by trusts and combines in the interval, will only take the place of policemen making the trusts move on, and do something more to evade the legislation enacted against their operations where they are injurious to the public interest. I hope that honorable senators opposite will have no fear that, under this legislation, any injury will be done to trusts or combines organized in such a way as to give a fair profit to capital, fair remuneration to the workers engaged in the industry, and do no injustice to the community generally. </para>

In the first place, we had combinations of workmen in unions. That was followed by combinations of capital and employers, and now we are ,going a. step further, and I believe we shall have combinations of employers and employes in certain businesses who will work together for the exploitation of the general public. The shipping companies have agreed with their men to increase wages, and at the same time to increase freights and fares to the general public, who must foot the bill every time. </para>

              <para>- Yes, there is; because there is no one to protect the public. There is nothing in this measure to prevent shipping companies adopting that course. I believe that we shall yet have a number of combines of employers and employes from which the rest of the 4,500,000 people in Australia will receive no benefit, but for which they will . have to pay every time. In my opinion the more legislation of this description that we pass the greater the tendency towards the establishment of such combinations will be. I do not think that the ingenuity of man can frame a law that these people will not be able to evade. Daniel O'Connell, one of the greatest legal lights of the old country, said that the British Parliament could make no law through which he could not drive a coach and four. I listened with great interest to the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who voiced my views in nearly everything he said. We have a Government with a strong majority behind them, but they have not been willing to take action in connexion with the harvester business. Why have they not collected Excise duty under the Act? </para>

              <para>- Honorable senators opposite accept many statements made in  the press as proof when it suits them, and while I accept the honorable senator's correction, I believe that many of the statements which have recently appeared in the press as to the doings of combines are correct. This is a very drastic Bill, because it actually puts upon an accused person the onus of proving that he is innocent. It is like asking a drunken man to prove that he is not drunk. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator is quite right; that .is a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence. From what has taken place in the past, we know that if Ministers do not approve no action is taken. I am debarred, sir, by your ruling, from referring to the matter, but every one here, and a great many persons outside, know that it is quite true that the Minister hides himself, as it were, behind the Comptroller-General, who has to do what he is told. If he is granted this power, he can appoint any person, fit or unfit, to exercise it. If ought to be intrusted to a Judge of the High Court, and not to the Comptroller-General, or the Minister of the day. It is very dangerous to intrust the power to any man except a Judge, who could hear the case and decide whether a man was innocent or guilty. . I do not intend to oppose the second reading of the Bill, but in Committee I shall be ready to support any amendment to improve the clause to which I have referred. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel</inline>GOULD (New South Wales) [3.31]. - Before the Minister replies, I desire to say a few words with reference to the measure. There is no necessity, I think, to discuss whether or not the legislation enacted during 1906  should have been passed. It was enacted, and the Government now say that they require further powers to enable them to carry out its provisions. This Bill contains no proposal to abolish that Act or to repeal any provision of it. I agree with honorable senators that where combines are shown to be detrimental to the public interest, and to fall within the class of cases referred to in that Act, it is our duty to assist the Government, so far as we reasonably can, to deal with the difficulty. I also recognise that, within the last few years, we have been confronted with a set of circumstances entirely different from what we were confronted with previously, with regard to not only trade and commerce, but also very many other matters. There is no doubt that, to a certain extent, it may be  necessary  to amend our methods and to abandon some of our preconceived ideas and notions. But in dealing with principles which have been recognised as those on which the law should be administered, we ought to .consider carefully any proposed ' departure from them, and also how far we are justified in making that departure. We ought not to depart from accepted principles until it has been abundantly proved that they are not good enough to conduct us in the way in which we desire to go. Much has been said in regard to a provision of this Bill being against British traditions and British practice. It has been argued that it embodies a principle of Australian law; but I take exception to that statement. The only Act in which such a provision is found is the Customs Act, and "it was enacted in that case to enable the Government to prevent smuggling and dishonest practices in connexion with the importation of goods. It is generally conceded that a provision of that drastic character is required in a Customs Act. We were then assured that we could rely upon the discretion and care with which the Minister or other person would use the powers conferred by that Bill, and that they would only be made use of when other powers were found to be insufficient to protect the public interest. But is this a provision which we ought to enact? We are told that trusts are inimical to the public interest, and that every means ought to be taken to suppress them. Crime of every kind is inimical to the public interest. But if it were proposed that every man who was charged with the commission of a crime - a theft, a murder, or a burglary - should be brought up and examined as to whether he had committed the crime, and examined in the circumstances which are supposed to surround the commission of crime, honorable senators would say at once that it must be abundantly proved that we would not ourselves commit a crime by punishing persons who were' innocent. If honorable senators are going to drag out to its full extent the doctrine which has been mentioned here, they will have to adopt the principle which is practised on the Continent, where a man is arrested, and then interrogated, in order if possible to extort from him a confession. That, we know, is entirely opposed to the traditions of British law. The principles which prevail to-day under British law are not the growth of yesterday. Gradually - in century after century - they have grown up, and in the interest, not of the ruling classes, but of the poorer classes - those who could not protect themselves as men of wealth and influence could do. Every advance which has been made in regard to those principles of British law has been in the direction of protecting the weak. It behoves us to consider well how far we ought to depart from principles which have been the growth of centuries. </para>

              <para>.- As the Minister interjects, the main feature is the intent. The act may be committed, but the question arises : Was there the intent, when the act was committed, to effect the object which is condemned by this particular provision ? As there is a certain amount of confusion in the minds of honorable senators, it may be well to consider how far this clause goes. I admit candidly that I do not like the clause, and that I would prefer to have everything proved against a man before he. is held to be guilty. But when it is stated that there is no possibility of the Government instituting proceedings, although there may be in the mind of the Minister or the Comptroller-General of Customs a reasonable belief that an offence has been committed against the Act, I am prepared to go so far as to accept the clause as submitted, because of the safeguard which has been provided by requiring proof of intent, and also requiring that a man must be proved by evidence to be guilty of an offence, if it is indictable, before he can be punished. So much for the provision itself. I am relying upon the statement made by the Government that they cannot initiate a prosecution, although there maybe a well-founded reason for doing so, without such additional power' as they now ask for. The next portion of the Bill empowers the Comptroller-General to hale before him any man he sees fit, to be examined, and on that examination to found a prosecution, and to convict him of an offence against the law. I ask the attention of honorable senators to this provision - </para>

            <para>His answer shall not be admissible in evidence against him in any civil or criminal proceeding other than a proceeding for an, offence against this part of this Act. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That shows clearly that it is contemplated that the Comptroller General shall have power to examine an individual, and, if he can, extract from him certain statements which will show that an offence has been committed, or induce a jury to come to that conclusion. That evidence may be used against him on his trial. Some honorable senators may ask : If a man is guilty of intent, why should he not be punished, even on his own admission? But they should always bear in mind that we have laid down the principle not to seek to extract from a man by force an admission of his guilt. If a person is willing 'to admit his guilt, well and good, and there is no better known rule with regard to criminal proceedings than the one that if inducements have been held out to a man to make a confession, it cannot be used against him in evidence. We have no protection provided in the clause. Let me point out the inherent weakness of the provision which the Government ask us to pass. Any man may be haled up and asked questions. If he fails or refuses to reply to any questions, if he is asked to produce a document and declines to do so, he will be liable to a penalty. Suppose that when a question is put a man deliberately tells an untruth. Honorable senators may say that probably he has been guilty of an offence. If he has been guilty of an offence,- is it not equally probable that when the question is put he will say that he did not do so-and-so? He may give an absolutely false answer, and there will be no means of punishing him, but if he gives no answer at all, he may be fined. </para>

              <para>.- There is in this Bill the provision that the Comptroller-General shall be intrusted with certain powers. I have taken exception to those powers being placed in the hands of the Comptroller-General. Let me point this out. The Comptroller-General is simply a. public officer under the direction of the Government of the day. This Government, or any other Government that may be in existence must, if it is to retain office, be supported by a majority in Parliament. It is possible that a political party might exercise such an influence over the Government of the day as to cause inquiries to Le made by the Comptroller-General respecting individuals or combinations, which inquiries ought never to be made. </para>

              <para>.- There would accure a degree of uncertainty as to the position of persons who were carrying on business. It is well, no doubt, to have a drastic law where the circumstances of the case demand it. But the public should be able to respect the law, and be satisfied that it is being administered upon such lines that no honest man could reasonably take objection to it. What I say is that where it is proposed to place great powers in the hands of the Comptroller-General, as under this Bill, it is extremely likely that the measure will fail to command the respect of the public, and their respect is essential if a law is to be effective. These considerations point to the desirableness of intrusting a Judge with the duty of making these inquiries. But the suggestion has been made that it is not practicable to intrust these functions to a judge - that he will not have time to make the inquiries or may not understand the ins and outs of trade and commerce. While admitting 'that, my opinion nevertheless is that if these provisions are to be adopted the powers which they confer should be exercised by a' Judge, or should be under the control of the Court. Let me explain to honorable senators what I mean by that. As the law stands at present, it is possible, in civil proceedings, to obtain what is termed " discover/." That is to say, it is possible to secure the production, of documents pertaining to a case. It rs also possible to have 'interrogatories administered.  A party to a suit may, in accordance with that process, have questions put to him that are considered by a Judge to be pertinent to the case. </para>

              <para>.- Yes; that is so. In matters of this kind, a Judge would not be likely to authorize interrogatories to be put to a man, the answers to which would be of a nature to incriminate him, unless the law made provision to that effect. What I would suggest with regard to this provision is this : If the Comptroller-General has grounds for believing that an offence has been committed against the law, I would allow 'him to make an application to a Judge - an <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> application, if that is considered desirable - for permission to. have questions put and documents pro,duced. He should be enabled to put such questions as 'the Judge thought fit to. allow, even though the answers might incriminate the individuals. </para>

              <para>- Not necessarily. An application can be made to a Judge in chambers when no one is present but the applicant. If it is thought desirable, provision might be made to that effect, and the Comptroller-General authorized, where he thinks there has been an offence committed under the law, to go before a Judge, and,, upon satisfying the Judge that there was <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> evidence,, be empowered to ask for an order under which full inquiries might be made, which the Judge might be authorized to grant. The Minister in charge of this Bill says that if such a provision were made, it would mean " good-bye to the Bill." But the Bill might be all the better for such an amendment. We have been used to a procedure of the kind  I have described. Why do we appoint our Judges  under  the conditions subject to which they hold their positions? Because we have confidence in their integrity. We put them almost above the power of Parliament. No Judge can be removed except on an address from both Houses of the Parliament, and then strong reasons must be shown for his removal. Practically, it has to be shown that a Judge is either corrupt or incompetent before he can be removed. But no man is placed in the position of a Judge of the High Court unless there is an absolute feeling on the part of the public that he  is  not only a man in whose integrity they have confidence, but also that he is a man on whose intelligence and' ability they can rely. I believe that if we made a provision of this character it would commend the Bill to the public, because they would see at once that. there was no desire to allow any possibility of unjust action being taken, or unjust inquiries made concerning a man's personal or private affairs. Before the Comptroller-General could get an order to make these inquiries, he would have to make application to the Judge, and, if there were sufficient grounds, the Judge would, grant it. </para>

              <para>- The Minister is very keen for his Bill, and, therefore, I make allowance for many things that may be said. But will he be kind enough to tell me this : Does he say that a man charged with the commission of a criminal offence should be asked by the Inspector-General of Police, or whoever might be the principal officer in charge of criminal procedure, such questions as that officer might see fit to put, with the view, as this Bill proposes, of obtaining evidence that would convict him of the offence with which he is charged? </para>

I shall not deal further with the question of the tenure of the Comptroller-General, for that reason. But I do wish to draw a distinction between an officer who holds a position, not at the hands of Parliament directly and' a Judge of the High Court.' I should be perfectly prepared to give the honorable senator every assistance in the direction of making provision for a Judge to have power to grant authority to make any inquiry that might be considered necessary. I think that if a provision of that kind were made, the public would have absolute confidence in the procedure. It would help to make the public respect the law. As I have previously said, one of our great aims in regard to legislation is that there should be a consensus of opinion that the law is entitled to respect. There should not toe any possible ground for suspicion that any individual may be proceeded against on improper grounds. I do not desire to say any more with regard to this matter, 'except to assure my honorable friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that I have had no desire to make a partisan speech. </para>

              <para>.- I have made these remarks with' a view of pointing out the direction in which I think such legislation might fairly go; and, while my suggestions do not follow exactly on the lines that the Government has laid down in this Bill, they do follow the principle that the Vice-President of the Executive Council enunciated in introducing it. If my suggestions were adopted, they would enable the Government to institute a prosecution, or to obtain answers to questions, under such circumstances that, while there was no fear of any denial of justice, there would, at the same time, be a guarantee to the public that they might have confidence in the administration of the law. </para>

              <para>- As the Minister says, it is a matter of opinion ; and I take the view that I am entitled to my own opinion. That is the reason why I have taken up this position to-day. I wish the honorable senator to dispossess his mind entirely of the fancy that I have spoken with any desire to destroy a Government measure or to support any partisan issue. But I do think that it is only a fair thing that, if I entertain strong views with regard to a matter of this kind, I should be at liberty to place those views before honorable senators. The official position which occupy would simply be intolerable to a man if he were precluded and debarred from expressing his opinions on a matter of grave public importance. </para>

            <para>.- At about this time last year, I was successful in having embodied in the Excise Tariff (Spirits) Act certain conditions with regard to the labour employed in the distilling industry. That Act comes into operation to-morrow. Unless the eight-hours principle is recognised and reasonable conditions of labour observed, the penalty is an additional Excise. I learn from the press that the Minister of Customs has sent word - if the newspaper reports are correct - to the various distillers, pointing out to them the obligations with regard to working conditions which devolve upon them from to-morrow. I wish  to  say distinctly and definitely that, so far as I am concerned, something more is required, If the same course is to be followed in connexion with the new protection principle in the distillation' of spirits as has been followed in connexion with the harvester business, it will be most unsatisfactory to those who are expecting an amelioration of their position, and who ought to get it without any hesitation when an Act of Parliament gives it to them. </para>

That is not a reasonable wage, and seventy hours a week are not reasonable hours for men. to be called upon to work in Australia. </para>

              <para>- If they are called "improvers" in Queensland,  I expect the assistance even of those honorable senators who are opposed to the Labour Party on certain questions, in my endeavour to see that the Act is carried out in its entirety. I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will not go kite-flying in connexion with this Act, and that the paragraphs which are appearing in the press, appealing to distillers to recognise the Act, will not l&gt;e continued. I expect the Minister of Trade and Customs, having the power under the Act, to say to the distillers, " From to-morrow you will have to pay this additional Excise, and if you observe the- conditions embodied in the Act, the Excise will be returned to you." </para>

              <para>- Exactly. It is not for the Minister of Customs or for a Court to inquire whether the industry is paying big dividends, or any dividends at all. Section 3 of the Act says that the duties specified in the schedule shall be charged, collected, and paid for the use of the King, for the purposes of the Commonwealth. I ask, therefore, if the Minister will see that the provisions' of " the Act are enforced to-morrow, and distillers called upon to pay this Excise until they have proved that they are giving to their employes reasonable rates of wages and fair conditions. </para>

With regard to the presentation of a joint address, I do not think that it would be reputable for - the Ministry to make that an- excuse for not dealing with this question.

              <para>- The Ministry has taken no action to secure the presentation of a joint address in connexion with the harvester Excise, and, therefore, we are justified in assuming that Ministers will not take action under the Act to which reference has been made.  I am of opinion, that it is derogatory to Parliament to allow a Statute to remain unrecognised and unapplied. Seeing what has happened in connexion with the harvester Excise, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> was quite justified in bringing this matter under the notice of the Ministry, with a view to prevent the continuation of inaction. I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Findley in every way in his efforts, to compel Ministers to give effect to the desire which they have professed to secure to all employes  - fair wages and reasonable conditions. Many of us know that the wages paid in the distilling industry, and the conditions of employment are not what they should: be, " and the collection of this Excise will do a good deal towards altering this  state of affairs. We should simply inform the distillers that, unless they pay fair wages, and allow proper conditions, this penalty will be imposed. In my opinion, they would rather do what is right in respect to their employes than pay the Excise. Therefore,. I think that 'it should be imposed at once,, in order to bring about what we desire. </para>

              <para>- I shall come to that matter. I repeat that if the Minister is not satisfied that fair and reasonable wages are paid, the responsibility is cast on him of introducing the necessary motion in Parliament, and, the motion having been passed, the Governor-General is then authorized, and  then only, to issue the proclamation. I ask honorable senators to bear in mind that, as. a matter of law, taxation Acts are always read with the strictest rigidity. I desire to say that the Minister has not been unmindful or neglectful in this connexion, because, on the 9th October, 1907, he issued the following circular to the Collectors of Customs in all the States - </para>

              <para>- There is a very important matter of privilege, although it appears in the nature of private members' business. The Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications have presented a report, and the consideration of it is set down for Wednesday next. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> consulted me, and I said I had no objection - in fact, I deemed it my duty - to permit the consideration of the report to be the first business for that day. The next business will be the Bounties Bill, which is at the third-reading stage; and then follow the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, and, probably, the Excise Tariff Declaration Bifl, though I cannot pledge myself as to which of the two latter measures will be taken first. The remaining measures are the Quarantine Bill and the Navigation Bill. </para>
