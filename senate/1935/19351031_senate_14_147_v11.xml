                        <para>- As a matter of privilege, I direct your attention, Mr. President, to statements which appeared in a Western Australian newspaper during last week-end to the effect that the Senate had reassembled after a holiday of ten days. I point out that, within the time mentioned, there were two Saturdays and two Sundays, and that the Senate, having completed the business on the notice paper, had adjourned over three sitting days. I resent this unfair criticism of Senate proceedings, and ask whether you consider it incumbent upon you to take some official notice of the manner in which this branch of the legislature is treated by certain newspapers. </para>

                        <para>- I remind the honorable senator that when raising a question of privilege it is customary to conclude with a motion. As regards the newspaper criticism to which he has alluded, all I need say is that the Senate is so firmly based that it can well afford to ignore the trifling and paltry attacks that are made upon it from time to time by irresponsible persons. </para>

(2) Is it a fact that a Japanese mining company (the Nippon Mining Company) has been admitted to the deal, and will now be in a position to supply Japan with iron ore in unlimited quantities? (3) Was the sale made by the Government of Western. Australia or by the Commonwealth Government? (4) Docs the Minister consider the sale a safe policy for Australia in view of possible international complications which art said to be likely in the Pacific? </para>

                        <para>- With reference to the statement made in the Senate yesterday by the Minister representing the Attorney-General relating to the power of the Parliament to disallow regulations, I ask the honorable gentleman: (1) Where a regulation contained in a statutory rule consists of seventeen sub-regulations and twelve paragraphs, could a motion be made to disallow or amend a sub-regulation or a paragraph? (2) If the reply is in the negative, or if there is doubt about the matter, will the Government take steps to amend the Acts Interpretation Act to clarify or alterthe position in order to give to the Parliament this power? (3) If a regulation repealing a previous regulation is disallowed, does the previous regulation continue in force? </para>

Also, in view of the fact that the commercial broadcasting stations consider that the regulations will seriously hamper the development of broadcasting, will he ask the Postmaster-General to call for a report on the subject? </para>

                        <para>. - Through the courtesy of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> I have had an opportunity to peruse the right honorable gentleman's, remarks in moving the second reading of this bill yesterday. There appears to me to be very little in the bill requiring further elucidation. In June, 1933, when the Australian Antarctic Territory Acceptance Bill was before the Senate honorable senators in opposition complained because they had very little information concerning that measure. I repeat what I said on that occasion, that, in assuming control over such territories, Australia is placing itself in a position which may be difficult to maintain, and we maybe brought into conflict with other countries. The Minister, in moving the second reading of the bill, practically confirmed that opinion. He said - </para>

                        <para>At the conference of Ministers it seemed that the States were disposed to be sympathetic towards the proposal to amend the Constitution along the lines suggested, partly because of the recognition by the States of the Commonwealth's situation in regard to whaling, and partly because State fisheries, with particular reference to pearl shell, trochus and beche-de-mer, had been adversely affected by poaching and operations within territorial waters by foreign nationals. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That statement supports the opinion of the Labour party that Australia cannot afford to become a colonizing country, and that there is a constant danger that the acquisition by Australia of new territories may bring it into conflict with other nations. If this bill is enacted the Commonwealth may be able to obtain some revenue from those engaged in the whaling industry,, but that has yet to be proved. The Minister stated that the New Zealand Government has made sufficient revenue from the- issue of licences to cover the cost of inspecting whaling vessels. This is really a machinery bill following upon the measure passed by Parliament in 1933, and the Opposition will not oppose the second reading. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (SenatorCollings). We recognize that there is always a need for the governments of various countries to protect industry from the depredations of private enterprise, which' has no regard for the interests of nations so long as huge profits can be made. The Leader of the Senate has informed honorable senators that in many cases whaling companies operating in the antarctic seas have ruthlessly slaughtered whales irrespective of the requirements, of the future. Whilst the Labour party supports this bill, and recognizes the need for government action to uphold the- convention to which the Commonwealth is a signatory with Great Britain and Norway, wehope that the measures to policethe whaling industry in Antarctica will be more effective than those undertaken by the Government to safeguard the fisheries in our northern and north-western waters. In those latitudes, depredations have been committed by the nationals of a certain power in the north. In the absence of adequate supervision, they have ruthlessly poached trochus shell, beche de mer and other marine products, and broken customs and immigration laws, without having been brought to book for so doing. In what way will the whaling industry be policed ; and how does the Government in tend to see that whalers in Antarctica operating under licences issued by this Government fulfil their obligations? If this country through its government is unable to safeguard fisheries off the northern and north-west shores of Australia from depredations by nationals of another country, what hope has it of supervising the whaling industry? Foreigners have denuded the Queensland beds of trochus shell, they have broken the immigration and customs laws, they have had dealings with aboriginal women, and their sampans have, apparently, had unrestricted right of entry into the territorial waters. According to the bill whales of a certain size, a calf, suckling or immature whale, and a female accompanied by a calf or suckling shall not be taken. It is all very well for the Government to insert that provision in the measure, and I hope it will be able to police it, but honorable senators are entitled to know how this will be- done. </para>

I hope that this supervision will be carried out properly, because it is necessary to safeguard the industry. The Government has failed adequately to supervise the fisheries in the northern waters, and yet it is preparing to assume additional responsibilities in Antarctica. </para>

                            <para>- The Federal Government can enforce its own laws, such as those relating to customs and migration, and they are constantly being broken. Twenty foreign boats were beached on. Bathurst Island contrary to the laws of the Commonwealth, but practically no action was taken. I mention this merely to show that difficulties may arise in the operation of this measure. From another source complications may arise. Japan is no longer a member of the League of Nations, and is not a signatory to the Whaling Convention. Would it be possible for the Japanese to catch whales in the antarctic waters controlled by Australia and avoid payment of licence-fees? Recently a number of chasers and a factory ship went down into the antarctic seas and according to press reports, they intended to catch as many as 900 whales. Perhaps they will go into the waters adjacent to the land controlled by Australia. I would- like to know from the Government whether poaching of that nature can be stopped, in view of the fact that the Government has- not been able to prevent poaching in the northern waters. </para>

Admittedly an element of danger does exist, for heavy responsibilities are placed on. the Commonwealth once itaccepts territories. But a far greater danger would present itself if those lands fell into the hand's of a foreign power. Ownership of those territories gives Australia the advantage, apart from any others, of being , able to keep at a greater distance foreign nations who might constitute- a potential source of danger. </para>

                            (Australia) argued in favour of the restrictions proposed by the draft Convention. He even thought they should be strengthened, particularly in regard to the limitation of the number of whale-chasers; but he thought it wiser not to take any decision on the point pending the receipt of more accurate information from the International Bureau of Whaling Statistics at Oslo, which, under the Convention, was the institution centralizing and distributing information. The information to be supplied by the bureau would enable a definite opinion to be formed on the point. As matters stood, the Australian Government waa satisfied with the present draft and would sign it, if the final text were not substantially different from the draft text at present before the Committee.

                    <para class="block">So far as the Commonwealth is able to judge, the attitude of Japan is still the same as was expressed by M.  Kawashima  in 1931. Should Australia ratify the Convention, there is no doubt that representations will be made by the signatory powers - Great Britain, Norway, and Australia - to Japan and other countries in an effort to make the application of the Convention as widespread as possible. So far as the South Pacific is concerned, there is every hope that Japan, although not a member of the League of Nations, will become a signatory to the Convention. There is nothing to prevent it. </para>
                    <para>As to fishing in the Antarctic by fleets of other nations, the position there is not different from what it is off the coasts of Australia. The territorial waters of any country have a definite limit, which is recognized internationally. No country professes that its laws operate beyond its territorial waters. The only way in which whaling outside territorial waters can be regulated by a country is by exercising some . control over whaling vessels when they enter territorial waters. Because of the limited control possible to individual nations, those nations which undertake whaling operations should become signatories to the Convention. Seeing that the whaling industry is in danger of extinction unless this Convention is accepted and given effect, I believe that Japan, as a civilized nation, will in its own interests sign the Convention and see that it is effectively carried out. It is a measure of self-preservation. Although Norway regards whaling as one of its most profitable industries, it has accepted the Convention, recognizing that, if the industry is to continue, it must be regulated. Although, like Japan, the United States of America is not a member of the League of Nations, it is interested in whaling, and it is hoped that that country, too, will become a signatory to the Convention, so as to make it more effective. </para>

                        does not expect me to give, offhand, a learned dissertation on the various kinds of whales. At this stage, I can only say that the kinds of whales set out in the clause are well recognized by all authorities on fish. When a decision has  to be made as to whether or not a whale has been illegally caught, the responsibility will rest, not with me, but on some one more closely associated with the whaling industry.

                        PEARCE (Western Australia - Minister for External Affairs) [3.41].- Evidently the honorable senator did not hear my second reading speech in which I explained that we had endeavoured to persuade the States to transfer control of fisheries to the 'Commonwealth. Some were willing, but others were unwilling to do this, and therefore we abandoned that course. As, however, we were anxious to take the necessary action, we decided to pass this legislation and to ask the States to pass similar measures. When that has been done, the Governor-General may issue this proclamation as he will then do so virtually with the consent of the States.

No; the Governor General could not issue proclamations on behalf of the States without their consent, but if they pass the complementary legislation the States will virtually give such consent and it will be quite competent for the Governor-General to issue this proclamation.

An " officer " for purposes of this measure means " an officer performing duties under this act", and this clause provides that " every officer shall, for the purposes of the enforcement of the provisions of this act, have the same powers and authorities as a constable has under the Crimes Act 1914-32 ". Among those powers and authorities is the power to arrest without warrant in cases where proceedings by summons would be ineffective. When honorable senators visualize conditions as they exist in the Antarctic, they will readily recognize that a constable could hardly proceed by way of summons; he must proceed without a warrant. An inspector who may go to the Antarctic, either on an Australian or a British ship, will have the powers of a constable within the meaning of the Crimes Act only so far as this measure is concerned.

                            <para>- I have never known a lay to be arranged on the basis of the number of whales taken; it is usually arranged on the basis of the value of oil obtained by a ship or its crew. In olden days it was customary for whaling crews to be engaged at a certain rate of pay and they were entitled also to an agreed percentage of the value of the oil obtained. I take it that this clause will allow of such an arrangement to be made, subject to certain restrictions, but the marginal note does not fully convey the meaning of the clause itself. </para>

In connexion with this and a number of other clauses in this measure, I point out that their wording repeats the wording of the articles of the convention, which was drawn up by experts of nations like Great Britain and Norway which have been whaling for centuries. The object of these clauses is to give effect to the purport of the convention which, in the main, was that indiscriminate destruction of certain kinds of whales, such as young whales, should be prevented. Many clauses in this measure repeat the exact words contained in the convention.

                        <para>. - Yesterday I emphasized the enormity of the offence which has been committed by this Government in introducing legislation that abrogates all traditions of British justice by requiring a person accused to prove his innocence. This morning I received a copy of a Melbourne publication containing an opinion given by a well-known Melbourne barrister on this bill. He criticizes it in language much more severe than I have been accustomed to use in this chamber, in the press, or on the public platform. </para>

Always there have been students and thinkers, philosophers and scientists, prepared to accept whatever fate might have in store for them simply because they were in advance of contemporary thought. Giordano Bruno went to the stake because he would not recant, and Galileo was also a sufferer, though he recanted because his scientific researches - one of which indicated that the world was flat - so profoundly disturbed the current beliefs of the scholastic and ecclesiastical authorities of his time. </para>

Those amendments sought to penalize unions which had been connected with some unlawful association twelve months previously. They endeavoured to create an offence and make it retrospective for twelve months. The proposals aroused such a storm of indignation throughout Australia that the Government was glad to drop the bill. It was bitterly opposed in the Senate, where it originated. That is the kind of treatment which the masses of the people may expect from this Government. </para>

                            <para>- I am not so sure of that, but it is quite likely that an attempt would be made so to  adminster  the act if the occasion arose. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> appears to be imbued with the idea that such things as I halve suggested could not happen in Australia. If the honorable gentleman would refresh his memory of events of the last five years, he would have to admit that all our preconceived ideas of British justice were forgotten by a government which endeavoured to deport Walsh and Johnson. But such are the vicissitudes of party politics that Walsh, once the declared enemy of Nationalist thought, is now in the counsels of that party. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It will be interesting to see what actually happens if this measure becomes law. [  do not think that any honorable senator opposite really believes that the onus of proving innocence should be placed upon a defendant. As a Melbourne barrister said, trial by jury is being destroyed by the Crimes Act. I am satisfied that honorable senators opposite, ' who are the lineal descendants of those who burned Bruno at the stake and who supported King John, arc prepared to do what was done in those days. </para>

                        <para>.- I have studied the proposed amendments contained in this bill in conjunction with the Crimes Act 1914-32. Somewhat similar amendments are embodied in the British Official Secrets Act 1911, and were passed by an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons on the 2nd December, 1920. If I thought that this bill had 'been introduced to stifle honest criticism by any individual or by the publisher of any newspaper or pamphlet I should oppose it. In almost every clause the words "prejudicial to the safety and interests of the Commonwealth or any other part of the King's dominion " are used, and no citizens or associations of citizens need have the slightest fear unless their actions, words or designs are directed against the well-being of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> knows only too well of the white-anting methods adopted by a certain organization to destroy the Labour party in Australia. Yet when the Government introduces legislation to chock the underground working of such organizations which are aiming at the destruction of the Commonwealth constitution, honorable senators opposite protest. Proposed new section 30ab does not necessarily refer to communistic associations. It is a dragnet provision covering unlawful associations generally, and may include the NewGuard or organizations controlled by Fascists or Blue Shirts. I am generally in accord with the bill because many persons with foreign or anti-British sympathies have been given too much f reedom. When the bill is in committee honorable senators must be sure that nothing contrary to traditional British fair play finds its way on to the statute-book. The proposed legislation may be necessary, but it is always well to investigate and remove the causes of unrest. Some are international, over which we  have no control, but over others we have control and the power to provide remedies. When there was any indication of discontent or disorder in the Australian Imperial Forces the generals sought the cause and, invariably, found it, and its elimination resulted in contentment, loyalty and efficiency. But even then there were agitators who never reached the front line, and who were only a menace to the Australian Imperial Force. Their solo aim was to sow the seeds of discontent. The only deterrent was heavy punishment, which was inflicted only after trial by court martial, which every man who has been in the service admits is the fairest court in the world. If offenders were found guilty a heavy penalty was inflicted, and it always acted as a deterrent. It is equally necessary that heavy penalties should be provided for the offences set out in the Crimes Act, which are a check on those who wish to bring about a state of revolution in this country. I support the bill. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. I am inclined to believe that the Government, with its big majority in this chamber, considered it unnecessary to give honorable senators as full an explanation of the bill as otherwise would have been given. In presenting a measure containing such drastic provisions the Government should not think that the Senate is behind it willy nilly, and that we will support whatever measures are brought forward. It may be that I am not quite fair to the Assistant Minister, because he may intend to explain more fully the effect of each proposed amendment in committee. This is the more necessary in that the Senate does not possess what I may term a legal mind. The principal act has been amended on numerous occasions 'between 1914 to 1932, and I am beginning to wonder why it has been necessaryto alter it so frequently. Apparently the bill is to give to the Government increased power to deal with traitors in our midst, to prevent disruption and generally to ensure the safety of Australia.

                    <para class="block">By whom is he to be discharged and to whom can he appeal? A person may be arrested and placed in gaol. He may, however,' be discharged if proceedings are not continued within " a reasonable time ". But who is to decide what is a reasonable time? That and other points should -be explained by the Assistant Minister. Honorable senators opposite proclaimed in strong language their opposition to any interference with the right of free speech, but I have a very vivid recollection of the rights of free speech being seriously interfered with during the last general election campaign- in the electorates represented 'by members of the Labour party. It seems to me that the only portions of Australia in which there is not the right of free speech are those electorates. Honorable senators opposite and their colleagues should put their own house in order before protesting against the action of others. The Leader of the Opposition raised the subject of censorship. </para>
                    <para>I am not satisfied with the method of censorship as applied to either political works or to fiction entering the country. There seems to be too much restriction and too much differentiation. The people of Australia desire to be educated in regard to the political movements taking place on the other side of the world. Unless they are given that opportunity they are unable to obtain a proper idea of how the world is. developing. In the case of fiction, the differentiation made between one author and another verges on the ridiculous. </para>
                    <para>Whatever party may be in power, I am afraid that it may administer this bill in a way that may not be quite fair. I do not question the necessity for this measure; I simply say that the manner of presentation is not all that I would have expected in a deliberative body like the Senate. At the same time, I grant that the Assistant Minister possibly intends to explain very closely the purport of the various clauses in committee. I fear the effect that some of the clauses may have, and I trust that the Assistant Minister will explain them in detail when replying to the second reading debate. </para>

When moving the second reading, I explained that I did not propose to give a very full explanation of the details of the bill, because it was essentially a measure to be considered in committee. And that is the attitude which I take up to-day, one month, after the measure was introduced. If, as a result of consideration, or of reading the bill through, honorable senators have discovered any points which require elucidation, I shall be very happy to explain, them, and if necessary, to state why the Government has thought fit to insert them in the measure. </para>

Honorable senators opposite have evidently forgotten that we are living in a developing world, that conditions are not static, and that we have to face enemies in our midst, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings'</inline> father, to whom the honorable senator referred in his speech, had not to confront when he came to this country. We are to-day faced with an organization whose ramifications are world-wide; it is seeking to under-  mine the whole of organized society, and Australia has not escaped its attentions. </para>

                            <para>- Very likely, because this Government prefers to step forward rather than to step backward. The Leader of the Opposition spent a great deal of his valuable time in academic references to the suppression of the liberty of the press. It is rather unfortunate that .just a little earlier on the same day he had expressed the view that die best use the press could be put to was for stuffing the windows of those so-called hovels- at Molonglo, about which he had expatiated. I remind the honorable gentleman that there is no clause of this bill which deals with, or seeks to curtail, the liberty of the press. Attempts may be made to curtail the licence- of the press, but unless the honorable senator realizes the distinction to be drawn between liberty and licence, his 50 years of political education, of which he has spoken more than once, have been wasted in some important respects. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> had a great deal to say about the Liberty of the subject. This bill, from its title to its schedule, contains not a solitary line which curtails liberty of speech. </para>

                            <para>- In other words, the honorable senator strikes at one of the fundamental principles of our legal system ; that of trial -by one's peers, trial by jury. The person who commits an offence under proposed sub-section 1a. shall be guilty of an indictable offence. The use of the word " indictable " means that before he can be found guilty, he must be tried by a jury of his fellow citizens, a common jury as it is called, because the jurors are ordinary men, drawn from the community as a whole. </para>

                    <para class="block">Clause 3 merely amends that section by inserting after the word " constable " the words " or any Commonwealth officer who is authorized in that behalf by a Minister of State ". It will apply principally to unauthorized wireless apparatus. At present a constable has power to seize unlicensed wireless apparatus, but difficulties have arisen both in connexion with the disposal of the apparatus and because of the danger of more important duties not being performed. The purpose of the clause is to empower- inspectors of the Postmaster-General's Department to seize such apparatus. </para>
                    <para>The  honorable  senator also objected to clause 5, which deals with indeterminate sentences. This clause is directed, not so much against Communists and persons who divulge official secrets, as to the reformation of youths who have been convicted of offences. It has been inserted in the bill on the recommendation of judges, and is almost entirely identical with the provision in the Victorian act. </para>

Clause 5 seeks to amend section 17 of the principal act by authorizing the imposition of an indeterminate sentence on a person apparently of the age of seventeen years or upwards who has been convicted of an indictable offence against any law of the Commonwealth should the court, having regard to his antecedents, character, associates, age, health, or mental condition, think fit.

Whereas the act provided that the Attorney-General may be satisfied on certain information given to him, not on oath, this measure requires that, at the very least, a police, stipendiary or special magistrate must be satisfied of certain things on information supplied on oath. </para>

                <para>I explained . that the reason why that section required amending was that it did not empower inspectors under the Post and Telegraph Act to seize unlicensed wireless sets. It is desirable that such officers should have that power, as it is undesirable that the time of police officers should be taken up in policing a measure of this kind which is essentially administrative and, to a large extent, deals with non-criminal matters. </para>

It is -quite true that the seizure of unregistered wireless sets is not specifically mentioned in the act, but an officer may be authorized to make such a seizure by the Postmaster-.General. It is not intended to make Commonwealth public servants policemen ; but it is desired to give officers of the Commonwealth, particularly inspectors under the Post and Telegraph Act, power to seize and bring before a justice any article which is forfeited or which they have reason to 'believe is forfeited. There may be provisions in the bill that are open to criticism, but I assure the Leader of the Opposition that there is nothing sinister in this clause. </para>

                    <para>- At all events the proposed amendment empowers the Minister to vest any Commonwealth officer with limited power. I mention this because a few months ago the Deputy-Director of Posts and Telegraphs for Queensland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corbett),</inline> ordered officers of his department to seize a number of wireless receivers that were owned by working people who had not been able to pay the licence fee.  His  action caused some excitement. Many prominent people in Brisbane held that the Deputy-Director had no authority to order the seizure of the instruments in question. Apparently, the Minister takes the view that any police constable, or any person authorized hy the Minister, may enter the workers' homes and seize wireless receivers if the licence has not been renewed. In his second -reading speech, he stated that this provision was inserted to provide for the seizure of certain wireless receivers. Evidently it will be competent for any officer so authorized to enter any person's home and take away his wireless receiver. </para>

                        <para>- Section 9, as amended by clause 3, will enact that any constable or Commonwealth officer who is authorized in that behalf by a Minister of State, may, without warrant, seize any articles which are forfeited or which he has reasonable ground to believe, are forfeited. I am entitled to discuss the whole clause, and should not be limited to the words in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> which it is proposed to insert. </para>

                    <para>. -  During my second-reading speech, I opposed this amendment. The Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> endeavoured to show me that I was wrong, and that all that was intended was to give certain persons power to seize wireless sets. It now appears that there is nothing in the principal act concerning wireless sets. If this amendment is agreed to, another force with disciplinary powers will be established. Its members will have authority to enter a man's home to seize goods including books, letters or documents which a Minister, who after all is only a transient authority, may consider to be forfeitable. The members of the police force are under the control of the Police Commissioner, and if necessary may be called before a court. The proposal is to establish a new force similar, I suppose, to that brought into existence when at Warwick during the war an egg was hurled at the then Prime Minister. Under this legislation, any Commonwealth officer may be called upon to perform duties which should be undertaken by the police. If there are not sufficient police constables, the number should be increased. A Minister should not have the power to force public servants to undertake such duties. </para>

A constable may swear falsely, but policemen can be enlisted only from the material offering, which is represented by the ordinary common citizens. We can make inspectors or authorized persons only of officers who can be trusted. One may conjure up all sorts of imaginary things about dishonest officers, and, going further, conjure up visions of dishonest Ministers of State, and in the last extremity envisage dishonest electors, but we can only use the material which we have at our disposal. We must assume that the administrator who gives effect to an act of Parliament will do his duty. The powers now proposed to be given to inspectors are no different from those already entrusted to policemen. I have quoted the Wireless Telegraphy Act merely as an illustration. It was in the minds of the framers of this legislation, and this provision was inserted to enable inspectors to seize unlicensed sets. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> has painted a picture of the lengths to which an officer might go; but the official must be authorized by a Minister of State before he can take any action. There is a vast difference between an authorized and an unauthorized officer. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown,</inline> possessing all the qualifications that go to make an excellent policeman - physique, sense of duty, and calmness of demeanour - enters a house without authority, and commits certain acts, he is liable to be punished for it. But, if he is sworn in as a special constable, and is authorized by the Government to enter the premises, thereafter he may do things which he could not do before. And that is the case of an officer authorized by the Minister. </para>

                    <para>. -  It would not be correct to say that this section is aimed at any particular person, or class of persons. But I repeat that what was particularly in mind was the forfeiture of unlicensed wireless sets. Before a set can be confiscated there must be some knowledge on the part of those responsible for the administration of the act that no licence-fee has been paid, and therefore that an officer is entitled to seize it. Accordingly the officer is authorized to take possession of the set, but before he does so he must have the necessary warrant to enter the house. It was the necessity for extending to officers of the Postmaster-General's Department powers which were already exercised by the police which mainly suggested this amendment, but I do not undertake to say any more than that it must be judged by its terms. It might not be limited, and probably will not be limited, to cases dealing with wireless telegraphy. All I said was that unlicensed sets presented a difficulty that suggested the clause, but the provision may be used for all or any of the purposes which the act covers. In no other way does it extend the scope of the powers now possessed by the department. Nor does it increase the harshness of the regulations with regard to the forfeiture of wireless sets. It only enables an officer of the Commonwealth Public Service authorized by the Minister in charge to do what a constable may already do. </para>

                        <para>- The policemen who previously could take action were under State jurisdiction. This section, therefore, changes the jurisdiction from State to Federal. A person who owns a wireless set is liable to have it confiscated by an officer of the Postmaster-General's Department for failure to pay the licence-fee. Now, the forfeiture of a set worth 20, 30, 40 or 50 guineas for the non-payment of a licence-fee of 21s. is too drastic. The clause gives very large powers to the Postmaster-General's Department. </para>

                <para>In order to show how unfairly this provision may operate, I instance my own case. Since I left my home for Canberra, my family received a letter from  the  Postmaster-General's Depart  ment  stating that I had not paid my wireless licence-fee. I had paid it ; yet, because of a mistake made by the department, my wireless set could have been seized under this legislation. I should like to know whether the  Deputy  Director of Posts and Telegraphs must obtain a separate warrant to search each house which he thinks contains an unlicensed wireless set, or whether he can act under a general warrant covering a number of houses. The power to enter a house and seize wireless apparatus merely because thelicence-fee has not been paid is too drastic. It may be that because of the non-payment of a fee of 21s. awireless set worth £24 will be seized. The words "reasonable ground to believe" would have applied in my case. Had I not been a  member  of the Senate it is more  than  likely that my wireless set would  have  been seized and  kept  indefinitely notwithstanding that I had  paid  my fee. </para>

                    <para>On the motion for the adjournment last evening, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald re  ferred  to a committee formed to  distribute  a grant of money  made  available by the Commonwealth Government and the Western Australian Government for the relief of those engaged in the pearl shell industry at Broome. He asked whether this committee had made a -report either . to the Federal Government or to the State government, and, if so, whether the report was available to honorable senators. I have had inquiries made and it appears that a report has not yet been made to the Commonwealth Government. The State government was, however, asked during . the current month whether a report had been submitted to it and, if so, whether a copy could be forwarded to the Commonwealth Government. A reply has notyet been received from the State government. Further consideration will be given to the honorable senator's request that the report he made available when this reply is received. </para>
