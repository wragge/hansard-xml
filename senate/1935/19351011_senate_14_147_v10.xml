                <para class="block">Although this measure lias a somewhat high-sounding title it is a small bill.  It  appropriates for works £170,000 from loan funds, the raising of which was authorized by Parliament in legislation passed last. year. The total of the- loan estimates for 1935-3G is £5,243,506. This total includes £3,000,000 for this year's estimated requirements under the Farmers' Debt Adjustment  Act  and £1,216,750 for financial assistance,  to  the States for unemployment relief works, &amp;c. These amounts are covered  by  appropriations passed during 1.934-35. The balance of the loan estimates, namely, £1,026,756, is for expenditure on Commonwealth works during this financial year. Of this total, £856,750 represents the balance of the loan appropriations passed last year for this purpose, leaving only the sum of £170,000 for which further parliamentary appropriation is now required. The amount' of £170,000 for which provision is made in the bill is for works in the Federal Capital Territory and includes £100,000 towards the cost, of developmental work incidental to the transfer of staffs to Canberra. This sum will be expended on the commence-ment of the construction of office accommodation, the erection of cottages which will be required for officers who are to be transferred to Canberra, and necessary engineering services. As honorable senators are aware, the Government has approved of the return to Duntroon of the Royal Military College. Therefore £70,000 has been included in the bill for the provision of architectural and engineering services incidental to the erection of cottages for occupation by tenants who are at present housed in cottages at Duntroon. </para>

                    <para>. -  Honorable senators on this side of the chamber will not offer any opposition to the speedy passage of this bill, because they are glad that the: Government is, somewhat tardily, doing the right thing by the Federal Capital Territory. In regard to the proposed expenditure of £100,000 towards the -cost of developmental works incidental to the transfer of staffs to Canberra, I am disappointed to find that provision has not been made directly or indirectly, to improve the conditions 'of persons living at . the Molonglo and Causeway settlements. I do not wish to establish a reputation  foi  always harping on the one subject; but the position which exists in these settlements is, putting it mildly, so objectionable and- so discreditable, that I cannot understand why the Government allows it to continue. The. cottages at the Causeway and Molonglo, which are built of single weatherboards, were erected for the accommodation of German internees, and were never intended to be used as permanent residences. Matters developed in such a way that 'our own people are now occupying them. There is no need for me to go into those details which I have so often recited in this chamber, but I should like to mention that the timber in the framework of the windows has shrunk to such an extent that the wind and weather is kept out only by stuffing newspapers into the crevices. That is a good way in which to use many newspapers, of which I have some knowledge. I read a paragraph the other day to the effect that good white paper manufactured from clean rags is used by newspaper editors upon which to print lies. Will the Leader of the Senate state whether the expenditure of  £50,000  would enable a start to be made on the provision of more suitable cottages for these people ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but those cottages will not be occupied by families now living at the Causeway and Molonglo ; they are being erected to house persons who can afford a better type of dwelling. I should like honorable sena.tors to visit these settlements, and if they wish to do so I shall be prepared to pay my proportion of the cost of hiring a bus for the purpose. They should go into the homes, as I did, and ascertain the unsatisfactory conditions under which the tenants are living. Many of the men who have been out of work for long periods, are being pressed by private firms acting as agents for the Government, for arrears of rent, and some are likely to be sued as they cannot pay the rent charged for these terrible shacks. We intend to support the bill, because it is obviously the intention of the Government to do a measure of justice to the Federal Capital Territory, and because the expenditure will provide employment. </para>

                        <para>- When I visited the Molonglo and Causeway settlements, I found that the houses, some of which I inspected very closely both inside and out, are a disgrace to Canberra, and par- ticularly to this Government. In one cottage the occupant had erected a tent fly to prevent the rain which was leaking through the roof from reaching the bed. A private landlord would soon find himself in trouble if such conditions were known to exist in buildings owned by him. It is the duty of the Government to see that its tenants are properly accommodated. Canberra is destined to be the garden city of the Commonwealth; but it cannot rightly claim that distinction while the unsatisfactory buildings now at Molonglo and Causeway remain. </para>

There is no obligation on the part of the Government to provide homes in Canberra for all who desire them. People who come here voluntarily have some responsibility in the provision of homes for. themselves, as in other capital cities. There may be some obligation on the Government to find other homes for those of its tenants who will be dispossessed of the buildings they now occupy at Duntroon, but the Government does not admit that it has a responsibility to provide homes in the Capital City for all who desire them. </para>

                    <para>.- The Leader, of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> referred to Brisbane. In no part of Queensland are there tenements comparable with those at Molonglo and Causeway, to which I referred. I did not say that it is the duty of the Government of the Commonwealth or of Queensland to provide a home for every one who wants to live in either Canberra or Brisbane; but I do say that the Commonwealth Government, as the landlord of these wretched places at Molonglo and Causeway, ought to be ashamed of itself, and should give to its tenants an opportunity to occupy better homes. The buildings which they now occupy were provided for those workers whom the government of the day was exceedingly glad to obtain in the initial stage of the building of this city. I have no desire to embarrass the 'Government, because my long experience in municipalities and in State and Federal governments has given me a knowledge of the responsibilities of office; but I say that it is the duty of the Government to have regard to the needs of the " under dog " before launching out on fantastic schemes for the benefit of those who are much better circumstanced. I hope that the Leader of the Senate will not think that, in referring to these unsatisfactory dwellings, the Opposition has indulged in captious criticism. I would indeed be glad if the right honorable gentleman were to say that the Government had decided to spend, say £40,000 in erecting suitable cottages for the people now occupying these unhealthy tenements. </para>

                    <para>.- The sum of £100,000 is to be appropriated by this bill towards the cost of developmental works incidental to the transfer of staffs to Canberra. Already, as has been pointed out this morning, considerable difficulty is experienced in securing homes in Canberra, and it would appear that if further transfers of . public servants are made, that difficulty will be accentuated. I should like the Minister to say when the staffs still remaining in Melbourne are likely to be transferred ? </para>

                        <para>. - This bill is one of the most important measures which has ever come before this chamber. It is important in that honorable senators may so easily be led astray by their preconceived notions and prejudices and mistake it for something entirely different from what it really is. I pass on to the Senate, particularly the Minister who moved the second reading, the following quotation which I read recently: - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Society has just two moral enemies - the man who will not speak his mind, and the man who tries to close the mouths of those who do not think as he does. </para>
                        <para class="block">The Opposition will fight this bill at every stage, using the forms of the Senate to place its case before the people of Australia. It is not so foolish as to believe that it can defeat the hill, because it knows that honorable senators opposite have already made up their minds concerning the measure, and that the Government, with their support, will secure its passage through the Senate. The bill is essentially one for consideration in committee; and it is there that the Opposition will most strenuously oppose it. "We have often heard it said that a decision can be arrived at without prejudice. The words " without prejudice" frequently appear in legal documents, but an article I read recently said that a citizen without prejudice does not exist, and that there is no such thing as a judge without prejudice. It went on to say that when a judge passes sentence on a prisoner he merely, through the individual in the dock, punishes himself for crimes which he has sub-consciously committed. Those who have read anything of psycho-analysis know that nothing is really as it appears to be on the surface. "We are ail of us more or less masquerading as something which we have no claim to be. The reason why I stress that is that I want honorable senators to approach this matter calmly and without prejudice, otherwise wrong decisions will be reached. The whole of this bill shows that it has been drafted in a spirit of fear entirely anti-Australian, a spirit which is the greatest of all the enemies of human kind. Every bill prepared by official draftsmen under instructions from the Government and brought before this chamber should be drafted in a spirit of hope in all that is best in this great Australian continent of ours and not in the spirit of that worst of all human enemies, fear. We should have both faith and hope in the Australian people and in the future of this  country.  Are we going to sit here like cowering wretches discussing a bill and casting our vote upon it as people with no conception of the historic mission of the Australian people, as people unacquainted with the type of citizen sent here from our kith and kin across the seas to lay the foundations of this country? Most of us in this assembly are elderly men. Are we in such a craven atmosphere mentally that we think all wisdom will expire when we expire? God help Australia if that is the position ! We will be recreant to our faith in this wonderful continent and to our belief in ite future possibilities if we pass this bill because it has been cast in a hopeless spirit of fear. </para>
                        <para>Let us consider for . a few moments the history of Australia. My parents emigrated to this country from the south of England a long time after the arrival of convicts on Australian shores. At that time I was young enough and enthusiastic enough - and I owe a tremendous lot both mentally and physically to my parents - to appreciate Australia and its history, and all that had happened in it and to it. I realized that hundreds of men and women had been sent into this country convicted only of political offences. It would make an interesting topic for discussion in this chamber if I could pass before the mental vision of honorable senators all the things that have happened in Australia. I knew some of the people who were transported to this country for political reasons. On the ship in which I arrived in Australia there  were  five or six families who had left the. Old Country because of their political convictions. The primary reason for their decision to emigrate to Australia was probably the same as that which brought about theemigration of my own family - father, mother and seven children - that there wasno chance in the Old Country for an. honest .man to get a living which would enable him to retain his pride. Five or six families on that ship left England because of the persecution to which they were subjected because they would not submit to what was then the orthodox view, When I say that, honorable senators may get some idea of how I appreciate my residence of considerably more than half a century in this wonderful country. I well remember in the Old Country when my father's 25s. was due on Saturday night, journeying into the city and standing over the grating in front of one of the largest emporiums, and my father handing up to me through the grating his weekly wages. When I took his wages home, I used to sit with my mother and jot down on the bellows at the fireside with a piece of chalk how that 25s. was to go round, and cover the needs of our family for the ensuing week. When I came to this country I was so embittered against England that I endeavoured to forget I had ever had any connexion with it, remembering only that I was now in the new land of Australia which offered a chance for every honest man and woman to build up a social order that would be worth while. </para>

I have lived long enough to see all the things which in my youth were regarded as unorthodox, nonpermissible and punishable by law, become the orthodoxy of to-day. Yet because of the craven fear of those responsible for this bill, because they have no faith in the people of Australia, and because they believe, apparently, that with the passing of this generation all -wisdom will die, it is proposed to penalize people for ideas which will be the accepted orthodoxy of the years to come. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> will not overdo the " young man in a hurry " act. If, when I resume my seat, I have failed to make a clear statement of my case, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> will have ample opportuity  to tear my presentation to pieces. I take it that some honorable senators present to-day were probably engaged in mining in the early days of Australian history, and that they have heard of a certain incident known in history as the Eureka Stockade. Australia is not ashamed of that incident, nor am I. I am proud of the fact that my forbears were prepared at all costs to themselves to defy the authorities of the day. They demanded their rights, and they got them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> wants to know if we could have got along without a penal code. In all ages people in positions of authority have sought to impose their will by force on those not in a position of authority. The actuating motive has not always been the same except that reliance has always been on force and fear. You may exterminate the enemies of to-day, but to-morrow they will rise from the ground ten thousand times stronger. In Austria, Italy and Germany the best elements in the community have been driven underground by just such measures as we are discussing here to-day. Those elements have been driven underground because the opinions they have expressed do not suit those in place and power. I do not suggest that we should not have penal laws, nor do I find any fault with our present form of constitutional government. On the contrary, recent happenings in Europe are the best indication of the fact that with a limited monarchy and our present parliamentary institutions British people have the best form of government known to the world. But the best of our liberties are not based on a penal code of this drastic nature. It i3 impossible to place in proper review all the facts, ideas and ideals which I should like honorable senators to have in front of them before they cast their vote on this measure; but in order to show the position we have reached, let us look back along the road over which we have passed. In this way we will get some idea of the road along which we must travel if we are to reach our goal - the fulfilment of Australia's historic mission as a great democracy in the southern seas.

Yet the best I can get from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> who is sponsoring the measure, is a smirk of smug satisfaction, because he has said something which he regards as witty. Queensland was the first Australian State to abolish capital punishment. When I was much younger, I took an active part in the campaign to do away with the death penalty, and the propaganda for that purpose was most unpopular. Long before those days British criminal code punished with death 32 crimes, ranging from sheep-stealing to murder. Every one of those crimes was rampant in that period of the world's history, but capital punishment was no deterrent. The repressive measures taken did not accomplish their objective. Gradually we overcame prejudices and modified the harsh legislation until we achieved the abolition of capital punishment in many countries. A tremendous reduction in the number of those crimes resulted, some of them disappearing altogether, and the numbers of others becoming negligibly small. I mention those facts not to extol the abolition of capital punishment, but to illustrate my contention that repressive measures do not achieve their purpose. The <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of the 16th November, 1934, printed a significant article from Shanghai, entitled "Battle of Sexes: Chinese Women's Victory. Law to be Revised." The women of 'China gained a remarkable victory, in that they have shaken themselves free of some of the age-old customs which bound them in mental and other forms of slavery. In Australia, too, the movement towards emancipation must continue, despite a repressive penal code. One writer has put it - </para>

                <para>Many years ago my father took a prominent part in reform movements, and he was ostracized because he had the courage to say that Britons would ultimately become a decadent race unless they established some standard to ensure the fitness of persons about to be married. When I want beautiful roses - and Canberra is the home of beautiful roses - I secure the best available stocks; then I plant them in the right soil and position, where they will receive the benefits of the sun and the necessary shelter. I see that the bushes have every possible chance, knowing that only in this way can they produce perfect blooms. If I want a perfect racehorse I obtain the best sire and dam and give the foal every chance before and after it is born. But the methods that are considered necessary and profitable in the garden and on the stud farm are apparently too good to be applied to the human race. The nations of the world will become decadent and will fail if the present methods of breeding the human race continue. Any two persons of opposite sexes can mate. If they have children, well and good ; if they have not, still well and good. It is regrettable that persons about to marry are not compelled to submit themselves for examination in order to ensure that the offspring will be healthy, physically and mentally. Unfortunately Australia does not appreciate the value of a thorough policy to bring it abreast of modern thought on. eugenics. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have the interjection; it discloses more than anything else the inferiority complex of the honorable senator and his incapacity to understand a reasoned argument. Until we are prepared to give human beings the same chance as we give to racehorses we shall have little cause to be proud of the children we rear. I anticipate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> will say that eugenics are not referred to in this bill. I am well aware of that. I am judging the bill, not so much by what it says, as by what it leaves unsaid. "When I was young theories such  as eugenics were " tabu ". I shall have none of these measures, because in my youth the same repression as is here proposed was applied to me and others who advocated the unorthodox and unconventional. Once upon a time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> belonged to the same political party as I do, and I figuratively sat at his feet and paid him reverence because he was then and still is a very capable man. But the time came when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> informed me that he controlled a secret service in Australia superior to any in the world, adding - " Collings, you cannot open your mouth without my knowing of it in Melbourne within 24 hours ". <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> cannot expect me to approach this bill with equanimity. I have been for many years what is called an agitator - an advocate of unorthodox ideas - and I have been dismissed from my employment and ostracized both socially and economically because of my enunciation of birth control and other advanced ideas which since have come to be generally accepted. This bill will penalize succeeding generations if they in their turn happen to hold unorthodox ideas. One of the greatest intellects in the world to-day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> B.

                            <para>- I do not propose to engage in a dissertation on Russia. I do not believe it is possible to put the Soviet policy into effect in Australia nor do I believe that it will ever be introduced here. Nevertheless, Sovietism is the only policy possible for the vast country of Russia, considering its present stage of development and its historical background. The Russian people are entitled to the system they have, but I would not support its introduction in Australia. I warn honorable senators, however, against the danger of disregarding what is happening in Russia. The greatest social experiment in the world's history is proceeding there and if honorable senators are wilfully blind to what is happening they will not be worthy representatives of the Australian people. They may not approve or disapprove of this remarkable social experiment but at least they should try to understand it. The titles of some of the articles in <inline font-style="italic">The Soviets To-day</inline> are - " The Central Association Soviet Republic ", " Hollywood Recognizes Soviet Art '", " Soviet Election, Exclusive News ". There is nothing wrong with those subjects. In my opinion it was a disgrace to prevent these publications from coming through the post, and I say that after having been responsible for driving the Friends of the Soviet Union out of the Australian Labour party organization in Queensland. I have made it my business to find out what the off-shoots of communism are. </para>

But this stolid island race remains unmoved, secure in the liberties for which its forefathers bled and died. </para>

                    <para class="block">Yet this bill, which we are now asked to approve, makes a direct assault upon cherished principles for which, in the Mother Country, the forefathers of some of us fought and died. The measure is a futile effort on the part of the Government to deal with certain conditions allegedly existing in this country. One section of it deals particularly with, espionage and the defence of the Commonwealth; the other relates more particularly to political matters. "When the bill is in committee, I shall have something to say about those obnoxious provisions. I am not so much concerned about that section of the bill dealing with espionage, because I know that it is the duty of the Government to provide legislative safeguards for the Australian navy, army, and air force. Yesterday, one honorable senator who, I think, is in the chamber "at this moment, very truthfully declared, " If you have a contented service; if you treat men properly and give them decent food, you need never fear revolution."  His  observation puts the position in a nutshell. It is the hungry man, the man who has been unjustly treated by his superiors, the man who is made to understand his position ofinferiority in the scheme of things, whether it be in the army, navy, or air force, who is ripe for treason. So I say that if we put our own house in order; if we see that men are treated as human beings and not as so many cogs in a machine without having the right to speak or act when they so desire, there will be no need for repressive legislation like the bill now before this chamber. But it is in relation to those provisions of the bill dealing with political matters that I wish to be a little more definite. </para>
                    <para>We have been told that, as regards the defence of Australia, the bill will bring Australia into line with the Mother Country. What a wonderful statement! I hope that I shall not be out of order if I say to Government supporters that if they knew what was going on behind the scenes in this country they would surely know that legislation similar to the bill which we are now considering was adopted in Great Britain fifteen years ago. Apparently, the wiseacres in this Government have at last awakened to the fact that legislation which was in force fifteen years ago in England is necessary to prevent this country from getting into trouble! Let me tell the Assistant Minister, if he does not already know it, that when Lord Peel introduced the Official Secrets Act in the British Parliament, he stated, in effect, that it embodied the war experiences of the Mother Country in countering espionage. The Assistant Minister, in moving the second reading of this bill, said that when forwarding to the Governor-General a copy of the English act, the Secretary of State stated that its main features were regarded by the Army Council "as of the utmost importance from the point of view of defence." The Official Secrets Act, I repeat, was passed in Great Britain in 1920, and as this bill is modelled on that measure, it is. a very belated attempt to bring the Commonwealth into line with the legislation of the Mother Country. </para>

                    <para>It is interesting to note that the bill is the outcome of suggestions made by the Army Council, but as fifteen years have passed since the Official Secrets Act was passed, it can ^hardly be urged that there is need to hurry. Do Government supporters really think that they know what is happening on the other side, of the world? Do they natter themselves that their information regarding events in Italy and Abyssinia is quite up to date? Have they not yet awakened to the fact that this Parliament - the Senate and the House of Representatives - is only a pawn in the game of international politics, and that the Government moves at the dictation of other people, some of whom are actuated by the most sordid motives? Do they not know that there is no war on with Australia? This being so, why this haste in preparing for war! </para>

All this foolish talk of protecting the Commonwealth is based on a false premise. If we really desire to protect Australia from aggression, we must prepare to withstand the Strongest nation that is likely to attempt sovereignty over us. But let us face the facts. "Who expects the 7,000,000 of people - men, women, and children - in Australia to do anything of the kind? We know, of course, that all this talk about the bill being designed to ensure our adequate defence is so much twaddle.

"We shall not achieve this end by following the course indicated by the Leader of the Senate, who, in answer to a question a few days ago, as to what was being done at the munitions factory at Maribyrnong, in Victoria, said that the Government did not intend to interfere with private enterprise to a greater extent than was necessary - that its desire was to ensure the training of a corps of operatives who would be able to render good service to this country in times of national emergency. But on every occasion when protective duties are under discussion in this chamber - measures calculated to contribute to the adequate defence of this country - many Government supporters rise in their places to oppose them, and shed crocodile tears about the awful fate of our primary producers, because they may be obliged to pay a little more for galvanized iron, or barbed wire. </para>

Peace is not attained by repressive legislation. Hyde Park, London, is regularly the venue of great political gatherings, which are harangued by leaders of various sections of thought, but no one in the Mother Country worries about, what is likely to happen; such gatherings are regarded as a safety valve. The good sense of the people can be trusted to assess at their true worth statements made at all such political gatherings. </para>

                    <para>It is significant, that repressive legislation is always directed against the workclasses. I may be mistaken but I feel sure it is always the workers who suffer. What action has the Government ever taken to prevent men like Eric Campbell and De Groot, two prominent members of the Nev/ Guard, to foment insurrection in our midst? In the early part of 1931 there was a strong probability - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> will be able to bear me out in this - of insurrection in Sydney. I know that the large firms had instructed their employees to be ready for a raid which did not occur. It was said that a Labour red army was to march up Macquarie-street, and that the New Guard under Campbell and De Groot and persons of that type was to attempt to suppress a raid - a raid which did not eventuate, because the New Guard, faced with the possibility of retaliatory action, became afraid. The Government should establish a peace council instead of allowing a defence council to function. We should have a Minister for peace instead of a Minister for Defence. We should devise ways and means to dispense with war. </para>

                            <para>- I am willing to stand my ground and to substantiate what I said last week or this week. Freedom and liberty of speech are the greatest principles for which mankind has fought throughout the ages. Thoughts are useless unless translated into words, and <inline font-style="italic">words are</inline> equally futile unless translated into action. This bill is deliberately designed to prevent the people of this country from having any opinion's of their own. We can go back to the time when the greatest teacher the world has ever known appeared on earth, and in turning back the pages of history, we find that Bte came into the arena with a revolutionary doctrine which did not suit the authorities at that time. It was decided that He must be suppressed and on Calvary He was crucified. This bill suggests that another Calvary is being erected and those who wish to speak the truth will again be persecuted. The attempt of the Government to suppress freedom of speech will bring about renewed vigour on the part of some individuals, and before long Ministers will have to eat heir words as others who have endeavoured to suppress the liberties of the people have already been compelled to do. I have complete confidence in the Australian people, and in. the policy of the Australian Labour party. These two factors combined should be more, than sufficient to combat any extreme  doctrines  which may be enunciated. The laws at present on the statute-book relating to sedition have not been brought into operation. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Gordon</inline> Hewart, in defending the Officials Secrets Bill in the House of Commons on the 10 th December, 1920, said - </para>

                        <para>Last night's disturbance at the meeting of the Melbourne University Debating Society was discreditable to those responsible. Those who ill-used the students holding communistic opinions were only imitating the hoodlums and  anti-Australian  foreigners who broke up a meeting on Sunday at the Yarra bank. They were not acting as educated men, but as disturbers displaying mob intelligence. An institution that stands for the free play of the intellect does not need defence by personal violence.

                            <para>- I believe that Australia has a contribution to make to the age-old struggle between liberty and suppression. Honorable senators opposite, like dumb, driven cattle, will support the Government when the division bells ring, without knowing the issues at stake. I do not want " George " to do my job; I have never wanted any one to do my job for me. When I have come up against authority, I have always got the worst of it ; but unlike some honorable senators, I have not hauled down my colours. I still stand for Australia, the land of hope and glory. In no other country is liberty so little threatened, except by measures of this kind. Ten years ago a fight for free speech was waging in the Commonwealth. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> is to be commended for the stand it took then. I do not suppose that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> would agree with the views expressed in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> in 1925 ; because he, and others like him, stand for the suppression of the liberty of the people under such legislation as the Crimes Act.

                    <para>This bill seeks to take away that right. When it has been placed on the statute-book we shall be shackled intellectually, economically, socially and artistically, to such an extent as to be unworthy of the great race from which we sprang and the great destiny of Australia.- This great democracy in the southern hemisphere has not been .built up along these lines. The foundations of Australia's liberty were laid by men who were transported from .the Old Country for picking up a rabbit which a gamekeeper had shot and thrown over the fence, and boys who were banished for stealing a few buttons or other articles valued at a few pence. They refused to recognize the lord's right to the fish and the water and the furry animals in the woods. Time passed, and then came the Eureka Stockade. Those men at Ballarat who resisted injustice set an example to the world, and  even  to-day good Australians make pilgrimages to the spot, and raise their hats in reverence and thankfulness that men were willing to fight and die in order that others might enjoy a greater measure of liberty. I wish to see Australians not with less liberty, but with more. If the Government would rid its mind of the fear complex and realize that all wisdom will not die with us, it would remodel this bill to make it less vicious and less drastic. </para>

Clause 6, relating to incitement to mutiny, merely gives the court power to impose a fine.

Clause 8 is a beneficial clause, which protects the individual from prosecution without the consent in writing of the Attorney-General. These are actual improvements to the Crimes Act, dictated by experience. Opposition to the bill is not justified in view of the experience and laws of other nations.

                        <para>. - I realize that the bill before us is merely one to amend and add to the original Crimes Act, which I understand is being brought into line with the Official Secrets Act passed in the United Kingdom in 1920. Why this action has been so long delayed I do not know. Honorable senators on this side are not opposed to certain provisions in the bill; we recognize the right of a government, whether it be a democratic government or a dictatorship, to safeguard its own interests and its people. But some clauses in the bill are most reactionary. This legislation encroaches upon the freedom which is the inherited right of every Australian. It gives greater powers to the police, an organization which has a definite interest in launching prosecutions and bringing them to asuccessful issue. If undue authority is given to the police, we shall increase the danger to democracy and imperil the freedom of individual citizens. The bill also limits freedom of expression, and on that account it is reactionary. I am a believer in liberty of speech. I speak feelingly on this matter, because in the course of my life I have been punished in various countries, and put in jail for vigorously asserting my right to freedom of speech. Every Australian should hold  very dear this principle of being permitted to express his thoughts with perfect freedom, so long as those thoughts do not run counter to the social interests of the community. I make that condition because it is possible for a small section to convert freedom into licence. Instead of conserving : the freedom of the people this reactionary measure has a tendency to destroy this cherished possession. J contend that all actions with the object of limiting freedom of expression tend to destroy democracy. Australia has a democratic system of government which gives persons the right to vote for whom they desire and to put into office what party they desire. If honorable senators wish to preserve that democracy at a time when in other parts of the world democracies are falling and dictatorships are being raised, they must not take any steps leading towards government by dictators. All measures which tend to lessen the right of free expression bring nearer the day when dictatorships will be established. </para>

                            <para>- Admittedly there must be certain limitations of action. But the Labour party contends that acts of Parliament now on the statute-book are sufficient to meet the situation. Consequently there is no need for the Government to limit, further the right of persons to express their convictions. Legislation enacted by the States, and the existing Commonwealth Crimes Act, give governments a sufficient power to control those bodies at which this amending bill is directed. But there is another danger. In setting out to suppress one section of the community the Government is resorting to measures which may penalize undeservedly other sections. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> in sententiously dilating upon the conditions in Russia, Italy and Germany, informed honorable senators that men who held views contrary to those of the powers that be in those countries were placed against a wall and shot. He cited the criminal codes of several countries and pointed out how fortunate we are not to bp living in them. I endorse his remarks whole-heartedly, and I think, we should be grateful that we are living in a free country like Australia. Because the Labour party recognizes our good fortune it is anxious to preserve the freedom we  now enjoy.  It does not follow that because a reactionary Russian regime took certain action to consolidate its position, we in Australia should follow that example! Because Italy, Russia or Germany adopts brutal methods, it is ridiculous to assert that Australia is given <inline font-style="italic">carte blanche</inline> further to limit the right of free expression. To my mind that is one of the most paltry arguments that could be adduced. In Russia, Germany and Italy revolutionary action led to the overthrow of democratic rule. Mussolini himself stated that he walked over the corpse of liberty, and Hitler said that democracy brought Germany to the verge of ruin. The  bolshevists  took charge of Russia at a time when a struggle for life and death was in progress, and there was no opportunity to hold an election, or set up democratic rule. Whether it be fascist or communist, a government which meets a revolutionary situation must take revolutionary action. If a civil war occurred in Australia various forces would align themselves one against each other; if the fascists were successful they would shoot the communists, and if the communists were successful they would find a way of getting rid of the fascists. </para>

                            <para>- Several issues were transmitted by post, but subsequently their transmission by post was refused. In the copy which I received there were articles describing Soviet industries, as well as a number of photographs, which I found of interest. The Postmaster-General, in reply to my question, stated that the articles were of such a nature as to justify the action of the Government in preventing their transmission by post. Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> handed to me his copy of the issue containing the article to which exception had been taken by the Government. To me it did not appear to be very objectionable. It referred to the difference between the discipline in the Russian and Australian navies, and stated that the Russian naval officers fraternize with the men whereas the Australian officers do not. It also mentioned a little trouble that occurred on one of the Australian vessels following the striking of an officer by one of the naval ratings. Subsequent to the publication of that article, the transmission through the post of <inline font-style="italic">The Soviets of To-day</inline> was forbidden. If trouble is to be avoided, the members of our naval, military, and air forces should be able to ventilate their grievances, and by that means give the authorities an opportunity to remedy them. If the Government prevents the publication of information; the trouble may become intensified. The Government is providing in this bill that it shall have the right to" prosecute the publisher of a book, periodical, or pamphlet who may not be conversant with the actual contents of the article published. On a previous occasion, the Leader of - the Senate said that an article which appeared in <inline font-style="italic">The Soviets of To-day</inline> might have incited the members of the Australian naval forces to commit an act of mutiny, and, therefore, the transmission of that paper through the post had been prohibited. Tory newspapers containing articles on Russia and other countries, far worse than that of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> complained, are transmitted by post daily. Under the proposed amendments, a publisher of a magazine may -be brought before a judge and charged, with inciting men to mutiny. </para>

                            <para>- We do not advocate revolution. In a democracy such as this, with its parliamentary and other institutions, there should be every opportunity for freedom of expression, upon which the existence of such institutions depends. At present the law is sufficiently comprehensive, but because the Government could not prove that a certain publisher in a previous prosecution " knowingly " published an article it proposes to amend it. Some poor unfortunate publisher who unknowingly publishes an article which may be likely to incite persons to mutiny may be imprisoned. If a person publishes matter which is directly responsible for a mutiny in the naval, military or air forces, he should be punished. </para>

In Great Britain they lingered until liberalism triumphed in 1832, but in this country they disappeared with the adoption of the free speech clauses.

                        <para>The true meaning of freedom of speech seems to bc this. One of the most important purposes of society and government is the discovery and spread of truth on subjects of general concern. This is possible only through absolutely unlimited discussion, for, as Bagehot points out, once force is thrown into the argument, it becomes a matter of chance whether it is thrown on the false side or the true, and truth loses all its natural advantage in the contest. Nevertheless, there are other purposes of government, such as order, the training of the young, protection against external aggression. Unlimited discussion sometimes interferes with these purposes, which must then be  balanced  against freedom of speech, but freedom of speech ought to weigh very heavily in the scale. </para>

In war time, therefore, speech should be unrestricted by the censorship or by punishment, unless it is clearly liable to cause direct and dangerous interference with the conduct of the war. Thus our problem of locating the boundary line of free speech is solved. It is fixed close to the point where words will give rise to unlawful acts. </para>

Unfortunately, in some police forces promotion is dependent on the number of convictions for which an officer is responsible. I see danger in vesting too much power in any police officer. There should be some good reason for altering the law to give greater powers to the police. In ordinary circumstances a Justice of the Peace would have to be notified, and information laid against the accused person, and witnesses would be subject to cross-examination ; but under this bill extensive powers are to be given to the police without any of those safeguards. </para><para>Clause 5 deals with indeterminate sentences. The Minister who moved the second reading told us that this provision had been inserted at the request of certain judges. It is not right that after a man  has been convicted and has served his sentence he should be committed to a reformatory, for a further term. I have always understood that a man who has served his sentence is deemed to have expiated . his offence, and thereafter is regarded as a free man. Under this bill that will not be so. </para><interjection>

                        <para>. - Despite the eloquence of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> I intend to support the bill. It does not contain anything which should frighten any decent citizen, nor is there anything in it to interfere with the proper exercise of liberty of speech or of the right of a publisher to publish reasonable comment. On the other hand, it does seek to restrict those who, in a spirit of licence rather than of liberty, seek not only to suborn the members of our military forces but also to  undermine the thought of the community. There is no man more despicable or dastardly in any community than the seditionist or the suborner. I welcome this amendment of the Crimes Act as a step towards eradicating the cancerous growth of Communism which, unfortunately, is spreading in Australia. Generally I support the bill, which will at least eliminate a number of very undesirable people. There are, however, two clauses in this bill which, I suggest to the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan),</inline> might be slightly altered.' It is proposed by clause 6 to amend the original act so as to provide for a monetary penalty suitable for application to a corporate body. Obviously, it is impossible to imprison a. corporate body, and yet imprisonment is the only penalty prescribed in the act. But I should like to see the amendment drafted to provide that a corporate body guilty of an offence against the act shall be punished by the imposition of a fine, and that an individual offender shall be imprisoned without the option of a fine. Many enthusiasts are always willing to pass the hat round and raise a substantial sum for the payment of such fines, and there are a number of misguided people in the Commonwealth who always imagine that they should be on the side of the so-called " under-dog." The result is that the delinquent, who often has not got 2s. to rattle on a tombstone, actually gets off scot-free. T draw the attention of the Assistant -Minister to that clause, and suggest that the penalty be altered to imprisonment, in the case of an individual, without the option of a fine. </para>

The working of the clause should be altered to provide that it shall he compulsory for the Attorney-General to prosecute a charge of sedition or subornation in time of peace or war. We do not want  seditionists  or  subornists  in Australia.

I somewhat resent the suggestion which appears in the press from time to time that, because the Senate does not sit so long or so frequently as another place, it does not do .so much work. It must be remembered that no law can be placed upon the statute-hook unless it has rereceived the approval of this chamber. So far as the actual law-making goes, this chamber must do the same amount of work as the House of Representatives, because it has to pass an equal number of bills. </para>

                    <para>[3.41]. - Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> asked me if I would make available to honorable senators a copy of the statement made by the Italian delegate to the League of Nations giving reasons for the action Italy is taking in Abyssinia, together with the reply of the Abyssinian delegate. The Government  has received only one copy of the report of the League Assembly's proceedings, and it is proposed to lay that copy on the table of the Library. The Printing Committee can then decide whether the report should be printed in whole or in part. </para>
