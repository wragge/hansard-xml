                    <para>[11.1]. - I ask leave to move without notice a motion for leave to introduce a bill to amend the Immigration Act. As we are nearing the end of this period of the session there can be no question as to the urgency of the action I propose to take. As a result of a recent High Court judgment a very serious flaw, which may have a serious bearing on our White Australia legislation, has been discovered in the act. </para>

                    PEARCE.The first point is that money paid by the Commonwealth to the State cannot, at any stage, be subject to a garnishee order. The next point has reference to the protection of the estate when the authority constituted under the State act proceeds to deal with the money. I direct attention to subsection 3 of clause 6, which provides - 2^0  grant shall he made under this act to ii. State unless or until there is in force in thu State legislation constituting an authority empowered, on application being made to it, and at its discretion, to take action having the effect of suspending, either wholly or in part, the rights of any secured or unsecured creditor of a farmer against that farmer.

                    <para>. - I do not agree with the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that clause 6 has any relevancy at all to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn.</inline> That clause simply suspends any payment on the part of the Commonwealth until the State has constituted a tribunal; but once that tribunal had been set up and appropriated the money to the farmer, that money would be subject to the garnishee laws, unless some special provision were made to the contrary. I remind the right honorable gentleman that the workmen's compensation laws which operate throughout the Commonwealth contain a special provision that when a tribunal which has been constituted to decide the amount of compensation has arrived at a decision, any payment under the judgment shall not bc subject to a garnishee order. If the Government intends to protect the farmer against the possibility of the money granted to him being garnisheed the bill should contain a specific provision which would place the matter beyond all possible doubt The amendment is a simple one and the Government should accept it, if only to make the position more certain. In my opinion, the clause quoted by the Leader of the Senate does not protect the farmer to the extent that he suggested. We are concerned only that the money appropriated for, and paid to, a farmer shall not be garnisheed. I understand that that is the purpose of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn's</inline> amendment. I am open to conviction, but I am inclined to think that, as the bill stands, once the tribunal has arrived at a decision, the money granted to a farmer could be garnisheed by a creditor, in which event the intention of the Government when it framed this legislation would be defeated. </para>

                    seems to be under some misapprehension as to how the machinery provided in this clause will operate. Before any money is paid the States must set up an authority and, by legislation, endow that, authority with power to issue a stay order. A meeting of the creditors is then called. Up to that stage no money has passed, and it does not pass until a composition has been arrived at. Otherwise any one of the creditors could upset the whole arrangement by taking proceedings to enforce his particular claim. But there is nothing upon which he could en force it at that stage, and as no money is paid to the farmer or to the creditor until a composition has been arrived at, there is nothing to garnishee. The money is still in the hands of the State. Not until the money is paid by the authority created by the State can any action be taken. But even then the authority is protected by issuing the stay order. Therefore, even at the stage when the money is actually passing, no creditor would have any right of garnishee. The money is not paid to the farmer, but to his creditors on his behalf. The benefit he derives from the composition is the writing-off of portion of his debt. The farmer is doubly protected, first, by the issue of the stay order by the State authority and, secondly, by the fact that the money is paid to his creditors. That is the price of, or the inducement for, the composition. Honorable senators will see that the amendment moved by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline>
                    is unnecessary.

                    <para>. -  One principle which has consistently been enunciated in this debate is that the Commonwealth Government shall definitely lay down conditions governing the disbursement of Commonwealth money by the States. There is much point in the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> inasmuch as it makes the position of the farmer doubly certain, by laying down definite conditions to govern the expenditure of this money. Unless this amendment is carried it is possible that even although a stay order has been issued, some " smart Alec " may secure a garnishee order and, if the sum is a considerable one, costly litigation may arise. The bill enables the State authority to take action in its discretion, but if the amendment is carried that authority will have no discretionary power; it will be bound by a mandatory provision in the bill that no payment shall be made under a garnishee order or other order of a State court. I support the amendment. </para>

honorable senator is endeavouring to make is that, if the grocer is one of the creditors to whom money is paid by the authority under some composition or arrangement it may be garnisheed  by a creditor of the grocer. But it cannot be  garnisheed  between the authority and the grocer. By reason of the stay order, payment may be made to the grocer as a creditor of the farmer, but when it gets into his hands it becomes part of his assets, and if he owes money he is subject to the ordinary State law governing the recovery of debts. The Commonwealth Government cannot follow that money to its final destination.

                <para class="block">Sub-clause 3 of clause 6 suggests that the compositions are to be voluntary, because if they were compulsory how could one creditor forestall another? The Minister said that some States are making compositions compulsory while others will be operating on a voluntary basis. Is the administration of this relief scheme to be at the whim of the party in power in a State? Surely it is wrong in principle to compel creditors to agree to a proposed composition. When the scheme was first suggested it was understood that the Government would furnish money for specific purposes, and that the creditors of the farmers would be induced, as far as possible, to agree to a composition. It now appears that if a State authority decides to make a composition compulsory the person to whom the debt is due must accept so much in the £1 whether he likes it or not. If the position is as stated there will be differentiation between the States in the meeting of the liabilities of  the farmers. Clause 6 conveys the impression to the average person that the whole scheme is voluntary; otherwise why should the power be given to protect some creditors against others? </para>

                    is under a misapprehension as the provision is not compulsory. The Commonwealth will hand the money over to the States which legislate as to the. basis on which a composition shall be achieved. If the Parliament of South Australia, which is responsible to the people of  that  State, may decide to make the scheme compulsory, that is a matter for its discretion. We do not give such ' legislation our imprimatur. Why should we?

                    <para>. - I am somewhat surprised at the statement of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> because State legislation cannot override the Commonwealth bankruptcy laws. Anything done by tribunals appointed under State laws cannot affect the Commonwealth law. The rights of creditors will be determined by State legislation and not under the Commonwealth law. As a creditor of a farmer, I could stand out against a composition, and could not be compelled to agree to it. I could, of course, sue the farmer unless legislation too iniquitous to contemplate were passed, providing that any person who did not agree to the arrangement would not get anything. The States cannot make this  or  any other Commonwealth scheme compulsory unless this Parliament provides that it shall be compulsory. I should like this scheme to operate in the way the Government intends, and the farmers to be relieved of some of the burdens they are now carrying. Creditors should be encouraged to accept a reasonable composition, but we should be certain that the money they will receive will go into their pockets and will not be taken by some one else to whom they owe money. The Minister referred to the case of a grocer prepared to accept a composition of 15s. in the £1, and who might get his creditors in turn to accept a similar composition. But if he were offered 15s. in the £1, knowing that someone would garnishee the amount in his hands under the bankruptcy law, he would decline the arrangement. This proposal should be debated in a non-party spirit, and the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> should be given the fullest consideration. We  should make certain that if a creditor gets money under a scheme of composition, it will not be  garnisheed  by someone else to whom he owes money. If that happens the creditor may be in a much worse plight than the farmer for whose assistance this measure has been, introduced. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> has just pointed out that, despite the views expressed by the Leader of the Senate, a State authority constituted under this bill cannot enter into an arrangement with the creditors of a farmer, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has emphasized that a team of bullocks could be driven through the provisions of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> which enacts that moneys granted to a State shall be used in pursuance of a scheme authorized by or under the law of a State for the purpose of discharging, in whole or in part, the debts of farmers by means of compositions or schemes of arrangements between farmers and any or all of their creditors. As it has been made clear that the Commonwealth law of bankruptcy is paramount, it follows that schemes of arrangement between farmers and " any or all " of their creditors will be nullified. This being a non-party measure, honorable senators on this side desire to assist the Government to make its provisions watertight. The Government should accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne's</inline> suggestion. If an unemployed artisan obtains work in a railway workshop as, say, a boilermaker, his rate of wages is determined by an Arbitration Court award, but, under the existing law, there is nothing to prevent a creditor from garnisheeing  his wages. Unless the provisions in this measure are tightened up we may be sure that some creditors will take advantage of their position to force their claims. For once I am in agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is awakening rather late in the day to the danger of compulsion. While there is not in this measure a provision to compel the acceptance of a composition with regard to a farmer's debts, the States are compelled to set up an authority which might, and probably would, exercise a certain amount of compulsion in the case of secured creditors. Sub-clause 3 of clause 6 enacts that no grant shall be made to a State unless or until there is in force in the State legislation constituting an authority empowered, at its discretion, to take action to suspend wholly or in part the rights of any secured or unsecured creditors of a farmer against that farmer. This need not occasion the alarm which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> expressed just now. </para>

Would it not be possible to suspend the rights of certain unsecured creditors until the secured creditors were provided for? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has mentioned the position of State authorities such as agricultural banks, which have advanced considerable sums to farmers.

Other creditors will be protected by paragraph 3 of clause 6. While some creditors might well afford to accept a fairly low composition the position of others might be such that if they did so they would find it impossible to meet their engagements. In conference with those to whom a creditor of the farmer owed money he might be advised to hold off for a year or two in the hope that with a better season ho would have a chance of securing the whole of the money due to him. </para>

                    Western Australia - Minister for External Affairs) [12.8].- I canno't help feeling that the mountain in labour has produced a mouse. The words proposed to be left out do not touch the question of compulsion. They do not make the scheme compulsory; it is the legisla'tion of the States that may do so. This paragraph is necessary to give the farmers the benefit of the scheme. If, say, the debts in a certain case amounted to £1,000 and a composition could be obtained in respect of £950 of those debts, obviously the authority would consider that that was worth bringing about. I have been amused by the attempt on the part of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline>

The Leader of the Government in the Senate will not deny that the proposed amendment, in substance, although its wording may need to be varied, meets with the approval of the Senate, and that it would help to make the position more positive. It can do no injury, while, on the other hand, it may prevent a possible misuse of the act. </para>

                    whether it is not a fact that a creditor of a farmer who has accepted a composition from the farmer will be liable under this legislation to have his composition garnisheed.  I remind the committee that there are many men in Australia to-day whose unfortunate financial position is entirely due to the fact that they have been carrying the farmers. If the creditors of the man who has given credit to the farmer have to wait until he has collected some money from the farmer, and if the farmer makes a composition of 10s. in the £1, how will they get on?

                        <para>- The Minister should not try to bluff me with a statement like that. I suggest that he should inquire from his legal advisers whether or not the money to be paid under this scheme can be  garnisheed  before the farmer gets it. There is danger that one creditor will get the lot, in which event the last state of other creditors and the farmer will be worse than the first. Earlier in the discussion I referred to the workmen's compensation law which ensures that the money paid by way of compensation shall never become subject to a garnishee. If we are to assist the farmer we must make it easier for the person from whom he receives favours to make arrangements with his creditors, in turn, and not be forced into the Bankruptcy Court. </para>

                        <para>- Were it not for the specific provision in that legislation, the money payable to the widow could be  garnisheed.  That will happen under this legislation, unless definitely prevented by statutory provision. Both the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> are lawyers, but neither has expressed an opinion on this subject. Personally, 1 have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> disagrees with the view expressed by the Leader of the Senate. The only opinion we are asked to accept is that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and all he can say is that there is no doubt in his mind, and that it really makes no difference whether workmen's compensation is paid to the workman himself, or his widow or other dependents, because, in any case, it goes to the workman. In the interests of the scheme, and in order to make assurance doubly sure, I appeal to the right honorable senator to insert a provision which will ensure that the creditor of a farmer, when accepting a composition, may know that he, in turn, can approach his creditors without fear of his money being garnisheed. If that be done, it will be possible for all parties concerned to meet amicably, with the result that the farmer will, in fact, be assisted, and the scheme prove successful. </para>

If the honorable senator were a creditor of a farmer, and doubted whether, if he accepted a composition, he would be able to pay his own creditors, he would hesitate before accepting the composition. He would probably prefer to take advantage of the bankruptcy legislation. </para>

                    <para>. - Although the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has said that, in this matter, the Government has followed sound legal advice, I do not think that we can trust that advice. Only yesterday the decision of the High Court in the Griffin case, following an earlier decision in the Kisch case, provided further evidence of the incompetence and blundering of those who frame our laws. We cannot accept as sound the legal advice on which the Government rests its legislation. Thousands of pounds have been lost to the Commonwealth because of the blunders made in connexion with Herr Kisch and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin.</inline> Unfortunately, there has been not merely one blunder, but a series of blunders from start to finish. Australia has been held up to ridicule because ofits attempt to keep two men out of this country. Yet, in spite of this evidence of incompetence, the Leader of the Government in the Senate asks us to rely on the advice which has been tendered to him. </para>

It seems extraordinary to me that, in spite of all we have heard about preference to returned soldiers, a soldier settlement scheme financed by Commonwealth and State moneys should be definitely excluded from any relief afforded by this bill. I am aware that some reductions of soldier debts were effected a considerable time ago, but the circumstances of many settlers necessitate the further relief asked for by the Government of Western Australia. I do not know why these restrictions were- placed in this legislation, because they are entirely opposed to the policy of the Country party, as laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page in. a national broadcast on the 14th August, 1934. On that occasion he said - </para>

                    <para>It is useless approaching any creditors with a composition or arrangement involving scaling down the debt without being able to offer an immediate consideration. The chief class of immediate consideration will, of course, be cash, and this is an essential when dealing with unsecured creditors. Others available would include power to offer and effect a writing down, of Crown dues, power to offer secured creditors quarterly interest payments at a rate agreed upon over specific periods; power to offer guarantees on behalf of the Crown. </para>

                <para class="block">He said that the scheme would include relief from Crown debts. That is the very thing for which I am asking. In spite of those statements, broadcast from one end of Australia to the other and repeated on platform after platform throughout the country, debts due to the Crown are excluded by this legislation. If my amendment be carried it will be necessary to re-allocate the amounts to be granted to the States, because the small amount provided for Western Australia has been based on the understanding that more than one-half of its settlers who are debtors of the Agricultural Bank will be excluded so far as their debts covered by mortgages to that institution are concerned. A large proportion of the debtors of the Agricultural Bank have practically no other creditors, because, unfortunately, their circumstances are so involved that the bank has to supply them with their every requirement, including sustenance. As a matter of fact, the Agricultural Bank legislation recently passed in Western Australia gives to the bank an automatic lien over the stock on their properties, and they have been asked to give full security over the whole of their possessions. This matter is a very important one. If this amendment is not accepted, the mortgage and interest debts of more than one half of the settlers of Western Australia will be excluded from any relief under this legislation. </para>

                    PEARCE (Western Australia - Minister for External Affairs) [2.23]. - The Government cannot accept this amendment, as it would be quite foreign to the whole scheme of the bill. As I have already pointed out this is a bill designed to afford relief to farmers, and not to relieve State budgets. What vill t be the effect if

                    amendment is carried? The money provided under this bill will not go to the farmers; it will go to the farmers' creditors. Therefore, if the debts due to the Agricultural Bank were included the money allocated to Western Australia would go largely to that bank. In addition, there are the Rural Bank of New South Wales, the State Bank in South Australia, and the Agricultural Banks in Tasmania and Queensland. There is nothing to prevent the State Government of Western Australia from writing down these debts; but, of course,  the liability would remain with the State.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline>
                    has informed us that, to-day; the debts owing to the Agricultural Bank  of Western Australia amount to £13,000,000 ; but I remind the honorable senator that the Agricultural Bank is backed  by tthe  State Government nf Western Australia, and, therefore, any money owing to that bank is really owing to the Stat? Government. There is nothing to prevent the Western Australian Government, if it wishes, from setting up under this scheme a State authority endowed with the power to write down Crown debts. The State authority is appointed by the State Government under its legislation, and the Government may say to such an authority, " If private creditors will agree to the writing down of their debt, you aro authorized to agree to the writing down of the debts due to the Agricultural Bank ".

                        <para>- And no doubt will have to write down a good deal more. There is nothing to prevent them from empowering their own State authorities to agree to a writing down of the debts as a part of a general composition. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> was not correct in saying that all the debtors of the Agricultural Bank will be excluded under this proposal. Most of the clients of the bank are indebted to the merchants for cornsacks and petrol, and to the storekeepers for supplies. They have private debts in addition to their debt to the Agricultural Bank. The latter is largely a debt incurred in respect of capital assets, such as clearing, fencing, and the sinking of dams. The royal commission which inquired into the wheat industry in Western Australia some time ago estimated the amount of debts due to the Crown and also to private individuals. A very large sum is involved in the latter class, and, in respect of such debts, the farmers will be able to secure relief. </para>

                    <para>. - In extending sympathy to the amendment, one suffers the incurable handicap of defending past governments - at no time a task in regard to which one can work up any burning enthusiasm. But the effect of paragraphs e and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> is to circumvent the purpose of the bill. As the Minister says, the object of this bill is to help those who need relief in respect of their debts. But, at the same time, provision is made that if a. debt is due to the Government, the person who should be helped shall get no relief at all. Let us examine the nature of the debts due to the governments. We know well enough that over an extended period it has been the trend of public policy in this country, rightly, T think, for governments to step in, and, in a practical way. extend sympathy to citizens in distress. Governments  have  come to the aid of distressed sections of the community in a way that private enterprise would not do. Having done that, and having incurred obligations, a sympathetic Government is now told that it is not to get any reward or recognition at all, and that it may please itself as to what steps it takes to ease the burdens of its debtors. It is a case of the Commonwealth Government " passing the buck " to State governments. The Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry stated that the total debts of the wheat-growers amount to about £151,000,000. That debt rests upon a tripod, one leg of which represents the governments of the wheat-producing States which are carrying a debt of £50,000,000. Another £50,000,000 is divided between the banks and other financial institutions, and the other £50,000,000 among machinery merchants, traders and private mortgagees. On an average the governments of the wheat producing States bear one-third of the indebtedness of the wheat-growers, which has been incurred in accordance with frequently-applauded public policy. How do these four wheat-producing States compare with the Commonwealth which possesses infinitely greater resources ? If the amount of £50,000,000 owing to these governments is divided by four we find that each government is standing under an indebtedness of £12,500,000. This bill provides for the raising of £12,000,000 by the Commonwealth Government. While the Commonwealth is claiming credit for what it is doing, the relief it is offering is equivalent only to the burdon which the government of each of the wheat producing States is now bearing, and which they are now :asked to write off or forgo, although the financial capacity of State governments is infinitely less than that of the central government. Each State government, by contributing £12,000,000, as the Minister suggests, would be doing as much as the central government is doing under this bill. If the Commonwealth Government were to do as much as the government of each wheat-producing State is expected to do, this measure should provide for the appropriation of £48,000,000, and not £12,000,000 only. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The plea has been put forward that this legislation is not intended to improve the position of State budgets. I remind the Minister that the accounts of subsidiary organizations such as the Agricultural Bank in Western Australia, with which I am most familiar, water supply authorities and similar organizations in other States do not come into the State budgets, but are kept entirely separate. According to the report of the Wheat </para>
                <para class="block">Commission, the Agricultural Bank of Western Autralia already has a deficit of £6,000,000, and it is expected to carry its present burden without assistance from the Commonwealth. Analysing that indebtedness we find that it has been incurred in providing practically everything settlers need, and which they have found it difficult to obtain from private sources. The Agricultural Bank of Western Australia has assisted the farmers of that State materially. In the first place it has helped them to clear their land, and during certain seasons has provided them with seed, super, horses, harness and sustenance. I suppose that similar assistance has been given by the governmental institutions in the other States. Although these concerns have rendered such valuable service to the producers they are now being penalized by being asked to wipe out or to write down the debts which the farmers have contracted' with them. The main object of this bill is to assist settlers, but those indebted to an agricultural bank or a similar State institution will not obtain any relief unless the State Government is willing to afford it. That is a negation of the expressed intention of the Government to help those who cannot help themselves. Governmental institutions are doing what , private traders have declined to do and have incurred obligations of no mean dimensions. A way out of the difficulty would be to analyse the debts and ascertain to what classes the mam items belong. Items of capital expenditure and unpaid rates and taxes could be dealt with as State governments desired, but those governments should be given credit for debts relating to current expenditure, such as assistance in clearing the land and other work of that nature. If the measure is allowed to pass in its present form, Western Australia and South Australia will be shouldering as big a burden as the Commonwealth; but Victoria and New South Wales, which are stronger States, will not have to bear the same strain. I have stressed the point previously that it is manifestly unfair to treat State institutions in this way merely because they have rendered a service which would not  be provided by private traders. If money has been paid by the agricultural banks to purchase seed and super, the cost incurred will be shown in the records. I trust that the Government will redraft the bill with the object of giving help to those settlers who are indebted to the Crown. If it will not do that some other means will have to be adopted to ensure that justice is done. </para>

                    <para>The bill completes the programme of financial assistance to the wheat industry in respect of the 1934^35 season. The major provision for relief to wheat farmers is contained in the Wheat Bounty Act 1934, and the Wheat Growers Relief Act (No. 2) 1934, which were passed in December, following upon the recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry. The royal commission advised that immediate assistance should be given in respect of the 1934-35 harvest, and that an amount of £4,000,000 should be made available for disbursement in the following manner : - </para>
                    <para>Firstly, by a bounty of 3d. a bushel on the marketable wheat delivered for sale; secondly, by advances to be made to the States to an amount of £1,926,750 for the purpose of enabling them to make payment of approximately 3s. an acre on wheat; and, thirdly, by making the  balance of the £4,000,000 available for the assistance of farmers who suffered special hardships in respect of the 1934-35 harvest. </para>
                    <para>The Wheat Bounty Act 1934, provides for the payment of a bounty of 3d. a bushel on wheat sold or delivered for sale from the 1934-35 harvest. So far as it can be estimated at the present time, the expenditure under that act will be £1,500,000. The Wheat Growers Belief Act (No. 2) 1934 provides for the payment of grants to the States of such amounts as are necessary to' enable the States to make payments to wheat-growers at the rate of 3s. for each acre sown- with wheat for grain during the year 1934. It is anticipated that the expenditure under that act will not be less than £1,926,750. This bill deals with thebalance of £573,200 out of the £4,000,000. </para>
                    <para>The reason why the legislation passed in December did not embrace the full amount was that some doubt then existed as to the proper manner in which the distribution should be made. The royal commission had indicated in its report that the matter would be further investigated with a view to ascertaining the needs of the farmers in the different States, and that a supplementary recommendation would be made at a later date. That recommendation is contained in the special report that, has already been laid on the table of the Senate for the information of honorable senators, and the Government is taking this, the first opportunity, to introduce legislation to compete the distribution of this £4,000,000. </para>
                    <para>The royal commission advises that the most recent data obtainable indicates that the amount which will remain for the relief of cases of special adversity out of thetotal of £4,000,000 to be provided by the Commonwealth Government will be approximately £573,250, and recommends that it be distributedamongst the States as follows: - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="146332193504092_15_0.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para>The reports of the royal commission refer briefly to the nature of the adverse conditions experienced in each State, and advise that the allocation recommended has not been determined by the application of arigid formula, but rather as a result of the careful weighing of the conditions existing in the several States. The commission has expressed the view that the applicationof a hard and fast rule would not have achieved an equitable distribution between the States, having regard to the numerous causes of special adversity which must, be fully recognized and provided for in any scheme of allocation. </para>
                    <para>The Government is very anxious that those farmers who have suffered severely from the adverse conditions referred to by the commission shall be granted special assistance at the earliest possible date, and, accordingly, has brought down this bill immediately upon receiptof its report. The bill is to be regarded as bringing to completion the measures decided upon by the Government for financial assistance to wheat-growers in respect of last season. It prescribes the amounts that are to be granted to the several States in accordance with the recommendation of the commission, and specifies that the amount granted to each State shall be applied by it to the provision of relief to wheat-growers who satisfy the prescribed authority that they are in adverse financial circumstances, and that they have suffered serious loss by reason of either specially adverse seasonal conditions or extensive damage to their crops arising <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> the prevalence of pests or disease. Any amount applied by the State is to be paid direct to the wheat-grower. I commend the bill to the Senate. </para>

                <para>The purpose of this bill is to amend certain sections of the Immigration Act 1931-33. It has been rendered necessary, or, at least, desirable, by reason of a decision given yesterday by the High Court. The act, as' it stands, contains a number of far-reaching provisions dealing with the proof of what constitutes a prohibited immigrant. Sub-section 3 of section 5 reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In any prosecution under either of the last two preceding sub-sections, the averment of theprosecutor, contained in the information, that the defendant is an immigrant who - here follows a list of actions which he might have performed - shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary by the personal evidence of the defendant either with or without other evidence. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">In other words, when the prosecution alleges certain things against an immigrant, those things are deemed to be proved unless the person concerned personally goes into, the witness box and produces evidence to ' the contrary. The onus of proof, which usually rests with the informant, is, by that provision, reversed and made to rest upon the person accused. The next important provision is section 7, which reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Every prohibited immigrant entering or found within the Commonwealth in contravention or evasion of this act shall be guilty of an offence against this act, and shall be liable upon summary conviction to imprisonment for not more than six months, and in addition to or substitution for such imprisonment shall be liable pursuant to any order of the Minister to be deported from the Commonwealth. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is the section under which by far the greater number of prosecutions against suspected prohibited immigrants have been launched. Usually it has been applied in cases where Asiatics have come to Australia as members of ship's crews; sometimes, indeed, they have entered through our northern gate. But by whatever means they entered, proceedings against them were always taken under section 7. The first requirement is to prove that a man is an immigrant; the second is to prove that he is a prohibited immigrant. At times, particularly when dealing with an Asiatic, it is difficult to prove when and how a person arrived in Australia. Parliament thought it would not be unduly straining the laws of evidence to say that this was peculiarly a matter within his own knowledge, and to require him to prove that he was rightfully in this country. In other words, the onus of proof was transferred from the Crown to the person charged. Numberless successful prosecutions have been launched under section 7, but yesterday, in a case in which the defendant was one Griffin, the High Court held that the averment section could not be relied upon to prove the charge against him. </para>
                <para>Griffin entered Australia from New Zealand, and was deported as a prohibited immigrant; he subsequently returned secretly from New Zealand in disguise, and landed in Sydney, leaving his luggage behind him. He was apprehended, brought before the court, and sentenced to imprisonment. In ordinary circumstances he would have been deported before his term of imprisonment had expired. But he launched an appeal, and was liberated on bail. I want to assure honorable senators that this amendment is not aimed at Griffin, but has for its purpose the closing of a gap in our White Australia legislation which the decision of the High Court yesterday revealed. By this short amendment the Government is endeavouring to make it plain that in cases of this nature the onus of proving that he is not a prohibited immigrant shall be placed upon the person charged. </para>
                <para>SenatorRae. - That is a complete reversal of a principle of our much boasted British justice that the onus of proof shall not lie with the defendant. </para>

                            <para>- Exceptions to the general legal principle that the onus of proof shall rest on the prosecution are not uncommon. The immigration laws are not the laws of any particular party or person ; they have been enacted with the consent and approval of every political party in Parliament, and almost every party has taken a hand in moulding the provisions of the act. No political party has ever opposed the provision which the honorable senator now criticizes. An amendment of the law is particularly necessary because in the past numerous foreigners have been smuggled ashore. Once they have landed and gone into hiding for a few days, and the ships by which they arrived have gone away, it is almost impossible to prove that they are immigrants, prohibited or otherwise. All that is known of them is that they are in Australia. Is there any hardship in saying to a man "All the facts are within your knowledge; you must estab- tish or set up a prima facie case that you are not in Australia in contravention of our laws ". </para>

Is there any hardship in that? If a case were brought against a man who had been here for 30 or 40 years there might be some hardship involved in compelling him to establish his right to remain. But we are amending the act to deal with men who have been in this country but a short time. As I have said, the Government is merely closing up a gap which has been revealed in a section of the act which was thought by every party in Parliament to have operative force. </para>

The officers of the Law Department have for some time been considering the complete recasting of the existing provisions of the act in order to make them a little clearer than they are at present. I hope that this bill will do what is immediately required. While the law exists in its present form  a  considerable influx of undesirable immigrants might take place. </para>

                        <para>. -  Honorable senators on this side of the chamber intend to support this measure to amend the Wheat-growers Relief Act of 1934, under which certain moneys were made available to assist necessitous wheat-growers. In addition to the amounts previously granted, provision has now been made to make further grants to all the States on  such  a basis that those needing  the  most money will derive the greatest benefit. The allotment to the States which grew wheat for export would appear to be in proportion to the number  of  necessitous cases, which is the proper basis. </para>

                        <para>. -  There was a good deal of disappointment in Western Australia concerning the allotment  proposed  in the bill, because it was anticipated by the Wheat-growers Union and the Primary Producers Association in that State that, in view of the drought and rust which has affected the wheat crops, the allotment for Western Australia would be higher. The representatives of the Western Australian Wheat-growers Union telegraphed to the Government asking that the amount to be granted to that State be increased to £200,000, and the Minister for Lands, who expected that the minimum amount allotted would be £150,000, was disappointed to find that it had been fixed at £137,000. In view of the explanation of the Minister that the allocation is based on the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry, I doubt whether I would be more fortunate in moving an amendment to this bill than I was in endeavouring to amend the more important measure which the Senate has just passed. I protest against the quota allotted to Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>. -  This measure is to some extent complementary to the Loan (Farmers' Debt Adjustment) Bill, which we have just been considering, and which was to help those who may benefit by assistance. It was not to help those sufficiently well circumstanced to carry on unaided, but to aid wheat-growers on the border line, who with a certain amount of assistance may pull through. This bill covers more particularly those in adverse financial circumstances, as set out in sub-clauses 2 and 3 of this clause. I have stated previously that there is always an element of risk in dealing with necessitous cases, and I am certain that assistance so given does not, as a general rule, result satisfactorily to those concerned. A person in necessitous circumstances has to disclose his private affairs to officials, even though he may not receive help ; but the same objection does not exist to the same extent in respect of necessitous wheat-farmers, many of whom have already disclosed their private affairs to farmers' relief boards or similar bodies. The amounts to be allotted to the various States under this bill ha.ve already been discussed, and I understand that the Government intended to consider the representations made in the House of "Representatives before the bill was considered in the Senate. I have not analysed all the figures, but have made a comparison between the amounts to be allotted to Victoria and South Australia. Under this measure, Victoria is to receive  £192,000,  and South Australia  £127,000,  or roughly two-thirds of the amount to be received by Victoria. In the two States mentioned the average yield per acre, the area placed under crop, and the total production in bushels, are somewhat similar; but for the purpose of this grant the advantage should be on the side of South Australia. The average yield in bushels an acre over ten seasons, from  1922  to  1932,  has been - Victoria,  12.32,  and South Australia,  10.20.  According to the figures published in the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year-Booh,</inline> the total area under crop over a period of six years ended  1932-33  was - Victoria,  21,746,238  acres and South Australia  22,351,352  acres. The areas are within  3  per cent, of being the same. Over a period of six years ended  1932-33,  Victoria produced  242,005,588  bushels, and South Australia  199,631,441  bushels. The total production and the yield per acre in South Australia over that period was considerably less than in Victoria. On the other hand, the actual area under crop, as stated above, has been higher. These figures emphasize in every respect that South Australia has been less fortunate in the matter of productivity than Victoria. The area under crop in Victoria this year is  2,861,000  acres, while the estimated area in South Australia is  3,130.000  acres, and, according to a telegram despatched by the South Australian Statistician to the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> the estimated yield in South Australia is  29,000,000  bushels, although it may be considerably less. </para>

The disaster would be greater in the State having the smaller yield from a larger area under crop: From the figures I have quoted, it will be seen that there is not a great difference between the two States in the matter of area and production, but South Australia is being alloted only two-thirds of the amount to be allotted to Victoria. </para>

                        <para>. -  Figures made available by the Farmers Assistance Board in South Australia, in respect of wheat-growers in straitened circumstances, show that an average of only  2.085  bushels an acre has been harvested from  1,060,000  acres, and that an average of  5  to  6  bushels has been obtained from  900,000  acres. The Minister for Agriculture in South Australia should by now have received the estimated production for the present season. In many cases the actual yield has been below the official forecast. At many country sidings this year, wheat deliveries were not within  50  per cent, or  60  per cent, of the amount received in the previous season. The average production from  1,060,000  acres, representing one-third of the total area under crop, was only  2.085  bushels, and the average yield from a further  900,000  acres was from  5  bushels to  6  bushels. Victoria would have to show figures worse than this to justify receiving  £192,000  as compared with  £127,000  allocated to South Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In some districts, crops were almost completely destroyed. On the west coast, notably in the vicinity of Kimba, Cowell, Mangalo, and down as far as Tumby Bay the farmers have reaped little or no harvest, and have cut very little for hay. Many of them had to send stock away for pad.turage. The clause provides that the money to be granted to a State shall be used for the relief of wheat-growers who can satisfy the prescribed authority that they have suffered serious loss and hardship by reason of specially adverse seasonal conditions or extensive damage caused to crops by pests or disease. Farmers in the Murray Valley districts of South Australia have had very low yields this year. Many growers in the north-eastern portion of that area have been obliged to purchase seed for next season or make arrangements to obtain it from the Farmers Assistance Board. If we assumle that Victoria and South Australia had to grant extra assistance to farmers in respect of 1,500,000 acres which have returned very low yields, South Australia with an allocation of £137,000 would be able to pay at the rate of ls. 8. 3d. an acre, whereas Victoria would be able to pay 2s. 6.6d. an acre, or lOd. an acre more than South Australia. It appears, from particulars available regarding averages and acreages, that the needs of the two States are about equal, and, this being so, the total- amount of £319,000 to be allocated to Victoria and South Australia should be apportioned on a basis more equitable to South Australia. Last year, when £3,000,000 was allocated to the States for distribution on an acreage basis, the States paid varying amounts to the farmers in need of assistance, but in some States they received ls. an acre more than was paid in others. In the distribution of this money, the Government should consider the actual yield this season. The allocation in the bill is distinctly unfair to South Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I realize that in South Australia there is a belief on the part of the farmers that, in allocating this money, the Government has not dealt as generously with that State as it should have done. Since the factors to be taken into consideration are so varied, honorable senators will, I hope, realize the impossibility of allocating any amount with mathematical justice. The Wheat Commission, in its report dated the 20th March, gives a summary of the considerations which weighed with it when dealing with the claims of the wheat-growing States. It. is admitted that the information then available to it was in the nature of estimates rather than exact figures, but the commission seems to have predicted the actual results with a good deal of accuracy. Referring to the position in South Australia the commission stated that there were indications of wonderful recovery in some districts and expressed the belief that the average yield per acre would be about normal in certain districts that had suffered earlier adverse seasonal conditions. I also remind honorable senators that, in arriving at its estimate, the commission had at its disposal information which is not in the possession of honorable senators themselves. </para>

                            <para>- I think it did. The commission stated that the allocation had not been determined as the result of a complex, rigid formula, but rather as the result of a careful weighing of all relevant factors. It further expressed the view that the application of a hard and fast rule would not have resulted in an equitable distribution of the money between the States, having regard to the numerous cases of adversity which must be fully recognized and provided for in any scheme of allocation. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Herbert</inline> Gepp, the  chairman  of the commission, added that the recommendation was approved by all the members of the commission: I therefore venture to suggest that the commission was more likely to arrive at rough justice - nothing more than that could be expected in the circumstances - than are honorable senators who have listened to what are, no doubt.. genuine cases of distress among their constituents, but nevertheless are stories told by those having a deep interest in the allocation of this money. </para>

                            <para>- The final estimate shows that in South Australia, at all events the total yield is not so high as it was last year. Last year the estimated yield was 33,000,000 bushels and the actual crop was 34,000,000 bushels. The estimate for this year was 29.000,000 bushels, but wheat merchants contend that  the actual yield will not be more than 56,000,000 bushels. I therefore contend that the additional hardship suffered by South. Australian farmers this year owing to adverse seasonal conditions should be taken into consideration in the apportionment of the money to be provided under this bill. It is unfair that the amount provided for that State should be only £127,000 as against £192,000 for Victoria. If it could be shown that cases of hardship among Victorian farmers were greater by 50 per cent, than in South Australia I should be prepared to Accept the allocation, but I feel sure that the actual figures would not disclose this position. The Government should withhold payment of this money until more accurate information is available concerning the yield in each State this year. </para>

                            <para>- Last night when we were discussing the Debt Adjustment Bill we were told that the more populous States would have to find the larger proportion of the money to be made available for the rehabilitation of primary industries, and that if the amount were distributed on a population basis, some of the wheat-producing States would receive much smaller amounts than were actually allocated to them. This is not altogether correct, because we have to take into consideration the fact that the smaller States do a large amount of trade with manufacturers in the eastern States. South Australia has a huge adverse trade balance with Victoria and New South Wales. It makes large purchases of textiles and machinery from Victoria, thus helping to maintain employment in Victorian factories. Why should we not participate on an equitable basis in any distribution for the assistance of the farmers when the measures of their distress in the two States are almost identical? We should view this matter from an Australian, not a parochial, angle. There should be equal distribution throughout the Commonwealth. I am pointing out that, as regards cases of hardship for which this bill makes provision, the position is very much worse in South Australia than in Victoria. I feel that the Government has not given due consideration to the amount of hardship suffered by farmers in South Australia owing to adverse seasonal conditions. </para>

                        <para>. - I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman</inline> that the wheat harvest in Victoria this year has been very disappointing. The total yield was 28,000,000 bushels, as compared with recent averages of 40,000,000 bushels. In South Australia this season the yield was 29,000,000 bushels, compared with an average yield in recent years of 35,000,000 bushels; so relatively South Australian farmers are in a somewhat better position. Recently a shipload of  Victorian wheat was sold in London at 3d. a bushel less than has been paid for any other Australian wheat this year. That shows how seriously the rain which fell while harvesting operations were in progress affected the quality of the wheat. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to congratulate the Government on the introduction of this measure. It is ostensibly for the good of the farmers, and will help considerably to stabilize conditions, although the bankers ultimately will get the most of the money for which it provides. To the extent that it will relieve farmers of  pressing obligations we must be thankful for it. I am convinced, however, that whatever benefits may flow - from this kind of legislation will be of only a temporary character, and that a far more drastic alteration of conditions will have to be brought about before there can be anything like settled prosperity in the farming industry. </para>

                        <para>. -  I had an opportunity, during the dinner adjournment, to confer with my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> and I do not propose to occupy any length of time in the discussion of the bill at this stage. It seems to me, from a study of the measure, naturally limited because of the short time available to us, that under the Immigration Act about fourteen reasons, together with a number of sub-reasons, may be advanced by the Government why a person should be prevented from landing in Australia. In certain instances, proofs are demanded of persons against whom the allegation is made that they do not come within the category of prohibited immigrants. The High Court apparently came to the conclusion, in the case of Griffin, that the Commonwealth had purported to base its case against him on section 5, but the offence, if any, was properly chargeable under section 7; the court held, therefore, that the Commonwealth could not take advantage of the averment or evidentiary provisions of flection 5. Following that decision, we are now asked to tighten up the provisions of section 5 by imposing a penalty for the commission of any offence mentioned in that section, and that, in addition, any person who may be charged under section 7 should be subjected to even stricter evidentiary provisions than those contained in section 5. I have no objection to the imposition of a penalty under section 5. Parliament, in its wisdom, has decided, and I think the party to which I have the honour to belong is in agreement, that certain people should not be permitted to land in Australia. If they commit a breach of the lawby landing, they must be prepared to accept the punishment provided. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The first portion of the bill deals in the main with the punishment for particular offences; the second part seeks to widen the powers of the prosecution. In addition to preventing a man, on a specific charge, from landing in Australia, and imposing a penalty on him if he does land, we are now asked to- approve an amendment of the law to provide that any man found in Australia" may be brought before the court and charged with being a prohibited immigrant. This proposal is reminiscent of the thimble and pea trick. If the prosecution declares that he is under a certain thimble, and he is actually found there, he is adjudged guilty. If, however, when the thimble is lifted he is not found there, curiously enough, he is still adjudged guilty, and has to advance reasons why he was not under that particular thimble. </para>

                            <para>- Always. Under the principle embodied in the proposed amendment, if the question at issue were a murder at Albury, and one or two persons alone knew the person who committed it, any man in the street might be brought before the court and required to prove that he was not the murderer. Difficulties of proof have led to a relaxation of the old-established principle to which I have alluded, and the tendency of modern legislation is to make the way easier for the prosecution. I am opposed to this tendency to follow the philosophy of Emerson who declared that every man is as lazy as he dares to be. I regard the personal liberty of the subject as something more sacrosanct than proprietary rights but, since I have been a member of this Parliament, whenever the High Court has given a decision the effect of which has been to prevent the Government from, say, levying a certain form of taxation, action has been taken by the legislature to override the decision of the High Court. This is what is happening in the Griffin case. Regardless of my personal opinion of Griffin and Kisch, I do not wish any man charged with being a prohibited immigrant to be required to establish his innocence. The Attorney-General will, I think, admit that, under this amendment of the act, if a doubt remains in the. mind of the magistrate, that doubt must be resolved in favour of the prosecution and not in favour of the defence. We should be extremely careful before we extend this principle in our legislation. I have no objection to the amendment of the act imposing a penalty under section 5, but I am definitely opposed to the amendment to section 7 in order to extend what I regard as a very iniquitous principle. </para>

                        I do not profess to be a lawyer, but it appears to me that this measure is panic legislation, and a vindictive attempt on the part of the Government to achieve its purpose. It is well known that the bill has been introduced because of a recent decision by the High Court with regard to Griffin, and also because of the earlier decision of that tribunal in the Kisch case. No crime was charged against either Griffin or Kisch. They were deemed to be pro hibited immigrants, simply because agents of this Government declared them to be so. What did Griffin do? He was invited by a perfectly legal organization, as a visiting delegate from New Zealand, to attend the anti-war congress in Melbourne in November last. I suppose the Commonwealth Government was acting in collusion with the Government of New Zealand; otherwise I do not know how its agents could have known that he was in Australia. He is a native of Ireland and has ' been in New Zealand from early childhood. He had never been out of New Zealand until he visited Australia towards the end of last year. Immediately he got off the boat he was given a dictation test in the Dutch language and because he failed he was charged with being a prohibited immigrant. The man who put the test to him confessed that he also could not have translated the sentence into English. Throughout the whole of the proceedings against these two men no definite charge was laid against them, and no public statement was made of the offences which they were supposed to have committed. They were simply described as prohibited immigrants. Both are men of good repute in the countries from which they come. Kisch, it is admitted, came into collision with the Nazis because he exposed the iniquities and the brutalities that were taking place under the Hitler regime in Germany. Whether he was charged with being a prohibited immigrant because he spoke offensively of the country to which his Majesty the King recently sent greetings I do not know; but the fact remains that no criminal charge was laid against either Kisch or Griffin. Kisch visited Australia as a delegate from the headquarters in Paris of the anti-war movement, and Griffin, as I have explained, was invited to attend a perfectly legal congress that was held in Melbourne. Both were stopped. Griffin was subjected to a test in Dutch. Like most of us, he had no knowledge of it, and, having failed in the test, was sent back to New Zealand. The Acting Attorney-General
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan),</inline>
                        in moving the second reading of this bill, said that Griffin subsequently came back in disguise. It is true that he did come back  shortly after his deportation to New Zealand, but his only disguise was a pair of hornrimmed spectacles. He walked ashore without hindrance.

                        <para>- The fact that he had left his luggage behind was not discovered until later; consequently that cannot be the offence for which the authorities have been attempting ever since to gaol him.. The vindictive nature of this prosecution is shown by the fact that whereas persons charged with far more serious offences are granted bail on obtaining the requisite security - I have gone bail for alleged offenders more than once and know that the ownership of property of a certain value is sufficient for a bondsman - in this case a cash bail of £200 was demanded. Contrary to the expectations of the prosecution, the necessary bondsmen were found. An act of this kind can never be satisfactorily administered while a person proceeded against under it is in ignorance of the offence charged against him. tinder this act proceedings are conducted in secret. Without any publicity whatever a man of good repute, without any charge of criminality being alleged against him, may be deported to the country from which he comes. In Griffin's case the only offence was that he could not pass a test in Dutch. Kisch was prevented from landing at Fremantle and was detained by the ship's master. When an attempt was made to secure his release in Melbourne under a writ of <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus,</inline> it was over-ruled by the Chief Justice of Victoria. Kisch was compelled to remain on the ship until he reached Sydney where another  application under the <inline font-style="italic">Habeas Corpus</inline> Act was successful and he was released. Immediately afterwards he was re-arrested, and his bondsmen were required to find a security of £200 in cash. </para>

                    <para>Why should we manufacture criminals out of innocent men? Why should men be compelled to suffer penalties without having the elemental right of an open trial to determine their guilt or otherwise? Yet that is what this Government has done. In the most vindictive manner every possible attempt has been made to secure the conviction of these men.. The blundering incapacity of the Government's legal advisers, however, is such that, every step they took proved to&gt; be contrary to law. </para>

From beginning to end the Commonwealth Government simply rushed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> oblige someone - Heaven knows who it was - by trying to deport a man of good character. I want to know why, if there was anything against these men, a charge was not levelled against them and an&gt;. opportunity given them to be tried in&gt; open court. Instead of this, we had persecution, delay and enormous expense to the people. A question which I framed was asked in another place recently as to the amount which the Crownhad been required to pay in the <inline font-style="italic">Kisch</inline> case. The answer was that the costs amounted to £1,529. What has been expended on the somewhat lengthy proceedings in Griffin's case remains to be ascertained. The amount must be considerable since costs have been given against the Crown. </para>

                    <para>This, in brief, is the true history of what has taken place. Obviously these proceedings are aimed at those who advocate principles with which the Government disagree. A statement was madethat Kisch had landed in England and had delivered some lectures there. In what language he delivered them. I do not know. At the time he knew but a few words of English, but during the voyage to Australia, and subsequently, heacquired a fuller knowledge of our language. The statement, however, wascirculated that Kisch, while in England, had not met with the favour of ' the British authorities and a hint was given to the Government of the Commonwealth that he was not a desirable person. Nodefinite charge was made against him. Both of these men - although they were in no way connected with, each other - ' came here to advocate international peace, and to encourage organizations to prevent war. They also desired to expose the growing danger of a fascist form of government being thrust upon the people of this country. Neither of those objectives can be said to be criminal nor, in the minds of decent people, objectionable. This Government, while it professes an anxiety to destroy subversive propaganda, allows- another body of purely Fascist origin, and professing Fascist principles, to form an alliance with it to enable it to win the last election. This body, known as the New Guard in New South Wales, and by other names in other States, has been actually favoured and assisted by the Government although it openly stated at one period in New South Wales that if a certain party were returned to power in that State it would prevent it by armed means, if necessary, from taking over the reins of authority. While it is not legal for private bodies to engage in drill, the New Guard in New South Wales openly boasted that its members were drilling regularly in various places. Yet, no attempt was made by the Government to punish these persons or to dissolve their organization. They have been allowed to develop and organize as they think fit. In the case of these two men who came here on a legitimate mission, and against whom no criminal charge can be sustained- </para>

                    <para>SenatorRAE. - A statement was made by one Minister that certain allegations had been made against Kisch. The affidavit containing that statement, however, was withdrawn, showing that it was not soundly based and that the Crown was proceeding on mere rumour. Legislation which has been enacted from time to time during my short membership of this chamber has in several cases thrown' the onus of proof upon the accused. While we profess almost to worship the grand principles of British jurisprudence those principles are continually being violated by those who profess to uphold them. I protest against this class of legislation. The Acting Attorney-General has stated that it is extremely difficult for the pro secution to prove whether a man is a prohibited immigrant, whereas the. individual concerned knows exactly what his position is. The honorable senator also knows that it is not easy for the prosecution in many other cases to discover facts with which the man involved is familiar. It is extremely difficult sometimes to obtain the facts relating particularly to some of the most dreadful crimes that have been committed, but that does not absolve the powers that be from the necessity of proving their case if they elect to prosecute. They have to provide the necessary evidence to prove their case. </para>
                    <para>This is probably the last occasion on which I shall speak in this chamber, and I offer my emphatic protest against the vindictive spirit which has been displayed by the Government in these cases. I protest also against the growing practice of attempting to place the onus of proof on the person accused. That principle has been embodied in several parts of the Crimes Act and in certain other measures. The whole history of this Government is one of an attempt to break down the democratic institutions that we profess to honour and observe and by every means to pave the way for Fascism to become eventually the policy of this country. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The Acting Chief Justice, in giving judgment in this case, said, as reported in the press, that the principal act had been amended on ten or eleven different occasions and that the various amending acts had led to much confusion on very many important points. This, he said merited the attention of Parliament. I take it that we are attempting to-night to clarify the law. His Honour also said that this confusion threw a great  burden upon the court. The fights which have recently taken place between the Government representing the people of this country, and Herr Egon Kisch and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin,</inline> are fresh in our minds. We must all admit that in the first fight Herr Kisch won every round. He certainly won on points, even if he did not obtain a knock-out. Griffin not only won on points, but he also got away with the purse, for I take it that the loser - in this case the Commonwealth - has to find the money. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> said that Herr Kisch was prohibited from landing in Australia because he could not read Gaelic, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> was kept out because he could not read Dutch. Those were not the real reasons. Objection has been taken to the dictation test, but I remind the Senate that that means of keeping out immigrants is not peculiar to Australia. It is used in many other countries, particularly in the United States of America. It is open to any country to take any steps it thinks fit to keep out undesirable persons. </para>

Our immigration restriction laws were f ramed mainly to keep out coloured people, and it is essential that we should be prepared to defend our right to keep them on the statute-book when the challenge comes, as it will come some day. The thought that worries me more than anything else is that some day our bluff will be called. God help us if we are not ready. </para>

                    <para>I do not suppose that many people in Australia had heard of Kisch and Griffin before they attempted to land in this country. Doubtless, the documents concerning them are confidential and secret in the main, and, although we shall not know the reasons which actuated the Government, I am convinced that there were good reasons for prohibiting their entry into this country. Unquestionably, there was bungling. Before he came to Australia Egon Kisch was a non-entity. No one in Australia had heard of him. But the proceedings against him gave him a tremendous advertisement, and put him on a pedestal. He was referred to as " the eminent novelist," the " great writer," the " wonderful author " by people who probably had never previously heard of him or his books. Apparently, the whole act has been loosely drafted, and if this bill will tighten it, and make it more effective, I shall support it, for it is high time that the Government of this country had an unchallengable right to say who shall enter Australia, and who shall be kept out. For that reason I support the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- [ regret my unavoidable absence from the chamber this afternoon when the Minister explained the bill. It has been introduced in consequence of a recent High Court decision. A man named Griffin was charged under section 7 of the Immigration Restriction Act. with being a prohibited immigrant. The person who prosecuted on behalf of the Commonwealth said that Griffin was charged under that section, but he produced no evidence because be contended that Griffin must prove, under subsection 3 of section 5 of the act, that he was not a prohibited immigrant. The magistrate agreed with that view, and convicted Griffin ; but on appeal the High Court, unanimously held that the prosecutor and the magistrate in the lower court were wrong, that sub-section 3 of section 5 had no application to the case, and that, as there was no evidence against Griffin, the conviction must be upset. In so deciding the High Court followed a decision given in 1926 in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Williamson v. Ah On,</inline> which is reported in 39 O.L.R. page 95. The High Court pointed out that the language of the act was so confused that it should be considered by Parliament. One of the difficulties of the act is that section 5 provides no penalty or power of deportation. The bil] before us proposes to remedy that defect by amending section 5, and to that extent we on this side agree with it. That section deals with persons who have entered the Commonwealth by evading its officers, by landing at points where there were no officers, by presenting false credentials, by making false statements, or by refusing to leave Australia after having been  admitted for some temporary purpose. With such persons there can be no sympathy. Nor can objection be taken to those provisions which apply to an immigrant who, within five years after his landing, fails to pass a dictation test. If the bill stopped there, we would not object to it; but, unfortunately, it proposes to go further, by amending section 7 to provide that the burden of proof shall rest with the defendant. He may be a perfectly honest man, and a European ; but if he is charged with being a prohibited immigrant he will, under this legislation, have to prove that he is not. Although it is contrary to all our traditional ideas of justice to make an accused person prove his innocence, this bill provides that he must do so. Moreover, the defendant will not be told the Crown's reason for' saying that he is a prohibited immigrant. Section 3 of the act contains fifteen paragraphs, each of which has a number of sub-heading3, setting out what constitutes a prohibited immigrant. This legislation will require the defendant to show that he does not come under any of those headings. Under section 5 of the act a dishonest immigrant is given notice of the charge against him, but the honest immigrant is not treated so well under section 7. The evil principle of compelling a man to prove his innocence is aggravated by the refusal to tell him the nature of the charge. The Opposition will not resist the second reading of the bill, but in committee it will endeavour to defeat paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of clause 3. </para>

                    <para>The original Immigration Restriction Act was the outcome of a desire to avoid the difficulties experienced in other countries because of unrestricted immigration. That legislation prohibited the entrance to this country of persons who our fathers thought should not mix freely with the white people of this country. There were various reasons for regarding would-be immigrants . as undesirable. It was thought that persons might enter Australia and accept such low wages and unsatisfactory conditions as would make it impossible to maintain for Australians a decent standard of living. Our fathers desired to keep Australia clean and white, and we, their sons, are actuated by the same motives. From time to time weak spot.3 in that legislation have become manifest, and on each occasion an attempt has been made to strengthen it. Consequently, there is some confusion regarding it. There has never been any attempt to consolidate the various measures. The immediate reason for this amending legislation is the unfortunate experience of the Commonwealth in attempting to keep out of this country two men - Herr Egon Kisch and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin.</inline> I have seen both of these men. They addressed a conference over which I presided recently. Egon Kisch appeared to me to be a most amiable old chap, the embodiment of benevolence, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> did not impress me as a particularly dangerous individual. I cannot understand why the Government should hav.e made itself look so ridiculous in the eyes of the world by taking so much notice of those two men. They could not have done much harm, because most of the people of this country believe in the right- of free speech. It is well known that in Britain a bodyguard to protect even a political refugee from another country is provided by the Government. That is done in accordance with British conceptions of justice, and our forefathers in this country had the same regard for liberty of speech. I stand behind that principle to-day. Why did the Government specially concern itself about two perfectly harmless people who had been invited to this country by responsible Australians to address a conference? An honorable senator has said that great publicity was given to two nonentities by the action of the Government. It is possible that the people who invited these gentlemen here were very much better informed regarding them than was the honorable senator. They may have read some of the works published by Kisch. I have not done so. but neither have I read the Koran, which embodies the religon  of millions of people. If Kisch was so obscure a person as has been alleged, why should this Government make such a tremendous fuss about his entry into this country? Yet the Government set the hounds of the law against him. </para>

                            <para>- As a matter of fact, Peter Lalor had to flee for his life. But that is only one of the wrongs which this country has inflicted upon inoffensive persons. The only result of the persecution of Kisch was to bring him prominently under the notice of the people. As I have already said, from my personal contact with Kisch, I would judge him to be a most harmless person. Surely there was no justification for the Government scaring the people of this country by making a bogy of a European tourist. I would not permit the entry of any undesirable immigrants to this country.  If Asiatics were landing in Australia, menacing the health or the economic standards of our people, I would support a provision to stop their entry, either by the application of the language test or by some other means. Great organizations have been set up in the world for the purpose of smuggling people into countries where they are denied admittance, and I am sure that there is such an organization or a branch of it operating in Australia. We read in the press day after day that the Government is being advised to police our northern coasts to prevent Asiatics from poaching in territorial waters, thus committing an offence against our nation. We are frequently told that we should place fast gunboats on the northern coast to prevent such practices. It is possible for numbers of Chinese to be landed at lonely parts on the coast and brought down to Sydney or Melbourne to work in competition with Australian workmen. The Government cannot be blamed for making provision to protect this country against the admission of such people. But the provision for the amendment of section 7 of the Immigration Act is too drastic. Possibly by the time the bill has run the gauntlet of both Houses of Parliament it will have been amended in such a way as to safeguard the interests of the nation while giving satisfaction to all parties. I cannot imagine a matter so vital to the welfare of Australia being made a party question. It would appear that intellectual leaders from abroad, who are invited to this country by reputable and intelligent citizens, may be prevented from landing by politicians who are opposed to democratic thought. Much of the literature of the world is debarred from entering Australia. I resent very much being prevented from reading books written by eminent authors in other countries. This Government is responsible for placing an embargo on the thoughts of distinguished writers. Is it not possible that when these authors find that their books are denied entry through the customs of this country, they may decide to come in person to Australia to tell the people what is in their books. Only recently a book written by Aldous Huxley, a great Englishman, was banned by the censor. Yet that book is on the shelves of the Parliamentary Library, unless the customs officers have stolen it. How would Huxley fare if he came to Australia? Would he be treated as Kisch and Griffin were treated? Would this Government put all the machinery of the Immigration Act into operation in an endeavour to prevent him from landing and send him back to his own country? </para>

But graver danger might arise to the people of Australia from the admission of people with white skins who are desirous of assisting certain persons already here to break down all the institutions that we hold, dear, thanfrom the admission of 20 or 30 coloured people who come here to work. We must take a common-sense view of this matter. No Australian government, irrespective of its shade of politics, would take action to put this law into operation without good cause. I do not know what communications the Government may have received in regard to Kisch and Griffin, hut I am confident that it obtained information sufficient to justify it in using to the fullest extent the provisions of the law to prevent them from landing in this country. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator should display more intelligence in discussing a subject of this nature. We have to judge men by the company they keep, and at the gathering held at the Melbourne stadium one of the principal speakers was a leading Communist. Another Communist who has twice been defeated at a parliamentary election suggested that the Russian system of government is much better than the one under which we are living. Egon Kisch and Gerald Griffin were evidently associated with such men. </para>

                            <para>- The law is clear enough to those who wish to understand it. The principal act was passed many years ago, but, from time to time, it has been amended in ways which experience ha3 proved to be necessary. Incidents have occurred during recent years that prove that the present law is powerless to keep undesirable persons out of Australia. The law in relation to coloured races is sufficiently watertight, but in other respects it has proved ineffective. From time to time we hear a good deal about freedom of speech, but the members of the organization with which honorable senators opposite are associated do not favour that principle. </para>

I know of a man who was expelled from the party, although the only charge that could be laid was that he expressed himself freely. In view of that incident it was amazing to hear the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> speak so vehemently concerning freedom of speech as a heritage of the British people which should be preserved. Would honorable senators opposite suggest that a man who incited others to injure a. policeman on duty should not pay the penalty? Freedom of speech is not permissible in every instance. </para>

                        <para>. - Laymen on this side of the chamber are at somewhat of a disadvantage in discussing this measure, particularly as we have not had time to study it fully or* to compare it with the principal act. Moreover, we should have been supplied with copies of the judgment delivered in the High Court. Honorable senators opposite seem to have become panic stricken because Egon Kisch and Gerald Griffin have spent some time in this country. I hold no brief for either of these two persons, but I have read some of their speeches and I was in the court on one occasion when Kisch was on trial. I do not think that he is physically deficient, and so far as I could see he appeared mentally alert. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether the honorable senator can read what is in the mind of Kisch. Many persons who have heard the speeches of Kisch and Griffin have told me that they came to Australia to preach universal peace. If they were preaching a peaceful doctrine they were not acting contrary to the law. If they advocated violence or the overthrow of constitutional government by force they should be deported. There appears to be something sinister behind all this agitation. The present policy is contrary to the ideals of liberty in the old country from which many of us came. I have suffered close confinement in one of  His  Majesty's gaols because I had the audacity to speak as I thought. I believe in free speech but I am opposed to license. If a representative of Hitler, Mussolini, or that American dictator, Roosevelt, came to Australia to advocate the doctrines which they support no action would be taken against them, but because Kisch and Griffin advocated something contrary to the policy supported by this Government they have been treated as undesirables. The most advanced Nazi or Fascist would not have been interfered with by the present occupants of the treasury bench.. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but Kisch and Griffin, who preached the doctrine of universal peace, were treated as criminals. A few days ago I read a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Bloodless Pogrom,</inline> by  Seibler  which deals in detail with the persecution of the Jews in Germany. It is stated in that book that many authors of repute were driven from that country because they had Jewish, blood in their veins. Included in the authors mentioned is Egon Kisch whose name some honorable senator said they had never heard before he came to Australia. They must not think that a man is of no importance merely because they have not heard of him. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators on this side have not had an opportunity to read the judgment of the High Court and study the bill in relation to the act. I wish it to be clearly understood that we are entirely opposed to the entry into Australia of any man or woman of criminal associations or tendencies. Likewise, we are opposed to the admission of any person suffering from disease or likely to spread disease. But being firm believers in liberty of speech and freedom of conscience we are absolutely opposed to any attempt by this or any other government, to prevent the landing of any person of good repute who, while in Australia, is prepared to abide by its laws. "We fear that if this amendment of the act is agreed to it may be used in such a way as to press with undue severity upon persons who wish to come to Australia, and whose only offence is that they hold views contrary to the political principles of the Government. Ministerialists may say that the Government should have the right to prevent such people from coming to Australia. I consider it is wrong that any biassed government or any biassed Minister should have this power. We on this side believe that there should be no bar to the entry of persons of good repute, but we say that immediately any person who, by speech or action, advocates violence in opposition to the law, he should be and can be dealt with under the existing legislation. </para>
                    <para>Why should the Government and its supporters . be afraid of such men as Kisch and Griffin ? But for the publicity which  was given to these two men, they would have come to Australia on their mission, would have made brief appearances on a number of platforms of certain associations, and then would have passed from our shores without very many people knowing that they had been here. Simply because the Government, for political reasons, objected to their presence, Government agents got busy and sought to have them ejected. The only effect of this activity on the part of the Government was to make Australia look ridiculous in the eyes of the world. </para>
                    <para>I have had placed in my hands a copy of the Immigration Act, and although I have not had an opportunity to study it closely, I am not convinced that the amendments now proposed are necessary to prevent the entry into Australia of undesirable persons. I shall be glad, therefore, if the Acting Attorney-General will tell me if these amendments are essential. We on this side support the White Australia principle, not because we have any bitterness or hatred against </para>
                    <para class="block">Chinese, Japanese or other coloured races, but because we believe that if they were allowed to enter they would endanger our industrial and living standards. It has been suggested that if this amendment is not passed, hordes of Chinese, Japanese and other coloured aliens will flood this country. We believe that the existing law is strong enough to keep out those who, in our opinion, would be a menace to a White Australia. It has been proved good enough for many years and I am certain that we should not have heard of this proposal to amend it but for the Kisch and Griffin incidents. </para>

I have put my point of view as a layman, but owing to the fact that the bill was only introduced this morning, I and others on this side have been unable to go deeply into the question. I hope that the Acting Attorney-General, when he replies, will set my fears at rest, and show clearly whether it is not possible under the act as it stands, and without the provisions of the second part of this bill, to do all that is necessary by the exclusion of undesirable immigrants to maintain the policy of a White Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I understood the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> to say, in his speech on the second reading that the aim of this amending bill was to fill a gap in the principal act which endangered the White Australia policy and which had been discovered as the result of a recent High Court judgment. It was not aimed at Griffin or others similar to him. I was somewhat pacified by that announcement because the Opposition is most anxious that the policy of a White Australia should be maintained. The action taken iu the <inline font-style="italic">Kisch</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Griffin</inline> cases, however, illustrates what might be done under this proposed law by a Government which desired to keep out of the country persons with whose political views it disagreed. If this bill were designed only to deal with Asiatic immigration, we should not have much to say concerning it. But what guarantee have we that the object which the Government has in view is not to shut out Europeans who desire to come here and to exercise freedom of speech? I understood from what the Acting Attorney-General said in his second-reading speech that the intention of this measure is not to enable the Government to make an example of future Kischs or Griffins who may seek to enter the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>-. V. MacDONALD.- I should say that neither Kisch nor Griffin is an undesirable immigrant. Departmental officers are not always the judges. In political cases the Federal Attorney-General at the time, possibly after receiving biased reports from overseas, would have the final decision in the matter. I am quite ready to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kisch,</inline> whom I have not heard or seen, is a distinguished author in his own country. We have read that he is the author of many works and a well known journalist, and as such he should be allowed to come here and state his case in regard to world politics and their bearing on Australia. If Griffin's entry into Australia had not been objected to, if he had been allowed to land quietly and to address anti-war meetings, he would have secured but little publicity and six months after he had left the country his name probably would have been forgotten. If the Acting Attorney-General will give us an assurance that this legislation is not aimed at dealing with the Kischs and Griffins who in the future may come here, I think we shall be satisfied. </para>

                            <para>-  I am always open to conviction, and am not prepared to accuse our opponents opposite of the enormities of which some people say they are guilty. But I certainlyobject to the onus of proof being cast on a defendant, as provided for in this measure. It is a principle of British justice that the onus is upon the prosecution to prove the guilt of the person charged. Under this law, however, the onus of proving his innocence will rest upon a defendant. Two years ago an amendment of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act was before the Senate which sought to create an offence and make the provisions of the bill retrospective. I fear that in this bill there may be something hidden of which senators on this side of the House cannot approve. </para>

                        <para>. -  The honorable senator who has resumed his seat, and also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown,</inline> who preceded him, apologized for the two men whose names have been freely mentioned during this debate, and whom the Government considered to be undesirable immigrants. Both honorable senators admitted that there should be some authority to determine whether or not such persons are desirable. If an immigrant is determined by a competent authority to be an undesirable person to enter this country, he certainly ought not to be allowed to land. Would any honorable senator seriously suggest that this or any other government would take action to prevent the entry into this country of a man merely because his political views disagreed with their own. </para>

The Government of the day, no matter to what party it belongs, must be guided to a great extent in regard to the character of the immigrant by the advice of its officers. If officers of the Intelligence Department reported that an undesirable person had taken passage to or even from Australia, the Government of the day would have to act on the information so supplied. It is absurd to suggest that any government would be influenced by political considerations in administering this law. I do not think that either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> V.

He has pointed out that our immigration law served its purpose well until a serious flaw in it was disclosed by a judgment of the High Court, which was delivered yesterday. The court drew the attention of the public and the Parliament to the fact that the law as it stands is confusing and uncertain. The Government is now by this bill seeking so to amend the principal act as to make clear what was always believed by government after government to be its intention. Honorable senators opposite from time to time have supported amendments of the act. </para>

In his opening remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> offered objection to the fact that the Government sought to set aside a High Court judgment. Probably the honorable senator did not use those words, but he said that the Government had rendered itself censurable because it took legislative action to overrule a High Court judgment. I cannot understand his criticism, for the honorable senator must know it is a common proceeding in every English-speaking country, when the courts have come to a decision which is contrary to what the legislature intended, for steps to be taken to amend the legislation so that it will more clearly express what the legislature believed was the law already. As he looks through his acts of Parliament the honorable senator will frequently find the name of some case, which indicates that the legislature has noted the decision in that case, and has altered the law accordingly. </para>

                        describes this as panic legislation. It is not panic legislation, except in the sense that the decision of the High Court, which upset what the legislature believed to have been the law for nearly 30 years, was delivered on the eve of the adjournment of Parliament for several months. It is true that this legislation has been conceived in a hurry, and is being passed in a hurry, but only because of the impending adjournment of Parliament. To that extent, it is urgent, but not panic, legislation.
                    </para>
                    <para>The honorable senator and others laid stress on the fact that this legislation alters the usual procedure in regard to the onus of proof. I admit that it is the general rule in the criminal law courts for the onus to rest on the Crown; the Crown, having made a charge, is under the obligation to prove it But it is by no means a rare thing for that onus to be reversed. In particular cases, and in particular types of cases, it is common for the onus to be cast upon the defendant. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator's suggestion was that, in this legislation, the Government was departing from an established principle. That is not so; the Government is following a well-established principle, that if certain matters are peculiarly within the knowledge of a defendant, and the plaintiff has no opportunity of knowing of them, the defendant may be called upon either to prove his innocence or to disprove the charge laid against him. Certain persons are prohibited immigrants; they are not allowed to remain in this country except under prescribed conditions. In most instances, prohibited immigrants are allowed to enter this country only by permit. But let us assume that some foreigner has escaped from a vessel, that he cannot speak our language, and knows nothing about our institutions. As the law stands at present, it would be necessary for the prosecutor to prove when and how he arrived in this country. Or let us take the illustration which I mentioned this afternoon. The prosecution may know nothing about the man, and be incapable of proving anything about him ; but there may be strong reasons for believing that he entered this country illicitly. </para>

I do not want to draw the colour line in this discussion. This legislation is directed against undesirable immigrants, whatever their colour; but since the honorable senator has mentioned the coloured races, I can tell him that there are facilities for coloured people to enter Australia which are not enjoyed by the European races. "Without an alteration of the existing legislation, there might be some risk of an influx of undesirable persons. As honorable senators know, there are in existence organizations - powerful organizations until a few years ago - which are engaged in smuggling aliens into Australia. In the past, these organizations have succeeded in bringing coloured people into Australia. They would know the decision of the High Court, and would probably exaggerate its importance from their point of view. That is one of the reasons why there is danger of an influx of coloured persons. </para>

                        has supplied the answer. The Government intends to use the law in the future as it has been used in the past. In my second-reading speech, I said that this law has not been designed in order to catch

                        Obviously, it has nothing to do with Herr Egon Kisch, who has left Australia. It is extremely unlikely that further proceedings will be taken against

                        so long as he conducts himself properly. This bill was introduced, not to deal with him, but to avert the danger of  an  influx of undesirable immigrants. The Government gives no undertaking as to the classes of persons which will not be admitted to Australia.

                        <para>. - I do. not intend to support this clause. The Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> has quite rightly stated that, if the act is amended as proposed, the Government intends to put it into force immediately. But there is no imminent danger of an influx of aliens, for the simple reasons that large numbers of coloured races have already been put to the dictation test, and refused entry. The very fact that men are deported shows that they have little opportunity to use the law against those who deport them. The deportees are, usually, people without means. Even if one of them had the means, the opportunity, and the intelligence to defend himself successfully his victory would not free others. There is no urgent need for this provision. The whole Immigration Act is most complex, and an alteration of this kind should not be sprung upon us without our having an opportunity to study the principal act and the effect of the proposed amendment. For that reason I intend to oppose this clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays has said that no government would take action against an immigrant on its own initiative, but would act on the advice of public officials. I do not pretend to understand how these things are done, but action may be taken against a man simply because he holds views which are objectionable to the political party in power. It could not be said that any government acted in a biased manner if it sent back to the country from which he came a new arrival with a criminal record; but proceedings against an individual, because of his advocacy of certain views which may be distasteful to the Government, is in an entirely different category. Consider the case of the men who- have been mentioned in the debate to-night. They have been put to great pain, trouble, worry and expense as a result of the action taken against them. The case of one of these men was protracted for a period of more than six months, during which time the Crown, as well as the individual, was put to considerable expense. There should be some means by which we can get prompt justice in cases where objection is raised against a person simply because he holds views to which the Government is opposed, and which the Government believes might be ultimately dangerous. For political purposes the Government prosecuted Kisch and Griffin to the utmost limit of the law. Whilst Ministers may have acted on bad legal advice, they showed lack of discernment in not discovering their error sooner. </para>

                        <para>. - No, I could not accept such an amendment because it is not necessary. As the Leader of the Senate has interjected, in almost all of these cases the desire is not to punish the person, but to ensure that he does not remain in Australia. But the man must be legally detained and, unless there is a provision to justify his detention, application will be made to the courts for his liberation. Statutory authority for the detention of a prohibited immigrant is therefore necessary. Although a term of imprisonment is prescribed, a prohibited immigrant is imprisoned only until he can be deported. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause requires some consideration. The Government is imposing conditions that for many will be absolutely impossible of fulfilment. Many of the people affected by this clause will be strangers without relatives or friends in this country, but they will be asked to find sureties. It might not be difficult for a man in good financial circumstances to provide surety but most of the men likely to be affected by this clause could not possibly do so, and therefore would be sent to gaol. In the cases of Kisch and Griffin bail was fixed by the court at £200 cash. It is difficult to understand why bail should have been fixed at so high a sum when in more serious cases bail is frequently fixed at a much lower figure. Obviously this is a vindictive attempt on the part of the Government to provide for the imprisonment of men who cannot find cash sureties. In some instances, the members of organizations endeavour to raise the necessary funds, but as they are usually in poor circumstances, that can be done only by great sacrifice on their part. If the Government has any sense of justice or fairness, it will amend this provision in the direction I have suggested. Most of those who are likely to come under it will be unable to find sureties. </para>

While Griffin was in custody awaiting bail, he was told that if the money was not forthcoming by 5 o'clock he would be sent to the Long Bay Gaol. I believe that he was sent there, and- was not released until the following day. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that it is unreasonable to impose such unnecessarily hard conditions on persons many of whom have not committed any breach of the law. The legislation contained in the principal act should be separated so that one portion would deal with aliens and the other with those described as undesirable, and who may be Europeans with political views which conflict with those of the great majority of people. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> rather shrewdly, I suggest, avoided the main point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> had in mind by interjecting that a man had offered £20 to be smuggled into Australia, but that would be offered by the representative of an alien organization. Europeans with political views such as those I have mentioned may be pounced upon by departmental officers acting under instructions from the Attorney-General who has received from the other side of the world, a report which he may not have had time to peruse; or he may have become too much impressed by the views of others. These persons may be arrested, and if they wish to keep out of gaol they are expected to provide  a  surety of £100 or even £200. Surely that is unreasonable. I trust that the Government will give further consideration to the matter in the interests of those who have no intention of contravening the  law. </para>

                    <para>Senaltor DALY. - Under the amending measure, every man must establish his innocence where previously, in many cases, the Government had to prove his guilt. It seems unfair to impose upon a person such heavy responsibility in the matter of 'bail. Surely this can be left to the discretion of the magistrate. The tendency of legal societies in Australia is to make it easy for litigants in necessitous circumstances to obtain legal advice. In South Australia the Law Society places at the disposal of unfinancial litigants the services of an advocate. I am aware that the provision dealing with bail is already the law, but this bill gives me an opportunity to suggest that as it is not so easy to-day as it was in 1925 for any person to find. £100, we should leave the amount of bail to be determined by the magistrate. In 1925 a large number of farmers in South Australia would have had no difficulty in obtaining £100 in cash if they had been charged under the Immigration Act with being prohibited immigrants. Owing to the depression, their position to-day is entirely different. In the circumstances the Government should not insist upon the high amount of bail stipulated in the act. The Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> have, I am sure, as I have on many occasions, appealed to the court on the subject of bail. They have put before the court the financial circumstances of their client, pointed out the nature of the offence and the possibility of the appellant appearing before the appellant tribunal, and urged the court to do nothing that would prevent him from giving to his counsel the assistance required for the proper conduct of his case. It should not be necessary for counsel to attend at the Adelaide gaol, as counsel for Egon Kisch was required to do, to get instructions. The principle which I am urging is not inconsistent with the principles which operate in connexion with other legislation. In the case of men like Kisch or Griffin we may be sure that all the facts would be placed before the Court from the point of view of the Commonwealth by highly-paid barristers, some of whom might be disposed to agree with the suggestion of counsel for the defence that bail should not be so high as is provided in this section. All I ask is that the magistrate should have unfettered discretion in determining the amount of bail. It is well known that the opinion of the Court on this question is not the same as it was in 1925 because the depression has altered so materially the financial circumstances of litigants. </para>

All I am- pleading for is that in the case of a man who, in the opinion of a magistrate, should be released on bail less than the amount specified in this legislation, the judgment of the magistrate should be unfettered. </para>

There is, therefore, a differentiation between offences committed under this act and ordinary criminal acts punishable under other legislation of the Commonwealth. Under this law it is alleged against a person, not that he is not a perfectly good man, but that he is not, in the opinion of the Minister, or an officer, a desirable citizen. </para>

The Immigration Act is operated against persons whose presence at large in Australia is deemed to be undesirable. The list includes any idiot, imbecile, feebleminded person, epileptic, person suffering from dementia, insane person, person who has been insane within five years previously or person who has had two or more attacks of insanity, any person suffering from a serious transmissible disease or defect, any person suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, trachoma, or with any loathsome or dangerous communicable disease, either general or local. Should that class of person get bail or should it be made easier for him to get bail?

                        <para>. -  I entirely agree with the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> that the type of persons to whom he has referred should not be allowed to come in. Take the case of a person who is insane. This measure does not try, and is not intended to determine in the first instance the question of a man's sanity. Is there any State in Australia that would not put an insane person into a mental asylum? Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the authorities, instead of having administered the Gaelic language test to Kisch, had declared that he was insane. Under this particular provision, if the magistrate who dealt with the case had any doubt he would have to find that he was insane. Any doubt is to be in favour of the prosecution. This amending bill has to be read in line with the existing law. If a magistrate had found that Kisch was insane, and the High Court had held on appeal that he was not, Kisch would, in the meantime, have been detained in an asylum quite improperly for a considerable time. Prostitutes and others, to whom, the Acting Attorney-General has referred - 'persons who have been convicted of a criminal offence - would be kept under supervision  under  the State law. </para>

            <para>SenatorRAE (New South Wales) [10.55],  -  Although I am very tiredI cannot allow this opportunity to go without making a final protest against this amending legislation. Some sort of case has been made out as to a fear of this country being overrun by objectionable persons unless we hasten the passing of this bill. If there is any basis for such a claim that is a reason why other legislation should have been put aside and an opportunity afforded us to consider these amending provisions in conjunction with the principal act. I am convinced that the Government, like Pharoah of old, has no time to listen to even a convincing argument. We might as well talk to tombstones. Members of the Government are devoid of all reason and have nothing but ridicule for any one who stands up for the liberty of the individual. Every effort that has been made to submit people to legal restrictions and repressive measures has always had the support of honorable members opposite. They are ever eager torestrict the liberty of thesubject. Action of this kind has been taken over and over again. In this particular legislation we have first of all the averment that the person accused is guilty unless he can prove his innocence. We have a further provision for prohibitive bail which in many cases means long periods of confinement for persons who are unable to find the requisite security. In the case of Griffin, to which repeated reference has been made during this debate, something like three months elapsed from the time that he lodged hisappeal until his case was heard. He had no funds of his own. He had only a few shillings when he came into the country, and would have had to remain in gaol but that bail was found for him. This means a more severe punishment for the poor than for those who have financial backing. We are told that the law does not differentiate between the rich and the poor, that it is as illegal for a millionaire to sleep under a bridge or in a railway truck as it is for a beggar to do so. But the one is compelled to do so by circumstances that do not apply to the other. In a case of the kind to which the Leader of the Government has referred - the case of a gang of smugglers - the accused persons would have the means to find bail ; but an insane person, who most of all should receive our consideration, would probably be entirely destitute of any funds for his own defence. We have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> that he could secure free legal advice ; that however would not provide him with bail. A man, because of his impecuniosity, may be able to obtain legal advice; that however would not prevent prohibitive bail being demanded of him, so that the free legal assistance is not of much bene-" fit to him. Every attempt that has been made to mitigate this legislation has been absolutely ignored. The supporters of the Government when a division is called are as mere cogs in a wheel and vote solidly with Ministers. </para>
            <para class="block">I recognize the hopelessness of any attempt to get a fair deal in this legislation. The Government has deliberately hardened its heart against any amendment designed to soften the rigorous nature of any of its proposals. Surely no honorable senator believes that all the wisdom of the 'Senate is concentrated on one side of the chamber ; but, in practice, the supporters of the Government act as though they believe that to be the case. Nothing that we on this side suggest is thought to be worthy of consideration; the most obviously fair proposal is treated on party lines, and when the division bells ring, the followers of the Government, like dumb-driven cattle, go where they are directed. The scanty consideration given to legislation by honorable senators supporting the Government is a denial of democratic rule, and is hastening the trend towards the constitution of a fascist state in this country. </para>

                    <para>. -  I, too, protest against the scanty consideration given to the views of the Opposition in regard to this measure. The personal liberty of the subject is something that is sacred, and I hope that the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> will later, if not now, give serious consideration to our representations regarding bail. Unless something is done in that direction, I foresee a further shaking of public confidence in our parliamentary institutions. I realize that the Government, is anxious to get its legislation passed in view of the approaching adjournment; but I think that the Minister should have given more consideration to our protests. It may be that in the House of Representatives the party to which T belong will be able to persuade the representative of the Acting Attorney-General to relax the rigorous nature of the provisions relating to bail. </para>

                    <para>.- Et is somewhat astonishing to find such concern by honorable senators opposite for the people who will be affected by this amending legislation, seeing that those people come to Australia only to sow seeds of discord. Only a few days ago the press of Australia published an inaccurate report alleging that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> had stated that he was prepared to consider a proposal for the admission to Australia of British migrants. That report raised a storm of protest in both Houses of this Parliament. It was urged that such a policy would injure Australia. Yet the Opposition, which protested against our own kith and kin being permitted to enter this country, now objects to keeping out undesirable immigrants. Australia can do very well without such men as Kisch and Griffin, with their Marxian theories, which cannot be put into operation without detriment to this country. Australia is wise in endeavouring to keep out those persons who would come here only to stir up unrest. This country has managed very well fbr  100  years without the assistance of these imported gentlemen, and their strange doctrines. </para>

In order to mitigate the rigorous nature of that provision, we have applied to it the provisions of section  7  a. T sympathize with the view. that a discretion should be left with the magistrate, hut I remind the Senate that our immigration laws have never so provided. At all times, bail has been rigid. In the United States of America prohibited immigrants are not allowed their freedom at all, but are kept in custody until their trial takes place. </para>

                        <para>- I make no apology for this bill. The Government has done the least that the High Court expected it to do. That tribunal made a point of the necessity for clearing up this law. It may be that the law will have to be reviewed still further, in which event the advisableness of vesting a discretion in the magistrate might well be considered. My own opinion is that the legislature has considered that point from time to time, only to conclude that the bail must be substantial. A further element of security is the necessity to obtain the approval of the Collector of Customs. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the honorable senator's objection is to the severity of the bail. If anything in that direction is done, it should, I think, be by means of a differentiation between the various classes of cases. There are some persons whom it is almost impossible to detect or to hold. The Leader of the Senate could tell us of Instances in which it took months to lay hands on persons who had escaped from the clutches of the law. Legislation of this kind is difficult to administer; certain cases may deserve consideration, while others should be given no leniency at all. It may be that the bail is too large in some cases, but were it not for this amendment, there would have been no bail at all. </para>

                    <para>The bill makes provision for the first three months of the next financial year. This provision is necessary because Parliament will not be called together again before the 1st July next. The amount of the appropriation to which the Senate is asked to agree is £6,704,400. This amount includes the following sums for ordinary services: - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">The items making up these sums are based on the appropriations passed by Parliament for the present year, and represent approximately one-quarter of the total appropriation, except in a few cases where expenditure on any item is heavy in the early part of the year. In addition, the usual provisions are made for " Refunds of Revenue " and "Advance to the Treasurer ". The amount set down for "Refunds of Revenue" is £500,000 and for "Advance to the Treasurer " £1,500,000. This latter item is required to carry on uncompleted works in progress oh the 30th June, 1935, and other urgent works, and to cover unforeseen and miscellaneous expenditure, including special grants to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. These special grants, will be continued on the same basis as during the present financial year, pending the introduction of new bills. Provision is made in this bill only for the amount which is estimated to be sufficient to carry on essential services on the basis of the appropriation for the current financial year, 1934-35. No provision is made in this supply bill for any new expenditure or for any departure from existing policy. As nine months of the current financial year have elapsed, I take this opportunity of informing the Senate of the progress of the Commonwealth finances for that period so far as the figures are available. The year so far has been marked by a continuance of the buoyancy of revenue which was experienced in the last financial year, with the result that the finances generally are in a very satisfactory  position. Customs and excise revenue has continued to show an upward tendency, the collections for the nine months having been £28,601,000, which was £2,800,000  more than the receipts for the corresponding period of last financial <inline font-style="italic">year,</inline> and £2,650,000 in excess of the <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> budget estimate. Post office revenue also has been very satisfactory; the total receipts for the nine months -were £10,450,000 or £700,000 more than the receipts for the same period of last year and £400,000 in excess of the <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> budget estimate. Sales tax collections, although £300,000 less than the collections for the same period of last year,  owing to the reduction of the rate of tax and the additional exemptions granted, were £300,000 in excess of the <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> budget estimate for the nine months. The position in regard to income tax is uncertain. Possibly the yield will not reach the budget estimate. The revenue under other sub-heads has been normal and shows no marked departure from the budget estimate. On the other hand, additional liabilities have 'been incurred since the budgetwas introduced and expenditure under various heads has exceeded the estimate. The proposals for relief to wheat-growers involve a total expenditure of £4,000,000, againstwhich the flour tax receipts this year will probably reach £750,000. Other expenditure increases include, flotation expenses and interest in connexion with London loan conversions, unemployment relief works from revenue approved by Parliament, £176,000, and additional payments to States under the Federal Aid Roads Agreement, £200,000. </para>
                    <para>It is too soon to make any reliable forecast of the financial results for the- full year ending the 30th June next, but the present indications are that the results will he satisfactory. </para>
                    <para>Although the Government is seeking parliamentary approval for three months' supply for next financial year, it intends to 'call Parliament together before the expiration of that period. It is proposed that on this occasion the budget shall he presented to Parliament <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> soon as possible after it re-assembles, and the granting of the three months' supply now sought will obviate the necessity for passing a Supply Bill at that juncture. The second Supply Bill for next year will therefore be presented after the budget has been introduced. </para>
                    <para>As I have already mentioned, the Supply Bill now before the Senate is, in accordance with established practice, based on this year's appropriations and does not contain provision for expenditure on new services. The proposals for the new year will be embodied in the budget and honorable senators will then have an opportunity to discuss the Government's financial proposals in detail. </para>

A few days ago I received an extract from the Geelong <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser,</inline> stating that the brother of the murdered man was fitting out an expeditioninto Central New Guinea to inquire into the circumstances of the tragedy. In a letter accompanying the extract, the writer said that nothing which was not already known could be found out, and he expressed the fear that the expedition may be regarded as an act of revenge. Has the Minister any information regarding this proposed expedition, and will he give an undertaking that nothing of a punitive nature is contemplated ? </para>

The murderer afterwards committed suicide. Naturally, the parents are much distressed at the loss of a son to whom they were greatly attached. The brother of the murdered man proposes to visit the scene of the tragedy, but not with any punitive intent; he will go there under the auspices of the administration, merely to be able to assure his parents that the victim has been decently buried and to bring back to Australia his possessions. </para>
