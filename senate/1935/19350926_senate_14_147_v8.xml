          <para class="block">This measure provides for the validation until the 30th November, 1935, of collections of duty made in accordance "with the customs tariff proposals introduced into the House of Representatives on the 28th March last. As honorable senators are aware, unless the schedule is passed by both Houses of Parliament within six months from the date of introduction, a validating bill is necessary. As there is insufficient time within which fully to debate the items separately before the 28th of this month, Parliament is being asked to validate the collections until the 30th November. This is the date to which collections under the tariff proposals introduced on the 6th December last are also validated. The validation of the collections of duties under both proposals until the same date will afford the Government an opportunity to combine the two schedules, thus making it more convenient for the discussion of individual items. </para>

            <para>. - The Opposition will not oppose the passage of this measure. We understand its purport, and the necessity for it. When the Scullin Government was in office, and adopted precisely the same procedure as is now being followed, honorable senators who sit on the other side of the chamber bitterly denounced that Ministry's policy. However, that need not affect the situation this afternoon, although I cannot resist the impulse to remind honorable senators of their former attitude. Honorable senators of the party to which I belong are somewhat flattered to know that the present Government has been obliged to adopt this procedure, as well as some other practices introduced by the Scullin Administration. Perhaps the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will assure the chamber that within a reasonable time honorable senators will have an opportunity to discuss the tariff items in a detailed and thorough manner. </para>

            <para>.- While not objecting to this bill, I consider that the principle involved is altogether wrong. In matters entailing grave consequences both to the manufacturers and the community in general the fullest possible discussion should be permitted. Many months have passed since the tariff schedules were introduced, but so far they have not been debated by Parliament. Trade and industry are vitally interested in the new customs duties, and have been waiting for an opportunity totest them. I am quite satisfied that the Government has no desire to repeat this method of carrying on business, but will afford honorable senators an opportunity to express their views on tariff matters at the earliest opportunity. The present method by which reductions of dutiesbecome law as soon as new schedulesare laid on the table is viewed with grave concern in many quarters. I hope that when tariff schedules are brought down in future, every opportunity will be afforded immediately for their consideration by the Parliament and the public. </para>

            <para>. - I fully agree with the sentiment expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> though possibly from a different view-point, that validating bills of this description are undesirable. When a similar measure was introduced in this chamber on a previous occasion this year, I expressed the hope that it would not constitute a precedent for future action, and the Minister in charge of the bill indicated that it would not. I trust this will be the last occasion on which it will be necessary for the Government to introduce a validating bill of this kind. Having studied this clause I believe that a grave anomaly might arise which would prevent the return or refund of duties collected in error or held in abeyance pending the production of additional information. This clause reads - </para>

            <para>. - The honorable senator has raised what might at first appear to be an interesting point, but I believe that it has been considered before. The words that govern the clause are: "pursuant to the customs tariff proposals." The collections must be pursuant to those proposals. If not, the importer stands in exactly the same position as one who has been unlawfully overcharged under schedules that have been finally passed by Parliament. </para>

        <para>This measure, which is associated with the Customs Tariff Validation Bill (No. 2), ensures that the exchange adjustment amendments necessitated by the ordinary customs tariff proposals of the 28th March, 1935, shall operate to the date mentioned in that measure, namely, the 30th November, 1935. As the Customs Tariff Validation Bill (No. 2) has been passed, the passage of this measure is essential. </para>

            <para>. - Providencehas come to the rescue of the Government. Droughts in other countries and rumours of war between Italy and Abyssinia have increased prices for Australian primary products in overseas markets, with the result that the budget figures presented to the Senate on Monday disclosed an improvement, for which however Ministers cannot claim justly the whole of the credit. This being the case, no surprise need be occasioned if we, on this side, examine critically the Government's policy and administrative record. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline>addressed a few words of wisdom to the Senate yesterday. He spoke in approving terms of the ability of private enterprise to deal with our unemployment difficulties, to overcome the depression and set Australia again on the road to prosperity. We on this side take an entirely different view. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> and his friends - members of the United Australia party and Country party - belong to the parties of conservatism and reaction. They stand " pat " for the things that are. Labour senators believe in change with a view to progress and to meet any situation as it arises. Government supporters, in their survey of the world's economic position, pin their faith to private enterprise and lose no opportunity to endeavour to persuade us that, if unhampered by governmental restrictions, private enterprise would restore prosperity in the world. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline>is typical of the class he represents - the reactionary element in the community. Although personally he has all the attributes of a good fellow, he has an obsession about the superlative efficiency of private enterprise. Only yesterday he deplored the decline of the natural increase of population in Australia, but failed to point to the true remedy. That is a subject in which he has always displayed great interest, and I think we all commend him for the views which he has expressed. He believes, as we do, that our circumstances necessitate an increase of population. Then the honorable senator went on to tell us about the Fairbridge Farm School in Western Australia, which cares for a few children sent out each year from the United Kingdom. That institution was commended by the honorable gentleman as one means of increasing the population. We say that such projects are all right in their way, but our complaint is that the Government does nothing to ensure for the people already here continuity of employment at reasonably good wages, thus encouraging them to establish homes and rear families. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> whom I regard as one of the mental troglodytes, would say that the Government must not do any of the things which we advocate. </para>

At one time the world was peopled by cave dwellers, who were known as troglodytes; so to suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> mentally is a troglodyte - one living in the dark ages of social progress - is surely not personally offensive. I assure him that I have no desire to hurt his feelings, and I hope that he will be satisfied with this explanation. I do not imply that there is something wrong with the honorable senator, merely because he cannot accept my view.

              <para>- I freely admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> has had considerable experience; and on many  occasions I defer to his judgment. But may I suggest that, in the Labour movement there are also men of wide experience? Within comparatively recent times certain members of our party " ratted " from our ranks and our political opponents have welcomed them with open arms. Some have even become tory leaders. As the representatives of the workers, wo have every right to speak for Labour. Many Government supporters having been in privileged positions all their lives, definitely represent the more fortunate sections of the community, and consistently oppose any action that might jeopardize their interests. Those who .are not privileged suffer; and, consequently, they support a policy which offers them some hope of a changed economic condition. When I interjected yesterday that a reduction of the working hours would help to solve the unemployment problem, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> ridiculed the suggestion. It is all very well for the honorable senator to take that stand, because his future is assured; but what about the thousands of unemployed who would find a job if the working hours were reduced ? Those who- gain their livelihood by exploiting the workers will, of course, oppose anything which might reduce their income. Opinion in regard to private enterprise is different from that which obtained a few years ago. I do not belie.ve that any honorable senator really believes that private enterprise can solve the unemployment difficulty. Throughout the world there is a growing belief that government assistance must be forthcoming. </para>

            <para>The events of the last twelve months may be said to have set the seal upon this transformation of attitude. Instead of receding as signs of recovery have appeared, the demand for collective action and organization has, on the contrary, been reinforced. The very security of the State is now seen to depend not only upon the inviolability of its frontiers, but upon its ability to provide an orderly and sufficient existence to all classes of its citizens. As it has been aptly remarked by the well-known American publicist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walter</inline> Lippman, "the task of ensuring the standard of living for its people is now as much the fundamental duty of the State as the preservation of national independence." </para>

              <para>- I know that the people of Western Australia have had their minds poisoned against Queensland.

He did not even get the position of  Chairman  of Committees after so many years of faithful service to his party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> was once a Minister, <inline font-style="italic">but</inline> he has now been relegated to the rank and file of his party. It seems that good men and true, who support the Government and represent the State of Queensland, cannot get a major ministerial appointment. </para>

          <para>The Premier of Queensland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forgan Smith)</inline> has taken the Federal Government to task for preening itself about its surpluses while the States are labouring under deficits. After the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in 1934, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith proposed that the Commonwealth Government should accept responsibility for a greater proportion of the State debts. He proposed also that the Commonwealth should shoulder the full burden of the repatriation of returned soldiers. That is essentially a Commonwealth obligation. He claimed further that the States were entitled to the whole of the proceeds of the petrol tax, pointing out that roads were built and maintained by the States. The Commonwealth is insidiously, but obviously, bleeding the States to financial death, and the Constitution should be altered to give them greater financial power and enable them to pay their way. A conference should be convened to consider amendments of the Constitution which would have the effect of removing the States' disabilities. The Constitution should be so amended as to enable the States to achieve progress, and render it impossible for them to be bled by the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>In thebudget speech the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> expressed pleasure that the Commonwealth Government, by its adherence to sound finance, had been able to provide means for the absorption of increasing numbers of the unemployed. Is there ground for satisfaction in the fact that a country so rich as to be capable of feeding all its people, has many thousands of men and women on the bread line? There is something rotten in a financial system which allows that state of affairs. </para>
          <para>The budget compares the situation in 1932, when the employment index showed that 30 per cent, of trade unionists were unemployed, with the position in the second quarter of this year, when the percentage of unemployed was 17.8. The comparison indicates admittedly a considerable reduction of the ranks of the workless. State unemployment figures are not mentioned in the budget, but in the second quarter of 1935 the percentage of unemployed in New South Wales was 22.7 ; in South Australia, 18.9; in Tasmania, 16.4; and in Victoria, 15. Anti-labour governments are in office in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. In the States where Labour governments are in power unemployment is considerably less. The percentage of unemployed unionists in Western Australia is 13, and in Queensland it is only 8.8. Since Labour assumed office in Tasmania unemployment has been greatly diminished in that State. When I mentioned the matter of unemployment yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> said that a reduction of the number of hours worked would not contribute substantially to the lowering of the unemployment figures. The Under Secretary for Employment <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> at the International Labour Conference this year announced that he favoured a reduction of working hours as a means of increasing employment.  His  statement received world-wide publicity. </para>

              <para>- Private enterprise alone cannot solve the problem. It has been necessary for the central governments of the world to come to its rescue. The assistance given by the Commonwealth to primary producers has cost millions of pounds, and the Labour party has supported the granting of that assistance; it has even had to fight the Government, which would not agree to a paltry £50 of the bounty being reserved for each farmer's personal benefit, although the fact is well known that most of this money usually finds its way into the pockets of traders and financial institutions. The 40-hour week has been introduced in the United States  of  America, Italy and even Czechoslovakia. At Geneva, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Stewart spoke eloquently in favour of Australia following their example, but the Commonwealth Government has taken absolutely no action to that end.

              <para>- People are very nervous at election time, or when a war is looming, and they are easily swayed by catch-cries. If the war now threatening does eventuate, I suppose that propaganda will be circulated to make people believe that Australia should participate in it. At the elections the Labour party made a sensible proposition for the control of the Commonwealth Bank, and counter-propaganda was employed to alarm the electors. The Government, speaking through the Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> flatters itself that the interest bill has been reduced. A paragraph in the budget reads - </para>

            <para>The common practice of referring to the ever-increasing interest hill on our national debt makes it necessary to invite attention to the facts. In 1921-22, the aggregate interest bill on Commonwealth and State public debts represented £7 9s. 4d. a head of the population. For 1935-36, the corresponding figure is £7 8s.1d. These figures include all long-term and short-term debt and all exchange charges. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">That statement makes a particularly interesting study. The Assistant Treasurer informs us that the debt per head of the population is decreasing. As a matter of fact, it is a few shillings less. The Commonwealth Statistician, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPhee,</inline> has compiled figures showing that within the last five years Commonwealth and State debts have increased at the rate of £27,500,000 annually. As this debt is being discharged at the rate of £7,848,000 a year, the total indebtedness is increasing by approximately £20,000,000 a year. When reference is made to Australia having turned the corner, we should ask when we shall be in a position to pay our debts. At the present rate of progress, the country is, like the Irishman, advancing backwards. The Assistant Treasurer has stated that there is a diminution in the interest bill per head of the population. Presumably, if the debt continues to increase the interest bill will decrease, and some day when the debt is big enough we shall not have to pay any interest at all! From a study of the Assistant Treassurer's figure, the only conclusion I can draw is that while the debt accumulates the interest grows less. </para><interjection>

              <para>- The combined Commonwealth and State debts are increasing by £27,000,000 a year. In the budget there is a brief mention of the accumulated deficit of £17,000,000, and in its financial wisdom the Government has allotted £211,205 this year as a contribution towards its redemption. At that rate of progress, it will take 80 or 90 years to pay off the accumulated deficit, though, in the life of nations, such a thing is, perhaps, of no consequence. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>Another minor improvement in the position is in connexion with the tobacco industry. After long consideration, the Government proposes to reduce excise duty on manufactured tobacco. In other words, the Government is to differentiate between home-grown tobacco and foreign tobacco and at the same time to reduce the excise duty on cigarettes. Can there be some private reason for this decision, because requests previously made for a differential excise in regard to home-grown and foreign tobacco were always refused by the Government? Now it is proposed to reduce excise on home-grown tobacco involving a loss of revenue of £90,000. This we endorse, but will the growers get the benefit? Unfortunately, hundreds of growers have been ruined. When the Scullin tariff operated,800 farmers were growing tobacco at Mareeba, but now their numbers have diminished to less than 200. Business men have also been adversely affected, one storekeeper alone having lost £70,000 as a result of the Lyons Government's interference with the Scullin tariff. The Government now proposes to extend some assistance to the tobacco-growers and reduce the excise on the Australian-grown products. The tobacco-growing industry in Mareeba attracts only one buyer, who, in the absence of competition, can fix his own price: consequently, the unfortunate growers are labouring under grave disabilities. On one visit the buyer will seek tobacco leaf of mahogany colour; the next time he will ask for a. light yellow leaf; and then for an altogether different kind. The growers do not know what is really required by the purchaser. From 22 tobacco-growers in Mareeba. I have a statement which should be interesting to honorable senators, particularly when the claim of the Lyons Government that it has restored prosperity is remembered. It shows that these farmers consigned 7,262 lb. of tobacco to the Combined Growers Tobacco Company. Valuing the tobacco at 6s. per lb. the gross return was £2,178 12s. Excise at 4s. 6d. per lb. amounted to £1,633 19s.; manufacturers' cost at 9d. per lb., £272 6s. 6d.; selling costs at 6d. per lb., £181 lis.; half of the proceeds deducted, £44 lis. 2d.; freight, £24 3s. 5d.; total, £2,156 lis. Id.; balance to farmers, £22 8s. Id. One farmer sent 42 lb. of tobacco and another 120 lb. They were debited with 5s. 9d. and ls. 5d. respectively. Those men are ruined, and yet the Assistant Treasurer, refers to returning prosperity ! Have the funds of the United Australia party by any chance been augmented by a contribution from the British Australian Tobacco Company ? </para><interjection>

When one government encourages development of a certain industry by placing a duty upon the imported article, such protection should not be lifted by any succeeding administration without giving those people so occupied an opportunity to reimburse themselves. Many farmers whom the Scullin Government encouraged to grow tobacco have now been driven off their holdings. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Badman's</inline> interjection reminds me that a considerable number of people in the southern States have an entirely false conception of Queensland.

          </continue><para class="block">Brisbane he remarked to a friend, " This is the first time I have been in a foreign country." Many people living in distant States look upon North Queensland as a foreign land, and judging by its attitude this Government is indifferent to the conditions of the people in the far north of that State. It is prepared to strain every nerve to fight on behalf of Abyssinia -which is peopled by a race belonging mentally and morally to the dark ages, but it does not seem to be so much concerned about fighting for Australia. We on this side put in a plea that Australians should not die for some foreign country, but should live for their own. Accordingly, we say that this Government might with advantage make some provision to assist the people who are doing so much to develop the northern part of Queensland. Why not help them ? We have appealed to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> for assistance for Cooktown, the most northern town in Australia. Many years ago it was a thriving gold mining town, but to-day it is in a dilapidated state. A considerable number of good Australian citizens who are still living there are appealing to this Government for assistance to enable them to carry on, so that they may play their part in protecting the northern shores of Australia. As one of the outposts of the Commonwealth, Cooktown should not bo neglected. Apparently government supporters are not interested in my appeal on behalf of Australian citizens, although a day or two ago they gave close attention to the Leader of the Senate when he was appealing for the support of citizens of a foreign country who, we read, on their feast days are accustomed to drinking the blood and eating the flesh of living animals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> knows the north, and he will, I am sure, appreciate the force of my appeal on behalf of the people of Cooktown. Recently, the Government voted £500 for the establishment of an aerodrome there. This was expended in the construction of a runway, and a request has now been made for a further £1,000 to complete the work. Surely it should be possible for the Government to provide this small sum from the magnificent budget which the </para><para class="block">Assistant Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> presented on Monday. </para><continue>

        <para>It is a painful duty to be obliged to submit this bill. As honorable senators are aware, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Kingsmill had a long public and parliamentary life, extending over 38 years, partly in the Parliament of Western Australia and partly in this chamber, of which, for some time, he was  President.  I regret to inform the Senate that his widow is in ill-health, and is practically without means. All honorable senators will regret that this should be so. One cannot go into the causes. The Government has made inquiries, and has ascertained that the position is as I have stated. It felt that, in view of the long public and parliamentary career of the late honorable senator, the country would not object to provision being made for his widow, who is unable to provide for herself. The circumstances in which she finds herself are no fault of hers. I feel sure that, in view of what I have said, the bill will, in this chamber, receive the same sympathetic consideration as was given to it in the House of Representatives. </para>
