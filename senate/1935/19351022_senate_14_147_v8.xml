                            <para>- The Postmaster-General takes his instructions, not from individual Ministers, but from Cabinet. I have seen the circular letter to which the honorable senator has referred, and concerning it all I need say is that if threats are issued against members of either branch of this legislature official cognizance should be taken of them by the respective Houses in order to protect the privileges of their members. As honorable senators are probably aware, there is a system of censorship over matter broadcast from all stations. The script is submitted to the censors who excise from it such portions as they think may be offensive to any section of the community. </para>

If so, can he say if the project, theterms of which include a loan from the Commonwealth of &#163;1,000,000 for the erection of meat works and construction of roads, railways and shipping facilities, is new, or is it the scheme which was discussed by the Government two or three years ago? </para>

The answer supplied to enator Gibson does not satisfy me. Will the Leader of the Government state definitely whether or not such negotiations are &#39;being conducted by the Government? </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Since I left Canberra on the 10th instant I have learned the terms of a resolution, announced by Dr. Earle Page as having been passed at a meeting of the Country party held on that date in this building, approving the appointment of a Leader of the Country party in the Senate. Dr. Earle Page sent me a special invitation to attend that meeting. I replied stating that my views on the subject &#39;had been clearly expressed in the Senate and that, as I had nothing to add to them, I did not intend to attend the meeting. I wish to refer to the resolution only so far as it affects myself and my position as an elected senator representing my own State and pledged to my electors to adopt a certain line of policy in the Senate with which my acceptance of a party leader here would conflict. I have no real differences with the Country party except on this major question of the alteration of the status of Country party senators, by the new appointment of a Country party leader in this chamber. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>For the last ten years Country party senators from the various States have sat here free to carry out their duties to their States without the measure of party control and guidance which the appointment of a leader imposes. The Senate is a House of review designed to protect the interests of the smaller States. We in Western Australia look on this branch of the legislature as our one stronghold. It is the only place where, under the Constitution, we have an equal voice with any other State. It is, in truth, the only bulwark of the weaker States. The decision to impose a party leader and party methods in this States&#39; chamber is entirely repugnant to my conception of the Senate under the Constitution. I do not come 2,500 miles from Western Australia to be told by a party leader here what to do. I therefore am unable to allow the Federal Country party either to impose its will on me or to place me in party leading reins. I regard its action as a barefaced attempt to destroy the rights of free parliamentary speech and action which are cardinal principles of representative government. It is another step towards stifling the voice and influence of the smaller States in the National Parliament. </para>
                    <para>There are good reasons why the sudden and reckless, and, so far as I know, ill considered change of policy by the Federal Country party, should be particularly unacceptable to-day to senators from South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. Never have those States felt a keener sense of grievance against the Commonwealth than they feel to-day. </para>

                            <para>- The suggestion of Mr. Butler, the Premier of South Australia, that honorable senators from South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, irrespective of party, should co-operate to protect the interests of those States has been most favorably received by leaders of thought in them. No more inopportune time could have been chosen to place new party obligations on senators from those States. The decision of the Federal Country party to exercise party leadership and discipline over honorable senators from the smaller States shows an utter disregard of the interests of the primary producing States. It is almost incredible that a political party, which was established by primary producers to protect rural interests, should be so far forgetful of the three primary producing States as to attempt to place new party shackles on the representatives of those States in the. only chamber where they have any effective voice and vote. This action justifies the protests made by Senator Carroll and myself against this introduction of party domination. It is clear that the policy of the Federal Country party to-day, in relation to basic principles and vital matters, is dominated mainly by the three larger States. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>As a candidate for the Senate, I was pledged to the primary producers&#39;&#39; association and the Country party organization of Western Australia, as well as to the electors, to place the interests of Western Australia before any other consideration in a chamber specially designed for the protection of the weaker States. That pledge, and the political beliefs of a lifetime, prevent my joining the quartette of Country party senators who have voluntarily accepted a party leader in a non-party house of review established to protect State rights. For 25 years I have been a representative of my native State in the Parliaments of Western Australia and the Commonwealth. I will accept no leader and no political dictation in regard to my duties as an elected representative of Western Australia in the Senate. I have therefore tendered to Dr. Earle Page my resignation as a member of the Federal Country party. In future, I shall sit in the Senate as a Western Australian Country party senator, bound only by the principles of the Country party platform of that State and my pledges to the electors. No party leader in the Senate shall stand between me and my duty to Western Australia; no other honorable senator shall profess to express my views. I shall speak for myself as a representative of my State, without party domination or interference. I stand for that complete freedom of parliamentary speech and action which is the foundation of our civic liberties. </para>
                    <para>As incorrect statements in relation to my resignation from the Country party have appeared in certain newspapers, I now make it clear that I gave only one carefully prepared statement to the press for publication. That statement appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline> To the extent that other reports differ from it, T. accept no responsibility for them. It is particularly unfortunate that unauthorized statements which have been attributed to me in some other newspapers, should refer to Dr. Earle Page and Mr. Paterson. I have the highest regard and esteem for those gentlemen, and did not make the statement about them which has been attributed to me. </para>

A day or two later he gave an explanation of that explanation. To-day he has attempted to explain his explanation of his first explanation. If the serial continues much longer, much valuable time of the Senate will be taken up. Three honorable senators of the Country party have stated that Senator Johnston issued a circular convening the meeting at which the party elected a leader.  </para>

                            <para>- The new wave-length plan was designed and brought into force for the &#39;benefit of listeners in general and it would indeed be a retrograde step to endeavour to design a system on the basis of utilizing obsolete receiving apparatus. A limited number of wave-lengths is available for the whole of the Commonwealth, and if progress is to be achieved it is quite impossible to maintain the conditions which prevailed when a much smaller number of broadcasting stations was in service. The dominating factor in the post office plan of wave-length allocations is the interest of listeners throughout the Commonwealth. The plan could not be modified in the direction suggested without sacrificing vital benefits to the general body of listeners. </para>

The time in which the motion could be submitted was limited and there was a danger that if a report were furnished in the ordinary way to conform with Standing Order No. 36(a) the right of the Senate to object to this regulation might lapse. The committee is unanimous in its view of Statutory Rule No. 29. The committee does not approach this subject from the standpoint of policy; that is not a matter which concerns it. The committee has to decide whether Statutory Rule 29 is in accordance with the law, and as I indicated, it is unanimously of the opinion that it is illegal. When the committee was appointed no provision was made in the Standing Orders as to its duties. The Standing Orders merely provide that all regulations and ordinances laid on the table of the Senate shall stand referred to such committee for consideration, and, if necessary, for report thereon. If action is necessary, following a report of the committee, such action shall be taken in the Senate on motion after notice. The Select Committee which reported on the Standing Committees system, under which this committee came into existence, recommended that the committee should scrutinize regulations to ascertain. - </para>

                    <para class="block">That section was interpreted recently in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Broadcasting Company of Australia- Proprietary Limited and others v. the Commonwealth,</inline> 52 C.L.R. 52. A majority decision was given by the Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Evatt and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> McTiernan, who said : &#34; No one disputes that the mere fact that a statute of the Commonwealth Parliament operates retrospectively is insufficient to invalidate it&#34;. Retrospective legislation is clearly within the competence of the Parliament, but the majority decision of the High Court laid it down quite definitely that retrospective regulations are not within the competence of the administration unless power to make them is specifically granted, which has not been done in this case. In other words, Parliament may, if it chooses, l&#62;ass retrospective legislation, hut the administration is not at liberty to frame retrospective regulations. Statutory Rule <inline font-style="italic">No.</inline> 29 is a particularly long dated case, in that the regulations are to be . made retrospective for nine years. I have already said that this is not a matter of policy, but in a sense one of technicality. I admit that this regulation is not nearly so flagrant as that on which the High Court made its pronouncement. In that case there was a contract between the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department and a number of broadcasting companies, setting out certain terms between the two parties. Subsequently the broadcasting company entered into an agreement under which it sold or assigned to the Dominion Broadcasting Proprietary Limited all licence-fees and revenue received from broadcasting operations between certain dates. The Postmaster-General&#39;s Department came in subsequently, and tried to increase the amount it was entitled to withhold, which meant that the actual financial rights under the contract were detrimentally affected. The case dealt with by the High Court was a particularly bad one, but ethieally the statutoryrule now before the Senate is not bad. It seeks to legalize payments to officials by the Dried Fruits Export Control Board, dating back, in some instances to 1926. No doubt, these payments have already been made and as such I have no objection to them. They were proper payments, I expect, but they cannot he legalized by a regulation of this kind. The only way in which they can be validated is by legislative action. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It lays down that the amendments effected by the preceding regulation shall be deemed to have taken effect on the 28th day of April, 1926, and the High Court held, in effect, that a provision of the kind was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> not only in respect of the past, but also in respect of the future. This matter came before the notice of the committee only a week ago, and, through the secretary, application was made to the Department of Commerce to ascertain the reason for the regulation. The committee desired more information upon the general purport of the regulation, particularly as to why it was necessary to make the amendment retrospective to the year 1926, and as to whether such provision was not invalid. The Department of Commerce offered the following explanation, which I shall give to the Senate, because it indicates that the matter in itself, apart from its legal aspect, is not of great importance :  - </para>

                    <para>The Commonwealth Auditor-General upheld the view of his London officer and accordingly in order to validate payments which had then been made to these employees the amending Statutory Rule (No. 29 of 1935) was promulgated. </para>

                    <para>It is, however, pointed out that these amendments do not provide for the payment of increased salaries to any of the board&#39;s employees and that they merely legalize certain payments made in London which had been questioned by the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth as being outside the scope of the regulations (Statutory Rule No. 55of 1926) as they then stood. </para>

                        <para>This is not a matter upon which the department might properly venture an opinion, and it would appear to be more appropriate ii the legality of the regulations are in doubt, for this question to be referred to the law officers of the Crown. </para>

                    <para>This, then, is purely a matter of legalizing the payment of sums of money made in the past to certain officials who earned them and were entitled to receive them; hut the procedure adopted, the committee maintains, does not validate the payments at all, and, in view of the judgment which I quoted, the regulation is palpably invalid. In my opinion, too, it is not desirable that the administration should have power to make retrospective enactments affecting expenditure so far back as ten years, or it might be, 20 or 30 years. I am not a supporter of retrospective legislation by this chamber, but the danger of retrospective action becomes greater if it may be taken by any branch of the administration. The Acts Interpretation Act specifically lays down that regulations shall come into force only from the time that they appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> or from a later date. </para>

                            <para>- In fact the regulation goes hack over a number of different administrations. I am quite prepared to admit that this procedure has been followed inadvertently, but the mistake is so obvious that I cannot imagine that the regulation can be defended on any ground. It is eminently desirable that the Senate should act in circumstances such as these, for the regulation infringes on the right of the general public, although it has not detrimentally affected any specific person. If it had done so, the legality of the regulation might have been tested in the courts, but where no particular person is detrimentally affected it devolves upon Parliament to object to regulations of this kind - which are detrimental to the interests of the puhlic generally, in order that they may be safeguarded. I hope that I am not oversanguine in anticipating that the Government will agree that the regulation should be disallowed. I shall be interested to hear any defence that may be offered on its behalf. Only this year the matter was decided in the court by a majority decision of three judges, and the fourth judge, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich, although he delivered a separate judgment, -was of substantially the same opinion as the majority. </para>

                            <para>- HUGHES. - A payment can onlybe legalized by legal means. According to the Acts Interpretation Act, and especially in view of the High Court&#39;s decision, the regulation is invalid. The committee for which I speak, was appointed for the purpose of seeing that regulations of this kind which conflict with the law are not allowed to stand, and there is proper provision, of which the committee has taken advantage, for an objection to be lodged to such within a specified period. I hope that the Government will realize that if the work of this committee, which is most laborious, involving as it does a great deal of attention to detail, with very little result to show, is to be disregarded in such a palpable case of invalidity as the present one, it is hardly worth while for the committee to waste its time on the work which it is doing for the benefit of the general community, and which is plainly within the terms of the powers it was meant to exercise. Whether or not the Government agrees I again emphasize that all members of the committee are unanimously of the opinion that the regulation is invalid and should be disallowed. The duty of the committee appears to me to be perfectly clear, and it is on its behalf that I move for the disallowance of the regulation. </para>

                        PEARCE.But this is the first report which calls for action and I think we should be extremely careful, when establishing new procedure, to see that the rights of the Senate are safeguarded. Two things have been done in connexion with Senate procedure which, I venture to say, have been of the greatest convenience to senators and also have safeguarded the privileges and rights of this chamber. I refer to the insertion in the Senate Standing Orders of Standing Order No. 66a which reads -

                    <para class="block">Then it goes on to provide, that, among other things, a motion for the disallowance of a regulation or ordinance shall take precedence.

                        PEARCE.Yes. Their insertion gave the Senate a control, which it had not possessed previously, over acts of administration. It may be argued that the exercise of thispower in respect of a particular regulation, such as the kind mentioned by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#39;Sampson,</inline>
                        comes within the scope of the committee. But my objection is that the motion is a dual one; it is a private motion for disallowance, hut it is also, in the words of the mover, the opinion of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I take exception to that. If the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has a report to make to the Senate, that, report should be submitted in accordance with the provisions of the Standing Orders and in no other way. Standing Order 36a deals with the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and provides in paragraph 4 -
                    </para>

                        <para>All regulations and ordinances laid on the table of the Senate shall stand referred to such committee for consideration and, if necessary, report thereon.

                    <para class="block">If we are to hear from that committee, that is the procedure which it should follow. The Standing Orders do not authorize any member of that committee, to take action, on notice of motion, for the disallowance of regulations. I therefore ask the Senate to disregard the statement of the mover of the motion that, in this matter,he is acting on the authority and with the approval of the committee, because it has not power so to authorize him. In appointing the Regulations and Ordinances Committee the Senate said, in effect, to that body - &#34; We ask you to consider all regulations and ordinances to see if any contain provisions to which exception should be taken, and if so, to report that fact to the Senate. The Senate is the master of its own business and will then decide what shall be done.&#34; That was the procedure which the committee should have adopted. If now we accept the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> we shall be creating a precedent which may prove to be extremely dangerous. </para>

                        PEARCE.As the honorable senator has said, the Standing Orders of the Senate fix a time limit for disallowance of regulations or ordinances. For that reason an honorable senator may think that action should, at this stage, be taken to disallow the regulation to which objection is taken. But the mover of the motion gave us to understand that he was taking this action at the request and on behalf of the committee.

                        PEARCE.- If the committee took that view it could recommend accordingly. Obviously, it is not competent for any honorable senator to move for the disallowance of a regulation at the direction or request of the committee, but he may take such action on his own initiative as a member of the Senate. My principal reason for rising was to express the hope that, in future, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee will not follow the procedure adopted in connexion with this matter now before the Senate, and to ask honorable senators that, whatever may be their attitude to the subject-matter of the motion, not to &#39;accept it in its present form, thus establishing an undesirable, and possibly dangerous, precedent. I do not know what steps the committee took to inform its collective mind on the merits of the regulation, but I assume that it summoned certain officials to attend before it. I think
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline>
                        mentioned that the committee discussed the regulation with the secretary of the Department of Commerce. It might happen that on some future occasion the committee, while not being fully informedabout a regulation, will reach a certain decision, and, because of that decision, every member of the committee will feel himself bound to support a motion made in the Senate.

Certain aspects of a regulation which were not known to the committee might then be revealed and senators would not feel in duty &#39;bound to support the recommendation of the committee.

                        <para>. - I am in complete agreement with the remarks of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> Honorable senators should endeavour to visualize the position which might arise if we accepted the motion in its present form. There is a deal of difference between the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> this afternoon and a motion to disallow, following the presentation of a formal report from the committee. If we recognize the right of any committee of the Senate to move that certain legislation, whether made by regulation or ordinance, should be disallowed, we shall, in effect, be acknowledging that r.he committee is superior to Parliament. 1 could never accept that position. If  i  his regulation were in terms similar to other regulations that have been made in recent years, concerning which a great deal of bitterness was engendered, not perhaps in this chamber so much as in the House of Representatives, what would have been the position if an honorable senator, in his capacity as a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, had moved for its disallowance? The correct procedure for the committee is to present its formal report for the consideration of the Senate. To ask us to disallow a regulation merely because the Regulations and Ordinances Committee thinks it should be disallowed is to take away from this branch of the legislature authority which we should guard very jealously. </para>

That may be so in a technical sense; but the fact remains that no person has been detrimentally affected by it. The regulation came into force in March, .1932, as an amendment of Statutory Rule No. 55 of 1926. Section 1 2 of the Dried Fruits Export Control Act provides that the salaries and conditions of employment of officers appointed under that act shall be as prescribed. In 1932 an officer of the Auditor-General&#39;s Department in London questioned the correctness of certain payments, and expressed the view that a distinction should be drawn between persons who were officers of the Dried Fruits Board and others who were its servants. He thought that the man in charge of the Fumigation branch, and another classed as a messenger and assistant, would more correctly be designated as servants than as officers, because they occupied relatively minor positions in London. As the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor concurred in that view doubt existed as to whether the amounts paid to those two minor employees were legally paid. There was no question of the correctness of the payments other than in law. In order to validate the payments, which no one has ever disputed were proper payments for services rendered, the present statutory rule was brought into operation. Later, the High Court ruled that, by virtue of section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act, a statutory rule could not be made retrospective. The regulation under review purported to be, effective as from the 28th April, 1926. No question as to the right of the , men to receive the money paid to them arises, nor is their status affected. The regulation which sought to validate the payments made to them also covered the newly created office of Economic Adviser in Australia.

                    <para>Although I admit that technical grounds exist for the motion, there is no real substance in the complaint made against the regulation. I point out tha J neither House of the Parliament has power to amend a regulation; it must accept or disallow the regulation <inline font-style="italic">in tot&#34;.</inline> I wish to make it clear that the regulation was not made in defiance of the judgment of the High Court, and ask honorable senators to reflect on the result of disallowing it. </para>

                            <para>- A new regulation could be brought in. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> implied that the whole regulation was bad in law by reason of the High Court judgment, but I point out that paragraphs 1 and 2 of the regulation are perfectly valid. But they would be disallowed if the motion were agreed to. I take it that the only desire of honorable senators is to reject that part of the regulation which conflicts with the decision of the High Court. For that reason, I ask them to reject the motion. But, in order that there shall be no suggestion of flouting the High Court, I undertake that if the motion is rejected, the Government will either repeal the regulation or amend it by removing the offending provision. </para>

Honorable senators should be content to leave the adjustment of this matter to the Government, which will, if necessary, introduce a bill for the purpose. Whatever is done-, honorable senators can rest assured that the regulation will be so amended as not to offend against the decision of the High Court. </para>

It is only fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> to say that the committee was actuated by the best intentions and the knowledge that any action to disallow the regulation must be taken within fifteen sitting  days  after the tabling of the regulation. I think that I am right when I say that to-day is the last day when action to disallow the regulation can be taken. I realize the force of the remarks of the Leader of the Senate concerning the danger of setting up an undesirable precedent, and I assure him and the Senate that the committee has no desire to interfere with the ordinary procedure in this chamber. In my opinion, there is nothing in the Standing Orders to require a report to be made by the committee in writing. It may be that a written report is preferable to a verbal one, but the Standing Orders do not preclude the making  of  reports other than in writing. </para>

Whatever honorable senators may think of the way in which this subject has been brought before the Senate, they will, I think, credit the committee with having done its duty in drawing attention to it. In general I concur with the remarks of the Leader of the Government, and I accept the undertaking given by the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan).</inline> However, in this matter, responsibility certainly rests with the Senate and I remind honorable senators that this is the last day upon which we can take action in the matter. </para>

Section 12 of theDried Fruits Export Control Act provides power to appoint officers, and also that officers appointed in pursuance of that section should not be subject to the Commonwealth Public Service Act. A further sub-section provides that the salaries and conditions of employment of officers appointed in pursuance of this section shall be prescribed. The prescriptions were framed practically on the same lines as the schedules which honorable senators will find attached to this regulation except for some omissions. In a desire to meet criticisms of the Audit Office, the regulation was amended in terms which have now been challenged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes.</inline> I point out that a distinction can be drawn between the broadcasting case to which the &#39;honorable senator referred and the matter with which we are now dealing.

The broadcasting case, because it concerned accrued rights and vested interests, was very different from the matter to which the statutory rule under discussion applies and it appears that the High Court strained the effect of. section 10 in the interests of common justice. Here we are not attempting to interfere with anybody&#39;s rights. We are endeavouring to vest with authority and protect certain officers who, without such protection, would be liable to the Crown for the amounts they have disbursed without proper regulating authority. It was never intended under the Dried Fruits Export Control Act that the whole of the staff payments should be regulated by the statute itself. It was intended that such should &#39;be prescribed by regulation and the regulation is retrospective in effect only insofar as it endeavours to empower, regulate, and legalize something that has already been done. </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that the case upon which the honorable senator relies is absolutely distinguishable from the present ease as the observations of the justices who delivered the judgment will show. Regulation 67 A, which was involved in the broadcasting case, was one empowering the Crown to deduct certain payments, and that was made retrospective. In the opinion of the court, it was retrospective legislation with a vengeance, in that it interfered retrospectively with the accrued rights of certain people.

                    <para>The point is that that regulation cut across rights that had already accrued. The regulation before the Senate, insofar . as it embodies the old regulation, has been in force for a considerable time. I do not think it was intended that the statutes should contain all these details. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> is right in the contention that all retrospective regulations are bad, then there is only one way to avoid them, and that is to inflict a body of detailed statute law on the Parliament from time to time. While the point at issue may not be of any importance with regard to this particular case, it becomes of considerable importance in the entire administration of Commonwealth affairs. The strong point in favour of the honorable senator&#39;s argument is contained in the majority judgment of the Chief Justice and Justices Evatt and McTiernan - </para>

                        <para>In our opinion this clause is inconsistent: with section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1904-1930 and is void . . . This objection is, of itself, sufficient to invalidate the regulation, but its invalidity can be demonstrated upon broader grounds. For the essence of the regulation is its attempt to alter and set aside the accrued rights of those who had already provided a broadcasting service to the public, and for whose remuneration provision had already been made in the regulations. No  one  disputes that the mere fact that a statute of the Commonwealth Parliament operates retrospectively is insufficient to invalidate it. Hut, where the executive Government attempts to give to a regulation a retroactive operation the validity of the regulation is necessarily dependent upon the precise term of tha grant which the Parliament has conferred upon the executive. </para>

                            <para>- I think so. One must look at these things in a workaday world as referring to ordinary  commercial  conditions. For  instance  clerks, fumigators and others are required, from day to day, as shipments of fruit arrive in London, and these matters cannot be regulated entirely from Australia. I suggest that these are not conditions of the kind which the judgment of the court aims at. Nor do 1 believe that if section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act stood alone, the court would have decided as it did. Regulation 67a really represented an effort on the part of the Executive Council, without the authority of thu Parliament, to prevent certain people from receiving payments to which, in the opinion of the court, they were entitled, and the attempt was made retrospectively. The court said that the essence of  the  regulation was its attempt to alter and set aside an accrued right. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich, in his judgment, said - &#91;n my opinion, the regulation is void insofar a* it purports to authorize a further deduction from thu available revenue accruing prior to the date of its adoption. </para>

If the Senate adopted the motion on the grounds that this regulation is illegal it would be constituting itself a court, and applying a principle which was applied by the court to a totally different set of circumstances. The Senate would also be interpreting section 10 of the Acts Interpretation Act in a way in which I do not think it should be interpreted. The law provides that all regulations made shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be notified in the Government <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and shall come into effect from the date of such notification.

                            <para>- The gravamen of his objection is based on paragraph 3 which makes it retrospective. The honorable senator is asking the Senate to constitute itself a court of law and to say that every retrospective regulation adopted by the executive must necessarily be illegal. That is going very far. This is a matter requiring most careful consideration. I have had a fairly long ministerial experience and I am sure that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will agree with me that this is by no means an isolated case. A perusal of the statutory rules and regulations would reveal that there are hundreds involving retrospective action. </para>

Standing Order 36a provides that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee is a standing committee, and Standing Order 37a provides that the procedure to be adopted in the proceedings of a standing committee shall be the same as in a select committee unless the Senate otherwise orders. This standing committee is governed by the rules of a select committee. Standing Order 310 provides that it shall be the duty of the  chairman  of every select committee . to prepare a draft report. It is clear from Standing Order 311 that the draft report has to be in writing, and that each part of the report has to be submitted to members of the committee so that they may vote upon it. Standing Order 312 provides that there may be an alternative report, No. 313 for re-consideration, and No. 314 for the report of the committee to be signed by the  chairman.  It is clear that the report of the committee must be in writing and signed by the  chairman.  The Standing Orders continue -

The motion asks the Senate, not the  President  or the committee, to disallow the regulation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> skated around the main point, and I regard his explanation as being like the curate&#39;s egg, good in parts. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J.

                            <para>- The honorable senator acknowledged it in a very halfhearted and offhanded manner. The committee has rendered great service to this chamber. No honorable senator can say that this regulation, is good. The Senate desires to know whether it is good or bad. Some honorable senators stated that the chamber was constituting itself a court of law; but the Senate is given the power to disallow, and we are entitled to pronounce on every regulation our considered judgment. The alternative is to have government by regulation, and bills might as well become law without consulting this chamber at all.. I support the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes.</inline></para>

                        <para>. - Having listened attentively to the remarks of Ministers, I fail to understand why they feel obliged to support something which in their hearts they know is not correct. I took particular  interest in the extracts which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan quoted from the judgment of the &#39;High Court. The judges stated not once, but several times that the regulation was invalid, not only because it was retrospective, but also for other reasons, but the point mentioned by them, first was always the retrospective aspect. This regulation purports to validate payments made since 1926. Certain honorable senators stated that this chamber has no judicial decision to guide it in this matter. I say that the verdict of the majority of judges of the High Court was definite and unequivocal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> stated that the regulation, with the exception of paragraph 3, was valid. The Government is seeking to do by a subterfuge what should be done by legislation. No honorable senator can deny that. </para>

                            <para>-No ; but this chamber is constantly having to pass legislation to validate something that has been done irregularly. Although this particular matter may be regarded as unimportant, because it concerns only one or two people, and the public is not vitally interested in it, a big principle is involved. If another party took office and promulgated regulations to make something retrospective over the terms of three or four parliaments, would honorable senators sitting on this side of the chamber consent to it? Because the matter immediately at stake is small, we should not be prepared to accept something which we know is wrong in principle, and dangerous. I support the motion to disallow the regulation. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not propose to deal with the legal aspect of this debate, because, having heard the different arguments advanced by the legal gentlemen who sit in this chamber - and I shall leave legal technicalities to them - I confess myself more confused than ever. As a Labour member of that committee, I attended every sitting, and I can inform honorable senators that we investigated this matter very closely. In bringing before this Senate something which we believe to be wrong, we have done what we consider to be ourduty. The committee was unanimously of the opinion, in the light of the judgment of the High Court, that the regulation was bad in principle, because it was retrospective for a period of nine years. The committee, therefore, decided toacquaint the Senate of its decision, with a view to having the regulation disallowed. Perhaps we have not observed all the forms demanded by the StandingOrders relating to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. The most serious omission appears to me to be, not so much in respect of the presentation of the report - the Standing Orders do not state whether it shall be verbal, typewritten, or printed - as in the failure to give notice of the motion to the Senate. The committee did not give notice, but it had an excellent reason for failing to do so; only one day remained of the period within which the regulation could be disallowed. Hence the committee gave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> authority to make the report verbally. </para>

                            <para>- We found that there are other regulations which are retrospective, though perhaps they are not so important. The committee considered that this matter was of sufficient importance to warrant its being brought before the Senate. This is a subject which, apart from, the legal technicalities, must appeal to every honorable senator as one that should engage the attention of this chamber. Ministers have admitted that something should be done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> representing the Attorney-General, stated that the matter would be referred to the department concerned, and that something different from the existing regulation would be introduced. I repeat, the committee was unanimously of the opinion that the Senate should be informed of its discovery, and any failure to comply with the formalities that has occurred was due to the pressure of time. There has been frequently a protest, particularly by the Opposition,, against legislation by administrative act or regulation. Undoubtedly every honorable senator is interested in having the position clarified, so that the committee and the Senate may know what are their powers when reviewing ordinances that involve a possible encroachment on the legislative power of the Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that, and I consider the procedure to be perfectly in order if the committee empowered the  chairman  to take this course. I fail to see the cause for any worry and excitement over a course of action which is not prohibited by the Standing Orders. It is not mandatory that the committee should first submit a written report to the Senate, before a senator may move in his private capacity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan said that the judgment of the High Court in the broadcasting case &#62;vas based on the protection of accrued rights. In that case a private enterprise applied to the court, and obtained judgment in its favour. Suppose that the regulation now under consideration had been made retrospective in respect of the action of some one in London who had reduced the wages of certain employees of the Department of Commerce. Honorable senators agree that retrospective legislation is wrong in principle when it affects adversely the individual citizen. Under a retrospective regulation, workers in London might be obliged to return wages paid to them over a series of years. For instance, an unfortunate man employed by the board in fumigating goods in London might be called upon to refund a portion of his wages. I have never been&#39; in favour of wage reduction, whether it affects Parliamentarians in Canberra or workers in London. The Assistant Minister has suggested that one result of the disallowance of this regulation may be that a humble worker in London will have to repay wages received since 1926. If so, I shall be compelled to vote against the judgment of the committee, because I feel sure that, whenever the opportunity presents itself, certain people will always move the courts to do as I have indicated. Only a few days ago I had brought under my notice a case in which action was taken in the courts to secure a refund of portion of wages paid to Brisbane workers who had been taken off relief work and given regular employment for five and a half days a week. The result was that their position at the end of each week was worse than it would have been had they remained on relief work. </para>

                        <para>. - I regard the retrospective nature of these regulations as particularly dangerous. Lord Hewart, inThe <inline font-style="italic">New Despotism,</inline> has emphasized that Parliament is being robbed of its legislative functions by governments legislating for the community by regulations. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> A. Bland, lecturer an public administration in the University of Sydney, and recognized as the foremost authority in Australia on parliamentary institutions and their working, has also directed attention to this trend in recent years, and has pointed out that legislators are really becoming merely cogs in a gigantic law-making machine. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Massy-Greene</inline> this afternoon reminded us that during the last few years hundreds of regulations, having retrospective effect, had been adopted by both Houses nf the Parliament. This being so, it is time that the Senate called a &#34; show down &#34;. It is bad enough when regulations having no retrospective effect take the place of legislation by Parliament. Regulations that are retrospective in their effect may, and often do, have direful results. All retrospective legislation that has been passed by Parliaments, Commonwealth or State, has been objectionable. It is urged, <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> support of this trend in legislation, that errors made in administration are covered up by the issue of retrospective regulations. This expedient places in the hands of Ministers the most effective and dangerous instrument that could be devised to cover up administrative faults, because, as frequently happens, large numbers of regulations are laid on the table, and, unless disallowed within the prescribed period, they become law. Legislation by this method. is an abrogation of the best British traditions of parliamentary government. I am, therefore, definitely opposed to a continuance of the practice, if it is a practice, of issuing regulations of a retrospective character. To replace legislation by regulations is to prevent this chamber from discharging its proper functions as a house of review, and from amending legislation which, in its opinion, should be altered. </para>

                    <para>Regulations may be of a far-reaching nature, yet it seems to me that many honorable senators do not scrutinize them as carefully as they should. Among those who gave evidence before the Select Committee appointed by the Senate to consider the advisability of setting up standing committees to deal with, amongst other things, regulations and ordinances, were several outstanding constitutional lawyers who advised members of Parliament to be careful to scrutinize all regulations. I trust that honorable senators will read the report of the Select Committee and in future give to regulations the consideration that they deserve. </para>

                    <para>Three points in connexion with this subject appear to me to be relevant. The first is whether my statement that I have represented the unanimous view of the committee, is disputed. Is it suggested that I have not made a truthful statement about the unanimity of the members of the committee in regard to this matter? I do not think that the Leader of the Government would accuse me of a deliberate mis-statement. Indeed, it would have been foolish of me to claim to represent the unanimous view of the committee if that were not so in fact, because the members of that committee could, and no doubt would, have disagreed with me. </para>

I do not wish to occupy the whole of the time at my disposal in discussing this point, since the  President  has ruled that I am in order. If it is contended that other procedure would have been preferable, T point oat that I almost suggested that in my opening remarks. But as the course which I have taken is also within the rules of the Senate, surely I am in no way blameworthy. Of course, the members of the committee,, one &#39;by one, could have agreed with what I said ; but it did not appear to the committee that there was need for that to be done. </para>

                    <para>I am forced to take notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan&#39;s</inline> statement that the decision of the High Court had not come to the notice of the department when the new regulation wa3 issued. The judgment of the High Court was delivered on the 21st February and the regulation was dated the 26th March. Are we to imagine that the law officers of the Crown are not conversant with a High Court judgment until five or six weeks after it has been delivered, particularly when it may affect not only the regulation in respect of which the decision was given but also a number of other regulations? Although the full verbatim report of a case might not be available for some time, surely the legal advisers of the Crown are informed, in some detail, of a decision of the High Court soon after it is made. I should have thought that at least a type-written report of every judgment is made available to them immediately. </para>

                        also said that no person had been detrimentally affected by the regulation. What about the taxpayers? If money has been paid without legal authority, some one is detrimentally affected. Although I happen to have been called to the bar, I am not practising at. present, and have not done so for 20 years. For that reason I do not speak as a lawyer when I say that in my opinion
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Massy-Greene</inline>
                        was wrong in the views that he expressed. The honorable senator&#39;s contention was equivalent to saying that it is not for the Senate to set itself up as a High Court. A person who consults a number of lawyers very likely receives a different opinion from each of them. But surely when we have before us u regulation which obviously is governed by a decision of the High Court this year, it is only courtesy to that tribunal t hat this chamber should recognize that decision, and its application to the present circumstances; otherwise it will mean, in all probability, that every case will have to be fought before the High Court, and the right of this chamber to disallow regulations will simply disappear because there may always be argument on points of law. The Assistant Minister has amply confirmed my views on the legal aspect of this matter. The Postmaster-General

                            <para>- I admitted that three judges gave a majority judgment, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich gave substantially a similar decision on different grounds. If it will help the Minister I now admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Starke, who is an exceedingly able lawyer, took . a different view in his judgment. I take it that in opposing my motion members of the Government do not admit that my legal contention is correct. I hold that it is correct, and I am not prepared to accept any undertaking that may be given by the Assistant Minister. For that matter, if we are to be governed so very closely by the Standing Orders, there is nothing in them, dealing with the acceptance of undertakings. </para>

It should not be provided for by departmental and administrative regulation. </para>

                            <para>- Such a minor matter as the payment of a fumigator may not be all that is involved in considering these regulations. An examination of regulations which have been passed recently indicates that this is not the only one. which offends against the judgment of the High Court. I reiterate that the committee has accomplished what it was asked to do. Certain powers were delegated to it by the Senate and, I think, it was on the motion of the Leader of the Senate that the committee was constituted. The matter we have considered is probably not of first importance except in respect of the principle involved. The committee has indicated what it considers to be the proper action to be taken. Any member of it who is of the opinion that the Ministers&#39; answers meet all requirements in this matter, is at full liberty to vote with the Government, but I take the view that the committee has acted properly in the matter and has considered the interests of the community. I propose to vote accordingly. </para>

                        <para>Some of the regulations are relatively unimportant, and do not require such aclose scrutiny. The important regulations needing scrutiny are those which impose substantive law and prescribe the rights and duties of whole classes of citizens. I draw attention in that category to another block of regulations in the same section - those relating . to licences. The rules provide that the Government may by proclamation prohibit the export of dried fruit except under licence and the conditions under which licences may be granted are very rigid and definite in the regulations. </para>

There are others, who are members of the Independent Dried Fruits Association of South Australia, on whose behalf I am speaking, an independent organization, formed because of the rigid nature of the regulations. That association, which was formed in December of last year, now has a membership of over 1,000, who dispose of the whole or a portion of the crops of 1,200 to 1,500 fruit-growers.

This association controls a kind of pool, and growers sell fruit on consignment. The independent organization which buys fruit for cash is giving such satisfaction to a large number of growers in South Australia that its business has increased considerably. This independent undertaking has increased its operations so substantially that the Australian Dried Fruits Association has become concerned at the amount of business that it is losing to the organization. The board controlling the export of dried fruits is composed of eight members drawn as follows : two from Victoria, and one each from New South Wales, South Australia- and Western Australia, while the remaining three are appointed by the Government.

Murdoch, of Waikerie, a prominent member of the Australian Dried Fruits Association. Theses men have done excellent work, and they are highly respected and esteemed in South Australia.

In my opinion, this board is prejudiced against the majority of the independent growers, who have rendered good service to the industry. They are quite prepared to submit to reasonable regulations. But it is for honorable senators, not a board dominated by the Australian Dried Fruits Association, which is most anxious to protect its own interests, to define what are reasonable regulations. </para>

These men are anxious to sell their product for cash, and there are ready buyers waiting. Wheat-growers are in much the same position. One honorable senator present, who is a prominent wheat-grower, can please himself whether he sells to the pool or privately - a privilege which he prizes most highly. </para>

In support of what I have said about the tactics of the board I shall mention one or two incidents that are reported to have occurred. Under the act exporters of dried fruits are required to obtain the permission of the board. I am advised that some time ago a merchant sold a shipment of dried fruit to a Canadian firm at a price f.o.b. Port Adelaide, to be shipped by a vessel named by the purchaser.  His  request to be allowed to send <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> fruit by this vessel was refused by the board, notwithstanding that the price had received the board&#39;s approval. The merchant was required to send the shipment to Melbourne and thence to Canada by a vessel sailing from- that port. </para>

                            <para>- Between 1,200 and 1,500 growers sell the whole or portion of their fruit through this organization. They know that they can sell for cash whereas if they sell through the Australian Dried Fruits Association they have to chance what they will get. Therefore they are more vitally concerned than are the merchants. Naturally the Canadian buyer was incensed at the action of the board.  His  comments were published in the monthly circular of the <inline font-style="italic">Dried Fruits Producer,</inline> an Adelaide trade journal, on the 20th June, <inline font-style="italic">1935.</inline> To be absolutely fair I made available to the Minister the information which had been placed in my hands, in order that justice should be done to the growers. This is what the Canadian buyer-broker had to say about the matter- </para>

                            <para>- No; but I am in favour of some control. I submit that the Senate should see that regulations, framed for the purpose of controlling the export of our primary products, do not operate unjustly against legitimate competitors. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Uppill,</inline> quite properly favours, or does not object to, a voluntary pool for wheat because it permits him to sell either to the pool or in the open market, whichever offers him the better return. I take the same view with regard to the marketing of our dried fruits. The buyer broker continued - </para>

                        <para>The board probably knows as well as the buyers know that as long as Australian prices are as favorable as they are to-day, owing to the fact that they have no duty to contend with, there is nothing to fear. However, the time will come probably on the next change of government, which may be within the next twelve months, when there may be some changes in the Canadian-Australian treaty and raisins from other countries may be permitted to come in without the present handicap. When this comes, buyers will not give the same support to Australia as they have been more or less compelled to give in the past. </para>

                    <para class="block">There was similar trouble in connexion with another contract for the sale of fruit to Canada. The exporter, having secured the necessary licence, contracted to sell a certain quantity at a price which was acceptable to the board. One of the terms was that the fruit should be shipped from Adelaide in April. As the exporter was unable to get space in the April boat he was obliged to ship it in May, and because it was being exported a month later the board would not allow the fruit to go forward at the original price. This was what the Canadian broker had to say about that decision - </para>

I submit that it is incumbent on the honorable senator to do this, otherwise any honorable senator could submit a motion objecting to certain sections of acts, and in that way seek to annul legislation which had been passed by Parliament. </para>

                    <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon. P. J.</inline> Lynch). - The point of order taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> is an important one. He submits that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay,</inline> in support of his motion to disallow the regulations made under the Dried Fruits Export Control Act, should show that they discriminate unfairly against certain sections of the industry concerned. Up to this point in his argument <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> has produced evidence of, discrimination, and in asking the Senate to disallow the regulations he is seeking to give a relief to those producers who, in his opinion, have suffered because of this discrimination. Therefore I rule that the honorable senator is in order, but I shall expect him to show that the regulations are not in conformity with the act. </para>

                            <para>- The motion is within the Standing Orders, for it is within the power of the Senate to disallow these regulations which are far too drastic. The board is using them unfairly, and if we allow them to remain in their present form, we shall do a great injustice to a number of citizens. </para>

                    <para>The people concerned were given only one day&#39;3 notice that these regulations were to come into force.  That was most unreasonable. They immediately approached the Export Control Board and asked for a conference. No reply was received to their first letter, but to the second communication the board replied refusing the request. Such actions prove that the board is biased, and that there is need for these regulations to be carefully considered &#39;by honorable senators. </para>
                    <para>I am opposed to only three or four of these regulations, yet, apparently, I must either accept or reject them all. I favour the fixation of prices, the regulation of quantities, and the control of a number of matters by a board , but I am opposed to vesting too much power in one body if thereby the growers in the industry are placed in a precarious position. </para>

                            <para>- There would be no difficulty, provided the board were not so biased as to be determined to stop its competitors. I am in favour of a quota and of a fixed price, but I am not in favour of the Australian Dried Fruits Association dominating the board and driving its competitors out of business. Other merchants who are in competition with the Australian Dried Fruits Association have established sheds, and sent agents to Canada where they have been successful in obtaining markets. They have given satisfaction to the growers, and should not be interfered with unreasonably. The regulations which the new regulations seek to repeal have been in operation for ten years and until recently have &#39;been fairly &#39; rigidly enforced. The independent members have not objected to that where the board has acted reasonably; and despite the difficulties with which they have had to contend, they have given fairly general satisfaction. If, however, some of the new regulations are not disallowed the independent exporters will be driven out of business, the money they have expended will be lost, and additional men will be seeking jobs. Moreover, nearly 1,500 growers who dispose of their fruit to these cash buyers, will be at the mercy of the Australian Dried Fruits Association. Many of them were previously members of that association but left it voluntarily. I trust that honorable senators will assert their rights, and not allow the board to decide what regulations shall be in force. </para>

                    <para>When the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> was speaking this afternoon, I, as a new senator, thought that, in some way, sacred rights had been interfered with, because the right honorable gentleman seemed offended- at the course of action which had been taken. I respect &#39;his judgment, and ask him to give the Senate a lead in the matter of legislation by regulation. I ask him to indicate in what way these regulations can &#39;be modified so as to make them less drastic. The regulations are signed &#34; By  His  Excellency&#39;s Command, Earle Page, Minister of State for Commerce.&#34; I do not, know wl&#39; ether regulations are sent directly to the Governor-General by the Minister concerned or whether they have to be. approved by Cabinet. If they are the result of a Cabinet decision, I can appreciate the position of the Leader of the Senate, because loyalty among Cabinet colleagues has to be observed. I appeal to honorable senators to weigh every aspect of this matter carefully and if they believe that these regulations go too far, to do the right thing irrespective of any other consideration. What ever our decision may be, I hope that it will be in the best interests of the industry as a whole. </para>
                    <para>Summing up, I claim that the Export Control Board is dominated by the Australian Dried Fruits Association, and that the latter body resents outside competition. The export trade should be regulated fairly, in the interests of all sections of the industry, including those who wish to sell for cash as well as those who sell through the Australian Dried Fruits Association on consignment. Some of these regulations are not designed to control export, but to drive exporters, who buy for cash, out of business; some infringe the rights and privileges of a large number of growers; and some of them constitute a chain of laws established by regulation, a practice against which, as I pointed out this afternoon, the honorable the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> protested when he gave evidence before the commission. If it is desired to establish a compulsory pool for the industry, then it is not for the board to establish such a pool by regulation, but for Parliament to do so by legislation. I draw attention to the evidence given on the 30th January, 1930, by Professor Kenneth Hamilton Bailey, Professor of Jurisprudence and Dean of the Faculty of Law in the University of Melbourne, before the Select Committee of the Senatewhich inquired into the establishment of standing committees, and upon whosereport the Regulations and Ordinances Committee was founded. ProfessorBailey said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Those regulations affect intimately and invery great detail the livelihood of a class of citizens, and they call for special scrutiny. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Those regulations were of minor importance compared with these with which I am now dealing. Evidently ProfessorBailey was an independent thinker. I wonder what he would say if he happened to be an honorable senator to whom fell the duty of considering the regulations to which I am now referring - regulations which are much more drastic than those he said should be carefully scrutinized. I. hope that these regulations will be fully debated. I do not desire to do injustice to any member of the Australian Dried Fruits Association. That organization has done much for the dried fruits- industry. This Government also has done much to help the industry, and having gone so far I now appeal to it not to allow that board to suppress legitimate competition. These 1,500 men whom the Australian Dried Fruits Association opposes have shown admirable ability and initiative in private enterprise, and, having explored overseas markets, can offer better prices to the grower who is prepared to sell for cash. Would the Senate agree to driving such men out of a business in which they have become independent through their ability and perseverance. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Extension of time granted.&#93;</inline></para>

                <para>The purpose of the bill is to appropriate &#163;12,000,000 from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. It has been customary in the past to seek parliamentary approval for the periodical appropriation of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10,000,000</inline> for this purpose, the last appropriation having been made in </para>
                <para class="block">August, 1934. The amount then provided is now almost exhausted. For some years &#163;10,000,000 has been sufficient to cover approximately one year&#39;s expenditure, and Parliament has been asked to appropriate this amount each year; bur the annual rate of expenditure now exceeds &#163;12,000,000, the amount included in this year&#39;s budget for this purpose being &#163;12,770,000. For this reason Parliament is now being asked to appropriate &#163;12,000,000 instead of the customary &#163;10,000,000. Honorable senators will be interested to know that the total amount appropriated by Parliament for invalid and old-age pensions since the inception of the system has been &#163;171,250,000. The actual expenditure to the 30th September was &#163;163,564,000. The balance of &#163;2,686,000 will be sufficient to meet the claims only to the 30th November next. The amount being provided by this bill will be paid to the credit of the invalid and old-age pensions account from which the payment of pensions is made. I point out that, as is usual in a bill of this description, there is no provision dealing with the rate of pension or the conditions under which pensions are paid. </para>

On the recommendation of the. Commonwealth Grants Commission special grants were made to these States in respect of the financial year 1934-35. The amounts included in this bill and the other two measures to come before the Senate are in accord with the further recommenda tions of that commission. These amounts and the amounts for last year are as follows :  -

                    <para>In its second report relating to grants for the year 1935-36, the commission has examined the position of the claimant States at much greater length. The report shows that the commission has spared no pains in an endeavour to arrive at an equitable measurement of the assistance that should be rendered to Claimant States. Doubtless, honorable senators have studied the second report, but I should like to refer to some of its main features. First, the commission -adheres, in effect, to the principle of its first report, and recommends grants based on the relative budget positions so as to -enable claimant States &#34;to function at a reasonable standard with an effort appropriate to their particular situations.&#34; It adds that the adverse effects of federal policy are not, in themselves, grounds for assistance, and that whatever the federal policy may be, a State has no claim for assistance if it is in a good financial position. Secondly, the simple average of Victoria and Queensland is taken as the &#34; normal standard &#34; upon which to calculate the grants. New South Wales is omitted, because, in comparison -with the other States, it has so many abnormal features. Last year New South Wales was included in arriving at the normal deficit, and some of the other normal standards, excepting principally social services. In the case of South Australia and Western Australia, certain deductions are made for past mistakes. The grants are calculated on the basis of State budget results for 1933-34. The Government is anxious that, in order to avoid the necessity for annual revision, these special grants should be placed upon a more permanent &#34;basis. In its second report, the corn- mission gave further consideration to this matter, and expressed the following views : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is certain that no fixed grant could bc determined equitably for a long term of years. We have not found any satisfactory method of doing so, even for a short term, but will give the matter fuller consideration in our next report, when the possibility of devising an automatic sliding scale will also be discussed. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>As already mentioned, the grants recommended for 1935-36 have been based on the budget figures for 1933-34. The commission pointed out that the figures for the financial year, 1934-35, would not be available in time to permit a proper investigation and calculation of the grants to be made on the basis Df the figures for that year. </para>

                    <para>The purpose of this measure is to grant financial assistance amounting to &#163;500,000 to the States of- New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. The object of this assistance is to help in the reduction of State deficits. In the recent years of depression, State finances have suffered more severely than Commonwealth finance. The aggregate deficits of the States were : 1931-32, &#163;18,400,000 ; 1932-33, &#163;8,220,000; 1933-34, &#163;6,870,000; 1934-35, &#163;3,800,000. In the same period, the Commonwealth Government had excess receipts, namely: 1931-32, &#163;1,314,000; 1932-33, &#163;3,546,000; 1933-34, &#163;1,301,000; 1934-35, &#163;711,000. </para>
                    <para>The financial position in recent years has, however, been abnormal. Last year, when the excess of receipts was &#163;6,160,000, the Parliament approved of &#163;2,000,000 being granted to the States, and of &#163;4,160,000 being appropriated for defence purposes. The &#163;2,000,000 granted to the States was intended partly for budget relief and partly for unemployment relief, hut no conditions were imposed on the States. Actually, about &#163;1,700,000 was applied to budget relief, and the balance to relief of unemployment. As was stated at the time, this &#163;2,000,000 was a non-recurring payment, as it was drawn from the fund resulting from fortuitous receipts of the past. At the recent meeting of the Loan Council the subject of finance was discussed with the States and, in a desire to help their budgets, the &#39;Commonwealth Government offered to make a payment of &#163;500,000 to the States out of the excess receipts for 1934-35. Tasmania stated that it did not desire to participate in the proposed grant. The &#163;500,000 was allocated approximately on a population basis, the amount for each State being: New South Wales, &#163;205,000; Victoria, &#163;140,000; Queensland, &#163;75,000; South Australia, &#163;45,000; Western Australia, &#163;35,000; total, &#163;500,000. With this assistance the estimates of deficits of the States, according to the budgets brought down for the current year, are: New South Wales, &#163;1,750,000; Victoria, &#163;435,000; Queensland, &#163;1,162,000; Western. Australia, &#163;56,000; Tasmania, not available. South Australia is budgeting for a surplus of &#163;1,000. The total net deficits of the States, excluding Tasmania, are estimated to be &#163;3,402,000. I repeat that this &#163;500,000 is a non-recurring payment, as it arises from the excess receipts of last year. </para>

                            <role>I direct the attention of the Assistant Minister represent ing the Minister for Commerce to a brief but obviously inspired statement which appeared in this morning&#39;s newspapers with regard to the dairying industry, hinting at the abolition of the Australian Dairy Council, as at present constituted, and the re-organziation of the industry by the appointment of a Dairy Products Export Control Board to consist of six producer representatives. I, for one, fail to see what the Australian Dairy Council has done to merit this treatment. It has rendered most valuable service to the dairying industry generally, and the Export Control Board has placed the export of butter on a sound basis. As recently as April of this year the Minister for Commerce (Dr. Earle Page</role>

                        <para>was loud in his praise of the work performed by these two bodies. I feel sure that the smaller States will have something to say about this proposed alteration as it appears that their representation, already small, will be further reduced. Western Australia will have only one representative instead of two as at present, and South Australia and Tasmania will probably be affected similarly. The permanent committee to advise the new council will consist of the Directors of Agriculture in the various States and whilst I do not question their qualifications, it must not beforgotten that they arc the servants of the respective governments and are not, themselves, in any way connected with primary production. Thus their recommendations will influence the policy of the new council, and the change will lead to a large measure of government control of the industry. This will be an undesirable state of affairs. If more producer representatives on the board are deemed necessary, why not leave the council as at present constituted and add to it three or more representatives of the producers? Definitely the Dairy Export Control Board, which body understands marketing problems and has proved its worth, should be permitted to carry on its good work. Additional producer representatives could be appointed, instead of wantonly destroying this body, and setting up in its stead a board so constituted as to make its success problematical. I also direct attention to the following motion which was carried at the annual meeting of the Australian Dairy Council held in Sydney the week before last- </para>

                    <para class="block">That this meeting views with surprise the action of the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> in accepting the recommendation of the Australian Agricultural Council to abolish the Australian Dairy Council in view of the assurance given by him at the National Dairy Conference held in Sydney in April last that the council would he allowed to continue to function in consideration of the effective work that it had done on behalf of the dairying industry of . Australia ; this council protests against the recommendation being given effect to, and, further, this council considers that the proposed representation of the new body , suggested is totally inadequate to efficiently represent the various phases of the industry. </para>
                    <para class="block">The representatives from all States, with the exception of New South Wales, voted in favour of this motion.I do not know why the Mother State dissented. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> in his position as Leader of Country party senators, will prevail upon his friends in New South Wales to adopt a more federal view of the dairying industry and use his influence to see that the representation of the three smaller States is not reduced. It is,I think, necessary to impress upon the New South Wales section of the dairying industry that the smaller States are dissatisfied with the proposed alterations, and will have something to say about it. My State committee, which consists of six members - two representing the cooperative manufacturers, one proprietary manufacturer and three producers&#39; representatives who are themselves producers in a big way - instructed its representative to attend the committee meeting of the council and oppose its suggested disbandment. The dairying industry in Western Australia is most emphatic in its view that the present dairy council should be allowed to continue its good work. If, as has been suggested by the originators of the proposed alterations, the Dairy Products Export Control Board should be more representative of the producers, the position may bo met by adding three more producers to the board. It passes my understanding why the present Dairy Council should receive the encomiums of the Minister for Commerce one week and be informed, a few weeks later, that steps were being taken to abolish it. I urge the Assistant Minister to bring my representations before the Minister for Commerce, and I appeal to honorable senators to assist me in defeating the proposed alteration of the constitution of the Australian Dairy Council, because the change will be definitely prejudicial to the interests of the smaller States. </para>
