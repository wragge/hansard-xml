            <para> -Has  the  attention of the Postmaster-General been directed to a statement, made by the Queensland Home Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon,</inline> appearing into-day&#39;s newspapers, to the effect that one of the difficulties with which parliaments had to contend in connexion with measures to suppress illegal betting in Queensland was the control exercised by wealthy interests and the use made of the telephone facilities provided by the Post and Telegraph Department? One big organization, carrying on illegal betting throughout the State, he said, had400 betting shops, and a revenue of &#163;20,000, one-half of which went to the Postal Department in payment for telephone services. If so, has the Minister any comment to make? </para>

                    <para>- The suppression of illegal betting is  the  function, not of the Commonwealth, but of State police departments. Whenever any infringement of a State law is reported, appropriate action is taken by my department in order thatits facilities may not be used improperly by persons proved guilty of such offences. It is impossible for the Postal Department to discharge functions which properly belong to State police departments. </para>

            <para> - When, on Friday,I asked for leave to continue my remarks, I was pointing out that, in the event of the imposition of sanctions after the18th November, there was every probability that Germany would continue to sell goods to Italy. I do not know whether the League of Nations, or any government associated with it, has received any guarantee from Herr Hitler that the Government of Germany will not follow such a course. </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para class="block">If Germany should continue to sell goods to Italy after sanctions are imposed, that would, in the opinion of all thinking men, nullify to a great extent the effect of sanctions. We know authoritatively that, during the Great War, goods were sold even by the Allies to Germany, the goods being forwarded through neutral countries. We also know that, during the Great War, representatives of the financial interests of Great Britain, France and Germany met in conference to deal with the granting of a loan to China, and to determine, among other things, the amount which each of these powers could lend. Thus, in a war in which the great European powers were involved, opportunities arose and were taken advantage of by the governments of the belligerent countries to sell goods to belligerents irrespective of alliances. If a similar opportunity should arise in this conflict, sections of private enterprise, which are devoid of national honour, will be prepared to act against their own nations in order to make profit. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with alternatives. In answer to a question earlier in this debate, I stated definitely that the Labour party would not support Australia&#39;s participation in this struggle on the plea that Australia must, with other nations go to war in order to bring about peace. In 1914, we participated in a war to end war; now the cry is that we should go to war to bring about peace. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy&#39;s</inline> query, I point out that, because of the defection of Germany and Japan from the League of Nations, and because America is not a member of the League, the situation, so far as Australia&#39;s allegiance to the League is concerned, has changed considerably during the last  few years. To-day it is not right that Australia should be committed to take up a stand with Great Britain and France in the imposition of sanctions against Italy, because the League of Nations has not the. power to enforce its desires. Were Germany, the United States of America and Japan members of the League of Nations and committed to sanctions, Italy would be confronted by a combination of great powers against which it could not stand. But the interests of the great powers in some respects are so opposed that unanimity among them is impossible. To some extent, I agree with the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W..</inline> M. Hughes in his book <inline font-style="italic">Australia and the War To-day.</inline> In condemning the League of Nations, the right honorable gentleman went so far as to say - </para>

                        <para>- He mentions both economic and military force. He says bluntly that a recalcitrant nation can be kept in check only by the application of force. The Labour party fears that Australia will again be embroiled in. a European squabble. Within a few weeks we may find&#39; that, instead of the imposition of sanctions bringing peace, it has involved Australia in a major conflict; that instead of collective security ensuring peace for Europe, the weakness of the League of Natrons will result in another world war. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, the Labour party has not the numbers to defeat the Government&#39;s proposal ; but it will continue to express views which it believes to be right. I am inclined to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> that the old diplomacy could bring about a better result than is possible to a weak League of Nations. The right honorable gentleman goes further in his book when he points out that Italy is at war with Abyssinia to-day because of the weakness of the League of Nations in allowing Germany to re-arm. Germany is now one of the most powerful nations in Europe; and will be able to say &#34;Yea &#34; or &#34; Nay &#34; to the world should ittake the field. I do not know whether,in the event of war, Germany would side with Great Britain or with Italy; but one thing is certain - Hitler would ally Germany with the side which would confer the greatest benefit on the German nation. Before Germany enters the field it will weigh the possibilities in the balance. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Some day mob psychology may not be so potent a force as it is to-day. Those honorable senators who are interested in mob psychology should read a book on the subject by the French writer Le Bou. The situation in Europe may be likened to an international game of chess: one move, and the whole situation may be changed. The game is being played secretly, and we can follow its progress only by what we read in the newspapers. Members of this Parliament know only what the Government allows them to know. I have no doubt that for some time past messages have passed freely between Italy, France, Great Britain and Australia in relation to the situation in Europe. An interchange of views regarding the European situation is constantly taking place between Germany, France and Britain. These nations arc playing for high stakes, and we are wondering from day to day which side Germany will join. According to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of yesterday, efforts are being made by Germany, behind the back of the League of Nations, and in collusion with France and Britain, to bring about a tripartite agreement, apart altogether from sanctions. </para>

                        <para>- I applaud the honorable senator for his frankness, but I do not admire the attitude of some members of his party who would have the public believe that the imposition of sanctions is the only issue involved. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> would fight to the bitter end, if necessary. He has the courage of his convictions. No doubt he is prepared to see Australia put it? hand to the sword, and carry on a conflict until a decisive result is obtained. </para>

                        <para>- I have been trying to point out that the imposition of economic sanctions against Italy would undoubtedly lead in the end to military action, and that there would be every probability of Australia being embroiled in a war with Italy, and, possibly, other countries. The imposition of the sanctions for which this bill provides would undoubtedly be resented by Italy to such an extent that Mussolini, who has trained millions of men for war, would throw down the gauntlet, and pit his forces against Britain and Prance. The <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of to-day publishes a cable from Rome in which the temper of II Duce is plainly revealed. Like the mouse who got drunk on whisky and defiantly cried &#34;Now bring out your cats&#34;, Mussolini, drunk with power, believes that Italy can fight the world. </para>

                        <para>- No. I believe, with the Premier of Queensland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forgan Smith),</inline> that the control of Abyssinia is not worth the life of one good Australian. &#34;Why was not the control of Manchukuo worth thousands of Australian lives? Not a word of protest was uttered by honorable senators supporting the Government when the Japanese penetrated Manchuria, and when the Gran Chaco dispute occurred. But now that Great Britain and Italy, who for years have been discussing the economic partition of Abyssinia, are ranged against each other, Australia is prepared, practically without discussion in this Parliament, to throw in its lot with the League of Nations merely because Britain says that that would be the proper procedure. The terms under which Italy is prepared to make peace have not been debated in this chamber or in the House of Representatives, and we have not been given an opportunity to say whether we stand for or against Italy in this dispute. To-day I gave notice of a question relating to the conditions on which Italy is prepared to cease hostilities. The Government, undoubtedly acting within its powers, has agreed to a certain procedure, but the Sanctions Bill is only a formality. The measure is brought before Parliament and honorable senators debate it, but its passage is assured. The Government might as well bc Mussolini, so far as Parliamentary control of its actions is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but the Government has already committed this country, not only to the application of economic sanctions, but practically to military sanctions, which may lead to universal disruption and war. The trouble in Europe will spread like wild- fire, and honorable senators will have no say in preventing Australia from becoming involved. War will be upon us possibly before honorable senators realize it; and doubtless they will then offer the excuse that they approved only of economic sanctions and not of military sanctions. </para>

                        <para>- I refer the honorable senator to my speech on Friday, when I stated that quite a number of persons in the Labour movement throughout the world agree with the attitude of the Australian Labour party toward sanctions. We have adopted a definite policy on many vital matters, which is not acceptable to Labour organizations in other parts of the world. As a boy &#91; lived in the Old Country, and I know that the British Labour party was partial to the international outlook. Its members were very friendly to foreigners, regardless of nation or colour, who visited their hospitable shores. They had no conception of the White Australia principle, which they regard as being utterly wrong. In the present circumstances, the British Labour party&#39;s outlook on sanctions is international; but because it considers that the policy of the League of Nations is right, that does not influence the Australian Labour party. In approaching this subject we have given consideration to possible future developments. If Australia is committed to act in accordance with the League&#39;s decision to apply sanctions, a precedent will be established which may react against us when the White Australia principle or some other principle dear to Australia, is discussed by the League. Rightly or wrongly wo believe that the Government has made a mistake in this matter, and we, as a party, are opposed to sanctions. We are not against any procedure which will bring about peace in the world, but we do object to an action taken by a few nations and likely to cause another war in Europe. </para>

                <para>In conclusion, I ask honorable senators to give every credit to members of the Labour party, as public men, for speaking sincerely on this matter. We desire to do the best for Australia; we hope that we are right; and we hope that the Commonwealth will not have to suffer any serious consequences as a result of the Government&#39;s mistake. We are as good and loyal Australians as anybody in the community, doing what we think is right in the best interests of Australia. While believing in the defence of this country, we consider that Australia, in view of its situation, would be better advised not to be embroiled in any European controversy, and that it should devote its energies to building up a worthy nation within its own boundaries. </para>

                    <para>.- I support this bill for the simple reason that, for good or evil, Australia has been a member of the League of Nations from its inception. If there has been one section of the community that has been almost fanatical in its support of the League, it has been the Labour party. When the League has been dealing with matters of world importance, no organization has been more ready to send delegates overseas to participate in the discussions. When any criticism of the League has been offered by members of Parliament or by public men, the foremost to champion it have been members of the Labour party. Yet on the first occasion that the League finds if necessary to give effect to the Covenant the members of the Australian Labour party are shirking their obligations by declining to support the undertaking which Australia, in common with the other members of the League, has given. On Friday last, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> said that he was opposed to the imposition of sanctions, I asked, by interjection, if the honorable senator believed that Australia should withdraw from the League. He declined to answer. I now ask the honorable senator if he believes that Australia should d&#39;odge its obligations by withdrawing from the League? </para>

                        <para>- If honorable senator.? opposite have studied the Covenant and followed the work undertaken at numerous conferences of the League, they must know that provision is made for the imposition of sanctions against  any  member of the League which does not comply with the Covenant. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown,</inline> as a former champion of the League, knows that if a member nation commits a breach of the Covenant, it can be declared an aggressor and punished as such. Yet while alleging to support the principles of the League, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> and those with whom he is associated suggest that on the first occasion the League finds it necessary to act Australia should not honour its obligations. From one end of Australia to the other, sections of the Labour party have advocated that Australia should not support the imposition of sanctions. There may be some justification for opposition from those who have opposed the League ot who have been only lukewarm supporters; but every member of this chamber, including honorable senators opposite, who has championed this organization, should, now that it is compelled to act, support it. Honorable senators opposite know what membership of the League implies, and must have realized long ago that a time would come when the League would find it necessary to act against an aggressor. Are we to believe that during the period in which honorable senators opposite have supported the League they have been giving only lip service to it and that they intended all along that when support was expected Australia should shirk its responsibilities? Has their support been given merely to allow delegates to partake in joy-rides to Geneva ? When trouble arises, are we, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> would say, to retire te our &#34;funk-holes&#34;? </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. No party in Australia derives greater strength from uniform action on the part of its members than does the Labour party. Woe betide the member of that party who acts contrary to a decision of a majority reached in the caucus room. Any nation which for sixteen years has supported the League of Nations and now refuses to honour its obligations has committed an act of international &#34; scabbing &#34;. Honorable senators opposite who speak so  freely  of &#34;scabbing&#34; in connexion with political and industrial matters should support th&#34; action which Australia as a signatory of the Covenant is taking.

                <para class="block">League, but I believe that Australia, having supported the principle of the  League for  the last sixteen years, should not be so cowardly as to attempt to evade its obligations. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> who accused the Government and its supporters of warmongering said that we desire to plunge this country into war. Several members of the Government and many of its supporters have been on active service, and knowing the horrors of war are not likely to assist in involving Australia in another war if it can be honorably avoided. The Council of the League of Nations having declared that one of its members had committed an act of unprovoked aggression against a fellow member steps must be taken to impose penalties upon the aggressor. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> really believes that the probable effect of the application of sanctions against Italy will be an extension of the war he should carry his argument to its logical conclusion, and advocate that Australia should immediately withdraw from the League of Nations. But he does not go so far as that. Apparently he considers that we should retain -our membership while things arc going smoothly, but immediately difficulty is encountered, other nations may deal with it; Australia should evade its responsibility. </para>

                        <para>- It is, and it is deplorable that Italy, after warlike preparations extending over several months should, bv an act of aggression, so profoundly disturb the foreign policies of other members of the League as to make possible another world war. WhenI visited Italy about 25 years ago, the people of that country were facing extraordinary difficulties due to dislocation of industries and political unrest. It was my privilege to revisit that great country in 1930, and again early in the present year when, as a member of the Empire Party Delegation, I touched at Italian ports on my way to Great Britain. I was greatly impressed by the remarkable changes for the better in 1930, and I realized the extraordinary work of re-construction that had been carried out under the direction of Signor Mussolini. There had been a notable improvement of the living conditions of the people, a better type of public buildings had been erected in the more important cities and towns, and the harbour facilities at Naples and other ports had been brought up to date. One cannot spend any time in Italy to-day without acknowledging that Mussolini has been a tremendous driving force and power for good to the Italian nation. It is, therefore, regrettable that, during the last few months, he should have marred his splendid record by action which has plunged his country into a war, the consequences of which to the world, as well as to Italy, cannot be foreseen. 1 am, however, hopeful that the imposition, at the instance of the League of Nations, of economic and financial sanctions will force the Italian people to realize that their ruler is out of step with the rest of the world. &#39; It is hoped that the action taken by the League will eventually lead to a cessation of hostilities. </para>

                    had something to say in criticism of the League for not having prevented Germany and Italy from rearming. It is easy to criticize. I should like
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline>
                    to indicate what action the League could have taken to prevent Germany from re-arming, because Germany, it must be remembered had left the League. What power could the League, or individual nations like Great Britain have exerted to prevent Mussolini from converting Italy into what is virtually an armed camp, or to prevent France from increasing its military strength by an alteration of its conscription law ? The only way in which any individual nation could prevent another nation from doing any of these things would be to declare war and apply military force.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline>
                    has told us that he is against war, and is opposed to the application of economic or financial sanctions against Italy because of the risk of war, which such action entails. Yet, almost in the next breath, the honorable senator criticizes the League of Nations and Great Britain for not having prevented Germany or Italy from rearming.

                <para>I agree with the statement made by the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> on Friday to which exception was taken by honorable senators opposite, that for Australia to shirk its responsibility in connexion with the application of sanctions against Italy would savour of cowardice, in view of the fact that for sixteen years we have sent our delegates to Geneva to discuss with the. representatives of other Member Skates measures to promote world peace. </para>
                <para>In his speech on Friday the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> spoke of a land-hungry world seeking for expansion, and of Australia as an empty continent. I invite the honorable senator to consider what those landhungry nations would think of us if we shirked our responsibility on the very first occasion when honouring of it may expose us to risk. I agree with the honorable senator that this empty continent is one of the richest prizes that tempts a land-hungry world. Therefore, we should be steadfast in our resolve to stand by our partners in the League at a time when some show of firmness may have the desired result, namely, the maintenance of world peace. I emphasize, also, that if we are to do what is expected of us, we must remain part and parcel of the British Empire and stand solidly behind the Mother Country in this crisis. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline>
                    deplored the fact that Italy was attacking Abyssinia, but. admitted that it was in pursuance of Mussolini&#39;s desire for territorial expansion.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline>
                    pointed out that this attack by Italy had arisen from the fact that Italy&#39;s increase of population demanded expansion of its territory, and, in the next breath, he claimed that Australia should take no action to prevent Italy from invading and conquering another country with the object of establishing there a colonial empire. Because of Australia&#39;s peculiar position, we should be the first to stand beside Great, Britain and its supporters in this dispute to  prevent Italy from walking into  Abyssinia and taking what territory it needs for colonization purposes. I reiterate that, because of the temptation this country presents to a nation bent on acquiring colonies, Australia should be the first to protest against predatory action on the part of any nation. I believe that there has been much provocation in the present dispute. A number of frontierincidents occurred between Ethiopians and Italians, and Italy apparently had certain grounds for complaint against Abyssinia. The report laid on the table of the Library a fortnight ago by the Leader of the Senate
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline>
                    in which the Italian delegate&#39;s case for Italy and Abyssinia&#39;s reply to it are set out, contains convincing proof that international trouble has been smouldering on those frontiers for many months past. However, no one for a moment would agree with the methods adopted by Italy to settle the dispute. If I had any criticism to level against the League of Nations, it would be that for six or seven months it allowed ItalY. in full view of the nations of the world, to make preparations for this attack. When I passed through the Suez Canal early in March last, I saw troopship after troopship conveying from Italy to Abyssinia, troops, ammunition, fodder, and implements of war. Thus, month after month, under the very eyes of the League, Italy prepared for this attack. I believe that, when this trouble is settled - and I hope peace will be established soon - -the League will have so to organize itself as to enable it to take even stronger action in. international disputes than it is taking in the present instance; it will require to be able to prevent such disputes from developing to the extent that the ItaloAbyssinian trouble has developed. Because of the advanced stage which has been reached in the present conflict, tremendous difficulties will have to be surmounted before peace call be arranged. Already Italy lias captured thousands of square miles of Ethiopian territory, and when the time comes to consider peace terms, Abyssinia, no doubt, will demand compensation for the losses it has suffered, at the hands of Italy. On the other hand, it will be difficult to persuade Italy to relinquish any of the territory it has already captured. If the League is to be truly effective in promoting the peace of the world, it must be enabled to deal effectively with disputants before hostilities actually commence. I repeat that, because of the preparations made by Italy for this conflict, every one was aware that an attack on Abyssinia, was impending. It was obvious that Italy was not transporting hundreds of thousands of troops to the borders of Abyssinia simply for the purpose of protecting neighbouring Italian colonies. Unless the League is enabled to enforce its will immediately upon a nation that commits a breach of the Covenant, it will rapidly disintegrate. I remind honorable senators that many of the smaller members of the League joined the League expressly for their own protection.. They realized that, if they remained outside such a body as the League, there would be nothing to prevent stronger neighbours, if the latter so desired, from overwhelming them. They joined the League much from the same motives as actuate a person in taking out an insurance policy; they wanted to ensure that they would be protected in the event of any attack being made upon them by a more powerful nation. It must be a sad thought for the weaker members of the League that one of their number, Abyssinia, is being invaded by one of the stronger members of the League. Under these circumstances one&#39; can readily understand why the smaller members of the League are unanimously standing behind Britain, France  and Russia in the imposition of these sanctions.
                </para>
                <para>Members of the Opposition have been inclined to question the diplomacy of Great Britain in this dispute. Whether we think that British diplomacy has been wise or not, we must recognize that the Mother Country, throughout the history of the League, has placed all its cards on the table, and all its efforts have been for the promotion of world peace. It has been prepared to take risks itself in order to achieve that object; it has remained disarmed in the face of an armed world, thus giving an example to other nations of what they should do in the interests of world peace. In its endeavours to defend the smaller nations of the world it has never paused to consider what nation its efforts in that direction might offend. Because of its record as a member of the League, I would be one of the last to question any action that Great Britain has taken in the present negotiations. I .hope .it will not be long before the efforts of the League bring about a cessation of hostilities. &#34;Whatever mistakes the League has made, and whatever may be our individual opinions of the effectiveness of the methods it has adopted to restore peace, let us remember that those nations which are members of the League at the present time are sincerely striving for world peace. Britain, Russia, France, and the smaller members of the League have only one purpose, and that is to stop the present hostilities as soon as possible, and prevent them from extending. My earnest hope is that this measure will play at least a small part in restoring peace. </para>

                    <para>. - The right honorable the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> put the case in favour of the passage of this measure very fairly and clearly before honorable senators. I regret that members of the Opposition have approached it as though we were discussing a declaration of war. When the League was formed many of us had grave doubts regarding the success that would attend its efforts, but all of us were at least unanimous in the hope that it would accomplish its main object - the maintenance of the peace of the world. As a citizen of Australia, I claim that we are doubly bound to the League: first, as an integral part of the British Empire, and, secondly, because we had the honour to be a signatory to that notable agreement. However, to-day there are murmurings among many Australians, who would like Australia to withdraw from the League. These people apparently are prepared to refuse to carry out the solemn obligation to which this country subscribed in that agreement. If we adopted such a course we would prove conclusively that all our gestures and efforts in the cause of peace, and all our talk of high international ideals at the time of the formation of the League, and since, have been only lip service. In passing this measure, we shall place on our statute-book legislation unprecedented in the history of this country. Whenever previously legislation of this character has been enacted it has been for the institution of a blockade by nations which, at the time, were involved in war. On this occasion, while they arc still at peace, certain nations are striving, by the imposition of economic and financial sanctions, to compel the belligerents to settle their dispute by other than armed force. </para>

                        <para>- Not so far as Australia is concerned; we have not yet made a single gesture that would indicate that we are likely to take part in this conflict. The settling of differences between nations by other than force of arms is the logical outcome of international law, as it has developed in Europe and elsewhere, during recent years. The League of Nations has been established for sixteen years, and to let pass this opportunity of settling an international dispute, without exploring every article of the League Covenant, would be a confession, not only of failure, but also, and worse still, of a lack of moral courage to put into operation those provisions which might solve the present conflict. T do not admit that this bill constitutes an act of war. In viewing the present conflict and the action which the League has taken to stop hostilities, I stand on article 11 of the League of Nation&#39;s Covenant, which says that any threat of war is the concern of the whole of the League, and the League may take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to preserve world peace. Australia&#39;s action in supporting the imposition of sanctions cannot be construed in any sense to indicate a desire on our part for open hostilities. Argument to the contrary is as unreasonable as would be a contention that a baton charge on a mob engaged in destruction constitutes a riot on the part of the police. We must not forget that, if we refuse to resist aggression, we allow the brutal elements of the world to become more powerful than before. It is most unwise to stir our people by insinuations that, because some of us who are members of this Parliament have passed the age of military service, we are forcing our young men into the shambles of war. Those who fought in the Great War have such a realization of the horrors of war that they seldom mention them. Many of us have memories that we do not wish awakened. I ask honorable senators to reflect on the position of the world to-day had the Allies not been victorious in the Great War. All thinking people know that that war was forced upon us, and to-day they are seeking to avoid a repetition of the horrors of 1914-18 by supporting the League of Nations; they are doing everything possible to avoid another world conflict. Great Britain has earned the right to be regarded as the leader of civilization. In the past Great Britain has at times resorted to arms in the interests of civilization; but to-day it is putting up almost a singlehanded fight to maintain the peace of the world by conciliatory measures. Can wo who are bound to Britain, not only by ties of Empire, but also by ties of blood, ignore the traditions of our people? Surely that national honour and integrity of which we are so proud must debar us from even the thought of deserting the Old Country at this critical period in its history. In my opinion, there is only one course to adopt and, therefore, I shall not labour the question. Should the League of Nations fail in its efforts torestore peace on. this occasion, for many years to come might will again be right, and the building of any peace organization will bo postponed indefinitely. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> expressed a pious wish that the nations would establish a peace council instead of a war council. The League of Nations is the greatest council for peace that the world has ever known ; it only requires the support of the peoples of the world to make its efforts successful. On a number of occasions I have listened with interest to the Leader of the Opposition, and have frequently agreed with the humanitarian principles which he has expounded. On this occasion, however, I disagree with the honorable gentleman for, although his argument may have been sincere, his speech from beginning to end was merely sound and fury, signifying nothing. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall not deal at length with the bill, or elaborate upon the circumstances which necessitated its introduction. Suffice it to say that, the League of Nations has been designed to support and strengthen the greatest and noblest conception of the human mind. The League was born in a sea of human suffering and it had not long been in existence before it was called upon to nurse and tend a sick and tottering civilization. Unfortunately, like all man-made things, the League has made mistakes; but who will say that those mistakes were of sufficient magnitude to warrant its destruction ? </para>

It lias remained for a small group of &#34;little islanders,&#34; known as the Australian Labour party, to take a stand which would, if generally accepted, destroy thi1 ideal that the world has set up. Other sections of British people have looked into the future and seen civilization tottering on the brink of an inferno, and have pinned their faith to the League of Nations as the only hope for peace. The Australian Labour party has also looked into the future, but, with blurred vision, it can see nothing but the Australian Labour party. It is out of its depth and floundering in a sea of hopeless bewilderment. </para>

                        <para>- Why does the Labour party now abandon the policy it has followed for many years ? It would appear that its support of the League in the past has been only lip service. The Covenant of the League is not new, and the Labour party should have known long before the present trouble between Italy and Abyssinia developed, what the Covenant involved. Strangely enough, only recently has the Labour party learned that sanctions may have serious consequences. </para>

                <para>Now that the League is on its trial, now that it has reached the cross roads in its history, now that the sincerity of the signatories to its Covenant is put  to  the test, and now that the worth of its true friends is revealed, this is the time when the Labour party chooses  to  adopt an attitude which, if generally adopted would mean the destruction of the League. I remind the Opposition that the destruction of the League means the destruction of its subsidiary organizations also. </para>
                <para>What the ultimate result of the present crisis will be is a matter for conjecture. The Opposition may be right in its contention that the action taken by the League must inevitably lead  to  war; but, on the other  hand, it may be wrong. We all sincerely hope that the conflict will not extend. Time only can tell. The League came into . existence in order to prevent war. Failing to prevent war, it seeks next to limit and localize the conflict. On this occasion the League did fail to prevent war between Italy and Abyssinia. It is now taking the next step and is attempting to limit the war and bring it to an early conclusion. Although this bill has been introduced to that end, the Opposition has been loud in condemning it on the ground that sanctions must inevitably lead to war. </para>

                        <para>- Time only will tell whether <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham was right. The fact remains that when the League Covenant was prepared it was not thought that sanctions would inevitably lead to war. Had that been the belief at the time provision would have been made in the Covenant for financial, economic and military sanctions to apply simultaneously. The Covenant, however, provides for the gradual application of sanctions. Whether financial and economic  sanctions will be effective is, I admit, a matter of conjecture. </para>

                        <para>- All man-made organizations make mistakes, and the League has not been an exception. The result of that mistake is seen in Mussolini&#39;s attitude towards the League to-day. Is it not clear that the failure of the League to take action against Japan inspired Italy to attack Abyssinia ? There are good grounds for believing that before another bully nation contemplates an attack against a weaker nation, it will have a different conception of the League from that of Mussolini, who thought that as the League had failed once in its duty, it would fail again. He thought that every party and every nation was of the same kidney as the Australian Labour party; but he has slipped badly. </para>

The Opposition has -not told us how to avert the calamity that confronts civilization. It shows a willingness to throw away the substance, and to grasp at the shadow. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> touched upon many matters, but did not deal with the provisions of the bill.

                        <para>- The honorable senator read extracts from certain newspapers, some of which are reputable. He particularly quoted at some length the remarks of a writer who, in  1921,  deplored the fact that there was a race of armaments, and appealed to the leaders of thought in order that some steps might be taken to check it. The League of Nations had its birth in the year  1919,  and although we had hoped for better results than have been obtained by it, its task  ha3  been exceedingly difficult Yet it has come through its ordeal fairly well. What result other than a race of armaments can be expected if we smash the League? What would the Opposition give us in its place? The alternative offered by the Labour party to the collective security obtained through the League is a policy of &#34; adequate defence,&#34; but exactly what that term means has never been explained. </para>

                <para>The bill states definitely that no financial assistance of any kind shall be given to Italy, yet the Leader of the Opposition objects to it. The Labour party would, presumably, allow all  possible financial assistance to be given to Italy. It would not prevent any individual or society from forwarding money to that country to assist it in its attack on Abyssinia. The Opposition says that it does not want the bill. The only deduction to be drawn from that declaration is that it is prepared to help Italy in its war  on  Abyssinia. The Opposition goes even further than that. The bill prevents the export of arms to Italy, and as the Labour party objects to the bill, ii must be willing to allow any armament  or  munition firm to send warlike material to Italy. The bill prohibits imports into Australia from Italy. That is a very proper provision, because the money which Italy would receive for its goods would be used in the purchase of warlike material. The Labour party objects to the provision, and, therefore, says, in effect: &#34;Let&#39; Italian imports come in. With the proceeds Italy can purchase the warlike material it requires in its attack on Abyssinia.&#34; </para>

I did not reflect on him personally, but on the judgment of the Labour party, which&#39; is prepared to do what, in my opinion, would amount to assisting Italy in its attack on Abyssinia. I agree wholeheartedly with the course of action taken by the League of Nations to hamper the operations of Italy. The bill gives me an opportunity to register my protest against the Italian attitude, and I regret that every section in this chamber does not stand behind the Government and the League by supporting this legislation. </para>

                    <para>. - Little did we in Western Australia reck about ten years ago when we formed the League of Nations Union there that we should live to hear such an awful verbal exhibition as that to which we have been treated in this Parliament by members of the Labour party. Amongst the most prominent founders of that union, the members of which held varied political beliefs, were gentlemen eminent in the Labour organizations. Now that the first concrete effort made by the League in the interests of peace affects our own nation, we find that the opposition to the application of the sanctions is practically confined to prominent members of the Labour party. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this situation is that the members of the Opposition are only fair-weather friends of this instrument for world peace. The League itself it the only protective barrier which exists at present to reduce the risk of war. The barrier may contain holes and be weak in places, but the fact remains that the League is an active, instrument and the only alternative to resort to the clash of arms. To-day, any action that may possibly weaken the prop, should be avoided. To abandon the League would be to invite trouble, because it is the only means by which friction between the two belligerent nations can be reduced. The nations of the world, with few exceptions, have accepted the fact that  Italy  is the aggressor, and, if we are not prepared to apply the conditions laid down in tins bill, we must continue our trade relations with Italy. Perhaps the Opposition would like to see the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited works turning out munitions or military accoutrements to be consigned to Italy for use against the poor unfortunate Abyssinians. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> has pointed out, if the Labour party votes against this bill, it will declare, in effect, that our present trade relations with Italy .shall continue,, and that we shall supply it with materials for war. I cannot understand the Labour party&#39;s present attitude, because it has applied the expression &#34;sanction&#34; throughout its political activities. People are living in &#34;Western Australia to whom the Labour party applied sanctions in 1917, because of their political beliefs, and a political vendetta continues against them. </para>

I am glad to note that the Federal Labour party is not expressing the opinion of the great majority of the individuals in the Labour movement. &#39;So far as Australia is concerned there is no war, and no declaration of members of the Opposition can convince me that there will be a war between Italy and Australia.

                        <para>- On that occasion perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> will refrain from mentioning the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> Out of the wealth of opinions expressed on this bill one thing stands out prominently in the present situation. I could not better express it than in the language used by the German Government recently when it paid a very high compliment to Britain, for having regained the leadership of the League, which was formerly held by France. I emphasize that this compliment has been paid to Great Britain by a recent enemy, for the work it has done in trying to maintain peace. This occasion should not be allowed to pass without mention being made of the excellent work that the British Minister for League Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anthony</inline> Eden, has performed at Geneva on behalf of world peace. He has striven for long months to find a way for the nations to compose their differences, and has been a master of patience; to his untiring efforts the people of Australia should pay tribute. </para>

                <para>Another aspect which has appealed to me both before and during the discussion on this bill is the need for Australia to be prepared for any debacle such as that contemplated by the Opposition. Should its security be menaced Australia itself will require all the help the world can offer. Unfortunately, during the last few years Australians have not realized the low ebb at which the defences of this country stand. To the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes I would pay the compliment that at least he has done much in the last fortnight by the publication or his now famous book to cause the public to realize the acuteness of the. danger to which Australia is exposed through its lack of defence. I hope that this will be a reminder to the Australian people that it is high time to ensure that the Commonwealth is adequately defended - and defended by ourselves, without leaning too heavily, as we have done in the past, or. </para>
                <para class="block">Britain and the British Navy. We have a duty to our people which wemust shoulder, and i trust that, as a result of the discussion on this bill, we shall be a step nearer to the day when we shall be adequately protected. The defence policy of Australia should be revised, starting from the bottom, with the re-introduction of compulsory military training. The discipline and the training under that system were the finest that we have ever had in Australia, and until it is reintroduced, we shall encounter considerable difficulty in building up adequate defences. I commend the bill, because I feel sure that it will contribute towards a peaceful settlement of the European situation. It is an honest endeavour to carry out our solemn obligations as a consistent member of the League of Nations from its inception. The League is on trial, and we should do our share to help it in its time of trouble. Unfortunately, the Opposition seems to base its attitude on the two alleged failures of the League, in connexion with the Gran Chaco and Manchukuo wars. The former, as the Leader of the Senate mentioned, was an old and musty family quarrel, and could be ignored. The position in Manchukuo was entirely different because that country is nearer to Australia. Perhaps our friends in opposition would have liked the League to have intervened in that instance, and to have applied all kinds of economic financial and military sanctions to Japan, in which case they would be in a very sorry position to-day. The League may have failed in that it did not interfere in the Manchukuo dispute, but as an Australian I thank God that it did not.  1  commend the bill to honorable senators and express the hope that it may help to calm the European turmoil. </para>

                        <para>- I dispute the contention of the Leader of the Opposition that Australia cannot defend itself. Australia can, and will, defend itself if given an opportunity to do so. Australia is not the small and insignificant nation that the Leader of the Opposition would have us believe that it is. In this country to-day we have at least 2,000,000 men of fighting age. To the pathetic and pitiable doctrine that we must in all circumstances keep out of trouble I do not subscribe. When the honorable senator says that Australia should not participate in any European war, I ask him what we would think or say if Great Britain declared that it would not help Australia in the event of an invasion. We stand together or we fall together. During the Great War, Australia was defended in Gallipoli, Belgium, France and Palestine, just as surely as if our trenches had been cut across Commonwealthavenue in Canberra. We can, and will, defend Australia. Universal training is an adequate, necessary and effective means, and what is more it is truly democratic. I. do not subscribe for a moment to the doctrine that we are incapable of defending ourselves. Possibly if it came to a fight with tongues some honorable senatorswould be regarded as champions. We have shown that Ave are capable of playing a man&#39;s part. Kipling says that - </para>

                <para class="block">Thosewho think only of material things, of ample food, comfortable clothing, and ease, should study carefully those lines. The Leader of the Opposition almost made me weep, so fearful was the picture he painted. The inference to be drawn from the honorable senator&#39;s remarkswas that some members of the Government are anxious to send men overseas to be butchered and maimed. He said that men weresent overseas during the Great War. No Australians were sent overseas to serve in that conflict. We were not sent;wewent of our own free will.I trust that I shall be pardoned if I intro duce a personal note. One of my kiddies was born on the day that war was declared. I went overseas when hewas a little chap three months old, and I did not see him again for several years. Do you think I wanted to go ? Politicians, writers, pedants, students and others may argue until the crack of doom as to the cause of the greatwar. I can give the reason why over 300,000 Australians felt it their duty to offer all they had, by putting their poor, frail bodies up against the mighty armies of a great disciplined power lusting forworld domination. Stripped of all camouflage, humbug and make-believe, the reasonwhy wewent was that we believed that mightwas not right, and never will be while free men inhabit the earth. That iswhywewent. We realized that if might were greater than right, Australia would not be safe. Wewanted Australia to remain a country in which men and women may live their lives according to their lights, so long as in so doing they do not inflict hardship upon others. That is whywe went. It is a false doctrine that we can repudiate our pledged word, act dishonorably, and still retain our self-respect and the respect of other nations. </para>
                <para>Hadwe been living in the good old days, or bad old days, whicheverwe may term them, the conflict between Italy and Abyssiniawould not have produced an international crisis. Abyssinia would have been invaded like many other African countries have been invaded, and there would have been just another colonialwar. Britain and France would have asserted their rights under the Tripartite Treaty of 1906, and Italywould have given the same assurance that it has now given that it would respect those rights. In the olden days this conflictwould not have concerned the world at large, but it does concern it to-day. Why? Because there is a League of Nations. By making the conflict itsown concern the League has made it the vital concern of all of its members. It is the League that has transformed what would have&#39; been a remote and local affair into a near and general problem. That being so, according to the Leader of the Opposition, we should be better off without the League. Has the League really had a chance? It emerged from the Great War when there seemed to be one supreme necessity - the prevention of another world war. Admittedly the League has met with some failures. It failed to avert or stop war in the Far East and in South America. It failed to avert war between Italy and Abyssinia; but it is now doing its best to prevent it from continuing. In any hostile criticism of the League let us be just. The Far East is a long way off. To have brought pressure to bear upon a great power such as Japan, which has absolute command of its own home waters, would have been exceedingly difficult, and very dangerous, especially to Great Britain, which has so much at stake in the Far East. Many argue that the war in the Far East could, and ought, to have been stopped by the League. I am not saying that those who so argued are wrong. I merely say that the effort would have been difficult and very dangerous. Moreover, we have no means to judge with any degree of certainty whether it would or would not have been possible to coerce the Japanese. The war in South America was fought between two relatively weak States - Paraguay and Bolivia. It was so far off and in a region so inaccessible that again interference by. the League would have been extremely difficult. There is also the Monroe doctrine and it is very doubtful whether the United States of America, or the South American States, would have wished any interference by nations of the Old World. Now there is war much closer at hand  between  two nations, both of which are members of the League. One is in Europe and, to use a venerable term, belongs to the modern &#34; concert of European powers &#34; - a concert which gives the  League  whatever reality it may possess. We cannot say that on this occasion, it was physically impossible for the League to have prevented war between Italy and Abyssinia. But would not coercive measures be so difficult and so dangerous that Europe might lose more than it would gain? That is a matter on which opinions may differ. Everything that could be done through conciliation and arbitration has been or is being done. Can the terms, or, rather, the general directions of the Covenant be enforced with full vigour if gentler methods fail? We do not know yet, but we may know before long. Great Britain most certainly does not desire conflict with Italy, although the happenings of a few weeks ago would suggest that Mussolini  believed  that it did. His threats and boasts about Malta and Gibraltar were really responsible for the strengthening of the British naval forces in the Mediterranean, by the addition of several vessels belonging to the Home fleet. </para>
                <para>The League is either a reality or it if not. The Covenant is either a serious treaty, which has to be honoured by those who signed it, or it is an expression of amiable and impotent idealism. The collective system is either an effective instrument for the preservation of peace, or it is an empty formula. When the League was established, it was assumed that the United States of America would be a member of it. I recall very clearly the atmosphere and temper in Paris when the terms of the Peace Treaty were being considered, because I had a job of work to do in Paris just at that time. 1 witnessed the arrival of the German, Austrian and Turkish delegates, and I have a vivid recollection of the picturesque Abyssinian delegates who came to Paris to congratulate the late  President  Woodrow Wilson on the success of the peace negotiations, and also, no doubt, to do what was possible to prevent their country from being &#34; gobbled-up  &#34; by some of the victors. I clearly remember that it was taken for granted then that the United States of America would be u member of the proposed League of Nations. That assumption proved to be wrong. </para>
                <para>More was expected of the League than was politically possible, though in the circumstances of the times, this was not surprising, because it was forgotten that if, and when, moral suasion failed, there was no provision for the application, by the League, of force to ensure the observance of its covenants. This may be one of the reasons why, in some directions, the League has failed to fulfil its real purpose. We should, however, remember that the League represented an international revolution - one of the greatest in history; that it is, and was, a great experiment, and, like all  experiments must develop by trial and error. Only there must be a time limit to its experimental working, or if there is no limit, we must simply face the facts and draw our own conclusions. </para>
                <para>If the League goes on shrinking - unfortunately in recent years it has shrunk somewhat - until it fades out of existence, we must not go on pretending that it exists as an effective instrument for the maintenance of international peace. Least of all can we allow it to be distorted into the opposite - something that while never averting trouble, will always drag us into it. </para>
                <para>The quarrel between Italy and Abyssinia is a real and severe test in the sense that the far-eastern and South American conflicts we&#39;re not. The British Commonwealth of Nations is resolved to carry out to the full the obligations that are laid down in the Covenant. But it cannot do so alone. Indeed, it is not its business to do so alone, for it is the essence of these obligations that they shall be collective. </para>
                <para>I desire now to refer briefly to the attitude of the Australian Labour party to the imposition of sanctions. Labour&#39;s policy appears to me to be one of funk and dishonour. I can place no other interpretation upon what I have read of speeches delivered by Labour leaders, and what I have heard from the mouths of Labour&#39;s representatives in this chamber. Unless as a nation we are to be dishonored, wo must honour our solemn word and respect our obligations. A friend with whom I discussed Labour&#39;s attitude in this crisis suggested an analogy which I think is very apt. He reminded me that in industrial disputes a trade union calls a strike to secure redress of the grievances of its members. In furtherance of its policy it imposes sanctions against the employer. Any member of the union who, because of his circumstances, or because he fears to antagonize his employer, refuses to strike, is branded as a &#34;scab &#34;, and for the remainder of his life &#34; sanctions &#34; are imposed against him by his fellow workers. I remind our Labour friends that Australia is a member of a union - the League of Nations - and, as such, it must loyally support its fellow members in the course agreed upon to ensure world peace. Is Australia to become an international &#34;scab&#34;? God forbid! I would sooner see this country invaded and go down a defeated nation than that it should be said of its people, whose virility was tested some twenty years ago, that they have no sense of honour; that their word is not worth a snap of the fingers ; that whenever trouble looms on the international horizon, Australia &#34; scabs &#34; on its fellow members of the League of Nations. And not only &#34; scabs &#34;, but boasts about it because in this debate we have heard opponents of the Government&#39;s policy fighting valiantly with their mouths, suggesting that this country should repudiate its pledges through fear of the result. </para>
                <para>The League is above all an instrument of mediation and conciliation. The Covenant does not provide any specific coercive measures except under article 16 which can only be invoked to stop a war that has actually begun. Even when, despite the efforts of the League to avert hostilities, war has broken out, it cannot be seriously argued that the League is a failure. The question to be considered is whether the League can continuously and persistently arbitrate in this conflict. Can it exercise a certain, even if limited, control over its members and more especially over Italy and Abyssinia? Can it exert influence, or even a pressure, that will induce or compel them to negotiate an early peace? And when negotiations have begun, can the League determine or help to determine the nature of the peace so that the terms may not be too vindictive or impossible? To these questions we have as yet no answer, but the answer which coming events will give will make it possible for the powers and for us to judge, for the first time since the League was established, whether it is a reasonably useful instrument for the maintenance of international peace. I wish that this Parliament had unanimously and wholeheartedly approved the bill, because I, for one, cannot see how we can, without loss of face, without suffering dishonour, refuse &#39;to support sanctions against Italy. </para>

                        <para>- In that year, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was not here to carry out his promise. However, this country did not in fact offer Britain the lam shilling in that conflict and a great deal of the cost of it was passed on to the shoulders of the workers. Largely because of our participation in the Great War, we have to-day 300,000 people unemployed, and our small population of less than 7,000,000 is carrying a debt as large as that which Great Britain had incurred at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. There is a progressive aspect in matters of this nature. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was sincere in his offer to Great Britain, but it was not fulfilled because when the war developed, we had to consider our own position in relation not only to the British Empire but also to the rest of the world. At that time the issue of conscription, which had never before been raised in this country, arose. Because they opposed conscription many people were called cowards and traitors. .1. myself, for instance, was called a Sinn Feiner, a pro-German and an Industrial Worker of the World supporter, although before that time, I had spent only about a fortnight in America. As the result of carrying out my duty, as editor of a newspaper, in allowing the free expression of public opinion on this issue, I was sentenced to two months&#39; imprisonment without the option. That newspaper was the official organ of the Labour Government in Queensland, and its  chairman  of directors was the Home Secretary, who, was in charge of prisons. My sentence was suspended but had I been clapped into gaol on that occasion, I would have become, as a prisoner, the guest of my  chairman  of directors. However, when the issue of conscription was put to the people, a majority of 30,000 in Queensland voted against it. Yet for daring to voice opinions against conscription as I have indicated, anti-conscriptionists, like myself, were sentenced to imprisonment by the Commonwealth authorities. The verdict of the people on that occasion, showed that not only the stay-at-homes - the &#34; deep-thinkers &#34; - the Sinn Feiners, the pro-Germans and the Industrial Workers of the World supporters were against conscription, but also the majority of the soldiers who were serving in the trenches at that time. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out that an unpopular cause subjects its supporters to  misrepresentaton  and harsh treatment. Sanctions are a very difficult problem. After studying it, I sum up my opinion- by saying that I do not want to see Australia involved in another war of such vast dimensions as the previous war; I do not think we could stand it. We did  more than our share in the last war, although some people say to-day that we did not do even our share in that conflict. After all, a nation&#39;s participation in a war is a matter of proportion. We say that the United States did not do its fair share in the last war. Considering its huge population and its financial resources, I do not think it did. </para>

                        <para>- There onn be no doubt on that point. It Lj like keeping the peace. Suppose that a policeman seeing two fellows fighting in the street, approached them and said, &#34; I have not met you&#39; before, but this is an unfortunate thing you are doing; it is ungentlemanly. Don&#39;t you think you ought to read the New Testament on the doctrine of love of your fellow ma.:!, and learn from that that you should nor. fight in a street?&#34; How far would he get with such a remonstrance? A policeman who had to keep the peace under such conditions would probably require the backing of sanctions. He would probably have to say to the offenders, &#34; If you do not desist from fighting, I will see that the butcher or the milkman does not call at your home in the morning &#34;. He would threaten to cut off their supplies of the necessaries of life. Of course, a policeman doing his duty in such circumstances would be threatened with reprisals. Undoubtedly, a similar position will arise internationally if sanctions are imposed. The former Minister for Health and Repatriation (Mi-. Hughes) who was the hero of the last war, holds this view, and quite a number of people, including a majority of the members of the Labour party, agree with him. Recently I read a report of a speech in which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> said that peace could be maintained, and that Australia does not want war. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> maintains that sanctions mean war. </para>

                        <para>- Many people who have a right to form a judgment on the matter have come to the con clusion that sanctions mean war, and 1 agree with that view. The Labour party is as sincere in its view of this matter as it was in respect of the conscription issue It does not want to see Australia involved in another war, and hopes, by preaching the doctrine of nonparticipation, to keep this country out of war. 1 agree with that view. I believe that by opposing sanctions we are adopting the right attitude. </para>

                    HARDY  (New South Wales) &#91;5.56  1  . - I was not. present in this chamber when this debate was commenced on Friday, but, having carefully read the speeches made then by the Leader of the Opposition

                    I feel I am sufficiently informed regarding their arguments to attempt to reply to them. A number of honorable senators have asked whether the Labour party really adheres to the principles of the League of Nations, or whether its professed adherence to the League is merely lip-service, to which it is committed in an endeavour to uphold a useful political ideal. One suspects the motives of that party in this matter. I have examined the various items of the Labour party&#39;s platform as amended at the federal conference in 1933, and I failed to find any mention of the League of Nations. A defence policy was mentioned at that conference, but no mention was made at that conference or in the platform of the party of the League of of Nations: nor was there any suggestion that the Labour party supported the League.

                    <para>Labour decides. - The overwhelming vote in favour of sanctions at the Labour Conference on Wednesday demonstrated how very largely personal is the much-advertised &#34; split &#34; in the party. A majority of 2,168,000 to 102,000 or over 20 to 1, was recorded in support of the League Covenant. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hugh</inline> Dalton, who proposed the resolution embodying the official party policy, made a clear, crushing and unanswerable case. </para>
                    <para class="block">Sanctions, he said, do not necessarily mean war. On the other hand the scrapping of sanctions as a reserve force behind international law certainly means war - war soon and in a far more terrible form than even a war between Italy and Abyssinia. A threat of sanctions may be enough to prevent war . . . But if Mussolini is so lunatic as to resist the united League of Nations by force, let it be so. He will order the firing of the first shot, and ho will take the consequences of that order. </para>
                    <para class="block">That this was the opinion of the vast majority of the delegates, was proved by the final vote. Before the vote was taken, however, there was a long and dramatic debate in which, the picturesque personalities of the minority spokesmen did something to conceal the numerical weakness of their supporters. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford</inline> Cripps, most of whose adherents appeared to be in the public gallery, argued thathehad changed his mind about the League because he had only recently come to the conclusion that it was a League of sated imperialist powers - an &#34; international burglars&#39; union.&#34; Yet the only significant change in its character, coincident with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford&#39;s</inline> conversion, has been the adherence of Russia! Lord Ponsonby laid great stress on the League&#39;s lack of universality, compared with the original intentions of its founders. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lansburyspoke</inline> the language of unqualified Christian pacifism: &#34;They who take the sword shall perish with the sword.&#34; The delegates were sympathetic, but not persuaded. In reply <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> tellingly remarked that those who did not approve of sanctions should have openly declared their opposition to the League years before. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Every honorable senator who claims to understand the Covenant of the League of Nations should have opposed sanctions years ago if hebelievedthat they meant war. Why it is that the Labour party has waited until now to voice its opposition to the Covenant? The reason is that there is a world of difference between the Australian Labour party and the British Labour party. What are the sanctions for which the Covenant of the League provides? First, the Covenant provides that the aggressor nation shall be prevented from getting arms. Does the Leader of the Opposition object to that? If so, it means that he is prepared to assist Italy to obtain arms. This bill is an attempt by Australia, in common with over 50 other nations, to prevent a covenant-breaking State - in this case Italy - from obtaining arms. </para>

                        <para>- I have said that it is hard to concede that the attitude of Labour is logical in view of the fact that the party  has  taken sixteen years to discover that it is not prepared to subscribe to the principle of sanctions, although in the present circumstances their application is clearly required under article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Senate has now to decide whether it will support the bill before it, which provides for the application of sanctions against Italy. I believe that I am correct in saying that the Leader of the Opposition, in replying to  the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that he will fight the bill at every stage, because he considers that sanctions mean war. But every honorable senator who has spoken in opposition to the measure, when pressed for a reason for that assertion, has been unable to justify it. The attitude of the opponents of the bill is entirely illogical. </para>

We contend that a nation which has deliberately broken the Covenant of the League, to which it has subscribed, and has set out on a policy which threatens to bring western civilization to its knees, by embroiling the world in a turmoil similar to that experienced in the years 3914-1S, should be regarded as an enemy of peace. If sanctions mean war, I would rather impose them than permit a belligerent nation like Italy to be supplied with arms to carry ou its cruel attack upon Abyssinia. If the Leader of the. Government said that it had been decided to allow  the  small arms factory at Lithgow to export its surplus arms to Italy, on the ground that this would provide work for Australians, would not the Leader of the Opposition claim that it would be wrong to employ trade unionists in the manufacture of arms that were to be sent overseas? The Labour party cannot consistently claim that it supports the League of Nations if it opposes the imposition of sanctions on a belligerent nation  which  breaks the Covenant of the League. What, would be the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition to the employment of members of the Australian Workers Union on the large grazing properties distributed throughout the Commonwealth, if this Parliament did not. prohibit the export to Italy of wool, which  is  required to clothe the Italian troops now engaged in harassing Abyssinia? </para>
                <para>The second object of sanctions, as 1 have previously remarked, is to prevent a Covenant-breaking State from obtaining essential raw materials. The third object is to inflict severe economic and financialloss upon such a nation. Italy has defied all the laws of humanity, and has deter- mined to wreck the peace of the world. By subjecting that country to economichardship we shall be trying to restrain it from pursuing its career of slaughter; but the Labour party tells us that we should not apply sanctions, because they mean war. What would the Labour party substitute for this bill? A conflagration threatens Europe, but that party takes refuge behind an academic argument. We have looked in vain for a constructive proposal -from it, but none is vouchsafed. It is illogical for the Opposition to condemn this measure, which aims at collective security within the League. The fourth object of sanctions is to give economic and financial aid to the nation which is the victim of aggression, but the Opposition is not prepared to give such aid. Only a year ago we heard the Leader of the Opposition reprimand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> and advise him to study the Covenant of the League in order to obtain a  proper appreciation of its implications. Why did he not then voice his protest against sanctions? It is said by the Labour party that sanctions will fail to achieve their object. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard it said in many places that, because sanctions will fail, they will merely irritate the people of Italy, and cause a war. I invite honorable senators to consider whether sanctions will be effective. To-day Germany. Japan and the United States of America are outside the League, and, of course, if Italy possesses sufficient gold, it will be able to trade with those nations.  Within  the last few days we have read in the press that the exports from the United States of America to Italy have increased tremendously. It may be said that Italy could purchase the raw materials it needs from Japan: hut I venture the opinion that it cannot expect the co-operation of Japan, whose official spokesman has declared that that country is interested in the stability of Asia, and is determined to lead the coloured races. So it is unlikely that Japan would help a western nation to crush Abyssinia. I am prepared to admit that Germany now has a large export trade with Italy. </para>

                        <para>- No. Although Italy can obtain supplies from countries that are independent of the League of Nations, it is only reasonable to assume that in a time of war its purchases will have to be made with gold. In considering whether sanctions will prove effective, we have to study the internal economy of the aggressor country against whom they are directed. Italy is not adequately equipped to-day, financially or industrially, to undertake a protracted struggle in Abyssinia, and is it not reasonable to assume that it would be less able to engage in a world-wide war against all the nations which constitute the League? </para>

                    <para>Will Signer Mussolini&#39;s &#39;&#34;forward&#34; foreign policy be hold back by economic difficulties? Many people are asking that question; and certainly a number of reports in the last few days indicate that the Duce&#39;s preparations in East Africa have given the economic screw in Italy a severe twist. First, the bank rate in Italy was raised last Monday from 3&#189; to 4&#189; per cent. This follows a drop in the gold reserve from 5,523 million lire to 5,257 million lire in the last ten days of July. Thus, despite the strict control of Italian citizens&#39; and firms&#39; foreign securities and assets, gold is flowing out; and this emphasizes the reason for the recent decree abandoning the statutory requirement of 40 per cent. gold cover against notes and sight liabilities. </para>

Italy will be hard put to make further progress with the conquest of Abyssinia. The national wealth of Italy is estimated by Mortara, an eminent economist, at only 450,000,000,000 lire, so that here exists a state of affairs hardly to be met with elsewhere, even in a colony, let alone among the great powers of Europe! The first part of the bill, which outlines the prohibition of the export of arms, is one which the Leader of the Opposition does not propose to support, and this is most illuminating. If the bill were stripped of its camouflage and merely provided that Australia should join with the other nations in prohibiting the export of arms, the Leader of the Opposition. to be consistent, would have to oppose it. because it would interfere with the freedom of Australia to export arms to Italy. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to quote figures showing the world&#39;s export of munitions for 1933. My authority is the <inline font-style="italic">Blue Book</inline> of the League of Nations. The United Kingdom, itself one of the parties to the proposal to impose sanctions, exports 33.8 per cent. of the total supplies. Is it not reasonable to assume if over one-third of the exportable arms are suddenly cut off, Italy must feel the effect of the cessation, or does the honorable senator advocate that England should continue to export 33.8 per cent. of the world&#39;s armaments? The United States of America, which has been so often referred to as a country outside the League, exports about 16.7 per cent. France, a member of the League, exports 14.6 per cent. Of the three great exporting nations in the munition world then, two of them, who represent 50 per cent. of the total, are members of the League and are applying sanctions. But even that fact does not impress the Leader of the Opposition who says that to apply sanctions is to interfere with freedom - that the very fact that these countries will not export their arms to Italy will create war. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has spoken against the application of sanctions, and they include a prohibition of the export of arms. Two nations are responsible for 50 per cent. of the total export of arms. The complete table, which may interest honorable senators, is as follows: - </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> may say that that does not prove my case, but I venture to suggest that if he were asked to give a definite vote as to whether we should supply Italy with arms to conduct war against Abyssinia his reply would be in the negative. Well, then, I ask him to support the bill. </para>
                <para>I now come to the subject of credits, which, as I have already pointed out, are extremely important for they are necessary for the prosecution of war. Although a modern army may have a constant supply of arms and munitions to prosecute a campaign, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> know, it needs about ten men in the supply organization to keep one man in the field. To obtain these supplies gold is necessary. The. surest way in which to limit a nation&#39;s ability to buy in the world&#39;s markets is to restrict its credits. There is no moral difference between sending 1,000,000 rifles from Australia for use by the Italian army and sending &#163;1,000,000. Both are used in conducting military operations and consequently come under sanctions. There are two classes of credits. There are credits owned by a country before the commencement of hostilities, and those secured by it after the outbreak of hostilities. Let us examine the credits in existence at the outbreak of war. They include foreign currency within the country; foreign securities within the country ; commercial balances and instruments abroad; and branch houses, real property, abroad. Before the commencement of hostilities, a nation must attempt to marshal its credits Mussolini has already acted on these lines. After the commencement of hostilities it is an entirely different matter, because it can then extend its credits only on interest and dividends on securities held - provided there were no sanctions; commercial balances from exports - provided that there are exports; borrowings by commercial houses - provided there are no sanctions preventing borrowing; credits or loans secured by the government - provided there are no sanctions; credits or loans secured by municipalities or credits transferred from a third country. When honorable senators analyse the provisions of the bill and the credit machinery they will find that the only source of credit available to Italy, apart from its internal gold reserve, is that available in the United States of America, Germany and Japan. If we analyse Italian loans since 1921 to the present day we find that all of these three countries, particularly the United States of America, are creditor countries which, in commercial terras, means that there is no balance to be transferred. Therefore, Italy cannot obtain credits abroad and the only credit available is its rapidly diminishing gold supply. Over 51 nations are co-operating in a campaign to prevent Mussolini from bringing western civilization to its feet. If the position which I have outlined does not impress the members of the Australian Labour party I do not know what will. The only conclusion I can come to is that the Australian Labour party is opposing this bill because it does not wish to work in cooperation with any other political party however great the national emergency may be. </para>
                <para>The only other point I wish to stress is the fact that the major portion of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition - I did not hear it, but I read it carefullyagainst the application of sanctions was an attempt to ridicule the Government because Italy is securing petrol supplies from the United States of America. I have heard members of the Labour party in this chamber say that sanctions cannot be effective because petrol, which is used extensively by a mechanized army, is flowing freely out of the United States of America into Italy. The Leader of the Opposition said - </para>

                        <para>- If the League and collective action fail each nation must inevitably adopt a policy of self sufficiency or economic nationalism, which will ultimately force Australian export trade to its knees. A short time ago the German Minister for Agriculculture said &#34; We shall never be forced to our knees as we were forced a few years ago &#34;. Because of the fear engendered among European nations they have been forced to adopt a policy of self sufficiency. We must not remove the only instrument which stands between Australia and complete economic chaos. Fully one-third of Australia&#39;s produce is  exported, and if we are to maintain peace and ensure a continuance of existing trade conditions we must support the bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that I should cast a silent vote on the measure before the Senate. At the same time I shall not employ many words, and in those words honorable senators may not find anything new. My real objective is to emphasize certain facts which have already been placed before the Senate. Australia having willingly, and oven eagerly, assumed the rights and privileges of a nation has hitherto displayed a desire to play a nation&#39;s part in world affairs. Now that it is asked to bear a nation&#39;s responsibility I am sure that there will be no flinching, and that this Parliament, on behalf of Australia, in agreeing to the application of sanctions to restrain Italy from proceeding further along the path of destruction, will be speaking with the voice of the people and honouring both their legal and their moral obligations. Honorable senators supporting the Government have been described as &#34;warmongers &#34;, but I, and other honorable senators on this side of the chamber, resent that term. I am sure that nothing is more foreign to the lessons of their experience than the promotion of international strife. Several honorable senators on this side have given service for their country in the field, some very much to their own personal cost, the evidences of which are to be seen to-day. </para>

At the first referendum, held on the 28th October, 1916, 133.813 votes were cast. Of that number 72,399 voted for, and 58,894 against, conscription, while 2,520 votes were informal. The majority for conscription on that occasion was 13,505.

                <para>The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> in moving the second reading of the bill, was, I am sure, deeply conscious alike of its importance and its possible consequences to Australia. In view . of his long public life and, I may say, great public service to Australia during the most critical period in our history, no man in our midst can speak with more authority and with greater knowledge of the political, economic and physical destructiveness of war, or the paramount need for avoiding it by every honorable and practical means. Is it likely, therefore, that he spoke on behalf of the Government without previously having given the most grave consideration to what is desired and the risks attached to the attainment of that desire? </para>
                <para>The history of the last 150 yearsis notable for the number of wars which have occurred, some of them dynastic in origin, some due to the need for racial expansion or commercial gain, some caused by sheer militancy and the desire for conquest, and others by internal pressure and upheavals. But through all that time, owing to the spread of enlightenment among the people of all countries, there has been evinced an ever-growing desire for permanent world peace, for the protection of human life, the cessation of the destruction of property, and the promotion of that spirit of understanding and helpfulness to which Christian communities profess to attach such great importance. In the pursuit of this objective we should, I think, give full emphasis to the sincerity displayed by the British Empire. During the critical negotiations in Europe in the mid-summer months of 1914, just before the commencement of hostilities, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey, the then BritishForeign Minister, declared that, if Europe could be pulled through the crisis, it would be the duty of the statesmen of the world to create some international system by which such future crises might be averted. </para>
                <para class="block">That weighty utterance was not an isolated pronouncement. Almost immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> then Prime Minister of Great Britain, announced that it was a war aim of the British people to establish, at its close, a league of peace. During all the dark years of the war that splendid ideal was not lost sight of by British Ministers, and the political leaders of that other great branch of the Anglo-Saxon race, the United States of America. The ultimate outcome was the establishment of the League of Nations, which was designed to promote peace and prevent aggression by any individual power. The principles of the constitution of the League were, I think, in accordance with our desires. We accepted its articles without opposition, and by signing the Covenant we assumed our share of its obligations without protest from any political party in Australia. At that time it seemed that &#34; the war to end war &#34; had really attained its objective. </para>
                <para> Now a situation has arisen in which Australia is, without a doubt, being jailed upon to play its part in accordance with its solemn undertaking. We cannot disregard the summons because the peace of older nations, as well as our own future, is at stake. Since collective security means protection for Australia against hostile acts, if by an adverse vote now we sabotage the League, who can say what dire fate may be ours later? </para>
                <para>I must confess that I cannot understand the attitude of the Federal Parliamentary Labour party upon this issue, unless it be its wont, despite its many good works, occasionally to back the wrong horse. I am satisfied that the people of Australia endorse every action taken by the League, and that by firmness on the part of this Government in support of Great Britain and the League, the danger of war - not a very grave danger at the moment, I think - will be averted, and more and wider avenues opened for future exploitation of the possibilities of universal peace. Since 1914 no country has  been  confronted with a graver problem than that with which we now have to deal. I have no doubt as to the decision of this chamber. I whole-heartedly support the bill. </para>

                    <para>. - In the course of my remarks upon this important subject, it will be my purpose to break new ground, if that be possible after the lengthy debate that has already taken place. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has not denied that the League of Nations was established for the purpose of preventing future wars from destroying civilization. On the contrary, he has, I understand, on many occasions upheld the ideals of the League. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The League of Nations came into being when the Treaty of Peace with Germany was ratified on the 10th January, 1920. Its charter, containing 26 articles, is known as the Covenant which includes a number of provisions for the prevention and settlement of disputes. These clauses bind natio&#39;ns which are members of the League not to employ force for the settlement of the disputes until they have first been submitted to the League of Nations, or to arbitrators or to judges. The right to resort to war was retained in the event of the League or the arbitrators failing to reach a unanimous decision, but even then only after a delay of three months after such failure. This right to war was abandoned by the 60 States which signed the Kellogg Pact. Thus for the first time in history machinery was devised for the establishment of an international tribunal with a set purpose to prevent war, which is regarded as the greatest scourge of mankind. </para>
                <para>Apparently the ideal of the League is too high for certain members of the so-called Labour party of Australia. </para>

                <para>In opposing the imposition of sanctions, members of the Opposition really suggest that Australia should break faith with the rest of the world. In following such a course we would probably not only cause confusion among the other nations which constitute the League, but would also support the opening of the door immediately for all sorts of open trading in oil, armaments, munitions, and all requirements of war. Thus we would add fuel to the flames and do the very thing which Australia as a member of the League has undertaken to prevent. </para>

                <para class="block">These are five of the main rules of conduct. I point out that the Leader of the Opposition has repudiated this fifth duty. This rule prescribes that the nation shall take collective action to coerce any nation resorting to war in a breach of its obligations under the Covenant. This being so, how does the Leader of the Opposition square his opinions of the League to-day with those which he expressed some time ago? On a previous occasion, he suggested that honorable senators should examine the Covenant of the League and find out exactly what the League stands for. At that time he implied that many honorable senators were ignorant of the real duties and objects of the League. Apparently, however, the honorable senator himself was totally ignorant of what the League stands for. The League of Nations is not a League of words; it is not even a House of Parliament. It is an assembly of nations which contracted to do everything in their power to preserve the peace of the world. I repeat that the fifth rule of the League makes it obligatory on all members to contribute to collective action for the maintenance of peace. Apparently, the Leader of the Opposition knows nothing about that rule, and his speech on this matter must be regarded as a mass of wordy nothings. A little while ago, I characterized his utterances as platitudes; they are not even platitudes. When the honorable senator took other honorable senators to task, suggesting that they did not know what the League stood for, he himself did not. understand the objects of the League. Apparently, he had not read the rules of conduct, which the Covenant lays down for League members. </para>

                        <para>- I am showing that the honorable senator knew nothing about the matter at that time. To-day, he opposed the imposition of sanctions, yet the fifth rule of conduct for members of the League lays it down definitely that in the interests of collective security, it is obligatory on members of the League to impose financial and economic pressure on any nation which commits a breach of the Covenant. The contribution of naval and military forces in any collective action taken by members of the League is a matter for recommendation to the Council. We are proud of the fact that, in spite of the dangers and difficulties involved in such a duty, Great Britain based sufficient naval strength in the Mediterranean, in order, first, to show its strength, and, secondly, to assist the League when the need for armed strength arose. Thus, at least one nation has stood by this rule of the League, and has been  complimented  by Germany on the fact that it had replaced France as the leading nation within the League. These sanctions have not been designed for the purpose merely of imposing the League&#39;s decision on members, but primarily with the object of preventing and in the last resort stopping breaches of the Covenant with as little injury as possible. That is the basic idea of the Covenant. It is not necessarily correct to say that sanctions mean war. The League holds the view that by the imposition of economic sanctions, it will shorten this war. Even if it were to fail on this occasion, on a future occasion it might, by the imposition of sanctions, avoid war. By such a method it seeks to stop trade in munitions, arms, ammunition, fuel of all kinds, and, in fact, all material likely to assist in the waging of war. No matter what authority honorable senators may quote in support of their attitude, I claim that economic sanctions do not necessarily mean war. The imposition of such sanctions is a means to be utilized by those nations which have covenanted under the League to bring about peace as quickly as possible and with as little injury as possible to any nation. </para>

He would not do so himself, but, like any other honorable man, would stick to an agreement to which he had placed his signature. The honorable senator has shown that he knows very little about the League of Nations. He takes his theories out of the political oven before they have been properly cooked. If he will give greater consideration to the ideals of the League, he will realize that ideals must be backed not only by words, but also by sacrifice. Nothing worth while in life has been won without some form of human sacrifice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> referred to the White Australia policy. Does he not realize that if Australia fails to honour its obligations to the League Covenant, it cannot consistently call upon other nations to defend the White Australia principle should it be challenged. </para>

                        <para>- If Australia were attacked, and the White Australia principle were endangered, I sincerely believe that the United States of America would come to our aid. Not many men will willingly dishonour obligations into which they have entered. It is said that an Englishman&#39;s word is his bond. Let it also be said that the word of the British Empire, and of Australia as a part of the Empire, is its bond ; that the people of Great Britain and the British dominions remain true to the best traditions of the race. Much has been said of the failures of the League of Nations, .but when we reflect that in this country, where only one flag flies and the one language is spoken, hatred and strife are only too prevalent, can we wonder that, among men differing in nationality, language and religion, there is not perfect unanimity in regard to the _ best way to abolish war? The problem can be solved only by strong men of resolute will, who are determined to stand by the obligations into which \hey have entered. The Labour party has failed Australia ; indeed, it has failed humanity, for not only Abyssinia but also every other small nation is involved in the present crisis. Australia is one of the small nations of the world; it is an outpost of the British Empire, occupying, as it were, the front trench of the white race. Should Australia ever be in great difficulties its position in the world will be stronger, if we are able to say that, when another small nation was attacked, Australia rang true. I hope that the war between Italy and Abyssinia will not spread, and that there will not be another world war. I am pledged to economic sanctions, because I believe-that they will be a potent factor in the preservation of world peace. </para>

                    <para>.- On such an important bill I do not wish to remain silent; nevertheless, I shall not weary honorable senators by expressing at great length the reasons why I support a measure, the necessity for the introduction of which I regret. If we were able to get in touch with every Australian citizen, we would find that, although the outbreak of hostilities between Italy and Abyssinia is deeply regretted, there is a determination on the part of a great majority of the people of Australia to do everything possible to assist the League of Nations to bring about a speedy termination of the conflict. In my opinion, not sufficient recognition has been given to the magnificent effort which Great Britain has been making for some time to avert hostilities and, failing that, to secure unanimity among the larger nations of the world as to the means to be adopted to bring hostilities to an end as early as possible. At no time in the history of the world has Great Britain stood so high in public esteem as it now stands because of its efforts in the interests of peace. For that reason, I greatly regret that this Australian Parliament does not speak with one voice in regard to the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. A. bill such as that now before us should be above party strife, for it transcends party in that it aims at the betterment of the peoples of the whole world. The New Zealand Parliament passed similar legislation without a dissentient voice being raised in either chamber. What New Zealand has done, Australia ought to do. I am not without hope that the three members of the Federal Labour party who constitute the Opposition in this chamber will, even yet, withdraw their opposition to the measure, so that it may be said that the Senate recorded a unanimous vote in favour of the bill, the purpose of which is to make it impossible for a covenantbreaking nation to carry on hostilities successfully. I am astounded at the attempts made by the Opposition to mislead the people of Australia regarding the motive underlying this legislation. Last Monday night, when in Melbourne, I attended a meeting at which prominent speakers referred to the Commonwealth Ministry as &#34; Australia&#39;s war ministry &#34;. The meeting was convened to express opposition to fascism and war, but opportunity was taken to censure the Government for having introduced a Crimes Bill and for desiring to embroil Australia in a world war. Fortunately, the audience was not large, there being probably not more than 1000 persons present, but I was surprised at the length to which the political opponents of the Government are prepared to go in an attempt to discredit it. There is no evidence of any desire for war on the part of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- Sanations can lead to war only if the nation against which they- are directed commits an act of war. Notwithstanding its strength, Italy would hesitate before engaging in war against the nations which have agreed to impose financial and economic sanctions against it. The most extraordinary thing about the meeting which I attended in Melbourne was that it was called with the object of protesting against fascism. The other item on the agenda paper was anti-war - a lovely mixture indeed ! Anything to catch the public ear and delude the people ! On the one hand Italy is denounced because it has a form of government which we in Australia would never tolerate and on the other hand, the Australian Government is denounced for bringing forward a measure to terminate the present war by imposing sanctions on Italy. </para>

                <para>The international position to-day is serious. I am much in accord with a  speaker  who addressed himself to the Abyssinian dispute recently, and said that, in his opinion, the magnificent gesture of Great Britain towards disarmament, though made with the best of intentions, probably accounts for the Italian aggression against Abyssinia. He contended that if Great Britain, instead of spending millions of pounds on the payment of the dole to its youth, had used the money to train the youths in defence of the British Empire, and to maintain: her armaments for defence purposes, Italy would never have dared to undertake hostilities in East Africa. That may be correct ; but we realize that Britain, despite its handicaps, has taken a risk in order to give a lead to the world in disarmament. Its attitude has evoked the admiration of the world. If Australians do not stand behind Great Britain in its magnificent effort, we shall no longer be Britons; we shall be recreant to the trust imposed in us and shall never bo able to lift our heads again among the nations that are honouring the Covenant. We must not desert Great Britain and other countries associated with her in their hour of need. No more important legislation than this has been brought before this Parliament for many years. This measure marks a critical stage in our history, and demands either that we stand firm in our intention to honour the undertaking we gave when we signed the &#39;Covenant of the League of Nations and maintain the loyalty which we owe to the Commonwealth of Nations which form the British Empire, or play the part of a renegade. We may follow one of two courses. I know the part that we shall play, however; the bill will be passed. </para>

                        <para>- I made that statement in the hope that the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues may repent. This matter is far too important to be made a party question. From my knowledge of the Australian people I .am confident that they will support the Government. In conclusion, I sincerely hope that the enforcement of sanctions by the nations which have agreed to them will bring about the speedy termination of hostilities in Abyssinia. If that eventuates, I predict that the League of Nations will become the force in the world that we hoped it would be when it was inaugurated, to preserve world peace for all time. </para>

                    <para>. - On behalf of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> I thank honorable senators for the high plane on which the measure has been discussed. No measure more far-reaching or more important has ever come before the Senate. It affects not only the interests of Australia but, as I shall indicate, the interests of suffering civilization itself. It is proper that a matter of such moment should be discussed on the highest possible plane, and not made the subject of party attack, because the future of civilization depends upon the attitude that is adopted by the constituent members of the League. Hie measure is fraught with such tremendous responsibilities that we should deal with it earnestly and in no carping partisan spirit. Any shaft that may come from me in the course of my speech, although perhaps aimed at some of the honorable gentlemen opposite, will be directed by a sincere desire to convert them from their present attitude to a realization of their responsibility and their duty to humanity. When debating a measure of this description, we should take stock of where the peoples of the world stand - why are we hero, what are we doing, and what is our duty to posterity? Surely we arc trustees for posterity, and have a responsibility for the future advancement of mankind. Because of this, a suffering civilization has brought into being the League of Nations. The foundation of the League was the first concerted attempt of civilized man to rescue itself from the horrors of war. Whatever failures it may have had in the past, and despite the lack of support from certain powers, the League has been a force for good. I remind honorable senators that though Germany and Russia were not original members, and the United States of America&#39; has never joined, the League has rendered considerable service to the world. It has eliminated the sufferings of many nations, and repeatedly preserved peace between nations that were on the very verge of war. Under these circumstances, a grave responsibility rests upon those in our midst who state that we should not support the League. Members of the Opposition have avoided the issue which briefly is this: Are we to retire from the League of Nations or carry out our obligations to it to the full? There is no middle course. We have either to accept our obligations or -leave the League. 1 am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> would be the last to declare that we should retire from the League. Does the Labour party stand for the desertion of the League? The only alternative is to support the League to the full. One cannot give part service to the League; we must either accept the Covenant as a whole with its disabilities, disadvantages and dangers, if we are to strive in the interests of suffering civilization and humanity - for that is the League&#39;s objective - or withdraw from it. Every law, both human and divine, stands for the observance of covenants, and I think that it is nowhere better expressed than in the Koran : &#34; Oh ye faithful keep your covenants&#34;. That is all that the League and the British Empire are asking. This Parliament is asked in its small way to implement one small part of our covenants. Our good faith, honesty of purpose and self-interest go hand in hand on this occasion. A few days ago, I said in this chamber that Australia, by reason of its isolated position in the southern seas, has much to gain from loyal adherence to the League. </para>

                <para>As regards the position in Europe, I speak with some degree of feeling, because T was a signatory on behalf of Australia to the Kellogg Pact. France, one of the nations represented at that ceremony, has had personal experience of war, and ir, has suffered more bloodshed on its own fields, than probably any other nation in Europe. Within a period of 50 years, France has endured two invasions, and has had its soil drenched with the blood of its own sons, the invaders, and those who went to its rescue. I never knew an assembly in which fervour reached such a point as on the occasion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kellogg&#39;s</inline> visit to France. The document, variously called the Pact of Paris, and the Briand-Kellogg Pact, evoked in the French people feverish enthusiasm for what they believed to be an implementation of the work of the League of Nations - an accession of strength to the League, fathered and fostered by the American people. As I have mentioned, the French knew the horrors pf war and experienced its disabilities and disadvantages. Their fields had been trampled by the rude foot of the invader for centuries past, and the French impressed upon me at the time their tremendous enthusiasm, almost a religious fervour, for the Kellogg Pact which outlawed war as a weapon among civilized people. The ceremony of signing the pact left an indelible impression on my mind. We in this country know nothing of the horrors of war close to our shores. Our country has been free, thank God, from even a civil disturbance involving any great shedding of blood. It has never felt the foot of the invader. The unfortunate people of Europe who know what war means, its disabilities and its consequences, desire only lasting peace. In these circumstances, regardless of party considerations, we should support this instrument of peace devised by man for his own protection and security, and give it an opportunity to succeed. We have no quarrel with Italy, a country to which modern civilization owes a great deal. Although the League may have some complaints concerning the conditions prevailing in Abyssinia, we have no quarrel with that country. Whatever may be the&#39; merits of the dispute, Italy and Abyssinia as members of the League are bound by the Covenant, and should have adhered to it. Abyssinia was willing to allow the dispute to be settled by the proper tribunal constituted by the League. and Italy having declined, must submit to whatever may be the consequences of the action it has decided to take. Some observations have been made concerning the far-reaching effects of article 16 of the Covenant. Whatever the Covenant may provide concerning the existence of &#34; a state of war &#34; between certain signatories to the Covenant, the League, in certain resolutions with which honorable senators are familiar, has interpreted those words. These resolutions were passed because the principle of peace is fundamental to the existence of the League. The League which was constituted to ensure the territorial integrity of all nations, and especially the weaker ones, and the existence of a state of war is contrary to the fundamental principles upon which the League is founded. In pursuance of the League&#39;s interpretation of article 16, the Member States are now acting together to bring about a stoppage of the carnage at present proceeding in Northern Africa. Some have said that the League has failed. Has the League actually failed? Has it ever previously been really tested? If time permitted, I could draw a clear distinction between the situation which existed in Manchukuo and that which prevails in Abyssinia to-day. I could refer honorable senators to the Lytton report which declared that there was some justification for a general cleaning up of the position in Northern China, but, I feel that Japan was wrong in adopting the methods it did. There may be something to be said in extenuation of Italy&#39;s policy towards Abyssinia, but countries which have subscribed to the Covenant of the League, are bound by its principles and procedure. The League failed to settle the Manchukuo dispute, but that does not mean that it will fail to solve the problem now before it. The League which was established in the interests of peace has the support of the French Government, and its representatives at the League Council expressed in no uncertain terms the loyalty of Franc? towards the Covenant.

                <para>Some misapprehension appears to exist in the minds of many persons concerning the meaning and use of the word &#34; sanctions &#34;. Ordinarily, &#34; sanction &#34; means approval, but in League circles the word has a different meaning. It is doubtful whether British law owes much to the Roman law, but the French, Italian, Dutch. and some other systems of jurisprudence are closely associated with it. Those who have been in South Africa recall that, in the Dutch legal system, there is a fair sprinkling of Roman law. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Roman law, which has exerted a wide influence on France and other Continental countries, has also influenced the language in which the terms of the Covenant have been expressed. This is not surprising if regard be had to the fact that French is one of the official languages in use at the League. At the Council meetings of the League, French and English are the principal languages spoken. The existing legal system has therefore found expression in various articles of the Covenant, and the term &#34; sanctions &#34; is commonly used to express punishments or deterrents. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Salmond, who was a judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, explains the term &#34; sanctions &#34; in his book on <inline font-style="italic">Jurisprudence</inline> in. this way - </para>

                <para>Honorable senators generally have given the bill their blessing. Australia must either honour its obligations under the League Covenant or resign its membership of the League of Nations. I cannot follow the logic of honorable senators opposite. They say - &#34;We do not believe in the participation by Australia in the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. We decline to carry out our obligations under the Covenant. We shall not vote to impose sanctions on the Italian people. We want to keep out&#34;. I put it to them that such a position would be absolutely inconsistent with our continued membership of the League. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> has told us that Labour&#39;s policy is the adequate defence of Australia. What would be the attitude of the Labour party if Australia were menaced by a foreign nation?

                <para>The object of the amendment is tolerably clear. There is no doubt that, when this legislation comes into force, many debts will be dueby persons in Australia to persons in Italy in respect of various business transactions, and it is only right that the debtors should be required to discharge their obligations. It is proposed to establish, as was done during the Great War, a clearing house, to enable that to be done. </para>

                        <para>. -  It can scarcely be imagined that I, as Leader of the Opposition, would allow this opportunity to pass without making some attempt to express very strong disapproval of the tactics adopted by some honorable senators in the course of this debate. I pay tribute to those who, in debating the measure, were at least not guilty of slander and misrepresentation of the views of myself and the party I represent. I do not object to honorable senators drawing their own deductions from what I said, but I strongly resent attempts - which I believe were deliberate - to put into my mouth words which I did not use. I can say truthfully that I am not thin-skinned, and that in this or any other debate I have not offered opposition merely for the sake of opposition. Yet this afternoon I was subjected to insult after insult, both personal and political. I do not object to such attacks, but I take this opportunity of saying that I know why they were made. </para>

                    <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon. P. J. Lynch).</inline> - I cannot see that a point of order arises. I had noticed that the honorable senator had said that he had been subjected to insults. That was a reflection on the Chair which I was prepared to allow to pass in the belief that the honorable senator was smarting under a sense of defeat. I assure him, howover, that he got as much protection from the Chair as he was entitled to. I remind him also that he constantly interrupted other honorable senators. The honorable senator cannot live in a glass house and throw stones, without having stones thrown at him in retaliation. On the whole, the debate on the second reading  was, as was said by the Postmaster-General, conducted on a high plane, and during the course of it every honorable senator was reasonably protected by the Chair. </para>

                            <para>- I hope, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that any remarks which I have made will not be taken as a reflection on yourself or on your conduct in the chair. This afternoon you were most magnanimous towards me and for that I pay tribute to you now. I realize that you could have been more severe towards me. However, that does not alter the fact that I was fully justified in what I said and I emphasize that I would repeat my offence to-morrow under similar provocation. The honorable senator who raised the point of order was one of those to whom I referred. At one stage he asked, by interjection : &#34; Does not the party to which the Leader of the Opposition belongs, impose sanctions on the boss?&#34; I hope that I shall be corrected if on any occasion I should say by interjection anything which is untrue or in which  I may have drawn wrong deduction from the remarks of any honorable senator. The interjection to which I have just referred sounds fairly innocent to a man who has not been educated in the&#39; policy and procedure of the working class. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator twitted the party to which I belong with having imposed restrictions industrially, or suggested that we believed in sanctions industrially. If the honorable senator knows anything of the history of the trades union movement, he must be aware that any sanctions imposed industrially were invoked because of the cruel conditions which prevailed in industry in Australia in days gone by. Gentlemen who belong to the class to which the honorable senator belongs, ought to go on their knees and thank Providence every hour of their lives that such a factor as the trades union movement came into the industrial life of Australia, and that power was given to it by this and other Parliaments to impose restrictions upon bad employers. Were it not for the power of this party, industrially and politically, to restrain the dispossessed in this community, to restrain the hungry and those who have not, and to restrain those upon whom the intolerable burden of unemployment is imposed by a bad social order, it would not be only the dividends or profits of the section which honorable senators opposite support, but their very lives which would be in jeopardy to-day. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator suggested that because we imposed sanctions under other circumstances we are perfidious or recreant when we oppose the imposition of the sanctions proposed in the bill. This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> referred unfairly to my remarks about oil. I do not object to criticism, no matter how severe it may be; it does not upset me. It is not a new ruse to tear a sentence from its contest and then make capital out of it, but throughout my career, political and otherwise, I have never knowingly submitted to an injustice without protesting, and I am not going to do so now. In regard to oil, I pointed out in my second-reading speech that, while we refuse to supply food to Italy, while we starve Italian women and children - </para>

                        <para>How long more will it be before the League gets on with the real job? We propose to supply food to Italy, but apparently supplies of a more essential commodity - petrol - are to be continued although this will enable Italy to operate against Abyssinia, its mechanized army, including its great fleet of aeroplanes. The Leader of the Government does not toll us why petrol has not been specifically placed on the list of sanctions or mentioned in this bill. 1 suggest that the reason is that great international interests - the oil producers of different countries - want to go on reaping unholy profits out of Italy. Deny Italy petrol and immediately its capacity to attack Abyssinia and prosecute the present conflict would be prejudiced. </para>

                        to remember, not its failures, but its successes. I still stand for the League of Nations, and when the Senate is asked to vote money for its support, I shall energetically and enthusiastically support the proposal. But if it means the sacrificing of one Australian life I do not. believe that we should stand by the League in a dispute such as that between Italy and Abyssinia.

                            <para>- I hope that the day will come when the League will be a really efficient instrument for peace. It is not so to-day. If I had time, and the Standing Orders permitted, I could show that there are interests which prevent the League from doing the work which it is most anxious to do. If, as is claimed, Australia becomes automatically engaged in war when Britain&#39; is at war, although 12,000 miles away from the scene of old world feuds, we shall beasked to make this country a first-class naval, military and air power. But, as honorable senators know, that is impossible. The Labour party is determined to do its utmost to prevent any Australian from being slaughtered at the behest of interests thousands of miles away. I am not afraid that I shall he sent to the war. I am too old to fight. But although in no danger myself, I shall not be a party to sending young fellows there. The </para>

Because I say these things, nearly all the adjectives in the dictionary, and others which are not there, have been hurled against me. I have been told that I have advocated a policy of cowardice.

At that time, &#34; funkhole &#34; had not been coined, but its equivalent &#34; hollow-log &#34; was freely used. I was told that I was always looking for a hollow-log. If it is true that I advocate a policy of cowardice, then I am a coward, and as such I shall endeavour to persuade my fellow countrymen to be cowards also should -an attempt be made to send Australians to the other side of the world to engage in old world feuds. </para>

If he had let himself go, he could have been guilty of a lot of unbrotherly, and perhaps, unparliamentary expressions. There was, however, nothing new in what the Minister said. I am old enough to remember other &#34;wars than the Great War of 1914-18, and I know the arguments that were used in connexion with them. Wc were told that the Groat War was a war to end war. Now, it appears that we shall have to go to war in order to protect the League of - Nations and to ensure peace. Peace is not the fruit of war. A man armed with a gun is not the best advocate of peace. When the existing social order has been altered, it may be possible to get a League of Nations which will prevent war. Why has the world not implemented the various conventions of the League of Nations? </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with Soviet Russia presently. Somewhat belatedly, comrade Stalin has become a hero in the opinion of the present Government. That astounds me. When I heard the Minister quoting M. Stalin as an authority I could scarcely believe that I was in an Australian parliament. Russia, the country which the Minister has extolled, recently had a display of force - tanks, aeroplanes, and countless thousands of drilled men - that could not be equalled by any other country. The creation of this force was rendered necessary because the hand of every country was raised against Russia, whose Communist rulers were led 1o fear that their policy would be upset. It is idle to talk of bringing peace by arms. But the armament race is on ! The job for the ghouls who make a profit out of death has begun, and little Australia is asked to throw out its chest, metaphorically speaking, and pose as a first-class power, when, we have ample scope for the employment of all our energies in the development of this country. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has used the wrong tense. Great Britain proposes to spend &#163;200,000,000 on its navy, and yet the honorable senator declares that the race could become a gallop! The Government asks that our enormous country, sparsely populated, should parade itself a.s a great power which Europe will hoed. Australia does not count three halfpence in international affairs. The patriotic appeal to prejudices and to the necessity to honour solemn pledges, which the Minister made to-night, has been uttered in every country that ever entered into a war. &#34; Are we to be cowards ? Are we to ignore our solemn pledge? We have put our hand to this thing and we must go on.&#34; Nonsense! If this policy will mean the sacrifice of Australian lives, now <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> the time for us to get out of the dispute. The Minister also alluded to the splendid action of France. France  entered the League very equivocally, and is only remaining a member very equivocally. It is the bully and the danger spot of Europe, and may yet plunge the Continent into war. For years it has been constructing hundreds of miles of concrete and steel fortifications along the frontier of Germany, and that is a deliberate incitement to -Germany to &#34; have a go.&#34; But the League has made no attempt to stop that military challenge. The League and Great Britain remained silent while Germany was permitted to re-arm. Germany has been slowly building up its defences ever since the Versailles Treaty and cruel reparations were imposed upon it. The position in Central Europe to-day is one of the consequences of the war settlement. </para>

                            <para>- Does the Postmaster-General believe that any steps which we have taken to date have even begun to call Mussolini&#39;s bluff? Mussolini is marching on in Abyssinia; women and children are being killed; and all the horrors of modern warfare are being employed there. Mussolini has called the League&#39;s bluff. Only yesterday, according to press reports, he told the League of Nations that it could proceed with its sanctions; that he would settle one score first and would deal with the others later. Despite that statement, I am told that the Labour party is wrong in stating that sanctions must inevitably lead to war. I said earlier that unless sanctions are childish puerility or entirely dishonest and not intended to be proceeded with, they must inevitably be followed .by war. Australia should not participate in such a conflict. The Postmaster-General made an eloquent appeal and might have reduced me to tears, but that I am too old and too experienced to be influenced by such tactics. He said that the Labour party has fallen from grace; that there was a time when it had wonderful ideals, and when its members would stand by their compact. I began to imagine that I was an absolute criminal for being associated with the present Labour party, when, like a flash, the question came to my mind: How did these gentleman and their predecessors treat that splendid old Labour party led by Andrew Fisher? </para>

                            <para>- In those times everything that the Labour party did was anathema and wrong. We were called cowards and cold-footers. Unionism and every other principle adopted by the Labour party was frowned upon. The Postmaster-General, in a final appeal to members of the Opposition, told us what good fellows the members of the party were 20, 30, and 40 years ago. I happened to be one of the good fellows of those days who was a bad fellow in those days, and was persecuted socially and economically because of my advocacy of Labour&#39;s policy. </para>

                    <para class="block">The whole of this sitting has been occupied in railing against the Opposition. One of the penalties of greatness is that the Leader of the Opposition has to hop over first and be the target for the shot and shell. But right down the years I have thrived on criticism. However, I realize that regardless of what we say the servile majority supporting the Government will enable this measure to be passed. Nevertheless this Government cannot silence the three men who constitute the Opposition. Although hour after hour is spent in attempts to show us where we are wrong and in distorting passages from our speeches, we shall not be prevented from making ourselves as effective in opposition as possible.Without the Opposition, this chamber would be worthless as a legislative body. I remind the Postmaster-General and honorable senators who have figured in the denunciation of the Labour party that we are  His  Majesty&#39;s Opposition, and without us in this chamber the procedure of constitutional government becomes a farce. Let ii be remembered that no bill can become law in this Parliament until we have expressed our views on it, if we so desire. These somewhat disjointed remarks come from the bottom of my heart. I regret that I have been unable to persuade a majority of the Senate to oppose the bill, because I firmly believe that the ultimate result of its passage will be not to stop the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia, hut to embroil Australiain another world conflict. </para>

In passing this measure we are forcing Italy and perhaps other countries to become even more self-contained than at present. </para>
                    <para class="block">Every war and every rumour of war has the effect of developing economic nationalism in order to reduce the risk of defeat. It has also been said that we have opposed this measure for party purposes, and the next moment we. are told that there are few people behind us. How can the two statements be reconciled? In order to clarify the position perhaps I should say that the members of the Labour party have no sympathy with Italy or its dictator. Mussolini. Any one who has read of the Fascist development in Italy must realize that the members of the Labour party have no love for Mussolini. </para>

We knowhow they have been persecuted and illtreated. How can it be said that we have any regard for Italy and its leader? On the other hand we have no love for Abyssinia. Only to-night the Parliamentary Librarian showed me a book published by the League of Nations picturing the horrors being perpetrated in that country. No one can peruse that book without feelings of horror at the way in which certain Abyssinian people are treated. We have definitely decided to take a certain line of action because we feel that in supporting the League of Nations in this dispute we may be embroiling Australia in another war.

Because they were sincerely desirous of upholding the principled upon which the League of Nations rested, they refrained from taking action to check the ambitions designs of those nations which landed the League with their tongues in their cheeks.

It is easy for honorable senators opposite to play upon the emotions of the people by speaking of the good old Mother Country and the boys of the bulldog breed. Honorable senators in opposition who have similar feelings contend that the people should know exactly what is happening, and should they decide to support sanctions we shall have nothing further to say. The course we are following is to ensure peace and to safeguard Australian development in such a way that there will be no need for war. </para>

                            <para>- Then I shall say it is not a parrot-like cry, but that of a magpie. It is puerile for honorable senators supporting the Government to ask repeatedly certain questions that have been answered on so many occasions. Our views on this subject are well known. We contend that war will never be prevented by the imposition of sanctions; that, to ensure peace among the nations, we must eliminate the basic causes of conflict. It was thought, when the peace treaty was signed, that Germany was utterly crushed. To-day Germany is as strong and virile as ever, and now threatens the peace of Europe. Within two years, it will be demanding the return of its colonies, the return of Memel and Danzig, and the elimination of the Polish corridor. It has not lost sight of its objective - a Mittel Europa extending from the Baltic to the Persian Gulf. Italy, too, is desirous of expansion. Its dependence on raw materials for the development of its secondary industries is compelling Mussolini to look to Northern Africa for the satisfaction of its needs. I repeat that we shall never eliminate the struggle between nations unless we come to some reasonable agreement for the supply of raw materials to those nations in need of it. </para>

But although Russia is now supporting the League and this Government against Italy, its system of government is anathema to the imperialist nations within the League of Nations. It is anathema to Germany, and also to Italy. </para>

                            <para>- I presume that, measures or regulations, similar to the provisions contained in this bill will be carried by France, Great Britain, and possibly, also by Soviet Russia, thus indicating a community of interest between these three great powers; but the effectiveness of sanctions about to be imposed against Italy is likely to be impaired by the antagonism between the system of government operating in Russia and the systems in Great Britain and France. </para>

                        <para>. - We who sit in Opposition have endeavoured to make it plain that we object to the application of sanctions against Italy because of the probable consequences to the people of this country, and I take this occasion to say to the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> that our attitude is summed up in the Latin phrase <inline font-style="italic">Bella! Horrida bella!</inline> We do not wish this country to be embroiled again in war overseas. It is apparent that a good deal of explanation is called for in regard to sanctions. There has been much splitting of hairs over it on the part of the Government. The former Minister for Health and Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> has said that sanctions mean war. In voting for sanctions when he believes that they will lead to war, he acted inconsistently. Yet members of this party are asked to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes;</inline> we prefer to be logical.

                    <para class="block">There is no doubt that, sanctions mean war. If we wish to make them effective - and I notice that Signor Mussolini within the last few days has threatened reprisals - we must continue to make them harder and harder until, as the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> pointed out, a covenant-breaking State takes to realism and elects to make the imposition of sanctions a cause of war. By admitting such risks to be attendant upon the imposition of sanctions, honorable senators opposite throw away their whole case, and prove that the views of the Labour party on this matter are sound. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Austen</inline> Chamberlain, the ex-Minister for Health and Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes), Sir John</inline> Latham, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford</inline> Cripps, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> Lansbury, and members of the Independent Labour party in England, support our views. For the information of honorable senators who are not familiar with the divisions of the Labour party in Great Britain, I point out that the British Independent Labour party claims to be the intellectual section of the Labour movement in that country. That party has numbered among its members in die past <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald and Lord Snowden, two gentlemen who at the commencement of the last war were opposed to war, but who with the lapse of time, and by the good will of the people of England, became respectively Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer. Thus the Leader of the Opposition is able to stand a good deal of the verbal whipping of honorable senators opposite ; if he lives long enough, he may bc asked to become the Tory Prime Minister of Australia. Should that happen, I have no doubt that he will receive the plaudits of any honorable senator opposite who is then living. I recall that a gentleman named Joseph Cook came to this country some years &#39;ago, and after taking a prominent part in the Labour party, progressed, changed his political opinion, and was knighted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> did likewise. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook,  at one stage of his career, said that &#34; the destiny of Australia is to become a republic&#34;, and when that day arrives I shall welcome it. </para>

                            <para>- I am mentioning these matters because we as members of the Opposition have been ridiculed. In this debate, much has been said about courage. I am no braver than the average man, but I point out that it takes a good deal of courage to be one of an Opposition of three in this chamber of 36 members. The relative strengths of parties in the Senate en courage the majority to become hostile to the minority to an extraordinary degree. I have mentioned the political histories of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook and other distinguished men to point out that leaders of minorities who have been much abused by the majority have ended their careers by leading the majority. This bill should not be passed. Although the Opposition numbers  only three, we may be the intellectual three of the 3U honorable senators in this chamber. It may be that we see further into the future than do honorable senators opposite. Our ideas on this matter are sound. Honorable senators opposite have said that the war is not on; the war is on. Although Italy has penetrated a distance of 50 miles into Abyssinian territory, it has not made a declaration of war, and, it is stated, Abyssinia is not at war although it is being bombed by Italians and being overrun by Italian tanks and armies. We claim that the war will extend immediately sanctions are imposed. There cannot be the slightest doubt about that, and in that view we arn supported by the greatest organ of conservative opinion in this country - the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline></para>

It has been alleged by honorable senators who support the Government that sanctions have been applied in our economic struggles, but I had never before heard the word used in that connexion. We do not consider that we are at war in the military sense when we engage in industrial fights. Economic sanctions, I maintain, inevitably mean war.

                                in the course of his speech on the second reading, said that Mussolini had evidently come to the conclusion that all the nations of the world are of the same &#34;kidney&#34; as the Labour party. My opinion is that when Mussolini realized that the League of Nations would not take action against Japan for its invasion of Manchukuo and China, he thought it would be quite all right for Italy to invade Abyssinia. The reason why no action was taken by the League against Japan was that the dispute was of too little interest to the principal Member States to make action worth while. The United States of America practically invited the League to intervene in the Sino-Japanese dispute, but the invitation was not accepted. In the Italo-Abyssinia dispute, however, the interests of the nations which were allies in the last war - and those nations are the principalMember States of the League - are vitally concerned. There are, for instance, the French interests in the Suez Canal and Abyssinia and the British interests in Egypt and Abyssinia. If Great Britain, France, and Soviet Russia were not supporting the imposition of sanctions, Mussolini would snap his fingers at the League of Nations.I do not think that any honorable senator will deny that sanctions must be pressed if they are to be effective. Unless they are pressed the last state of the League will be worse than its first, for it will become a laughing stock. But the enforcement of sanctions is undoubtedly likely to lead to war on a wide scale. If the two groups of the Labour party in Australia were alone in this view, they might reconsider their position; but thatis not the case. It will be a very serious thing for Australia if it. is to be drawn into every dispute that the powerful nations of the world, including Great Britain, the United States of America, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Russia, have in regard to colonial possessions.

                            <para>- I say that we should not, hurry into war. We should take all care that we do not give offence to the powerful nations of the world. If we are to become embroiled in every international dispute that occurs, we shall be in a most unhappy position. There is nothing disloyal about the attitude of the Labour party on this subject. If the majority of the people of Australia determined that the nation should go to war, we should need to examine the whole positionvery carefully; but we should not rush hot-foot into every dispute of an international character. Without doubt, the outlook of the nations of Europe is imperialistic. Unless they can reach a reasonable understanding between themselves with the object of pooling the economic resources of the world, or unless they experience a change of heart, numerous wars are likely to occur in the future. I have no desire to see Australia dragged into every dispute that occurs. If the League of Nations were functioning effectively- </para>

During this debate, honorable senators supporting the Government have repeated the parrot cry: &#34;Smash the Leagueand what is the alternative?&#34; They claim that world opinion is behind the League because 50 nations are opposed to Italy. But if France, Britain and Russia were taken from that number, the League would bo practically without strength. When the conflict is over, the world will again revert to the old system of maintaining a balance of power by grouping and alliances. War between Italy and Abyssinia could have been prevented hadthe League said to Italy when trouble first arose: &#34;You must not send a soldier to Abyssinia because you must not attack another member of the League.&#34; Right throughout the negotiations, France has been seeking to evade its responsibilities.. Soviet Russia is at present ranged with France and Britain in support of the League; but what would the position of the League be if Russia withdrew from the war, as it did from the Great War? </para>

Some honorable senators supporting the Government would make it appear that, because the Opposition is small, it has a weak case. That is not so. The Australian Labour party has advanced good reasons why this &#39;bill should not be passed, and future events will show that it has adopted the right attitude. As I have said, its stand on this issuehas the support of the majority of the people of Australia. </para>
