                    <para>This bill has its roots some distance back in the past. Its purpose is to approve an agreement which has been made between the Governments of the Commonwealth and the six States, relating in the main to soldier settlement loans. </para>
                    <para>The chief items of financial relief to the States concerning soldier settlement loans which are embodied in the agreement have already been given effect in accordance with announcements previously made to Parliament, but it was necessary to enter into a formal agreement, the completion of which has delayed the introduction of this measure. All the State parliaments have ratified the agreement and it remains only for this Parliament to do so. </para>
                    <para>The control and management of soldier land settlement was undertaken by the. States, but the Commonwealth contributed very substantially by way of financial assistance. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth also lent money to the States aggregating about £35,000,000. </para>
                    <para>In 1S25 an agreement was entered into between the governments to give effect to arrangements mutually arrived at. Under it the Commonwealth undertook to write off £5,000,000 of loans due by the States to the Commonwealth. This agreement was ratified by all States excepting New South "Wales and Victoria. Until' they had completed the agreement the Commonwealth was unable to ratify it, and consequently it did not become binding. </para>
                    <para>In 1927, requests were made by the States for further financial assistance from the Commonwealth. As a consequence, it was agreed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Pike of the New South Wales Land Valuation Court should be appointed to investigate the whole subject, with a view mainly to the allocation of financial responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Pike, after a very full investigation, recommended that the losses incurred should be shared equally by the Commonwealth and the States.  His  recommendation was accepted by all parties. So far as the Commonwealth was concerned, it involved the writing off of an additional amount of approximately £2,600,000 as from the 30th June, 1927. </para>
                    <para>The position was briefly reviewed in the budget speech of 1929-30. The announcement was then made that the Commonwealth had accepted the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Pike and would take action accordingly. </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>
                        Pike found that the total losses were approximately £24,000,000. Under his recommendation, the Commonwealth had to bear one-half of that sum. But towards this half previous assistance was taken into account. Shortly stated, the Commonwealth's share of half the losses has been found by -

                    <para>The balance of loans now due by the States to the Commonwealth, after allowing for the writing off of £7.600,000, is approximately £27,000,000. Clause 15 of the agreement provides that, from the 1st July, 1933, that sum shall be regarded as a debt owing by the States to the public, instead of as an advance owing by the States to the Commonwealth. It is a machinery clause to simplify inter-governmental accounting. As previously stated, effect has been given, in the accounts of the Commonwealth and the States, to the financial provisions of this agreement, in regard to the writing off of £5,000,000 from October, 1925, and of a further £2,600,000 from June, 1927, the action in both cases following upon announcements in Parliament. </para>
                    <para>In the financial agreement the totals of the debts of the States as at the 30th June, 1927, which were subsequently taken over by the Commonwealth, are set down specifically. As this new agreement affects those totals, it is necessary to amend the financial agreement. The amount of £5,000,000 to be written off from October, 1925, was deducted in computing the debts of the States for the purposes of the financial agreement. The further amount of £2,600,000 to be written off, was a subsequent development and was, of course, not deducted. A clause has accordingly been provided in the agreement, the effect of which is to reduce the net debt of the States at the 30th June, 1927, as set out in the financial agreement, by approximately £2,600,000. </para>
                    <para>In drafting the agreement opportunity was taken to make a small amendment of one of the clauses of the financial agreement relating to membership of the Australian Loan Council. The financial agreement provides for a loan council consisting " one Minister of State of the Commonwealth to be appointed in writing from time to time by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to represent the Commonwealth, and one Minister of State of each State to be appointed in writing from time to time by the Premier of that State to represent that State." In practice it has been found that in many cases the Prime Minister and the State Premiers were Treasurers in their respective spheres, and had to nominate themselves as members of the Loan Council. Some doubt was expressed as to whether a Prime Minister or a Premier could legally appoint himself as a representative at the council, and, consequently, in order to clarify the position, provision has beenmade in clause 18 of this agreement to amend the financial agreement, so that the Prime Minister and the Premiers of the States will be ex officio members of the council with the right to appoint substitute representatives. Apart from those two minor alterations, the agreement does not alter the financial agreement.. Nor does it in any way affect the administration of soldier land settlement. </para>

In a sense that is true; but the Senate is now asked to ratify an agreement which has been thoroughly considered by the representatives of both the Commonwealth and the States who subjected it to a more searching examination than is possible in this Parliament. I think that the Senate may safely accept the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- The bill contains a lengthy agreement, and as it has just been distributed to honorable senators we have had no opportunity to get a proper grip of its contents. This putting through of legislation in a blindfold manner leaves all honorable senators open to the criticism that they are ignorant of the measures they are supposed to deal with. As the bill has been on the stocks for so long, could it not be deferred a little longer? Why rush it through when honorable senators have not had an opportunity to study fully its contents? We have been informed by the Minister that experts have studied the agreement, but that fact does not relieve us of responsibility in dealing with it. I protest against this blindfold method of putting through legislation. By this measure we may be committing the Commonwealth or the States to the expenditure of millions of pounds. </para>

                        <para>. - Being familiar with the history of this agreement I point out to honorable senators that this measure will really clean up the position, as between the Commonwealth and the States, in accordance with the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Pike, who reported on the results of the unfortunate selection of certain lands for the settlement of returned soldiers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Pike's recommendations were, in part, specific and, in part, directed towards the ascertainment of certain amounts by the application of certain principles. Much water has flowed under the bridge since that report was made, but as a result of conferences between the treasury officials of the Commonwealth and the States, an agreement was arrived at. This agreement was drafted over two years ago by the law officers, and sent to the States for consideration. We have only recently received the completed agreement fully signed. We cannot vary this agreement; it has been settled as between representatives of the Commonwealth and the States, and the Prime Minister and the Premiers of all the States concerned have signed it. As the States have adjusted their accounts as between themselves and the Commonwealth on the lines of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Pike's report, there oan be little danger in acceding to the agreement. </para>

                    <para class="block">The bill includes items of expenditure other than on new works and buildings during the financial year ended the 30th June, 1934, which have been met under the authority of the vote for Treasurer's Advance. It should he borne in mind that parliamentary authority for this expenditure has been given by the appropriation in the Estimates in chief of a lump sum, under the designation of " Treasurer's Advance ". This provision enabled the Treasurer to make advances to the various departments to meet expenditure which could not be foreseen when the Estimates were presented and for which provision was obviously not included under the ordinary divisions of the Estimates. Details of the expenditure met in this way must be set out in Supplementary Estimates, and the items are now submitted to Parliament for a covering appropriation. </para>
                    <para>The vote for Treasurer's Advance for 1933-34 was £2,000,000. The total expenditure therefrom was £543,203, made up as follows: - Ordinary departmental expenditure and war services payable from revenue, £497,222; additions, new works and buildings, £45,981. </para>
                    <para>The amount of £497,222 is covered by this bill, and the new works expenditure of £45,981 will be submitted later for covering appropriation. There are no exceptionally heavy items of expenditure, and in most cases the additional expenditure was provided subject to corresponding savings on other votes. </para>
                    <para>Parliament has already been fully apprised of the expenditure now submitted for covering appropriation. Full details were furnished with the Estimates and budget-papers of the current year. In the Estimates, the actual amounts expended are set out alongside the votes for the previous year, and it can be seen at a glance whether the votes have been exceeded and what call there has been on the Treasurer's Advance. Details are also included in the Auditor-General's report and the Treasurer's financial statement. </para>
                    <para>Expenditure under Miscellaneous Ser- " vices is by far the largest item, amounting to £204,966. Most of this was expenditure which could not be foreseen, such as, for example, exchange on remittances to London, £16,053. Under War Service Homes, there is an item of £16,796 for the maintenance of homes and properties. This expenditure was occasioned owing to the unfortunate position of some of the occupants. Under the Department of Trade and ' Customs there is an amount of £20,000 to put growers of doradillo grapes in South Australia on a sound basis. All expenditure under this bill, I may add, has been examined by the Auditor-General's Department. </para>

                            <para>. - I direct the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Health to the serious inconvenience caused to passengers on overseas vessels upon arrival at Australian ports. The practice seems to be to require passengers to assemble on deck at about 6 a.m. to await the coming of the medical officers, whose business it is to make the inspection and give them clearance. On every occasion when I have arrived at Australian ports from New Zealand, New Guinea, or Great Britain, I have hoard complaints from passengers about the long delays and general lack of courtesy, especially at Fremantle. I ask the Minister to bring this matter under the notice of the Department of Health in order that a little more consideration may be shown to disembarking passengers. </para>

In elaboration of the observation I made last night, I wish on behalf of my colleagues and myself to say how much we have appreciated the candour and integrity which has characterized the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> in the discharge of his duties. Public business could not be carried on without a good understanding between those in charge of it and the members of the Opposition, and without reliance on the integrity of both parties. Public life will be a thing to be spurned and scorned if the day comes when we are unable to trust each other in that respect. While we on this side of the chamber have differed fundamentally in 'politics from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> I wish to acknowledge that on every occasion upon which he has given an undertaking to do a thing he has observed his undertaking to the letter, sometimes at great personal inconvenience. While in the whirligig of time changes must occur in the representation in this Parliament, my colleagues and I will feel a sense of personal loss, and moTe than a pang of regret, at our parting with those honorable senators who are in their place in this chamber for the last time to-day, at least for some years. I refer to certain honorable members on this side of the chamber who are retiring voluntarily, as well as to honorable gentlemen opposite with whom we have been associated for a number of years who are retiring by the will of the electors. To them all I can say, in the language of the Spaniard, "Adios" - God be with thee. More I cannot say. </para>

                        <para>.- I appreciate very much the kind sentiments which the Postmaster-General has just expressed. As Leader of the Opposition my job has been to oppose the Government. Usually the Government has been wrong, and I have never failed to point that out with all the eloquence at my command, and my colleagues have ably assisted me. Although at times the Opposition has been numerically weak, the Government has had reason to know that it consisted of game and stubborn fighters. Now the time has come for me to leave this gallant band, and to pass, temporarily, I hope, into the shades of political oblivion. The electors have so decided; we have always to bow to the will of the people, although I believe that at the last election they made an awful blunder, which, perhaps, they will correct in the near future. My long membership of this chamber has been uniformly pleasant. In political life one makes associations, the like of which I believe are impossible elsewhere. Men elected to this chamber are usually fighters having strong convictions which they strenuously advocate. Yet when the battle is over they bury the hatchet - but only till the following day when each man is again seeking the scalp of his political enemy. One effect of this constant warfare is to imbue us with respect for able and gallant foes. I shall take with me into retirement the happiest recollections of interesting experiences and valued friendships. It is said that "hope springs eternal in the human breast " ; I hope to return to the Senate some day, and should I do so, and should you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> still be in the chair, I shall again treat you with as much insolence as the Standing Orders and your good nature will permit. I shall sever my association with this chamber with the kindliest feelings towards all honorable senators. I believe I can say truthfully that I have not a single enemy here; certainly I myself bear no enmity towards any other honorable senator. </para>

At times I may have been regarded more or less as a ruffian and a Bolshevik. Partly because this chamber requires livening up occasionally, and partly because of the natural impatience of youth, one is led sometimes to overstep the bounds of strict decorum. Despite whatever little fighting I have been able to do during the six years I have been a member of this chamber, I shall leave it without any personal animosity towards any honorable senator, however vigorously he may have opposed me in debate or assailed the principles in which I believe. To the best of my. ability I have always endeavoured to express my honest sentiments; under no circumstances have I departed from the ideals which I hold dear. My defeat at the last election I accept with the philosophy with which I have been in the habit of taking every other adversity ; if some win, others must lose. I am in the habit of taking things as they come. This is not my first defeat, and, possibly, in the future, I shall be victorious again. I repeat, that I leave this chamber entertaining the kindliest feelings towards every honorable senator. </para>

I have known the honorable senator for many years, and long before I entered politics I formed an affection for him. Although we differ fundamentally on political principles, I have no doubt that, as an Australian and a man, it would be difficult to find his equal; it would certainly be impossible to find his superior. </para>

                    <para>SenatorJ. V. MacDONALD. (Queensland) [4.17].- On behalf of Senators Collings and Brown, who, with myself, will constitute the Opposition when the Senate re-assembles, I express regret at parting with some of our colleagues in the Labour party. We are also very sorry that the Senate is losing the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Lawson, Senator Reid,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott.</inline> Naturally, our greatest grief is because of the disaster which overwhelmed our own colleagues on this side of the chamber. As a result of their departure the strength of honorable senators on this side will be reduced from ten to three. Under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> we have had a fairly easy time in this chamber, and in losing him we are losing a great Australian. </para>
                    <para class="block">As a boy I spent some years in the Australian bush, and the old influences remained with me when I passed to other spheres in the city. Therefore I was agreeably surprised to find on my advent to this chamber a real Australian bushman in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> as my leader. Talking over our common experiences in the bush we spent many pleasant hours together. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> I hope that the parties represented by honorable senators on this side of the House are only suffering an eclipse, a temporary obscuration by another political planet, so far as their representation in the Senate is concerned, and that the retiring senators will soon be back with us again. I feel sure honorable senators opposite will endorse that sentiment, although, of course, they would not like to see twenty senators on this side, converting the present overwhelming majority into a substantial minority. I assure the retiring senators that my two colleagues and I, who will remain here after their departure will keep the flag flying. Of the work awaiting- to be done, I hope to be able to do my share. I have had a foretaste of the experience now awaiting three of us in that, about twelve years ago, for a period of three months I was the sole representative in this chamber . of the great Australian Labour Party. And so, although we shall be a party of only three, my position will be much happier than it was on the other occasion to which I have referred. Although we have had our little differences in the party room our relations have been harmonious, and I cannot express the regret I feel at what I trust is only thetemporary retirement of valued colleagues. </para>
                    <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon. P. J. Lynch)</inline> [4.20]. - It is customary, on the eve of our dispersal at Christmas, for honorable senators to express their respect for and goodwill towards each other. That such exchanges are no mere seasonal ebullition is proved by the cordiality of the sentiments that have been expressed this, afternoon when we are about to part with several honorable gentlemen with whom we have been associated in this chamber for many years. </para>
                    <para class="block">This cordiality and mutual respect between political opponents does credit to our national Parliament, and is a hopeful augury that the best traditions of public life will be maintained. </para>
                    <para>Reference has been made to those honorable senators who have fallen in the political battle. In politics, as in other kinds of warfare, there are victories and rewards; there are also casualties and defeats. But I hope that those honorable gentlemen, who have been for the time being, banished from this chamber, find solace in the thought that although their immediate path may be beset with difficulties, their defeat may be the beginning of a brighter future. On one occasion a gentleman, who, I thought, was a much better man than myself, but who was defeated by me at the polls, wrote to me that his defeat had been the best thing that had ever happened to him, because it had been the means of his obtaining a better position, where politics would trouble him no more. I hope that that will be the experience of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> and the other honorable senators who are leaving us. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> V. MacDonald stated, they are perhaps experiencing only a temporary political eclipse. Aristotle has said thatvery often sympathy is a mental impression of one's own destiny, but I assure these honorable senators that our sympathy for them is not based on any selfish fear that some day we may meet the same fate. We have learned to appreciate their corporate and individual character as representatives of the public. We cannot live long in the company of men without learning something of their inner character. I have learned to appreciate to the full the sterling qualities of those honorable gentlemen whom we may not meet again in this chamber for some years. They have lived up to the very highest standards of good citizenship. They have fought with all the powers at their command for those principles in which they believed, and for those things which they thought; would assist in making this country great. And yet when the heat of battle had passed they manifested one of the finest characteristics of the British stock - respect and goodwill for their political opponents. I am reminded of the old saying : " In essentials unity, in doubtful matters liberty, in all things charity." The cordial remarks that have been exchanged between political rivals this afternoon prove, if proof were necessary, that there is a charitable strain in the members of this chamber. </para>
                    <para>Officers of the House, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and the attendants have discharged their duties with characteristic loyalty and efficiency. They have done their work faithfully and well ; there has never been any need to exercise a stern supervision of them. All have been animated by the desire to render faithful service to the Parliament and the people of this country. In saying that, I am merely repeating a testimony that has been given on many previous occasions. </para>
                    <para>If I were to say anything good of myself, it would probably not be believed. But yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> made kind references to me, which I very much appreciate. Yet when he rose, I immediately feared that I had committed some error, for whenever a senator rises suddenly and asks: "Under what standing order do you give that ruling?" I know instinctively that he is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly. His</inline> knowledge and constant vigilance have been the direct means of compelling me to make a closer acquaintance with the Standing Orders than I otherwise would.  His  criticisms have been a blessing in disguise; so although he is leaving us, I hope that he will enter into the enjoyment " of fresh woods and pastures new." Let honorable senators make no mistake - I shall stand for the Presidency again ; and, if I am elected to the position, I hope that there will be somebody in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly's</inline> place who will have the same deep knowledge of the Standing Orders as he has, and the same propensity for ensuring that the  President  also keeps his acquaintance with them up to date. </para>
