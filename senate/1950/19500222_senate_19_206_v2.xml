      <para>HIS EXCELLENCY was pleased to deliver the following speech: - </para>
      <quote>
        <para>Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Representatives : </para>
      </quote>
      <para>You have been called together to deliberate upon matters of importance to the well-being of the Commonwealth. </para>
      <para>When last I addressed you, I indicated that  His  Majesty, accompanied by  Her  Majesty and the Princess Margaret, would visit Australia in 1949. Unhappily, this did not prove possible,  His  Majesty being stricken by an illness which rendered necessary prolonged rest and treatment. </para>
      <para>This misfortune evoked widespread expressions of concern and sympathy. More than this, it served as a reminder to all of us that the King is not only a symbol of our British association but also a sincerely respected and deeply loved leader of our people. </para>
      <para>My Government had hoped that, with a gratifying recovery in His Majesty&#39;s health, the Royal visit might have been arranged for 1951, the year of the Jubilee of the foundation of the Commonwealth of Australia. Unfortunately, for weighty reasons which have already been made public, this has not proved possible. We are all, however, confidently hoping that Their Majesties will be able to visit us in 1952. They may be assured of a loving welcome from our loyal and British community. </para>
      <para>The foreign affairs policy of my Government will be the subject of an early statement to Parliament by the Minister for External Affairs. It is also proposed to establish a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs to give opportunities for full study and to serve as a source of information to Parliament. </para>
      <para>The strategic distribution of the manpower and material resources of the  &#34;British Commonwealth, and the intensive development of Australia as a vital area in the Pacific, are of cardinal importance to the future of the British Commonwealth and Australia. My Government&#39;s policies for defence, immigration and development are designed to contribute in the most effective manner to the achievement of these objectives. </para>
      <para>My advisers base their defence policy on the acceptance by Australia of ite full share in co-ordinated British Empire schemes of defence, and on the closest co-operation with the United States of America. </para>
      <para>Active steps are being taken to improve the efficiency of the Navy. Training of officers and men of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve was resumed on 1st January after having been suspended during the war. My advisers are planning ite progressive strengthening over the next three years. Besides training ashore, every reservist will do an annual period of sea training if facilities can be provided. </para>
      <para>My Government is concerned about the man-power position of the services, particularly in the military forces. It .is considered that steps must be taken to fill all peace-time units and formations and to build up adequate reserves. While the Australian Regular Army will be kept at full strength by voluntary enlistment, my advisers are making preliminary preparations for the introduction of a sensible system of universal training designed to meet the military requirements of Australia with the minimum of interference with our urgent civil production. </para>
      <para>It is my Government&#39;s intention to develop the strength of the Royal Australian Air Force to an extent more consistent with the defence needs of Australia. Public interest will be stimulated by plans to build up the Citizen Air Force, the Reserve, and the Air Training Corps, and the re-introduction of a </para>
      <para class="block">Women&#39;s Auxiliary Air Force in certain suitable occupations. </para>
      <para>To give effect to a policy of industrial preparedness for defence against aggression, my Government will aim at the progressive filling of industrial gaps and the establishment of the most modern techniques and equipment in industry and in government factories, where required for direct defence needs. The long range weapons project is regarded as  of  the greatest importance, and this joint undertaking with the United Kingdom Government will continue to receive a high priority. </para>
      <para>In view of the urgent need to develop Australia&#39;s vast resources and to arrest the movement of rural population to the cities my Government will create a Ministry of National Development. <inline font-weight="bold">Major programmes</inline> of national expansion will be fostered by this Ministry in close and friendly co-operation with the States, and through them with local and regional authorities. </para>
      <para>In all developmental plans my advisers will pay attention to the importance  of  achieving a well-balanced pattern  of  decentralization. Capital expenditure, both public and private, will be required on a scale very much greater than in the past. My Government has under preparation a great loan scheme for this purpose. This scheme will not interfere with the carrying out of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme, to which my advisers attach great importance, and in the carrying out  of  which they hope to secure the statutory and administrative co-operation of the States concerned. </para>
      <para>My advisers are also giving attention to the much needed increasing of our supplies of basic materials such as coal, steel, and building materials. Among other things now being actively investigated are the development of mechanization, improved methods of coal extraction  generally, and the encouragement of high output and stable employment, with a programme of importation pending the achievement of the necessary volume of local production. </para>
      <para>In view of the importance of expanding and facilitating industrial development, Commonwealth legislation relating to patents and trade marks will be reviewed and brought up to date. </para>
      <para>My Government proposes to bring in a bill to provide for an alteration to the Constitution. The object of the bill will be to ensure that, in future, no measure giving to the Government or its instrumentalities, to the exclusion of others, monopolistic rights to engage in commerce or industry can become law unless it has first been submitted to and approved by the people at a referendum. </para>
      <para>My advisers intend taking strong measures to protect the community against the activities of subversive organizations and individuals, and in particular they have in mind the Communist party and its members. A bill will be introduced early in the Parliament to deal with this matter. </para>
      <para>Australia&#39;s external financial position is strong. &#34;With the continuance of good seasons and high prices our export income has reached record levels. As a result, substantial sterling balances have been built up in London, and, as overseas availability improves, these balances will be useful for the financing of imports essential to our developmental programme. </para>
      <para>However, like most countries outside North America, Australia is suffering from a shortage of dollars. My Government is making a thorough review of Australia&#39;s dollar problem and is exploring vigorously all measures which may stimulate production, encourage exports to the dollar area, and so increase the supply of dollars available. My advisers are convinced that, whilst a policy of import restrictions on goods from dollar areas is necessary in present circumstances, the major effort should be directed towards increasing the dollar earnings of Australia and the rest of the sterling area. My Government realizes that Australia&#39;s dollar position cannot be fully considered in isolation from the position of other members of the sterling area and is satisfied that concerted efforts are required on the part of all members of the sterling area if a solution of this difficult problem is to be found. </para>
      <para>Because they felt that restrictions upon our capacity to produce and sell goods and to receive and absorb profitably substantial numbers of migrants were most undesirable, my advisers recently announced  the termination of petrol rationing. </para>
      <para>My Government views with grave concern the increase which has been taking place in recent years in the cost of living. It is realized that the solution of this problem is not easy and calls for the closest co-operation not only as between Commonwealth and State Governments but also between all sections of the community. An intensive review is at present being made by my Government of the causes of present price trends with a view to determining the most effective measures which can be taken to remedy the current inflationary situation. </para>
      <para>My Government will introduce legislation to repeal the Banking Act 1947 and to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945-1948. The amendments to the Commonwealth Bank Act will provide for the establishment under the control of the Parliament of a board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank of which the Governor of the bank will be the  chairman.  It will also be provided that any policy issues which are the subject of disagreement between the Government and the Bant Board shall be referred to Parliament. </para>
      <para>An important task being undertaken by n-.y Government is a comprehensive review of the taxation laws of the Commonwealth. My advisers believe there is a pressing need, not only for reducing the burden of taxation but also for simplification of the various taxing acts, and an expert committee has been appointed to examine and report upon the issues involved. </para>
      <para>Action is also being taken to review the sales tax law with the object of determining to what extent relief may be granted in that respect. The desirability of providing exemption for goods which affect the cost of living and the value of the pound will receive earnest consideration. </para>
      <para>My Government&#39;s policy on civil aviation will be progressive and constructive. Without creating public or private monopoly the aim is to develop internal end external air routes, so that the widest number of communities may enjoy the advantage of regular air services. Plying doctors will be further aided in their humanitarian work, and aero and gliding clubs receive greater encouragement in their activities. </para>
      <para>Immediately upon assumption of office, my Government gave consideration to the many requests which had been received from ex-service men&#39;s and women&#39;s organizations for a review of pensions and allowances. Such a review is now being made by a Cabinet sub-committee, all Ministers of which are  ex-servicemen,  and it is the intention to introduce appropriate amendments to the relevant act as early as possible in the present session. </para>
      <para>My Government is proceeding with the creation of an independent cost-finding tribunal for our primary industries. Where it is necessary to guarantee prices to producers or to enable negotiations of prices for overseas contracts, this tribunal will determine not only the found cost of production but will provide for a reasonable profit margin for efficient production. Pending the setting up of this tribunal and to avoid any unnecessary delays in the announcement of Government policy, arrangements have been made for cost surveys to be continued. </para>
      <para>Discussions are continuing in London between representatives of the United Kingdom, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia for a post joint organization marketing scheme for wool. My advisers will examine proposals emanating from these discussions and will confer with Australian wool-growers&#39; organizations and other interests before  determin-ing  policy in regard to the future marketing of this important primary product. </para>
      <para>Legislation will be introduced early in the session to provide endowment of 5s. per week for the first or only child, under sixteen years of age, in every family. </para>
      <para>My Government realizes that the increase in the cost of living is accentuating the difficulties with which age and widow pensioners in particular have to contend. My advisers realize, also, that the present system, under which various benefits are paid subject to a means test, gives rise to problems of which there is no easy solution. My Government, however, is closely investigating the most pressing anomalies to see what can be done to remove them. It believes, moreover, that the application of its financial and economic policy will result in improvement in the purchasing power of the currency, so that pensioners, as well as other fixed income groups, will benefit. </para>
      <para>Of vital importance to the general wellbeing of the people is the question of industrial relations between employer and employee. My Government is convinced that a rapid development of the </para>
      <para class="block">Commonwealth depends largely on higher levels of production and, with them, higher standards of living, on freedom from industrial disturbances, and on the fullest co-operation of both sides of industry. The Government&#39;s responsibility will be to create, not only an atmosphere for the friendly and co-operative enterprise of management and labour, but to continue and develop the research and investigations being made into methods of improving the working environment and problems of human relations in industry. </para>
      <para>My advisers intend to review the existing machinery for conciliation and arbitration in the light of its operations since the amending act of 1947. An investigation is also being made of measures that might be taken to restore to union members the opportunity to express their views, by democratic methods, in relation to the election of officers and threatened or actual disputes. Steps have been taken to centre in the Department of Labour and National Service responsibility for industrial relations in all their aspects. </para>
      <para>My Government is firmly resolved to follow a policy of immigration on a large scale in the years ahead. It will do so with the conviction that immigration is vital to the security and development of Australia. Much has already been done since the end of the war to lay the foundations of a sound and successful immigration policy. </para>
      <para>Immigration has already made a substantial contribution to increasing production in Australia, particularly in the all-important basic industries. Some of the most marked effects can be seen in the production of building materials, including timber, bricks and cement, and in the output of iron and steel. </para>
      <para>Many utilities and services which were previously in great need of additional labour are now able to operate more satisfactorily as a result of the placement of migrants. These include hospitals and welfare institutions, transport services and the great development projects.While rural industries have also been aided, it is planned that a bigger proportion of migrant labour, in the future, will be attracted to the land. </para>
      <para>My Government attaches special importance to two major objectives in its immigration policy - first, the maintenance  over  a long period of the total rate of intake at the highest practicable level, and second, to ensuring a high proportion of British migrants in order to retain the fundamental British balance of Australia&#39;s population. </para>
      <para>On the first point, it is my Government&#39;s confident expectation that Australia will receive a total of 200,000 new settlers in 1950 and that thereafter the intake will be maintained at about that level. If this figure can be achieved consistently over a number of years, the Australian population will have increased from its present 8,000,000 to more than 10,500,000 in i960. </para>
      <para>Administration will be so carried out os to avoid as far as possible the aggregation of alien migrants into groups or colonies. It is believed that a proper distribution of such migrants will accelerate their assimilation into our community and will make it easier for them to accommodate themselves to Australian industrial and social standards. My advisers attach great importance to this matter, because they feel that new arrivals should be encouraged to regard themselves as Australians in the full sense and to realize that our community \? delighted to receive them as fellowcitizens. </para>
      <para>In this vital task of immigration, my advisers will work in the closest  collabora-tion  with State and overseas governments, all sections of industry, the trade unions, voluntary organizations and persons of goodwill throughout the community. </para>
      <para>The crisis of the war and our subsequent growth have enormously expanded our secondary industries. My advisers believe that there must be a thorough review of departmental methods of dealing with the trade problems which developed out of emergency conditions. </para>
      <para>It is the intention of my Government to have particular regard to the reports of the Tariff Board in the grant of protective tariffs and in relation to the methods of assistance involving the expenditure of Commonwealth funds. </para>
      <para>Due regard will be paid to the defence significance of new industries which became established during these years. Australia&#39;s responsibilities in relation to the international trade organization and other international commercial organizations will be closely examined and reviewed. </para>
      <para>Whilst ever mindful of the importance and necessity of encouraging our secondary industries, my Government will take steps to facilitate and accelerate the importation of commodities not now available here and which are essential to the construction of homes. </para>
      <para>My Government will take all possible steps to stimulate the building of homes, including, as a temporary measure, cooperation with the State governments in the large-scale importation of prefabricated houses, as a means of meeting the present serious gap between supply and demand. </para>
      <para>Consequent upon a recent decision of the High Court that the War Service Land Settlement Agreements Act 1945 and the 1945 agreement on this matter between the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales are invalid, the means of providing for the restoration of the scheme on a proper legal basis are being pursued. In the meantime there need be no apprehension concerning the scheme generally. Moneys already made available by the Commonwealth for the purpose of war service land settlement will be utilized for expenditure of the same general character as provided in the 1945 Agreement. </para>
      <para>A vigorous policy designed to develop the resources of the&#62; Northern Territory will be put into operation. Particular attention will be given transport, pastoral development for increased meat production, mining and possible agricultural settlement. Basic research into land,, water, mineral, marine and timber resources will be continued. The Darwin, town plan will be reviewed in the interests-&#39; of greater efficiency and economy. My Government will press on with th&#171;! development of Canberra to the limit of the resources available. </para>
      <para>My Government proposes to confer with State Premiers and Ministers for Health in order to bring into being an effective programme in relation to health, medicine and medical research to ensure steady improvements in the standards of medical treatment and progressive provision of modern facilities for the prevention and diagnosis of disease. </para>
      <para>My advisers consider that although people are often able to deal with minor illnesses families find real difficulty in meeting heavy, unexpected hospital and medical expenses of severe or longcontinued illness. The policy to be followed will aim to bring the cost of modern and improved medical, surgical, obstetrical and hospital treatment within the means of the general .public. It is further proposed to provide specific life-saving and disease-preventing drugs, and certain drugs for chronic diseases, free of charge to the public on presentation of a doctor&#39;s prescription. Legislation on these matters will be presented to Parliament. </para>
      <para>My Government intends to push ahead without delay in the development of postal and telecommunication services in both urban and rural areas in order to give the public greater and improved facilities. The value of television in both entertainment and educational spheres is fully realized and my advisers will see that a system suited to Australian conditions is introduced as quickly as possible. </para>
      <para>In the earnest hope that Divine Providence may guide your deliberations and further the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth, I now leave you to the discharge of your high and important duties. </para>
