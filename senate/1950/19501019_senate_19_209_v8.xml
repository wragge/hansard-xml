                        <para>- Many results may follow the delay in putting theComniunist Party Dissolution Bill into effect. One definite result is that the Australian Labour party, by its opposition to the bill, has afforded the Communist party a six months' amnesty within which it has been able to do all manner of things to protect itself from the possible application of the legislation. As to the balance of the honorable senator's question, it deals with a purely hypothetical case, and I am not in a position to answer it. </para>

                        <para>- I have not read the article to which the honorable senator has referred regarding the reversal of the procedure of British justice. However, if the Labour party really believed that there was a fundamental attack on British and natural justice, one would have thought that the members of that party in this chamber would not sit idly by and allow the measure to go through on the voices. There was a time when the Labour party fought for its principles, and did not lie down on them. </para>

                        <para>- The "galahs" on the Government side of the chamber may laugh and interject, but there is not one atom of truth in the report, I have never questioned the right of the press to criticize me, or to place any interpretation or slant on statements that I make in this chamber or anywhere else, but I strongly object to the lying report published in to-day's <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times,</inline> the object of which apparently is to convey to the public the impression that there is dissension among members of the Opposition in the Senate. I do not ask for drastic action against the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on this occasion, but I suggest that steps be taken to ensure that there shall be no repetition of the offence against either Opposition or Government senators. Apparently, the reporter made a mistake yesterday. I have observed that no other newspaper published a similar report. The only occasion on which I spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> yesterday was when I asked him to rem'ain in the chamber while I absented myself for a little while. I defy any honorable senator to say that any other conversation took place between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> and myself. I ask that action be taken to ensure that there shall be no repetition of misrepresentation of this sort. </para>

                    <para>- I sat in this chamber throughout the day yesterday, and I did not hear the statement purported to have been made by the Leader of the Opposition. In the past, action has been taken against newspapers which have been guilty of misrepresentation and their reporters have been denied access to this chamber. Although on this occasion I do not propose to follow that course, I shall look into the matter further. I hope that the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> will do the right thing and apologize for the report, which the Leader of the Opposition has characterized as being completely untrue. </para>

                            <para>- There has been no objection, but the honorable senator now" draws my attention to the matter. The  Clerk  has pointed out to me that the rules governing the asking of questions are not embodied in the Standing Orders. They are printed on the back of the form upon which questions on notice are written, and they are not, strictly speaking, part of the Standing Orders. It is left to the discretion of .the  President  to allow a question or not. If it is desired, the Standing Orders committee can be called together to deal with the matter. I am offering .this explanation because I heard an aside by a Minister that a certain question was not in order. </para>

I find the lighting in this chamber to be very trying, and it must be exceedingly trying for the unfortunate officials who must be present here all the time that the Senate is sitting. It is too glaring. Will you consult with the appropriate authority to ascertain whether fluorescent or some other form of lighting can be installed? We are trying to do a good -job, and it is only fitting that our eyesight should be protected in the process. The lighting is affecting my eyes and causing me frequent headaches. </para>

                        <para>- This matter has been brought to my notice by Senator Aylett on two or three occasions. Owing to the bad lighting in the chamber, I made a mistake recently in calling on a question upon notice. I have noticed of late that some honorable senators have lost their usual calm. I am informed by doctors that if a man's eyesight is affected, his temper is often affected too. If we can have a lighting system that will provide a good soft light, it may affect the emotions of some honorable senators and result in calmer debates. The lighting in the chamber is not good. It certainly is not satisfactory to Senator Aylett. I know that if the lights are too powerful and the glare too great, the eyesight of the  Clerk  is affected. Complaints having been made by several honorable senators, I think steps should be taken to improve the lighting. Some time ago I discussed with the engineers the  question of installing fluorescent lighting, and I shall go into that matter again. </para>

                        <para>- There is no provision in the budget for an increase of the rate of unemployment and sickness benefits. I point out that the number of persons in receipt of unemployment benefits is not great. Primarily sickness benefits are provided for persons suffering from temporary sickness; if they become permanently ill they are entitled to invalid pensions. The view was taken that the available money should be applied to the relief of persons who are most in need. For that reason age, invalid and widows' pensions have received priority. </para>

                            <para>- When asking a question of the Minister for Social Ser.vies yesterday in relation to the Melville Rehabilitation Centre in Western Australia, I spoke in terms of high commendation of the excellent work that is being done there. I did not criticize that institution, as the Minister's answer implied. As the third stage of the project has not been constructed, and work of the centre is being hampered, will the Minister assure the Senate that the £13,000 that is required to complete the centre and which has been withheld for some time, will be made available for that purpose at an early date? </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware that the Melville rehabilitation centre is being handicapped by not being extended. I have not received any reports to that effect. On the contrary, the reports that I have received indicate that the centre, as at present constituted, is doing an effective job. I do not really need to make inquiries about the matter at this stage. If the work of the centre develops and there is justification for the expenditure of the amount of money that has been mentioned, I shall certainly do my best to see that it is made available for extensions. I point out that strong demands have been made for extensions and additions to other establishments doing similar work. I am keeping in close contact with the position, and if the Western Australian activities develop to an extent that warrants development of the Melville Rehabilitation Centre, I shall be glad to see that that is done. </para>

To offset these delays the department concentrated specially for a few weeks on work associated with the provision of new telephone subscribers services. The honorable senator may rest assured that everything possible is being done by the Postal Department to meet the great demand for new telephone services and that the working of overtime will be resorted to from time to time for urgent purposes subject to the availability of materials and building accommodation.

                        <para>. - When the debate was interrupted in accordance with the sessional order last night I was developing the argument that during the last 25 years the political parties which now form the Government of this country had been sordidly dishonest in their approach to the menace of communism in this country. The leaders of the anti-Labour parties, whether in office or out of office made a political bogey of the subject of communism. During general election campaigns they endeavoured to hoodwink the people into believing that some connexion existed between the Communist party and the Australian Labour party and that if they were returned to office they would deal with the Communists ; but when they were in office they failed to live up to their threats. Indeed, they collaborated with well known Communists and other disrupters in this community. Some honorable senators will remember the "slush fund " that was established by theFadden Government from which large sums of money were paid to the Communist leaders of certain unions and other disrupters of industry. "While that dishonest liaison with the Communists continued the leaders of the anti-Labour parties said on political platforms throughout this country that they would deal with the Communists. When the Chifley Government was in office two members of the present Government were discovered drinking with prominent Communists in the liquor bar of this House. Those Communists were enjoying privileges that are strictly reserved for members of the Parliament, at a time when the Labour Government was engaged in a life and death struggle with the striking coal miners. Although a complaint was made about the presence of the Communists in the liquor bar, no action was taken against the members concerned. We have been accused of having changed face over this bill. What has been the attitude of the Liberal and Australian Country parties to the Communists throughout the years? On the 27th July, 1946, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> published a statement issued .by the Liberal party stating that that party did not believe in declaring the Communist party illegal or in suppressing it by law. The Liberal party said that the Communists would thrive underground and that if they engaged in subversive activities they would be dealt with as. other subversive elements were dealt with. </para>

                            <para>- The anti-Labour parties have never been able to agree on a common policy in relation to communism or anything else. During the war they were completely unable to agree on matters of policy. More recently they have had differences of opinion over the desirability of revaluing the pound. The Australian Country party invariably disclaims any responsibility for what the Liberal party does. That is the history of .all coalition governments. One party blames the other for every difficulty that arises. </para>

                            <para>- When this measure was first introduced into the Parliament the Government took extraordinary measures to prevent unauthorized entry into this building. Armed guards and policemen were stationed at many points throughout this building and members and supporters of the Government reserved all the accommodation in the public galleries for their own friends. When the first Communist Party Dissolution Bill was introduced the Prime Minister announced that it would not be amended in any way. He said that the fight was on and that it would not bo amended by even so much as the dotting of an " i " or the crossing of a " t ", but it is now apparent he did not intend to proceed with it if he could avoid doing so. Clause 20 of that bill when it was first introduced - and it was read with great gusto and very fine language by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> - reads -  </para>

                    <para class="block">That obnoxious clause permitted action to be taken similar to the type of action which could be taken when Nazi-ism was at its highest peak in Germany. It meant that a man could break open a door, enter premises and search the occupants without any warrant or authority, because the Attorney-General had no responsibility in regard to the issuing of warrants. I suggest to honorable senators that that provision would have been a total abrogation of British law and that it was  probably  one of the worst provisions ever- introduced in legislation by any administration in any country. I believe that that clause was inserted because certain members of the Government, evincing that political dishonesty which they have displayed all along the line, knew very well that no member of the Australian Labour party would stand for it. The members of the Government hoped that the Labour party would cast out this legislation and that they would then be able to go to the people and scream to high heaven about what they would like to do, when in reality they had no such intention. </para>
                    <para>Throughout this debate members of the Australian Labour party have been accused of delaying the passage of the bill and of protecting communism, and numerous other innuendoes and slurs have been bandied about. The members of the Opposition have no desire to protect any subversive person in this country. As proof of that statement, I point out that when the Australian Labour party was in office it took action against such persons. But it acted in accordance with the principles of British justice. It took them before juries and had them convicted under existing laws. This Government has been remiss, weak, ineffective and cowardly in not invoking the same laws in order to deal with a situation which it has alleged has been in existence for so long. This bill has no parallel in the history of British legislation. The members of the Government may argue legal points concerning criminal, moral and natural law, but there has never yet been a law of this country under which a person may be politically declared. Under this bill a man may be judged, tried, branded by a political party and given no recourse to law or justice. The members of the Government say that if such a man enters the witness box the Government will then prove the case, but that is not so, because there is no charge. He is already adjudged guilty, and he is convicted. </para>

                            <para>- I say that he is. He is removed from his job, and up to the time when he is declared by a notice appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette,</inline> bc is given no chance to present any evidence on his own behalf. He is accused by a person unknown to him, his declaration is determined by a political junta which reports to the Governor-General that he must be declared. Although the man has been given no opportunity to defend himself, and no. charge has been made against him, he is declared. If he is in a position to finance an appeal, as many Communists no doubt will be, he may do so, but if he happens to be a citizen who, by virtue of his position, has been honestly fighting a cause bearing no relation to communism, he is in a very unfavorable position indeed. The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner),</inline> speaking last night in a much more realistic manner than his colleagues, said quite frankly that the Australian Council of Trades Unions and the Sydney Trades and Labour Council would never be declared.  His  statement was concurred in by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer)</inline> and by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan).</inline> But is the Government going to dispense with the law in certain cases? If those bodies are Communist dominated, then the Government has no right to apply the law to one set of organizations and not to another, <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> am sincerely concerned about the way in which this legislation will be administered. </para>

                    <para>I warn the Government that it has taken ;i dangerous and an ill-considered step which will lead to something quite foreign to British decency. I also warn it that if it enacts legislation with the idea of being able to penalize some people and to excuse others, it will find itself up against the Australian Labour party and the trade unions. How can the Prime Minister honestly say that he is not concerned with the fact that the law will be used to penalize some people and to excuse others when all have been guilty of the same offence? What manner of law is it which a political party may enforce against an individual so that up to the time he is convicted, branded and removed from his position, he has had no recourse to justice? I consider the whole of this legislation repugnant and badly drafted. It is the product of sordid political hypocrisy and dishonesty, and I use the word " sordid " in its dictionary meaning of " mean and squalid ". I am sure that any decent member of the Government must be of the same opinion. The Government parties have brought before the Parliament legislation which represents nothing more than an attempt to evade a responsibility which they have acknowledged for 25 years. They have neither strengthened the existing laws nor provided themselves with sufficient intestinal fortitude to meet the problem of communism in clean open combat, an action which would be admired by any section of the Australian people. </para>

                            <para>- There is no need to speak about that. If the Australian Labour party brought into the world a child such as this, it would not ask some one else to strangle it. The bill is the creation of the Government parties and their moral outlook is incorporated in it. They claim that they have a mandate for it. If that be so, they should stand up and be proud of it, but, instead, in order to conceal the fact that their morale is low, they say to the Labour  party,  "In decency, save us from it". The Labour party will try to save the people that the Government will attack unjustly. Let there be no mistake about that. If acting under the terms of this measure, the Government lays a finger, unjustly, upon any person in this community, we stall fight on his behalf. The Government, having its bill, will have to stand by it. </para>

                    <para>For 25 years the members of the present Government parties have lied cravenly at every election and bracketed together the Communist party and the Labour party. They have also done so in the cou'rse of the debate on this bill. I heard one of them say, "We stand behind the people in this country". That is where they stand now - behind them - but when this bill has been passed they will come to the front. Then they will have to fight those people, and in the event of an innocent person being made to suffer they will have to fight us with them. They will have to explain to the people why they conceived a measure that, in its original form, not only abrogated the British rule of law but also sought to introduce into this country a vicious system of brute force. It was proposed that, regardless of the human dignity of Australian citizens, security officers should be permitted to break into Australian homes, without a warrant, and confiscate property without authority from a judicial tribunal or the Attorney-General. If honorable senators opposite believed that to be right then, doubtless, they still believe it to be right. </para>
                    <para>We believe that all that we have said about this bill is correct. We do not believe the Australian people will stand for it. We believe that, in its original form, it would not have been upheld by the High Court. The Government will soon be required to administer the measure, and then we shall see whether it will act in accordance with the statements that have been made in the Parliament by its supporters, which reveal a craven attitude. Some people have been told that they will be exempted from proceedings under the measure, and others have been told that action will be taken against them. In the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> read a list of names of persons with whom he said he proposed to deal as soon as the bill was passed, but within a week many of those persons had established their innocence. Is the right honorable gentleman still of the same mind? We shall soon learn the real intentions that underly  this sordid and dishonest measure, which the Government had no intention to implement in the form  in which it was originally presented to the Parliament. The introduction of the measure was a device to force the Labour party to make a political decision before it had ascertained the concensus of opinion of all party members, to distract attention from a broken promise to arrest the prices spiral and put value back in the £1, and to conceal the facts that the Government was evading its responsibility to age and invalid pensioners by allowing them to starve while prices increased and repudiating an agreement in relation to health and social services which it said would not be repudiated. The Government hoped, by its ruse in introducing the measure, to be able to fight a general election on an issue dishonestly raised in order to conceal its inability to solve the  difficult problems that confront this country. The moral calibre of the minds that conceived the measure  is  not great. After 25 years of trickery, the Government parties have a mandate to do something in relation to this matter, but they have produced something of which they cannot be very proud and of which, I am sure, Australia will ultimately be ashamed. </para>

                        <para>. - I should have preferred this debate to terminate, because the bill has already been fully discussed and it appears that the views of the Government and of the Opposition are irreconcilable. Therefore, no good purpose can be achieved by continuing the debate at length. However, I desire that my support of the measure should be recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> During the last two days we have wit nessed in this chamber the greatest climbdown of a great political party in the history of the National Parliament. It must be extremely humiliating for honorable senators opposite who have consistently opposed certain provisions of this bill to have to accept the decision of the federal executive of the Australian Labour party. I have never before heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> to such disadvantage. To put it mildly, his speech was pathetic. So also were the speeches of other members of the Opposition - pathetic in the extreme. I do not think that the statements of honorable senators opposite that they intend to vote for the bill in order to prove the Government's sincerity, because it is our baby, is a valid excuse, particularly when the uncompromising attitude of leading members of the Opposition from the beginning of the debate is recalled. Although honorable senators opposite have repeatedly asserted that this bill would undermine the fundamental principles of British justice, they now come cravenly into the chamber and say that they will support it. </para>

                            <para>- It is reasonable to assume that those honorable senators will derive a certain amount of satisfaction from the fact that the Australian Labour party has decided to fall into line with the Government. Another section of the Labour Opposition has treated the matter in a light-hearted fashion, because the honorable senators comprising that section were most apprehensive about a double dissolution. They realized that in such an event they were for the " high-jump ", and that their political careers would probably be at an end. </para>

                            <para>- It would be virtually impossible for some members of the Australian Labour party to be returned following a double dissolution, in view of the operation of the system of proportional representation. Honorable senators opposite in still another section, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morrow,</inline> have stated that they will not support the bill. 1 do not know how they will avoid their obligations to the party that they support. I suppose that they will conveniently leave the chamber before the vote is taken. I am concerned that this bill shall become law. </para>

                            <para>- In a speech in Adelaide recently, Dominie Paul McGuire, an Australian author, clearly outlined the extent to which communism has developed throughout the world in recent years. He specifically detailed Communist ambitions in Australia. By its support of the recitals in the preamble to this bill, the Australian Labour party has acknowledged that communism constitutes a menace to this country. In accordance with its pre-election pledge, the Government is determined to take steps to subjugate and, if possible, eliminate that menace to our land. The Communists in Australia constitute a fifth column of very dangerous proportions. </para>

                    <para class="block">In his policy speech, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> aptly described the Communist menace in this country as " an alien and destructive pest ". As has been stated already by other supporters of the Government, I consider that this bill is necessary in the interests of industrial harmony. The Communist party is not concerned primarily with the welfare of the workers in this country. It has never been concerned with the welfare of Australia as a nation. It follows a plan directed from Moscow in accordance with the Marx-Lenin-Stalin precept. I propose to quote a short extract from the book <inline font-style="italic">The Trade Unions,</inline> written by a very prominent Communist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> L. Sharkey. Honorable senators will be familiar with his name. He wrote - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Political strikes are a higher class of struggle than economic strikes. Such strikes challenge the government, the State, the rule of the capitalist class. One of our chief trade union tasks is the  politicalisation  of strikes. Strikes properly led and properly timed are a revolutionary weapon. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">We realize that the infiltration of key trade unions by Communists has been going on for just that purpose, and this bill is designed to remove them from office. Surely honorable senators recognize that events connected with the coal strike of last year prove the truth of what Sharkey wrote in his book. Working conditions and pay, on the admission of the Chifley Government, did not come into the picture. The proposed strike in 55 Australian ports as a protest against the Government's proposals has nothing whatever to do with industrial conditions. It would be a political strike, and an indication of the influence wielded by the Communist officials who occupy key positions in trade unions. Nearly all the big strikes that have occurred in Australia have been inspired by Communists, as is evident when we remember who handled those strikes - such men as Brown, of the Victorian Railways Union, an admitted Communist, Williams, of the miners' federation, Healy and Roach of the Waterside Workers Federation, and many others. Such men are not concerned with improving conditions for the workers and the Government has told the people that it will eradicate the Communists from the positions in which they have been able to wield so much power. </para>
                    <para>So much for the recitals in the bill. There is no need for me to discuss the clauses in detail, because many of them have been approved by the Labour party. It is necessary, however, to reply to some of the statements made by members of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> said that a declared person would not know the nature of the charge he had to face. That is not true. If a man is declared, he will know that he is charged with being a Communist, or with engaging, or being likely to engage, in subversive activities. The arguments of members of the Opposition on the subject of the right of appeal do not bear close examination. Some honorable senators opposite have claimed that there is no provision in the bill to give a person the right of appeal against a declaration that he is engaged, or is likely to engage, in activities prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        (South Australia) [12.22 j. - I rise to make my criticism of the bill and to justify the Opposition's attitude to it. I -was rather surprised at  the Government's attempt to stifle further criticism of the bill by moving, through

                        for the closure of the debate. That action was particularly surprising in view of the fact that yesterday, when the proceedings of this chamber were being broadcast, we had the unusual spectacle of several Ministers rising to support a measure that had' been introduced by one of their colleagues. If that is to be carried to its logical conclusion, there still remains one Minister to express his views on the bill. In view of the barrage of criticism by honorable senators opposite of the Opposition's decision to withdraw its objection to the passage of this measure, I wish to justify my position as a representative of the people of South Australia. The various sections of the Labour party in South Australia have consistently opposed the contentious clauses of this measure, including the onus of proof clause. The trade union movement and the Australian Labour party in that State have not deviated one iota from their stand on those clauses. That was made manifest as recently as Monday last, when, at the meeting of the federal executive of the Australian Labour party, the South Australian representatives strenuously resisted any departure from the party's earlier stand against the bill. As a Labour representative of the people of South Australia I place on record my unqualified support of that attitude. The withdrawal of Labour's opposition to this measure has been widely publicized in the press throughout the Commonwealth. The event has become quite a big feature of the current political news, so much so, in fact, that one wonders why the Opposition should be so severely criticized by Government supporters for having decided to permit the passage of the measure. According to the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline>
                        Labour has made the most abject surrender in the history of the once great Australian Labour party and the Government now expects the support of the Labour party in giving full effect to this legislation.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">On the one hand therefore, we have trenchant criticism of Labour's attitude, and on the other, expectation of full moral and material support in the implementation of this legislation, which, in our opinion, is designed to weaken and split the great Australian Labour party. </para>
                    <para>I am amazed at the enthusiasm of honorable senators opposite. In the last couple of days they have risen one after the other to make their contribution to this debate. That has been in marked contrast to their attitude last week when they were far from enthusiastic about joining in this debate. There was complete apathy on the Government benches, and an obvious disinclination to participate in the business of the Senate. Apparently, honorable senators opposite have now become revitalized. They are wrathfully criticizing the Labour party's acquiescence in the passage of this measure. Surely they should be grateful that the bill is to be passed after all. "We are accused of having abandoned our original stand merely for tactical reasons. In my opinion the. introduction of this measure originally by the Government was a part of a battle of tactics. This bill was designed solely for the purpose of bringing about disunity in the Labour party, but it has failed to achieve that objective. The Labour Opposition in the Senate amended the original bill and returned it to the House of Representatives in a form which would have enabled the Govern-" ment effectively to deal with the Communist menace. I shudder to think what may have happened but for the existence of the Labour majority in this chamber. If the bill as it was originally drafted had been translated into law industrial anarchy would have reigned throughout the length and breadth of Australia. The Labour Opposition in the Senate used its majority to amend the bill in such  a  way as to make it more acceptable to the Australian people. "We hoped that the measure as it left the Senate would be accepted by the Government and placed cn the statute-book. The Government and Opposition parties agreed that the Government had received a mandate from the people on the 10th December last to. deal with communism. Although  all the great democratic countries of the world uphold the principles of free association, the people of Australia then decided that the Communist party should be abolished, that its funds should be expropriated and that Communists should be prevented from occupying key positions in the trade unions and the 1'ublic Service. The political parties represented in this Parliament were in complete agreement about that proposal. The onus of proof clause became the principal bone of contention. The line of demarcation between the views of the Government and of the Opposition in respect of that vital clause was so thinly drawn that the differences of opinion could have been overcome by a common-sense approach to the problem. I understand that when one House disagrees with amendments made to a bill in another House the customary practice is to appoint a committee of management for the purpose of obtaining agreement on the matters in dispute. That procedure was not. followed in connexion with this bill. When the Prime Minister introduced the measure he uncompromisingly stated that he would accept no amendment of its vital clauses. That is why we contend that its purpose was more a political measure than an attempt to protect the country from its enemies. Had politics been dispensed with by the Government and had logic and reason prevailed, the delicate situation that has arisen in relation to this bill could have been avoided to the satisfaction of all concerned, the legislation could have been implemented months ago and a great deal of industrial turmoil and strife could have been prevented. Not long ago the secretary of a key industrial union made certain statements about the United Nations participation in the Korean incident which were considered by Government authorities to constitute a threat to our security. The statements were closely investigated by the Attorney-General with a. view to taking appropriate action. I believe that such action was withheld so that the Government could claim that its hands were tied because this bill had not become law. The Government, instead of attending to its obligation to protect the security of this country, played the game of politics. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators opposite have twitted the Opposition for having accepted the decision of the federal executive of the Australian Labour party not to oppose the passage of this bill. It is possible that the decision of the federal executive was influenced by the circumstances which I have recounted. The federal executive . may ako have played the game of politics. At all events, the Government will now have the responsibility of implementing this legislation and if we can believe press statements it seems likely that it will experience grave difficulties in attempting to do so. The differences of opinion that exist in respect of the onus of proof clause stem principally from the wide interpretation of "Communist " contained in the bill. We regard as Communists all those persons who are either directly or indirectly associated with the Communist party or its auxiliaries. A simple definition could be framed to cover all members of the Communist party and active supporters of its doctrines. The Opposition fears that if the definition be left unaltered innocent persons will be declared and suffer all the penalties that attach to such declaration. As the result of the representations made by the Opposition the Government decided to appoint a special committee to examine the evidence relating to suspected persons. Who, in the main,' will they be? Under this legislation any person may be declared. I assume that evidence concerning the activities of such persons would be furnished in the first instance by the security service, and that the files would then be passed on to the special  committee for examination and recommendation to the Attorney-General I have no doubt that the recommendation of the special committee will be based on the evidence submitted to it. Thus, the Attorney-General will ' be the final authority who will determine whether or not a suspected person shall be declared, fs it intended that he will personally investigate all the circumstances surrounding the declaration? Of course it is not. The Attorney-General will undoubtedly accept without question the recommendation made by the committee. We greatly fear that innocent persons. having first been submitted to the ordeal of scrutiny and investigation by the security service, will subsequently be declared on the recommendation of the special committee. .Because such wide powers are to be conferred on the Attorney-General we believe that the definition of " Communist " should be confined to embrace only those persons who are or have been, during the relevant period, actively associated with the Communist party or its auxiliaries. No person should be declared until he has been given an opportunity to confront hisaccusers and answer the case made against him. As a layman I have always understood that it is a principle of British justice that an accused person should be charged with his offence before any punishment is inflicted on him. The danger of the onus of proof provisions of this bill were well illustrated by the reference of my learned colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> to the case of the Bishop of Winchester. Honorable senators will recall that the honorable senator likened the powers proposed to be conferred by this bill to those exercised by King Henry VIII., who is reported to have said to one of his colonels, " Arrest the Bishop of Winchester; try him and hang him ". Under the provisions of this bill a suspected person is virtually found guilty and punished before he is charged with an offence. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to make some comment upon the definition of " Communist " as contained in the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. The Australian Labour party has disputed that definition, and that was the principal reason for the passage of this bill being protracted. It has also caused considerable ill feelings between the members of the Opposition aud the Government. The Opposition contends that the definition is too wide, and that' it is ambiguous. As I stated earlier, the definition would be more acceptable to the Opposition if it were stated in simpler terms. As it stands, it presents too vast a field, and may well cover practically any individual in this country. There may come a time when the Government wishes to arraign an individual. As the definition stands, it will be easy for it to be applied to any person who dares to criticize the Government. The Labour party also believes that it is wrong that once a person has' been declared a Communist, regardless of the fact that he may not subscribe to the philosophy of communism, the declaration is placarded throughout the length and breadth of the country, because of its publication in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette.</inline> It needs no stretch of the imagination to visualize the implications involved in the declaration. I know that the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> is not a publication that is popularly sought after, but it is nevertheless true that the fact of his declaration will be immediately broadcast throughout the locality in which he lives. Honorable senators will no doubt agree that it is surprising how quickly whispering campaigns commence. They are very much like bushfires, which before very long become vast conflagrations. It is possible in such circumstances that a man who has incurred the censure of the Government may be declared a Communist, and then have to run the  gamut  of local criticism and prejudice, with its resultant ignominy. He may well be boycotted in the community, because of a whispering campaign, and, if he is prominent in the community, it may not be long before his previous good reputation is disregarded by his fellows, with serious results to his economic circumstances. The fact of his declaration may detrimentally affect his wife and, particularly, his children. The Government says that such a set of circumstances will not occur in the case of a reputable citizen, but will arise only in respect of Communists. If the Australian people have given the Government a mandate to dissolve the Communist party, appropriate its funds, and disqualify Communists from holding positions in trade unions and the Public Service, the Opposition does not quarrel with the bill, but insofar as it carries out that mandate, we should like to be assured that the general application of the legislation will be only along those lines. Why does not the Government legislate specifically to draw a line of demarcation between Communists and reputable citizens ? That is a fair question, but the Government has clouded it in ambiguity. One may well wonder what sinister motive lies behind the wide implications arid the ambiguous nature of the definition of " Communist ". The Opposition is fearful that the Government will gather in the net any person who incurs its displeasure. </para>

                    <para>The members of the Opposition are alarmed that a person may be tried before being given an opportunity to deny that he is a Communist. Irrespective of the degrees of communism, he is declared definitely to be a Communist, and within the framework of this legislation he has no possible hope of establishing his innocence. He is deemed to be a Communist, and he therefore is a Communist within the meaning of the legislation. It is so much hypocrisy for the members of the Government to say that he will be given a trial, and, conditional upon his entering the witnessbox and proclaiming his innocence, the onus will be upon the Government to prove the charge. I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> a very able member of the legal fraternity, giving his exposition of this clause. I do not profess to be a lawyer, but I possess a certain degree of nous, to use a vernacular expression. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> has pointed out, a man may also be declared a Communist if his actions are deemed to be prejudicial, or likely to be prejudicial, to the security of the Commonwealth. It is true that such a person may appeal and declare that he is not a Communist, but prima facie he is one because the legislation says so. What hope has he of proving that he is not? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has said that if he can establish his innocence, he automatically escapes the second " leg " of the charge. </para>

                            <para>- He would not even have a first chance, because he would have been declared to be a Communist, and prima facie he therefore i3 a Communist. Despite al] his protestations, the Crown Prosecutor could say, "Your Honour, within the terms of the act this man is charged with being; a Communist. He has already been declared a Communist within the meaning of the act. He should be tried and hanged ". I make no apology for my statements. I hold no brief for the Communists, but I do hold a brief for the radical person, the staunch unionist, and the average Australian. It is that section of the community that I wish to protect. The Labour party maintains that, in accordance with the concepts of British justice contained in Magna Charta, before a person can be found guilty of an offence particulars of the charge made against him should be supplied to him. On a memorable day in 1215, the workers of England having revolted because they were burdened by heavy taxes upon which they had no opportunity to express an opinion through their representatives in Parliament, King John was brought to heel and arraigned before the barons and representatives of the common people of England. Magna Charta was formulated then. It contains all the concepts of British justice of which we are proud and which have been handed down to us through the centuries. Our democracy should never depart from them. Two of the principles enunciated in Magna Charta are that only by the law of the land can a man be found guilty and deprived of his liberty or rights, and that in the eyes of the law all men are free ; but, under this measure, a free man may be found guilty without trial and deprived of his rights. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber, as representatives of the common people, conscious of our obligations and responsibilities and mindful of the centuries of tradition upon which British justice is based, contend that the principles to which I have referred should be observed in proceedings under the measure that we are now discussing. We believe that only by the law of this land should men be found guilty and deprived of their rights, and that all men should be free until then. We are fortified in our stand by the Atlantic Charter - that great document that stimulated the democracies during the last war to fight for all that they held dear - and the Charter of the United Nations. Are we going to subjugate those principles for political purposes? Honorable senators on this side of the chamber, by their actions and protestations, have endeavoured to protect the traditions of justice in this community, and I hope the Government will administer this measure in a manner that will conform to those traditions. </para>

                        <para>The surest method of spreading Communism was to try to suppress it by force, the adviser to the Burmese Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. S.</inline> Furnival)  said at Melbourne University tonight. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Furnivall,</inline> an Englishman, is in Australia lecturing on behalf of the National University. . He said that a nation wishing to rid itself of Communism must find some less drastic method than force. Communism had no chance of success in Burma in the foreseeable future. </para>
                    </quote><para>The only way to destroy the forces of communism is to provide better economic conditions for the people. </para><para>One honorable senator opposite said that .the Government would use this measure only to suppress strikes. He added that, in his opinion, almost all the strikes that occur now are caused by Communist agitation. I believe that, in most instances, strikes are not caused by the activities of Communists. They occur when dormant discontent and unrest in an industry or organization reaches the point at which human nature boils over, and then no intervention by responsible trade union leaders can settle the strike until the factors causing the discontent have been removed and calmer counsels prevail. Only then can negotiations for the settlement of the dispute begin. I urge the Government to leave the industrial sphere well alone. It may be that members of the Government believe that Communist agitators are directly responsible for many industrial upheavals, but I cannot think of any circumstances in which a trade union leader could persuade all the members of an industrial organization to take part in a strike to further the aims of the Communists if there were no factors causing discontent among the members of the organization. The decision to strike is taken by the members of a trade union. I have confidence in the Australian worker. He knows what must Iv done to make a better Australia. He wants continuous work, because he has economic and domestic responsibilities. Do honorable senators opposite .believe that Australian workers or trade union officials enjoy dislocating industry? Some Communists may do so, but to succeed in their aims they must have the support of the rank and file members of trade unions. They can do nothing without that. During the last general coal strike, the members of the Chifley Government went among the miners. Despite the stranglehold that Communists had on the miners' federation, an overwhelming majority of the rank and file members of the federation subsequently reversed the decision of their Communist-controlled executive. We believe that all trade unions should be run on democratic lines, and that every member should have a voice in determining what is to be done by his branch. </para><para>That brings me to my next point. The Labour party is a democratic party. Its attitude to this bill has been determined by party members throughout the length and breadth of Australia. The decision was made by the rank and file of the party, not by an oligarchy or clique. </para><interjection>

I remind the Senate that the Opposition has a mandate to protect the interests of about half of the entire Australian community. We have advanced logical arguments, and the Government, seeing eye to eye with us, has enabled all hurdles but one to be negotiated. Although the Opposition has indicated its willingness to give the Government the bill, apparently honorable senators opposite are not happy. I am astounded and amazed that the Government will not accept its own bill. </para>

It seems to me that now that the Government is charged with certain obligations, and the end of its political propaganda has been reached, it should do something definite. Thepeople of this country are awaiting the promised activity of the Government to ban the Communist party, the expropriation of its funds, the removal of Communists from executive positions in trade unions and the Public Service. I earnestly advise the Government to be very careful to implement this legislation in accordance with the mandate given to it by the people of Australia and to ensure that only persons who definitely come within the definition of "Communist" in the bill will be declared. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the bill, and I trust that it will have a speedy passage. I must express my very keen disappointment, however, that, being a woman, I was not allowed to say the last word, in accordance with the popular fallacy. I consider that the procrastination on this matter is due to the attitude of the Opposition. Having previously spoken at length in this chamber about communism, I wish merely to express my intense amazement at some of the statements that have been made by honorable senators opposite. For some years prior to my election to this chamber I listened to the broadcasts of the Senate debates, and I always considered that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> presented well-balanced statements. However, I am impelled to challenge some of the statements that he made last night. He stated that in the 1949 general election the Communist party assisted the Liberal and Country parties to gain the government benches. </para>

                            <para>- Is it logical that a party marked down for destruction for its sinister work in this community would help to place in office where they could strike the first blow the parties that they are alleged to have assisted? That statement is altogether too naive to be considered seriously. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> also stated that the Victorian railways strike, which is paralysing transport in that State, is justifiable. I am inclined to think that the honorable senator did not fully consider the matter before making such a statement. As honorable senators are aware, in this country a strike is a lawless act. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> has described it as " justifiable ". Strikes hurt most the workers of this country, whose interests honorable senators opposite claim to protect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> knows as well as I. do that this strike is one of many that have been planned mid inspired by the enemies within our shores. As I told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> recently, and as he already knew, a plan was formulated in 1027 to bring about strikes in this country. 1 believe that this is. oik* of many rolling strikes that unfortunately  Iia  ve been designed to take place in Australia. Honorable senators opposite have stated that they have received their instructions from the federal executive of the Australian Labour party, to which they give their allegiance. Have they no other allegiance as representatives of flip electors of Australia in this chamber? I regard myself as a representative ,of nil classes of people in the.? country, not of any sectional interest, and T am astonished to find that there are honorable senators in this chamber who are making their representation absolutely sectional.

In spite of all those serious allegations that he made against the bill, and against those who are responsible for it, he concluded by saying that the members of his party would vote for it. There was a biblical character who sold his birthright for a mess of potage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> and other Labour senators are prepared to sell their souls for a mess of potage.

It certainly could, and the Opposition is responsible for the delicate situation that exists to-day. Members of the Opposition have said to us, " The bill is your baby ; you mus; carry it ".

                    <para>Being a woman, I was particularly interested in the attempts of the Opposition to use prices as a " red herring '' to confuse the trail. I am interested,  fis  are other women, in the subject of prices. Opposition members were at pains to drag in that particular " red herring ", and they were very disappointed when we did. not allow ourselves to be diverted from the course we had set ourselves. I am prepared to discuss prices at the proper time. The Labour party was afraid of committing political suicide by going to the country on the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. Well, I can assure honorable senators opposite thai their action in passing a bill which they claim to be a terrible travesty of British justice will prove to be a much more effective way of committing political suicide. Women are interested to note the solicitude of the Opposition about prices and the hardships of housewives, but they would be even more interested to see the Australian Labour party executive and the Parliamentary Labour party make an honest attempt to prevent the strikes and industrial stoppages that are putting up costs and reducing production. Recently, I received a letter from one of the pressure groups, the Progressive Housewives Association of New South Wales, which is affiliated with the Federated Association of Australian Housewives, with 100,000 financial members. No doubt, other honorable senators have received copies of the letter. Probably, if I had sought an' expression of opinion from other women's organizations, they would have written to me in much the same terms. We hare heard a great deal about prices in New South Wales, and we know that the price of cauliflowers, for instance, is very high, largely due to special circumstances. The Progressive Housewives Association of New South Wales carried the following resolution : - </para>

                    <para class="block">What issue did they put first? With their usual good sense, they placed industrial peace in the forefront. They know that as soon as the Communist Party Dissolution Bill is passed, the Government will make an honest attempt to remove Communists from key positions in trade unions, so that they will no longer be able to hold up industrial production. Women are not so stupid as to think only of clothes and lipstick. They have minds to consider the problems of their country, and reach conclusions about them. They know that if less coal is produced, there will be less electric power, less production of goods, and higher prices. They know that if electric power fails thousands of eggs will be ruined in the incubators, there will be fewer chickens, fewer egglaying hens, fewer eggs and higher prices, so that only the capitalist will be able to afford to buy eggs for his children. Women of every class expect all honorable senators to play their part, and to ensure that this bill shall be not only passed, but also implemented.

                        <para>.- This bill has been well discussed, and I have listened with great interest to the speeches. I have seen honorable senators with ruffled tempers allowing political hatred and bitterness to come to the surface. Some honorable senators have conducted themselves in a deplorable manner. Surely no legislation could warrant honorable senators losing their tempers, and expressing themselves as some of them have done. I believe that a majority of honorable senators are eager to free Australia from the threat of communism, but some of them forget what they owe to their position. Those who value capitalist democracy should try to preserve it, and should uphold the decorum and prestige of the Parliament on all occasions. It should not be forgotten that a large part of the population of the world, perhaps a majority of the world's people, is under Communist rule, while other sections of the world's population are drifting in that direction. In Europe, Russia, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Hungary, </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Roumania, and Czechoslovakia are under Communist direction. Not long ago, the elections in Italy, of all places, were fought on the issue of communism. In Asia, China has gone Communist, and Korea very nearly went the same way. Honorable senators know what the position is in Burma, and what might happen at any time in Indo-China, Siam, Borneo, and Sumatra. In spite of this, there are people in Australia who behave as if they were unconscious of the threat to our civilization. If there is anything worth preserving in our present form of society, they should do their best to preserve it. </para>
                    <para>On several occasions during this debate, references have been made to Labour's majority in this chamber. I emphasize the fact that every honorable senator has been constitutionally elected. It is true that the parties that have a majority in the House of Representatives are in a minority in the Senate, but we respect the Government's majority in the House of Representatives, and the least that honorable senators opposite can do is to respect our majority here. </para>
                    <para>We have heard frequently from honorable senators opposite the allegation that the Opposition is delaying the passage of this measure, but to discuss the many features and provisions of the bill, and the effect that the measure will have on the community, is surely within the rights of all honorable senators. I say deliberately that there is no need for haste in the consideration of the bill. In my opinion, if ever there was a need for the urgent passage of a measure such as this, it was back in 1930, 1931 or 1932. I give full marks to honorable senators opposite for their sincerity. They are honest in their beliefs and in the opinions that they have expressed. They do believe that communism can be dispelled by legislative action. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the provisions of the measure itself. First, we have the recitals. I have examined many bills in my time, but never have I seen one with such long recitals. There are nine long paragraphs in the preamble, which I believe to be the longest of any measure ever introduced into an Australian Parliament. It should be clearly understood, however, that no one can commit a breach of a recital, either by contravention or by non-observance. One is left wondering, therefore, why those nine paragraphs have been inserted in the bill. I gave this matter my careful consideration three months ago., when I was writing to a journal. This is what I wrote - </para>

                            <para>- I was excluding, of course, the honorable senator. During this debate, we have heard the rustle of the gown, and we have had the visions of the wig. There are lawyers in this chamber, and they never miss an opportunity to air their legal knowledge. I have had considerable experience in the administration of laws, and I have appeared in the courts. My experience has been that about 5 per cent, of court proceedings consists of evidence, another 5 per cent, of law, and 90 per cent, of bluff. I am sure that all laymen in this chamber have felt humble when lawyers have risen to speak. I suggest that in future, they bury their humility, and say to themselves, " This is merely a. show. It is all bluff ". Earlier in this debate, we were told dramatically by a lawyer on the Government benches - " The die is cast ". I felt like crying myself, and I am sure that several honorable senators on this side of the chamber were already weeping. That, of course, is the reason for the insertion of the long recitals in this bill. Considering the main provisions of the measure, one finds that there are ample means to deal with the father bear, the mother bear, and all the little bears. The Communists, of course, have to be extirpated, and all the organizations  that are part and parcel of the Communist movement have to be disbanded. However, after considering the main portions of the bill, we come to what axe termed the averment provisions. Many people, I am sure, do not really understand clearly what an averment is. Many statutes have averment clauses. They are usually essential if laws are .to be enforced in the manner in which legislatures intend them tooperate. One has come to expect to find such clauses, but generally speaking, they are regarded by the legal fraternity as being obnoxious. There is a genuine desire on the part of legislative institutions to avoid the use of the averment if possible. Under this measure, a person may be declared to be a Communist upon the recommendation of a certain body. Peculiarly enough, that body will consist largely of public servants. As the name implies, public servants are servants of the public, and, as such, are controlled by the Government. Because the Government controls them, it can also direct them. Therefore, the public servants upon whose recommendation a declaration will be made, will take their instructions from the Government. </para>

                            <para>- It would not be dishonorable to comply with an instruction. The mind of the public servants will be made up for them. They can still be honest, although acting upon a ministerial instruction. I am merely pointing to the weaknesses of the bill. At this stage, the averment provision has not been brought into operation. It does not operate until a person has been declared, and appeals against that declaration. He lodges an- appeal, and the mere fact that he does so is an acknowledgment of his guilt. In other words, he must acknowledge his guilt before he can move to prove that he is not a Communist. </para>

                            <para>- The laws of evidence deal with the use of the averment. They explain in detail how the averment operates, and how certain evidence must be adduced when proceedings are being taken on averment. A person who is declared under this bill to be a Communist and appeals against that declaration, has to prove his innocence. I have no doubt that, in some instances, the Government will be in possession of records of his past conduct and his personal standing in the community. The declared person will not know just what the Government does hold. He will not know why he has been declared to be a Communist. He will not have been present when a committee considered the material upon which it recommended his declaration as a Communist. Therefore, his position is this: In circumstances that did not permit his voice to be heard, he has been declared to be a Communist; then, without knowing the information on which he has been declared, he is required to prove that he is not a Communist. Such procedure may be approved by the Government, but T am sure that at least  h  few of its supporters do not wholly approve of it. A. better way of dealing with this matter could have been devised, and even now, perhaps, it is not too late for the Government to withdraw this measure and replace it by one, the provisions of which are in accordance with British practices and procedure. Proceedings could be taken against any person who is suspected of being a Communist by 'way of complaint- </para>

                            <para>- I was thinking rather of the Justices Act which operates in each State. Complaints made under the provisions of the Justices Act are heard by a stipendiary magistrate from whose judgment an accused person may appeal to a higher tribunal and thus obtain a second decision. In Australia we are accustomed to having all these matters decided in conformity with British law and in accordance with the principles of British justice. Many years ago Ned Kelly, the famous bushranger, who had committed many crimes in Victoria and New South Wales, was apprehended, brought to trial and hanged. He is still remembered affectionately by many living Australians. Although he was hanged, the responsible government of the day in Victoria has lost none of its good repute because he was dealt with fairly after his capture and sentenced after a fair trial. </para>

                            <para>- And will it not be lawful for this or another government to ban the Australian Labour party in the following week? Once we commence the process of banning a political party there is nothing to stop us from extending it until only one political party remains. Then  Ave  should need only the military or the police. A few days ago an election was held in Eastern Germany. Although the representatives of two or more political parties may have contested it we have been told by the press that as the result of fear in the minds of the people all the members elected were representative of one political party. If it is feasible to ban communism by legislation it should also be feasible to ban love, light or the winds. If we wish to eradicate the evils of communism from our midst we must first remove the causes of communism. "What has caused the growth of communism ? Does it not represent a struggle for economic security? </para>

Every honorable senator knows that when he returns to his State at the end of the week, or at the end of the month, his electors interview him about various matters concerning their welfare and interests. On his return to the seat of government he makes appropriate representations in respect of their grievances. In this country the people enjoy the right to give expression to their political views. No matter how lowly a constituent may be his grievances are always heard and considered by the Parliament. In these circumstances communism does not find a healthy breeding ground in this country. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that communism is. international. I have no doubt that the communists in Australia do the bidding of their masters in Russia. Communism spreads its roots in bad economic conditions and in helplessness and hopelessness among the people. Many people in this country have embraced the Communist doctrine as a means of escape from bad economic conditions. Prom 1931 until 1939 there operated in this country a system of employment known as intermittent relief work. From 1931 to 1934 the very best that Australia offered an unemployed single man was one day's work a week, for which he received lis. 6d. From 1935 to 1938 for one day's work a week he was paid 14s. 6d. From 1931 to 1934 an unemployed married man was provided with lj days a week for which he was paid 17s., and from 1935 to 1938 he was paid £1 6s. 2d. Between 1931 and 1934 an unemployed married man with three children was provided with 2J days a week for which he was paid £1 7 s. It was to be expected that conditions such as that would lead to the formation of a political party somewhat different from the parties that are represented in this chamber. Could we expect single men to live for years under such conditions without being affected by offers to improve them, from whatever source they emanated? </para><interjection>

During that period approximately 250,000 Australian people were out of work and the best that Australia did for them was to provide them with relief work under the conditions that X have outlined. If in a time of recession a single man cannot look forward to something better than that is it to be wondered at that he should be attracted to any political party that offered better conditions ? </para>

During the last period of great unemployment in this country the unemployed were almost all Australians who had an Australian outlook and typical Australian tolerance. If similar conditions exist again a large proportion of the unemployed will be new Australians who have not the outlook and tolerance of our own people. In those circumstances we may have something worse than communism in this country. I should like this measure to have been accompanied by another measure designed to ban unemployment for ever. It would be just as possible to ban unemployment as it will be to ban communism by means of this legislation. I think it was Shakespeare who said that " The mind shall banquet, though the body pine ". If we are going to starve men and give the people insecurity, then we are going to give them something on which to feast their minds. We shall make them think. At the outset, I said that I thought the principles of the Government members were sincere, and I repeat that statement. I still think that they believe the best is in this bill.

                        <para>. -  Having spoken on the original bill when it was before the Senate, I do not intend to take up the time of honorable senators for very long, but during the debate on this subject over the last three days we have heard so many very long and windy arguments that it seems to me that the members of the Opposition are arriving at the stage where they cannot see the wood because the trees are in the way. Apart from challenging any of the various statements that have been made, all I propose doing is to go very slowly through the various stages that occur during the averment and the other processes in connexion with .the bill. I join issue with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> who quoted from the Declaration of Rights and stated that, amongst other things, it called for complete freedom of political thought, because I do not consider that,, communism is a form of political thought. To my mind, communism in Australia is merely espionage on behalf of a foreign power. I therefore consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is quite wrong in suggesting that freedom to practise communism is in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Rights. </para>

Whilst I naturally do not agree with some of his points, I should very much like to hear more speeches in a similar strain from the members of the Opposition, instead of the continual and unnecessary villification of honorable senators on this side of the chamber. </para>
                    <para>In the few minutes I propose to speak, I wish to go slowly through the various stages of the&gt; averment and possibly what might be termed the conviction. I am rather doubtful about using a name for the purposes of illustration in case it should subsequently be mentioned, but I shall take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> as my example. Let us suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> acts in such a way that the security service of this country suspects that he is a Communist, and that he is, in fact, one of the people mentioned in this bill as being detrimental to the safety " of the country. The first thing that  happens is that the security service makes a thorough investigation. If, as the result of the investigation, it is decided that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> is a Communist, and is likely to act to the detriment of this country, the security service then reports to the committee of five members, consisting of the Solicitor-General, the permanent head of the Department of Defence, the head of the security service, and two others. </para>

                            <para>- That is rather an interesting point, because it was hoped that a leading member of the trade unions would be one of those two others, but, unfortunately, the unions have refused to recommend anybody. However, those five men - and I. do not believe any member of the Opposition would even suggest they were not suitable men with responsible ideas of life - thoroughly investigate the charge. If they, in turn, come to the conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> is what he is alleged to be, they report to the Cabinet. The Cabinet examination will be either cursory or long, according to the reports that are put in; but in any case the reports are examined by the Cabinet. All those people having decided that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> is detrimental to the safety of the country, they declare him. He is not put in gaol, nor is he hanged or shot. All that happens is that he is prohibited from holding office in certain key unions or in the Commonwealth Public Service, and in that I include the defence forces. Nothing further happens as far as the law is concerned. </para>

                            <para>-  His  own barrister or lawyer is also entitled to. question him, as in any ordinary law suit before the courts. I think it is rather a silly remark to say that he has to be cross-examined. Of course he has to be cross-questioned. He makes a definite statement: "I am not the man you. say I am ". The Crown must try to prove that he is, and by crossquestioning him it can, in very many cases, either obtain admissions of guilt or assumptions of guilt, and his own lawyer , is there to see that he gets fair play. I really cannot see what all this hullaballoo is about and I do not think any honorable senator could possibly disagree with the various stages I have demonstrated. </para>

                    <para>It seems to me that the reasons for the long-winded speeches from the honorable senators opposite fall into three categories': That they have not read the bill properly and thoroughly, and therefore do not understand it ; or that they are deliberately misconstruing it in order to oppose it, thus carrying their duties as members of the Opposition to extreme lengths; or that they may be endeavouring to talk themselves out of the position in which they find themselves to-day. I think the last-mentioned category is probably untrue of most of the Opposition in this chamber, because I should not like to feel that there are very many men in the Opposition to-day who are willing to stand up and say what a shocking bill this is, and 'how bad it would be for Australia, and then not to oppose it when the time  comes  to vote on it. Because I should not like to think that, I consider that most of the members on the other side of the chamber really do not understand the clauses that they have read in this bill, in spite of the hours they have spoken on them. I do not think any honorable senator will be able to fault those stages through which I have gone. </para>

                        said that a man who is declared' is not afforded the opportunity to defend himself before he is declared. A man who is accused of murder, or any other crime, does not have a little court set up for him in the police station so that he may be tried before he goes  to the real court. His trial commences and finishes in either the High Court or the Supreme Court or the Privy Council, whichever it may be. There is not some sort of subsidiary trial before the real trial is commenced.

                        or for that matter any legal man, knows that many people are accused of acts and that they must go to court to prove their innocence. In general, once they are acquitted by the court they are back in practically the same position as they were before. When it has been proved, by all our excellent methods of justice, that a man is not guilty of an offence, he returns to the society from which he came, and nothing further  happens.
                    </para>
                    <para>I do sincerely support this bill. I should like to add that I am quite in accord with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> when he says that it is useless to pass the Communist Party Dissolution Bill through this Senate and to make it law unless we do other things at the same time. However, I have sufficient confidence in the Prime Minister and the Cabinet at present in this country to believe that they have a plan which will work in conjunction with the passage of this bill. This measure is so important that it affects the whole production of this country, on which the other parts of the plan so greatly depend. </para>

                        on behalf of the Labour party, said that it was the worst speech that he had heard the honorable senator deliver. I believe that the statement by

                        was one of his best efforts. It was one of the best dissertations on an important question to which I have listened, and I am sorry that the proceedings of the Senate were not being broadcast when the speech was delivered.

                        and other honorable senator;: opposite do not appear to take much notice of the industrial position occupied by Australian workers, and apparently have not devoted much attention to a study of the development of trade unions in Australia. Pew honorable senators opposite know of the tribulations that the railway men suffered in their attempts to secure the right to form a trade union. In 1903 the antipathy of the Victorian Government to the railway men of Victoria was so great that it sponsored a measure to prevent them from being treated as Victorians. Their names were removed from the Victorian electoral roll and they were given separate representation in the Victorian Parliament. They were not allowed to associate politically with their fellow citizens in Victoria. We can visualize the environment of the men employed in the Victorian railways service from 1903 onwards. It has always been the policy of the Victorian railways to pay wages lower than those paid in other branches of industry. Time went on, and the Commonwealth arbitration system began to take shape. Eventually, the Victorian railway men linked themselves with the political and industrial movement of Australia, but at one time, when I was a delegate to a trades and labour council in Victoria, they were not allowed, under the laws administered by the Victorian Commissioners of Railways, to affiliate with a trades and labour council.

                            <para>- I forgive the Minister because, coming from South Australia, he does not know what transpires in the more  densely  populated States of this country. I Was replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> when the Minister rudely interrupted me. I think Ministers should set an example to the rank-and-file members of the Senate, not only on this side but also on the other side, by refraining from interjections. If the Minister had been present in the chamber during the course of this debate, he would know that I did not interject when honorable senators opposite were speaking. Let us consider the Victorian railway dispute. The Victorian railway men had a dispute with the Victorian Railways Commissioners. The  chairman  of the commissioners then conferred with representatives of the ralwaymen's union and with his own industrial officers. The men claimed that they should be paid for overtime on a daily basis. At present, the commissioners can order them to work for any hours they like to specify, and overtime is paid only after a certain period and not after each  day's work. The men claimed that they should be paid overtime on a daily basis, and also pressed a claim that they had been making for many years, that they should be paid for what is known as passive time. The commissioners agreed to accept the men's demands. The Conciliation Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall,</inline> declined to ratify the agreement made between the commissioners and the trade union. The commissioners were, and still are, prepared to accede to the men's claims. Why is it that J. J. Brown and the Communistcontrolled  executive of the union now have the men behind them? It is because of the way in which the men have been treated during the last ten or twenty years. That is one of the reasons why Communists have secured control of the Victorian  railway men's  union. The Communists fought strongly for the men, who were not being paid rates similar to those paid in other fields of employment and were not enjoying conditions in relation to overtime, &amp;c, equal to those enjoyed by men in other industries. </para>

                    <para>Why does the Labour party oppose the onus of proof provision in this measure so strongly?  Let  me tell the Senate of an incident that occurred in Sydney last week. An American citizen was in Martin-place. He had on him the equivalent of £12,000 in American dollars. He was not wearing a collar and he was questioned by the police. They jumped on him and were taking him. with them to be charged with being an escaped lunatic. When that happens in a city like Sydney, it can easily lie understood why the Labour party has adopted the attitude that it has to the onus of proof provisions in this measure. </para>
                    <para class="block">We believe that every man should have the rights to which he is entitled under our British system of administration of justice. </para>
                    <para>When I consider the history of the Liberal -party and its connexion with Australian Communists, I recall that, following an industrial dispute, a Liberal government announced that it proposed to deport two men, Walsh and Jacob Johnson. The. attempt to deport them was merely a sham, because Walsh was subsequently employed by employers' organizations and -Liberal party organizations in New South Wales and fought the  Labour party  as bitterly as the Liberal party is fighting it now. </para>
                    <para>I turn to the attacks that have been made upon the Australian Council of Trades Unions because it has consistently opposed this bill. Although members of the Government parties have attacked the Australian Council of Trades Unions, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has invited the  president  of that organization to attend a conference to discuss methods of achieving greater production in Australia. Whilst Government supporters condemn members of the Australian Council of Trades Unions as Communists, the Government is quite prepared to confer with the  president  in regard to production. </para>
                    <para>I am convinced that the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport would give a great deal to get rid of this bill, which the Government knows perfectly well is a loser. The Government wants the Opposition to reject the bill, but we shall not do so. The Government wanted the bill and will get it. At the moment the Government has no intention to do anything to implement the measure, because it knows that it can not do anything. During a strike in Victoria, the Hollway Government secured the passage through the Victorian Parliament of the Essential Services (Emergency) Act. I am not saying a word against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hollway,</inline> because I believe that at the time he really thought he could achieve something with the measure. It was along the same lines as the bill before the Senate, but it was not half as bad as the bill that we are considering, because it was thought out by a Victorian, not by representatives of the Liberal party from all parts of Australia. As honorable senators know, there is now a rail strike in progress in Victoria. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDonald,</inline> the Premier of that State, was asked recently why he did not put the Essential Services (Emergency) Act into operation, he replied, " I cannot do it. The act is not workable ". </para>

Would the Minister go into the pits himself ? No ! Coal can be won only by the men who are employed in the mines. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister is putting words into my mouth. I am not supporting the Government in connexion with this bill, and I shall not vote to enable its passage. The Government parties will be able to commit political suicide by attempting to administer it. Whenever a coal strike has occurred while an anti-Labour government has been in office, no attempts have been made to settle it. Liberal and Country party members have never had the courage to address the miners on the coal-fields, as Labour Ministers have done, to try to secure coal to assist Australian production. </para>

                        asserted that if a declared person subsequently won his appeal, he could go back to his job. I remind the Senate that when the public is hysterical, anything is likely to happen. We should remember what happened during the war period. If persons were thought to be subversive, even without trial they became marked men in the community. In many instances they lost their jobs, although a charge was not preferred against them. A certain stigma always attaches to the individual.

                    <para>What has the Government against the amendments that were moved by the Opposition? We supported the Government right up to the hilt in connexion with everything concerning the banning of the Communist party. What else does it want? We also agreed that Communists who were occupying certain posts in trade unions should be ousted. It will Be remembered that when Labour was in office a bill was passed to enable secret ballots to be conducted by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, upon the application of individual members of an organization. The present Government has never introduced any such measure. A lot of discontent has been caused amongst the people of this country because the Government has refused to accept the amendments that were moved by the Labour Opposition in this chamber. </para>

It may interest the honorable senator to learn that we have received from the Housewives Association of New South Wales telegrams by the score as long as the letter received by her. We have received piles of correspondence, including hundreds of telegrams, condemning us for the very action that we are taking in the Senate, and for the action that has been taken by the Opposition in the House of Representatives. We have been condemned because of the support that we have offered to the Government. We have been condemned because we have adopted a certain course of action, not in our own interests. What have we to gain from the actions that we have taken ? We represent the workers of this country, not large financial organizations.

                            <para>- Not one working-class organization in Australia supports the Government parties. The leaders of those parties are afraid of losing what they have. They were the most disappointed people in Australia when they learnt that the federal executive of the Australian Labour party had decided that this bill should be allowed- to go through. I presume that they realize that the action that we have taken is a presage of the destruction of the anti-Labour parties in this country. Labour is well aware of the difficulties that confront the Government. We have had experience in dealing with trade unions that are controlled by Communists. We have fought them, and we know what the Government is up against. Most trade unionists, even if they are not Communists, insist that everybody should receive a. fair "crack of the whip ". The onus of proof provision will enable them to gain support that they would not otherwise have been able to get. Labour is the only party that has anything to lose as the result of the action that we are taking. Although this action has not been taken as the result of a unanimous direction from the trade union movement, I point out that the action of the Government in this matter is receiving the unqualified support and backing of the large financial institutions, as well as of the press of Australia. Immediately before a political fight is due to commence, and as soon as the date is fixed, almost the whole of the broadcasting system of Australia is booked by the anti-Labour parties. We expect that the people of Australia will be so much on the side of Labour, because of the fair stand that has been taken by the Opposition in this chamber, that the anti-Labour parties will lose in the long run. I believe that when supporters of the Government learned of the decision of the federal executive of the Australian Labour party, the entire, stock of aspros available at the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms was soon sold out. I am firmly convinced that the supporters of the Government were  very  disappointed to learn of that decision. </para>

We in Victoria have had a taste of what the banks will do. and what they are prepared to spend their money on.

                        <para>. - I do not propose to speak at length, because the Government wants to get the bill. I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> make a melancholy speech last night, and to-day I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Katz.</inline> They are both Victorians, and it is a terrible thing that, at a time like this when conciliation commissioners appointed by the Chifley Government are trying to settle a strike, responsible senators from Victoria should be doing their best to encourage the strikers. The Labour party was in office for eight years in the Commonwealth, and Labour governments have been in office in the States. It was/because of the spineless attitude of those/Labour governments to the problem of Communism that we are faced with So  many difficulties to-day. We are threatened with Communistinspired strikes, but the Labour party is doing nothing to help to get this bill through so that we may attack the vicious group of people who are doing so much barm. I listened to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley),</inline> and I am sure that the public must have been disgusted with the political humbug that he displayed. I appreciate that every honorable senator opposite, with the exception of one, realizes that the Communists are a menace to Australia and to the peace of the world. Great sacrifices are being made in other parts of the world to check the menace of communism, and it is. not very encouraging to note the behaviour of the Labour party in this Parliament. Our own lads are making heavy sacrifices overseas, and millions of pounds are being spent in Australia on defence to enable us to play our part in the defeat of commu-111 Sn]  ; yet, for six months, the Government has been prevented from getting legislation which it believes is essential if we are to destroy the red menace in this country. For months we listened to speeches from honorable senators attacking certain clauses of the bill. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> must blush to remember them. Perhaps he is incapable of blushing, but he must surely hang his head in shame to recall the speeches that he made in opposition to parts of the bill. And now he is committed to vote on the bill, not as his conscience dictates, but in accordance with the decision of a small coterie of twelve men outside the Parliament who are dictating to the representatives of the people what they must do. Was it not sufficient for the Opposition to hold the bill up for six months ? Now, after it has been decided to give the Government the bill, they are still delaying its passage, as they have delayed it for the past three days. What is going on in Australia at the present time?  Communist leaders of trade unions are sabotaging the steel industry. Important coal mines in New South Wales are repeatedly idle. Strikes are occurring in various parts of Australia, and reports come to hand that they are inspired by Communists. The same sort of thing is going on in the maritime industry. Ships are constantly being held up. Because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> has some influence in the seamen's union he is able to persuade the seamen to hold up the sailing of ships so that steel urgently needed for defence purposes and for housing cannot be delivered. Yesterday, at most of the ports in Australia, there was a strike inspired by the secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Healy,</inline> a well-known Communist, who was kicked off the Stevedoring Industry Commission by the Chifley Government. Yet he is able to hold up 250 ships at a time when shipping is scarce, and goods are urgently required. There is a conspiracy among Communist trade union leaders in certain key industries to sabotage Australian industry, because they do not want Australia to get on with its _ defence projects. Labour senators are well aware of all this. ] appeal to them to stop playing the fool, and to pass the bill so that we may go on with the job. </para>

                    <para>We know that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited is working at only 70 per cent, of its capacity because of the shortage of coal, and that Lysaghts Limited, in Newcastle, have had to put off men because they cannot get steel. If the Communist party had paid Labour senators they could not have done a better job during the last three days in the interests of the Communists. As soon as the leaders of the Communist party knew that the Australian Labour party executive had forced the parliamentary Labour party to surrender on this bill they got busy, and for the last three days they have been burning papers, and getting rid of their cash as a prelude to going underground. The Labour Opposition in the Senate has held up the passage of the bill, thus providing the Communists with  time in which to act. On behalf of the Government, I protest emphatically against such behaviour. As -the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> said a few days ago, the task of the Government will be difficult. Throughout the whole of these protracted debates not one member of the Government has attacked the genuine trade union movement. At all my meetings on the coal-fields I have been only too pleased to meet representatives of the workers, and I have found that 95 per cent, of the trade unionists are decent men who are anxious to get rid of the Communists. For some unknown reason, however, the Communists have a grip on the executives of some of the unions and can prevent the moderate unionists from acting as they would like. It is a disgrace to the Senate that the bill should be held up in this way. I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> and to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> to put an end to this humbug, and let us get on with the job. </para>

All of them abused the Labour party. We have been accused of holding up this legislation, thus providing the Communists with an opportunity to go underground.

I for one shall not hesitate to criticize a bill if I consider that it merits criticism. The Labour Opposition in this chamber has criticized this bill because of certain provisions which are considered to be unjust. There will be no need for the onus of proof clause in dealing with the Thorntons, the Healys and others whose affiliations with the Communist party are well known. Our object is to protect the honest trade unionist who will be in danger of being declared under this bill. "We challenge the right of the Attorney-General to authorize people to enter the homes of private citizens merely on the ground that they may be members of the Communist party or of some affiliated organization.

                    <para class="block">The present Government parties have been in power in this Parliam.3nt for most of the time since 1925, bug what have they done? Can any one show that there are more strikes to-day than there were ten or fifteen years ago ? I invito honorable senators to cast their minds back to the depression days of the early 1930's. Although the Scullin Government was in office, the anti-Labour parties had a majority in this chamber, and what did they do ? Acting under instructions from one or two financiers, they permitted the people of this country to exist on. a starvation diet. Honorable senators opposite talk about the alleged domination of the Australian Labour party by a body consisting of two delegates from each State. In the depression years, the anti-Labour parties were dominated by one man, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer, who came here from Great Britain and told us that we must tighten our belts. The result was that nearly one-third of the people of this country had to exist on mere sustenance for a couple of years. They pulled in their belts all right. The sustenance allowance was about 7s. for each person. A married man with a wife and one child had. to live on 21s. a week. If he earned even 10s., that amount was deducted from  hi3  sustenance payment. Any one who had a few pounds in the bank and therefore was ineligible for sustenance payments, was unable to secure government employment. </para>
                    <para>We hear a lot to-day about the high cost of living and the need for increased production.' On more than one occasion when the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> was one of the "lonely three" Opposition members in this chamber, he said that the high cost of living and the low production was due to the activities of the Communists. In my opinion the shortage of labour is the cause of low production in most of our industries to-day. In every daily newspaper one reads advertisements by most of our leading industries for labour. Even the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which, during the Chifley Government's regime, was supplied with three or four hundred migrants, is still appealing for brickmakers, toolmakers and so on. I had an opportunity to inspect the Newcastle steelworks of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited some time ago, and to speak to a number of the immigrants who had been given jobs in that undertaking. They are doing excellent work. The inadequacy of steel production is not the fault of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. It is due to the shortage of labour and of material including coking coal.  ' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Simmonds</inline> said yesterday that the Labour party, if returned to power, would repeal this bill. Apparently the honorable senator was not aware of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> had said on Tuesday, which was that the Labour party would insert its amendments into this legislation immediately it resumed office. Those amendments include, of course, an alteration of the onus of proof clause. The injustice of that clause has already been dealt with fully by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> and other honorable senators on this side of the chamber, and I shall not refer further to that matter. We are fully aware of its dangers and it is against those dangers that we are seeking to protect the trade unionists of this country. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> to talk about the trade unionists not being satisfied with what we are doing. The honorable senator may belong to a trade union, but she has never belonged to one that is affiliated with the Labour party, so she does not know what she is talking about.

                    <para class="block">McKenna introduced a bill in this Senate to provide for the taking of a referendum on the subject of prices control. No sooner had he concluded his speech than the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> announced over the air and in the press the measures which the Government proposed to take to curb inflation. During the following two or three days he gave full details of his proposals. Although the evils of inflation had been apparent for many months, only after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> had introduced his bill in this chamber was the Prime Minister awakened to the importance of the problem and the need for action to solve it. The press carried full page advertisements, which were paid for by the taxpayers of Australia, setting out the measures proposed by the Government to curb inflation. The whole of the propaganda machinery of the Liberal party was put into operation in order to ensure that the widest publicity should be given to the Prime Minister's plans. During the last two weeks when the bill to deal with prices was under discussion in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Robertson,</inline> who to-day ha,3 complained about the high prices of commodities, had not one word to say. I am sure that she has no idea of the difficulties of the wife of a working man who is in receipt of the basic wage. The honorable senator claims to be the champion of the workers and of the women of Australia but she had not one word to say on a bill which was designed for the sole purpose of alleviating the distress that exists among them. </para>

While that measure was under discussion honorable senators opposite continually interjected, saying, " Let us get on with the Communist Party Dissolution Bill ". We have decided to accede to their request and now they appear to be astonished by our decision not to oppose the passage of that measure. In fact they have invited us to vote against it. What sort of a sham fight is this ? Do they want the bill to be passed or not? </para>

The Minister also said that they were elected to state their true views on the legislation brought before them and that it was contrary to all previous practice for them to come into the Senate and vote in accordance with the recommendation of an outside body. What a statement to come from the mouth of a responsible member of the Liberal party! Let us recall the history of that party since the days when it was led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> now Lord Bruce. When that party was in power it was responsible for the sale of the Australian Common wealth line of steamers: it sold the Commonwealth woollen mills and played a prominent part in other swindles which it engineered at the behest of its financial supporters in Sydney and Melbourne. What a record ! Some of the new members of that party should examine the records of its past activities in order to discover what sort of a political party they have joined. Honorable senators opposite have said that the Labour party is dominated by twelve men. I shall not disclose to them the details of the inside working of that party. I merely remind them that its policy is dictated not by twelve men but by the whole of the trade union movement throughout the Commonwealth. Its political machinery is the envy of other political parties. Let those who have criticized us in the last few days examine the history of the Liberal party in both the State and Commonwealth spheres. What was the record of the Liberal party of Australia in connexion with the general election of 1 949 ? </para>

                            <para>- The Labour movement generally will assist the Government in its efforts to implement the provisions of this legislation. That assistance should be worth while because the trade union movement, particularly in Western Australia, has bitterly fought the Communists for many years. In spite of the activities of the Communists Western Australia has a great industrial record. Very few disputes have occurred in that State, particularly in the coalmining and waterfront industries which are so important to our economy. Such differences as have arisen between employers and employees in the coal-mining industry have almost invariably been settled overnight by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> J. Wallwork, the  chairman  of the Western Australia Local Reference Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wallwork</inline> has never hesitated to speak plainly to the coal-miners and the coal-owners alike, and all sections of the industry are content to abide by his decisions. With his assistance production from the Collie field has reached record dimensions. The future of the industry in Western Australia looks very bright. Open-cut mining is being extended and new machinery is being obtained. It is hoped that as a result of these improvements the coal production in Western Australia will bp greatly increased during the next few months. The Government will encounter great difficulties in its efforts to implement this legislation but it may rest assured that we shall give it all the assistance we can in carrying out its task. </para>

                        <para>. - Like myself, my contribution to this debate will be very brief. Although honorable senators opposite are pleased to receive that assurance from me I remind them that they are not anticipating much because throughout the whole of my public life I have invariably been warned to be brief by the  chairman  of every meeting that I have addressed. I am well aware of the saying that brevity is the soul of wit. Indeed, I have just complimented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wordsworth</inline> on the brevity of his remarks a moment or two ago when he proposed that the question be now put. I have participated in this debate not because I am afraid of being declared - I am already approaching the sere and yellow - but because I want to have my views recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> so that those who are sufficiently interested in politics to read that publication may know and understand them. I regret that the proceedings of this chamber to-day are not being broadcast, because I should like to tell the people of my antagonism to those who masquerade as Communists. Twelve months ago or more I made a dissertation in this Senate on the subject of the various " isms " that have been inflicted on mankind including socialism, communism, anarchism, nihilism and liberalism ; and I characterized liberalism as the worst of all of them. However, I shall not turn the knife in old wounds by a repetition of my views on that subject. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>On the occasion when I dealt with communism I made it clear that I had a wholesome respect for it, but little respect for the people of this country masquerading as Communists. I wish to be a little more explanatory now, because since I delivered that speech I have learned something that has changed my mind towards communism as it is at present operating in Russia and the various parts of the world. The basie principles of communism were : from each according to his ability; to each according to his needs. There is nothing much wrong with that. In fact, it is a splendid idea, and no one can gainsay it. It is a claim that the State has the right to expect something from each and all of us according to our ability, and that it guarantees something to each and all of us according to our needs, thereby making provision for the halt, the lame, the blind, and the physically incapable. I regarded that as a glorious ideal. But I have discovered from a booklet sent to me by a prominent Communist - I have been cheek by jowl with some of them in past years - that in 1936, at the Communist convention in Moscow, that ideal was altered. That, of course, does not alter communism, but it alters the " ism " as practised in Russia under Stalin. One word in that preamble was altered, so that instead of reading " from each according to his ability; to each according to his needs ", it reads " from each according to his ability; to each according to his work ". That might sound democratic and quite proper, but when it is realized that another plank in their philosophy is based on the principle of work, so that " if any work not, neither shall he eat ",' we are able to see the pernicious effect of that alteration. It means that instead of helping the halt, the lame, and the blind, if they do not produce, neither shall they eat. </para>
                    <para>I believe that there has been liquidation to an alarming extent of people who have been inept and incapable in Russia. I am not speaking empty phrases. When I use the word " comrade " I use it in the real sense, and not in the sense that people now mouth it. bringing it into disrepute. I once had a Russian friend, a workmate, who was injured and was dying. While I am not asking for any pats on the back, I took over the responsibility of his two little children. I have no regrets, because they both turned out very fine citizens, and I am proud of the fact that I did so. </para>
                    <para class="block">The very fact that I did so meant that I had the fullest respect from all types of Russians in New South Wales. Thousands of them visited me in their natural concern for the children. I obtained information from those people which was not then generally known. People speak about an " iron curtain " now ; it was an opaque curtain before, and very little information came from Russia. I think I can rely on the information I received from both " White " and " Red " Russians to know what was happening in their country. The " White " Russians spoke of wholesale liquidation. I know that I am painting a terrible picture for honorable senators, but I do it so that if there are Communists who have sufficient interest to read in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> what I have said, I shall be proud to let them know my opinion of them. </para>
                    <para>I once met a Russian, who, with the father of the two children I have mentioned, had been a member of the Czar's bodyguard, and was standing behind him on Red Sunday, 1905, when he gave the order at  Tsarskoye Selo  to fire on peaceful citizens presenting a pleading petition. It was in disgust at that act that those two men escaped. They came through Siberia, passing through Omsk, Tomsk, Irkutsk and Harbin, and eventually finding their way to Australia, where I came in contact with them. The friend of the man with whom I was closely associated decided, some ten years ago, to go back to Russia. He was then aged about 58, and he went back with his wife and daughter. They have never been heard of since. He had reached the stage when he was physically inept, and I honestly believe that the man, whom I was proud to call friend, and who had been very prompt in discarding the Czar after the incident I have mentioned, thereby showing that he had some manliness, in. conjunction with hundreds of thousands of others, was liquidated, because he was no longer useful as a producing unit of the Soviet. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> have said that the Communists are operating from Russia and in association with Russia. I know that another of their doctrines is that the end justifies the means. That is anarchy. For that reason I prefer to describe as anarchists those people who masquerade as Communists, because anarchy is the negation of all forms of constituted authority. There is no doubt as to where these so-called Communists stand. They are really anarchists. I do not blame them entirely for what has happened, because, after all, we have just been through 'two world wars. We have heard of field-marshals, generals and admirals, but emerging from all that war period there is one general compared to whom all other generals pale into insignificance. That general is general apathy. Quite frankly, I believe that the Government is only using -this bill as a stalking horse, because I think communism is a dying, or a diminishing power in this country. General apathy is responsible for all the ills of the trade unionists. I am a trade unionist, and for many years I was the senior union delegate in every shop in which I worked. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> said to me some months ago, " I could not imagine any one declaring you, senator ". As a matter of fact, in the eyes of the general public and of this excellent committee of five which is to be set up, I may 'appear a very dangerous individual. I was the man who declared that terrible - and I say that advisedly - 1917 strike, which brought so much havoc in its train. That declaration fell to my lot. Confidentially, I did not believe in it at the time. I have heard nasty epithets thrown across this chamber at people who vote against their conscience. As senior union delegate in the Eveleigh workshops, it was my duty, when a majority decided on a course of action, whether I believed in it or not, to implement it, and I did so. Having implemented action to commence that strike, and having been associated with militant unionism in every workshop in which I have worked during my 37 years in the engineering industry, I consider that I would come immediately within the purview of this power to declare, and that the onus would then be on me. It would be my job to work my way out of that difficulty. First, there would be a stigma attached to me, to my home, and to my wife and children. It would be my responsibility to ward off skilled cross-examiners and endeavour to prove that I was not closely associated with various institutions. The onus would be on me </para>
                    <para>There is nothing that impresses us so much as that which we do not understand. I have had quite a lot of court experience, and I know the legal  habits  of trying to impress and then brow-heat witnesses or accused persons who are under cross-examination. On many occasions I have acted as an industrial inspector conducting prosecutions, and I have seen people tricked into saying something that was not true or that they did not mean. They became the victims of 'the advocates, and I can see that possibility emerging from this legislation. 1 repeat that the responsibility for all this apathy rests with the trade unionists who take so little interest in union affairs that they do not attend their meetings. They can bc forgiven to some degree because, in 1950, there are many more forms of diversion and entertainment available than there were in, say, 1910 or 1914, when the cinema was in its infancy, radio had not been introduced into Australia and the social evening, musical evening or conversazione was the principal means of entertainment. In those days, working men attended meetings of their trade unions, benefit lodges or labour leagues and were interested in the proceedings because there were not many counter attractions, but the advent of modern entertainments has made them somewhat lazy in this regard and encouraged their apathy. They can sit in a chair on a cold night with their feet up and listen on the radio to the best prima donna, comedian or lecturer. Unfortunately, trade unionists do not realize the value of modern inventions to the employing class ; otherwise, they would try to harness them so that they could be used to their own advantage-. I believe that that could be done. </para>
                    <para>When this legislation was first introduced, the Labour party agreed to give the Government all that it had asked for at the general election, or all that was necessary to enable it to implement the promises that it made then in relation to communism. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> when introducing the bill, said that he would not accept any amend- ments, but we know that, after lengthy debates, 35 amendments were made. The dangerous provisions relating to the onus of proof are still in the bill. If the Prime Minister and his party junta were sincere in their statements that they want to implement this measure, and that they would like the Opposition to assist them in doing so, they would meet the Opposition and endeavour to compose the difference in relation to the onus of proof that exists between the two sides. But the Government has been adamant in insisting that what I believe to be the very dangerous onus of proof provisions shall remain in the bill. Because the Government has been adamant, I suspect that it wishes to retain those provisions foi- a pernicious purpose. I am trying to speak temperately. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> on a wonderful speech, and Senators Benn and Kendall on temperate speeches. They dealt with this subject decently. </para>
                    <para>One of the greatest problems facing the Government is to put value back into the £1, but I am afraid that that is a hurdle that it will not surmount. Value could be put back into the £1 either by revaluing the currency- </para>

                            <para>- I admit that thews are many persons in industry to-day who do not work as hard as they did during and before the war, and I have told them 90. Many of them are soft-pedalling because the iron has entered their souls. They -felt the scourge on their backs for many years, and now, for the first time in their lives, they find themselves in the box seat and are swishing the whip regardless of whom they hurt. I do not agree with their attitude, but I can understand it. I have said in previous debates that the depression was man-made. It was made by the men who went to the bankers and said that they would withdraw the money they had lodged with them on fixed deposit unless they put value back into the £1 for them. The bankers began immediately to call in overdrafts at. short notice, and hundreds and thousands of people were thrown out of work. Then the banks lost control of the situation. The circulating money in a community is the money of men who invest it in one enterprise and then another. They let their money do its work in one enterprise, and then put it back into their pocket. Then they go to their bank managers and ask them to recommend some good shares to buy. When the men with those few pounds in their pockets hear that their friends have been lectured by bank managers on the state of their finances; when they hear their friends say how bad business is; and when they hear what has happened to Jones and what is likely to happen to Robertson because of a bank manager's threats, they become alarmed. They think their money will be safer in their pockets and they keep it there. That is how depressions are caused. 1 am afraid that this Government is wilfully leading Australia towards another depression in order to put value back into the £1. How else can it do so? </para>

                        <para>. - In common with other honorable senators on this side of the chamber I was amazed and amused by the air of despon dency and gloom that was apparent on the faces of supporters of the Government when they learned that the Opposition intended to allow this bill to pass, because they did not want that to happen. It has been apparent for some time that this bill is aimed not at the Communist party, but at the Labour party. This afternoon the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> treated the Senate to his usual outburst. He referred to what he termed was the Government's intention to attack the vicious group of Communists, and he asserted that the Labour Opposition in this chamber was dictated to by the federal executive of the Australian Labour party, comprising twelve men. Although he claimed that the Opposition, is holding up the passage of this measure, it is indeed strange that Government senators have spoken on it one for one with Opposition senators. It is evident that the Government is delaying the passage of the bill because, I repeat, it does not want the bill. Honorable senators opposite are afraid of the consequences of any efforts that the Government may make to implement the provisions of this measure. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator who has just interjected does not refrain from interjecting I shall tell the Senate about the telegram that he sent to me. The Minister had the amazing  affrontery  to make another appeal to the Opposition to expedite the passage of this legislation. At the same time he said that because of Labour's opposition the Communists had been granted six months in which to burn their papers and to go underground. That is a complete lie. If the Minister is not aware of the true position, other responsible members of the Government know that had the Government been sincere it could have banned the Communist party and confiscated its funds and other assets months ago. That is an undeniable fact. The only thing that the Opposition has steadfastly endeavoured to induce the Government to do has been to alter the machinery clauses of the bill. In his usual flambuoyant style the Minister stated that the Government intended to take drastic action to fight this vicious group of Communists. However, it is interesting to reflect on the record of the Minister's industrial activity. I regret that he is not in the chamber at present, because I have before me a cutting from the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> of the 20th January last which contains a report of a statement he made which I intend to discuss.

An attempt was made last night by the Government Leader in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> to close the debate, but it was half-hearted. . . . The original tactic was that there should be one Government  speaker  - the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> - to reply to the  Deputy  Opposition Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna).</inline> Thereafter the Government was to concentrate on getting the bill through. . . . The effect of this has been to drag the debate on. It looks now as if it will be fairly late to-day before the debate is concluded. Government leaders in the Senate could provide no real explanation for the hold-up. One said: "It's the fault of the air - every one likes to talk when we are being broadcast". Another said: "It's a case of one thing leading to another. A Labour member says something and some one on our side feels that he has to reply ". </para>

                            <para>- No, I have read out a newspaper report. Apparently, the Minister is endeavouring to get out of his dilemma. Probably somebody else gave that information to the <inline font-style="italic">Sun.</inline> Although it is stated that the Leader of the Government in this chamber made a half-hearted attempt to close the debate last night, I should have described it as quarter-hearted. It is particularly noticeable that Government senators are very ready to continue the debate when the proceedings of this chamber are being broadcast. The Government has made many attempts in this chamber to have this bill declared an urgent measure, despite the attempts of honorable senators on this side of the chamber to maintain a fight against inflation. In that respect they have been backed by no less a public figure than the repatriated rajah. I refer to the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> who was reported as having said that the problem of inflation was more important than that of defence. </para>

                    <para>Although I have great regard for the ladies in this chamber, I shall refer to statements that were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson.</inline> She said that she was amazed at the statements of some honorable senators. I have no doubt that she is a very truthful person, and I am convinced that her amazement was caused by some of the statements that have been made by supporters of the Government. During her speech an honorable senator on this side of the chamber interjected to the effect that the Communist party had helped the Liberal party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> became very indignant and asserted that the Liberal party had never received any assistance from the Communists. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> has probably heard of the State seat of Prahran in the Parliament of the garden State of Victoria - not in the seventh State of poverty that the present Government is endeavouring to establish. Thousands of citizens in this country were compelled to live in such a state during the regime of anti-Labour governments in the past. The State seat of Prahran wa3 held for many years by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ellis,</inline> a member of the U.A.P. I understand that that abbreviation means unemployment and poverty. As a candidate at the last election in Victoria before he died, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ellis</inline> was opposed by an endorsed Labour candidate and a Communist party candidate, lie was beaten in the preliminary count, but obtained more than 50 per cent, of the Communist preference votes and was able to retain his seat. That is not an isolated instance of the Liberal party being assisted by the Communist party. In the last New South Wales election the Liberal party endorsed a Communist for the Waverley constituency. Of course, when it became generally known that he was a Communist, the Liberal party fell head over heels in its haste to withdraw the endorsement. That was not an isolated instance either. In Victoria, there is a State constituency of Geelong. Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> ever heard of it? On the death of the sitting Labour member, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Brownbill,</inline> who had held the seat for many years, the endorsed Liberal candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montgomery,</inline> was opposed by a Communist candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker,</inline> and a Labour candidate. In the final count, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker's</inline> preferences gave the seat to the Liberal candidate. Yet honorable senators opposite proclaim that they have never received any benefit from the Communist party. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator implied as much or does she now admit that the Liberal party has received support from the Communist party? The honorable senator also said that she condemned dictation to members of Parliament from outside, and she suggested that members of the Liberal party made up their minds in the chamber on the various issues that came before them. Apparently, she does not know everything that happens. Last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> pointed out' how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> was ruthlessly and unceremoniously dumped from the Liberal Senate team in Queensland by a small band of persons who had power to select candidates. 1 make no mention of the consultative committee of the Liberal party in New South "Wales about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> threw a fit last night. Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> ever heard of two ex-Liberal members of parliament in Victoria, one named Edmunds, and the other named Lech te. who were members for Hawthorn and Oakleigh respectively, and were expelled from the Liberal party by a small group of men sitting in Collins-street, headed by a man named McKinnon ? That is proof of outside dictation to the Liberal party when things like that can happen. Will honorable senators opposite not admit that members of the Liberal party were dictated to by the banks during the last election? Do not honorable senators remember that the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> because his ego had been wounded, walked out of the Australian Advisory War Council when this country was at war, and our national existence was at stake? Have honorable senators ever heard of the .expulsion from the Liberal party of " Pistol Packin'  Percy " - in other words, the Honorable P. C. Spender, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Morris Hughes, because they would not follow Mi'. Menzies out of the council ? Yet honorable senators opposite say that their party is not dictated to from outside the Parliament! </para>

                    <para>It is obvious that the Government now realizes that this legislation will not enable it effectively to suppress any political party. I have never seen anything so pathetic as the Attorney-General last night when he was trying frantically to hide the. inability of the Government to do anything effective to suppress the Communist party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> had a lot to say about some one having to carry the baby. We know that the Government does not want to carry the baby in the form of this repressive legislation. The honorable senator said that the Labour party would find that at the next election it would have to deal with triplets. I am confident that, after the next election, we shall come back trebled in strength. At any rate, it is better to have live triplets than a stillborn baby, and that is what the Government has produced in this legislation. It would be better for the Government to admit frankly that it cannot put this legislation into effect, and that it does not really want the bill. It merely wants to hold the legislation as- a threat over the Communists, just as the Victorian Liberal Government used the  Essential Services Act as a throat. The essentia] parts of this bill were passed months ago, and the Government, could have acted on them then if it had wished to do so. My mind goes back to 1940. What did honorable senators opposite call themselves then? Were they members of the Liberal party or of the United Australia party? Apparently, they do not know. Anyway, round about 1.940, an anti-Labour Australian Government banned the Communist party. At the following federal election, two prominent,' self-confessed Communists, in the persons of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ralph</inline> Gibson and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline> O'Dea,  stood for Parliament as Independents. 1 ask the legal luminaries on the other side of this chamber what, will be the position of the Government, if this legislation comes into force, if persons such as those gentlemen seek election to parliament as independents? I suggest that there is nothing in the Constitution or in this legislation to prevent them from standing as independents, or even as Liberal candidates. Of course, they could not stand as Labour candidates, because we do not allow Communists to nominate as Labour candidates. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators opposite condemned the Opposition for allegedly obeying the dictation of twelve persons outside the Parliament, because that amounted to minority rule. There is no need for me to say that the Labour party is the mast democratic party in Australia. That point' has been well made by previous speakers. I. merely point out that a fine example of minority rule has been provided by a recent decision of the Menzies Cabinet on the subject of revaluation of the £1. Three members of the Cabinet are in this chamber at present. It is known to the press and the public that the voting in Cabinet on the question of revaluation was  twelve  to  seven in favour of revaluation. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs ' <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> whether he was one of the twelve who surrendered to minority dictation, or one of the seven who overruled the majority? </para>

                            <para>- I submit that my remarks are definitely connected with the bill because I am speaking of suppression. Honorable senators claim that we have been suppressed by a, small body of men. I contend that a majority of the Cabinet has been suppressed by  a  minority of it. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> mentioned the 1917 strike, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall,</inline> by way of interjection, made the despicable remark that that strike had been led by the present Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> T remind the honorable senator that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones. During World War I., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> did a job of national importance; T know of one gentleman to whom honorable senators opposite owe their allegiance who, after having been trained as an officer at the expense of his country, resigned his commission at the outbreak of war, and remained in a lucrative legal position in this country. </para>

There was little in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford's</inline> speech  that  calls for a reply. He, too, claimed that the Opposition was acting upon an outside direction, but I have already dealt fully with that matter. Mention has been made of the Cain Government in Victoria. At. whose direction was that Government dismissed in 1947? The Government had a majority in the lower house only, and the upper house, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Clarke,. perhaps better known as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir "</inline> Bank "  Clarke,  refused to grant supply and precipitated an election on an issue which was not primarily a State concern at. all. That action was taken at the behest, of private banking interests, becausecertain legislation was before the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

I have no doubt that the purpose of his .trip is to consult with some of his brother King's Counsel in an endeavour to expedite the hearing of the Communist party's appeal to the High Court against this legistlation, and I am sure he is praying to God that the appeal will succeed. </para>

The honorable senator's presence in this chamber seems to me to confirm the rumour that the Liberal party has adopted a new system for admitting members. I am informed that a prospective member has to be examined by two doctors. One looks into each of the candidate's ears, and if the doctors can see each other, he is admitted. I assume that that is how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> became a member of the Libera] party. </para>

                    <para>Tim danger of this bill has been amply demonstrated by honorable senators on this side of the chamber. Fortunately, we have already succeeded in inserting some important amendments. This country would have been in a chaotic state had the measure been, passed by the Parliament in its original form. I am afraid that, upon the proclamation of the measure, even in its amended form, there will be confusion throughout the Commonwealth. What does the Government propose to do with trade union leaders who have been deprived of their right to hold office? What does the Government propose to do about the present Victorian railway strike? Obviously, it cannot imprison or fine all those participating in the strike, or even the leaders of the unions. What practical steps can the Government take under this legislation to end the strike and prevent the recurrence of a similar hold-up ? No reference has been made to these things by honorable senators opposite. This bill is purely an appeal to the emotions of the people. It is designed to cover up the hopelessness and helplessness of the Government ever since it has been in office. Its purpose is to distract attention from the Government's failure to do any of the things that it promised to do prior to the elections. </para>
                    <para>There is no evidence of any attempt by Ministers to curb inflation, or to improve production. The Government's hesitation to revalue the Australian currency has caused dangerous speculation by overseas investors. We are told that " hot " money totalling £300,000,000 or £400,000,000 lias been brought to this country because the Government has advertised its intention eventually to appreciate the Australian £1. Every one knows that twelve members' of the Cabinet favoured appreciation, and only seven opposed it. Shrewd investors know very well that the tail cannot continue to wag the dog, and that, eventually, revaluation will come. . That problem, and many others, have been neglected by the Government, and this legislation has been brought down in an endeavour to cover up the Government's sins of omission and commission. So far the Government has honoured none of its election promises, which included, of course, the undertaking to put value back into the £1. It has no intention of even attempting to fulfil some of its promises, and, to distract the minds of the people from this failure, it is making a great song about the banning of the Communist party. The Government can have the bill. Honorable senators opposite can have their baby, but I warn them that ' when they pick it up they will find that it is more like a porcupine, for it has so many sharp points that they will be glad to drop it on anybody's doorstep to be rid of it. </para>
                    <para>The Government has no intention of implementing the measure. The bill is aimed not at the Communist party, but at the Labour party. That has been made clear by the ranting of honorable senators opposite throughout this debate. We are told that there is dissension in the Labour party. I say that the Labour party is a democratic organization, unlike the Australian Country party, one member of which has already resigned over the currency appreciation issue. The Australian Country party has won the first round against the Liberal party in the revaluation fight. It has pointed the gun at the Liberal party, and has threatened to end the coalition if the Australian currency is appreciated. I assure honorable senators opposite that there is no such dissension in the Labour party, and that there never will be over this issue, because we believe in majority rule. There is no need for me to elaborate on the method by which officials of the Labour party are elected. That has already been adequately explained by other speakers on this side of the chamber. It is sufficient for me to emphasize that the Labour party is a democratic organization in which the principle of majority rule is observed. Now that we have decided to give this bill to the Government, honorable senators opposite are suddenly afraid of it. I have never seen anything so pathetic as the faces of Government supporters when it became known that we intended to withdraw our opposition to the bill. </para>

                            <para>- The Government is no more interested in a double dissolution than is the man in the moon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> knows that his seat at least would be occupied by some one else should an election take place. I have sufficient faith in the intelligence of the people of Queensland to know that he would not be returned to this chamber.. A similar fate would befall many of his colleagues as a result of the hopeless mess that the Government has made of its administration since the 10th December last. All we can get from honorable senators opposite now is a challenge to vote against the bill. They are hoping against hope that we shall vote against the bill because they do not want the responsibility of implementing it. The Government introduced this measure for the purpose of distracting the attention of the people from its sins of omission and commission but, to use a colloquialism, it came a thud. It does not want to have to implement this bill because it realizes that political thought cannot be effec- tively  banned by a legislative enactment. An honorable senator opposite has said that communism is not a political thought. I do not agree with him ; but whether or not communism be a political thought the fact cannot be denied that neither communism, nor any other " ism can be wiped out by suppression. The only effective way to deal with communism or any other similar " ism " is so to improve the conditions of life of the people that they are not attracted by the false promises of any of those who advocate these strange philosophies. That can best be achieved by the return of a Labour government in this Parliament. The people have been completely hoodwinked by the anti-Labour parties. When an honorable senator this afternoon mentioned the Victorian State election of 1947 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> asked what the people did then. We know very well that at that time a campaign of fear had been whipped up by the anti-Labour parties and that the people had been so greatly influenced by it that they were completely hoodwinked. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> should recall that at the last general election in Victoria his party lost all the seats that they had gained at the earlier election and that it was thrown out of office. Prior to the election <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKinnon,</inline> the head of the Liberal party of Victoria, kicked Mr: Edmonds and. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lechte</inline> out of the party because they had the temerity to criticize <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hollway</inline> and his Ministers. When the people are given an opportunity to decide the fate of the Menzies Government they will remember how they were hoodwinked by the specious promises that were made by that gentleman and his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fadden.</inline> They will recall the chaos and confusion that followed the Government's attempt to implement this bill, and they will realize the wisdom of returning a Labour government to carry on the great work that was commenced by the Curtin and Chifley Labour Governments. </para>

                    <para>The people are aware of the grave dangers that are inherent in this bill. They fear that its provisions may be used by this Government to victimize innocent people. The Prime Minister, in his second-reading speech, when this bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives. named a number of men as Communists who, he said, would be declared under it, but on the very next day he had to swallow some of his words and admit that his list of Communists contained many mistakes. That fact alone indicates the grave dangers inherent in this legislation. The Government has never really wanted to implement the provisions of the bill, nor did it expect to have to do so. Now that we have decided not to oppose the bill the Government realizes the difficulties which it will encounter in attempting to implement it. It realizes too, that this hill, far from stamping out communism in this country, will cause industrial chaos and confusion. The Labour party did its best to make the bill workable, but its proposals were rejected by the Government. We now throw responsibility for the implementation of this legislation fairly and squarely on the Government. Months ago we agreed to pass the main clauses of the bill which would have enabled  the Government to ban the Communist party, to expropriate Communist property and to prevent Communists from holding office in key unions and in the Public Service. The Government rejected our offer and insisted on the retention vin the bill of the iniquitous onus of proof clauses. We have done our best to protect the liberty of the people and to prevent innocent people from, being wrongfully declared. We now leave it to the Government to implement this legislation as best it can. Like the Irishman with a wheelbarrow, it has its job before it. I trust that the people will realize the great mistake that they made on the 10th December last and that before the normal effluxion of time a Labour government will again be in office in this Parliament. </para>

In order to create the correct atmosphere I propose to preface my remarks by reading an extract from a broadcast speech made by the Labour Prime Minister in the United Kingdom, the Eight Honorable Clement Attlee, as recently as the 30th July last.

Communists, whether they make war in Korea or cause disruption in Malaya, India or Burma, whether they destroy the liberties of the Czechs and Poles, or try to wreck the economic recovery of Britain, France or Australia, aru all engaged in an attempt to mould the whole world to their pattern of tyranny. They seek to sweep democracy and liberty from the world. They are ready to destroy our lives if we do not agree with them. They talk of freedom while they murder it. They talk of peace while they support aggression. They are ruthless and unscrupulous hypocrites who pretend to virtues which their philosophy rejects. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am sure that the overwhelming majority of the people of Australia share those sentiments. That being so, it can well be imagined that the decision of the Australian Labour party not to oppose this measure must have been received by them with a certain amount of gratitude and relief not unmingled with a certain amount of contempt for the manner in which the decision was made. The stature of the Australian Labour party would have been considerably enhanced had its change of attitude been actuated by a change of heart, particularly on a matter which affects so vitally the safety and security of our country. Unfortunately, such was not the case. The Parliamentary Labour party has cravenly and, if we are to pay any regard to the speeches of honorable senators opposite, in bad faith betrayed its parliamentary responsibilities to a. body which was not elected by the Parliament or the people, and which is not answerable to, or removable by, the people. In words of shame and humiliation it has indelibly recorded for a.U time the fact that no pledge given by it can be certain of being given effect to and that any decision made by it might have to be abandoned, varied or altered, or in fact dealt with especially by being carried out. How can this once proud party again go before the electors and promise them anything? The hundreds of thousands of solid Australians who through the years </para>
                    <para class="block">Lave seen the gradual disintegration of the once great Australian Labour party will, I am sure, seriously lament this sell-out of its political soul. The act of people in changing their views, whether political or otherwise, is not necessarily reprehensible or a matter for adverse criticism. We have seen many instances of such changes. In this instance we have been faced with the spectacle of a change of attitude which was unaccompanied by a change of view. In many instances the changes that have characterized the political lives of many people who have made real contributions to the development and progress of their country have been the result of enlightenment or conviction or on account of a principle. Generally, they have been made at the risk of political oblivion. Rarely if ever in the history of parliamentary government in this or any other country has political principle been betrayed for the sake of servile security. These may be regarded as severe words. They were provoked by the very severe words that wore used by Opposition senators when the bill was first introduced and they described it as violating human dignity, human decency, and human rights. In order to emphasize my point I propose to refer to the stand taken by Lord Milverton, a man who spent the best years of his life in the service of the British Labour party. Speaking as a Labour peer in the House of Lords on the Steel Nationalization Bill in June, 1949, Lord Milverton said - </para>

                        <para>I have been told that I knew the Labour programme when I. joined the Labour party. That is true. I knew it in outline; but I did not, in joining, sign away my right to think; nor did I anaesthetise my conscience or my principles, nor, I hope, did I lose the power to learn. 1 had certain aims and ideals, and T thought that the Labour party could, in vulgar parlance, "deliver the goods". I am now appalled at the type of goods which are being delivered under a false trade label - the national interest. I thought I was participating in a crusade and 1 found myself a camp follower in a " rake's progress ". I am one of a large number of people of independent minds who saw the merit of the Labour party programme of social justice,, but who are now beginning to feel uneasy about the lengths to which the rest of that programme is taking them. </para>

                    <para class="block">The noble lord, after having spent a lifetime  of  service in the British Labour party, was cast into political oblivion because he stood for his principles. Here, Opposition senators have made a complete about face, not because of any change of view, but purely and simply because of a change of orders. That is a clear case of a man whose heart, in his earlier and more immature years, ruled his head at the expense of his judgment. As an older, more experienced and more mature man, he realized that not only did the Labour party not offer an exclusive haven for idealists who also wanted to be realists, but that in that tough, unbending, tyrannical atmosphere there was no room for idealism and realism to co-exist. Compare the attitude of that man - and his is only one of many instances in which people have risked political oblivion for the sake of conviction or principle - with the attitude of honorable senators opposite. I challenge any one who thinks I am wrong to correct me when I say that not one honorable senator has indicated his willingness, desire, intention or courage to vote against this bill. If there are two such honorable gentlemen, let them call for a division and put their colleagues on the spot. If there are two, they can secure a division on this bill. The Government would welcome a division, but if it calls for one it would mean that those two honorable senators would have to vote in accordance with their voices. If honorable senators opposite are in any doubt as to where they stand and if they are not voting against their conscience, or permitting by their silence, a bill to pass which they in their hearts claim to be the greatest betrayal in parliamentary history, I appeal to them to take a stand on it. </para>
                    <para>Shades of the great Australian Labour party! There was a time, and within living memory, too, when it did have some idealism, when it had a certain amount of spiritual significance for and upon the lives of the people. There were men, again within living memory, who at the slightest suggestion that a law was an unjustifiable infringement of natural human rights or dignity, would fight for its removal. Even the most mild backbencher would fight tooth and nail and even to the point of political extinction rather than, in abject and shameful  silence, permit the passage of a measure that he considered to be a betrayal of the people's rights and interests. The voice and the vote of honorable senators opposite could destroy this bill. They can if they wish, prevent this so-called iniquitous measure from going on to the statute-book, and they can take the Government before the people. </para>

                        has described the bill as a vicious, rotten piece of totalitarianism. God forbid the day to dawn when we on this side of the chamber, by our absence or silence, permit to go unchallenged a measure about which we feel so strongly, even if it means going into political oblivion ! I do not see how the people of Australia are to retain any respect for a party which has it in its power to prevent such a measure from being placed on the statute-book and while holding the beliefs it says it does fails to exercise that power. The Government is prepared to let the people be the judges, but the Opposition is not. Labour senators opposite are in a cleft stick. If they really believe that this bill violates the very fundamentals of natural justice and common decency, and yet are not prepared to take the only effective measures to stop it from passing through the Senate what will the people think of them? On the other hand the members of the Opposition may not really believe that the bill violates those principles because it is really difficult to conceive that honorable senators who were elected by free, independent electors to represent them here in Parliament, to cast free, untrammelled and independent votes, would do nothing whatever to prevent the passage of a bill that contained all those evils. But that is the position, or else the Labour senators for the past six months have been mouthing hypocritical humbug.. They cannot have it both ways. I believe that the people of Australia will say that their attitude is a craven betrayal of political principles for the sake of ensuring servile security in the decayed and decadent bosom of the once great Australian Labour party.
                    </para>
                    <para>What is the result of the Opposition attitude? There has been a delay of six months in dealing with what we on this side of the chamber believe, and what I am quite sure the Australian people believe, to be a real live threat to our national existence and security. Six months' delay has been afforded the Communists by the Labour party tactics. Honorable senators opposite place great reliance on newspaper reports, and from to-day's newspapers we learn that in the backyards of certain trades halls records are being burnt because it appears, so the newspapers say, that the hour of doom is approaching. The Communist party has had that six months' protection afforded it, and it has had six months in which to prepare against the day when the weight of this legislation will fall upon it. Then, after all that delay, there is an abject and servile surrender by Parliamentary representatives on a matter of expediency, not of principle. I repeat, and I hope that I shall have the opportunity of repeating it on the hustings very soon, that this change of attitude of the members of the Opposition in the Senate has been brought about not by a change of mind, opinion or principle, but entirely by dictation from outside, while they still profess to hold the same views as they have previously expressed. That change represents a public declaration that the Australian Labour party lacks the courage to meet the Government before the tribunal of the people. The Opposition knew quite well that if this bill were not put on the statute-book the Government would appeal successfully to the people. Members of the Australian Labour party say they are protecting the people, and they say that this legislation is an infringement of the people's rights. If that is so, why do they not go out and let the  peple  decide whether they want this legislation or not? The members of the Government are prepared to meet them there. In the days gone by, the once great and militant Australian Labour party fought valiantly for its principles and' ideals, regardless of petty risks, but where is it now? </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I merely say that this bill is directed only against those who are the servile slaves of an alien power seeking to destroy our country by sowing the seeds of social discontent and by other foul means. Wo Australian, no matter how radical his political views or how militant he may be in his industrial activities, need have any fear whatever of coming within the ambit of this bill as long as he is faithful to his fellows and loyal to his country. The Government recognizes the important and responsible part played in our industrial and economic life by the great trade union movement, and it also appreciates that the only alternative to a powerful, representative, democratically controlled trade union movement is industrial chaos. It is because of those and other reasons already stated in this chamber and elsewhere .that I commend this bill to the Senate in complete confidence that it will be hailed with relief and satisfaction throughout Australia and condemned and resisted only by the enemies of Australia. </para>

                        <para>, - I wish to refer to the, definition of "Communist". As it is defined, " Communist " means a person who supports or advocates the objectives, policies, teachings or practices of communism as expounded by Marx and Lenin. I wish to draw the attention of the committee to the fact that in placing this bill before the Senate the Government has gone far beyond the proposals that it put before the people last November and December. I should also like to refer to what appeared on page 15 of the joint policy speech relating ,to communism. I shall read them to the com'mittee so that I can develop my points from references to the exact words of the speech. The first passage that I wish to read is as follows: - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <quote>
                        <para>No person now a member of the Communist party shall be employed or paid a fee by 'the Commonwealth, nor shall any such person be eligible for any office in a registered industrial organization. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The first point that I make is that that pledge related to persons who, on the 10th November, 1949, were members of the Communist party, but the measure covers persons who were members of the Communist party at any time after the 10th May, 194S. Retrospective effect has been given to that pledge. If I confine the passage that I have just read to the point that I wish to make eventually, it reads, " No person who, on the 10th November, 1949, is a member of the Communist party, shall be eligible for any office in a registered industrial organization ". The Prime Minister also said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The laws with respect to sedition or other subversive activities will be reviewed and strengthened. Conviction under such  laws  will disqualify from employment under the </para>
                        <para>Crown  or from office in a registered organization. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The Government put two propositions to the people. It said, first, " "We shall render ineligible for trade union office those persons who, on the 10th November, 1949, were members of the Australian Communist party ". They had to be, not only members of that party but also members of it on the date on which the right honorable gentleman delivered his speech. The Government said to the people, secondly, that only persons who were convicted under the laws of Australia - I emphasize the word " convicted " ; it means convicted in accordance with the usual procedures of the law - would be taken out of employment in the Public Service and from office in registered trade unions. Putting those two propositions together, the Government told the people that this legislation would be directed against persons who were members of the Communist party on the 10th November, 1949, and that it would apply only to those who were convicted by the courts of the land under the then existing laws of the land. Has there been any review of the laws with respect to sedition or other subversive activities? "We have not been told whether there has or has not been a review. Have those laws been strengthened ? Honorable senators know perfectly well that, in ten months we have not had a measure before us affecting those laws. There is no indication in this bill that only persons convicted under the laws relating to sedition and other subversive activities will be taken out of employment in the Public Service or from office in registered trade unions. </para>
                    <para>The definition of " Communist " is drawn in the wide terms to which I have referred. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer),</inline> on a prior occasion in this chamber, intimated that " communism" in the definition means communism in its total concept - in its totality. There are many things in communism that are accepted by honorable senators on both sides of this chamber. Graduated income tax, free education and the decentralization of industry are all planks of the platforms of modern political parties. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> whether the definition means that nobody who supports or espouses something short of the full concept of communism will be declared. If that be the case, at what point will the distinction be made? Will the definition let out people who believe in communism  as an abstract philosophy but are not prepared to be revolutionary? Will it let out those who believe in 50 per cent, of the Communist platform but not in the other 50 per cent. ? I should like the Minister to answer those questions. </para>
                    <para>A person may, under this bill, be declared to be a Communist under two heads; first, because he was a member of the Australian Communist party at any time after the 10th May, 1948; and secondly, because he is a Communist within the meaning of the definition, although he has no association necessarily with the Australian Communist party. Persons right outside that party are intended to be picked up by the definition. Clause 9 makes it perfectly clear that declarations can be made in respect of members of the Australian Communist party and other persons who fit the definition. The application of the bill is far wider than was suggested to the people at the general election. The Government could direct a declaration against an individual in this country who did not hold office in a trade union or a position in the Public Service, and who had no thought of being employed in either capacity. Pursuant to the definition, the Government would have power to declare a person who, in its opinion, was a Communist and a danger to the defence and security of this country so that he could never be eligible for employment in the Public Service or to hold office in a trade union. I suggest that, in the respects that I have indicated, the Government has gone far beyond the propositions that it put to  the  Australian people. </para>

                        when the clause was before the committee on a. previous occasion. I do not propose to elaborate the reply that was given then by the Attorney-General.

                        he pointed out that Christian churches have a lot in common. Unitarians, Presbyterians, Methodists and Baptists believe in God and in the fundamentals of Christianity, yet it cannot be said that each of those denominations is. in its totality, identical with the others. A churchman associated with them would know which was which.

I believe that the Government has missed the bus by adopting this definition of " Communist ". I do not think the Australian public is very much concerned whether a person advocates a particular philosophy, especially if the philosophy was expounded over 100 years ago. Communists are hated in this country to-day because they owe allegiance to an international power, but there is no mention in the definition of the international characteristics of communism. If a strike occurs and there is a certain degree of right on the side of the strikers, the Australian people always have some sympathy with them, but when a strike is called for purely political motives, designed to further the objectives of the </para>

                        <para>. - It has been said by honorable senators on this side of the chamber that the Government is not concerned so much with members of the Communist party as it is with members of trade unions, especially those who are regarded as militants. The absence of a precise definition of " Communist " makes it possible for the Government to accuse of being a. Communist anybody who advocates certain planks of the platform of the Labour party. Many of the measures advocated by Marx and Engels in 1848 are now planks of the platforms of all parties in the Parliament. Marx and Engels, in their <inline font-style="italic">Manifesto of the Communist Party,</inline> advocated the abolition of property in land and the confiscation of  ground rents to the State. Those are classed as single taxers now. They advocated a heavily progressive income tax. All parties agree with that, and have imposed a tax of that kind. Marx and Engels urged the abolition of inheritance, but we have not gone as far as that. They advocated the confiscation of the property of emigrants and rebels. That is what the Government proposes to do under this measure. It regards the Communists as rebels and proposes to confiscate their property. Marx and Engels advocated the centralization of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly. The Labour party has advocated the nationalization of banking, and will continue to do so. Under this definition, every member of the Labour party who stands on a public platform and advocates the nationalization of banking could be declared a Communist. </para>

                    <para>Therefore according to the definition, members of both sides of this chamber could be declared Communists if they advocated that programme. This is palpably ridiculous. I shall refer now to a question that was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham</inline> in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, on the 28th March last, in relation to the employment of Communists in the Education Department, which was referred to during the recent Communist inquiry in Victoria. In his reply, the Minister for Lands, on behalf of the Minister for Education, furnished the names of three persons, whom I shall not mention. In the latter part of his question <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham</inline> asked whether the Government approved of the employment of Communists in the Education Department. The answer was - </para>

                        <para>The Government does not approve of the employment of Communists in the Education Department. The only power for the dismissal of Communist teachers is that contained in sections 55 and 58 of the Public Service Act, 1946, the provisions of these two sections being applied to the teaching service by section 60 of the Teaching Service Act, 1946. The persona named were in the service of the Education Department during the whole period of the previous Government, and no action was taken by that government to amend the law to provide for the dismissal of Communists from the teaching service of the Education Department. </para>

                    <para class="block">The previous government referred to was the Hollway Government. That answer proves conclusively that the Government was concerned not so much about a few Communists, as about an all-embracing definition to pick up anybody but Communists. It  show3  how perfectly ridiculous are the recitals in the preamble to this bill, and the definition of Communist. Anybody who advocates modern measures which are not revolutionary, but merely evolutionary, or a modification of capitalistic conditions, according to the definition could be declared and punished as Communists. This proves that the Government desires not so much to abolish communism, or to penalize Communists, as to disintegrate the unions, in a manner somewhat similar to that suggested in. a proposition that was made to the Bruce-Page Government when a referendum was taken in 192'6 on the question of amending the Constitution which included the right to dissolve industrial organizations. The referendum was overwhelmingly . defeated by the people. I repeat that this all-embracing definition has been included in the bill not specifically to deal with Communists, or the Communist party, but to deal with the trade unions and their members. </para>

                        <para>. - I express my dissatisfaction with the answer that has been supplied by the Minister. It is not sufficient to say that he relies upon an answer that was furnished to a somewhat similar question on some other occasion. I put it to him that when supporters of the present Government were wooing the electors, they stated that they would, if returned to power, take out of the Public Service, and out of the trade unions, two classes of people - those who were members of the Communist party on a particular date, and those who were convicted in the courts of the land. I thought that I had made it clear to the Senate this evening that the Government had gone far beyond those two classes of persons, and that, under this bill, it would be in a position to attach the label " Communist " to anybody that it selected, when what it put to the people was that it would have to be assured that a man was a member of the Communist party, or a person who had been convicted of sedition in the ordinary courts of the land. This very broad definition of " Communist ", which enables that tag to be attached to any person in the community, is a very great extension of what was put to the people. I want the Senate to understand that that label mav be attached to any individual in Australia, so as to prevent him from ever becoming eligible for service in a trade union or in the Public Service. It does not matter that he may never contemplate such service. I am pointing out that this is a grave and undue extension of the pledge and the promise that the Government made to the people at that time, and in the absence of any specific denial of that by the Minister, my proposition stands. </para>

                        <para>. - When this matter was first discussed I expressed my amazement at the scope of the definition of "Communist". I now wish to make an observation on a different aspect of the matter from that which was dealt with by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> According to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer),</inline> a person would have to accept this philosophy in its totality. Apparently, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> lias no ideas about the matter. I am quite sure that a good lawyer with a knowledge of sociology could show con clusively that Stalinites do not support Marxism in its entirety. Marx did not do things that many Stalinites have done during the last twenty years. According to leading socialists in the world, Stalinties are not Marxists. Stalinites have been described by members of the Labour party in Great Britain as conspirators. The Social Democrats in Germany and Prance also have been regarded as conspirators. No one could maintain that Stalinites are Marxists in the sense that they accept the philosophy of Marx in its totality. Lenin himself admitted that if he was confronted with antagonistic people outside Russia. he would resort to the new economic policy, which was a step back towards Marxism. I do not know who framed the definition of " Communist " in this bill, but I should not be surprised if it was conceived by the honorable^ member for Mackellar in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth).</inline> It is the most assinine and stupid definition that it is possible to imagine. As has been pointed out by another honorable senator on this side of the chamber, it does not deal with the international conspiratorial aspect of the subject at all. I am convinced that even if a man said that he was a Stalinite, a good lawyer with a knowledge of sociology) would have no difficulty in showing that he had not violated at least 50 per cent, of the teachings of Marx, and would not, therefore, be liable to prosecution under this measure. Although honorable senators opposite stated repeatedly, early in the debate, that the Government required this bill urgently, when it was announced that the Opposition would allow the passage of the measure, honorable senators opposite directed a tirade of abuse at the Opposition. They cannot have it both ways. I submit that this assinine and elementary definition of " Communist ", which is absolutely absurd, should be re-framed. </para>

                        <para>, - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is partly right. There will be complete immunity for any industrial organization registered under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State. The honorable senator mentioned the hypothetical case of an industrial organization which, having been registered, becomes deregistered by order of the court. That could happen only if the court found that the organization had violated an industrial law, or disobeyed an order of the court. That, however, would not in itself be sufficient. It would also have to be such an organization as Ls described in paragraphs (a) to <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> of sub-clause (1.). That is, it would have to be affiliated with the Australian Communist party; or a majority of its members or a majority of its committee of management would have to be members of the Communist party; or its policy would need to be directed, controlled, S] aped or influenced, wholly or substantially, by Communists. In other words, it would have to be substantially a Communist organization. </para>

                            <para>- That is the point I am making. This is a most important matter. As I have said, an organization may consist of 3,000 members. On its controlling authority of ten members there may be, say, six who come within the provisions of paragraph (6). As those six constitute a majority of the controlling authority, I take it that under this clause the whole organization can be declared to be unlawful. </para>

                        This clause appears to be an extraordinary attack on trade unions. The Minister has not made any attempt to give honorable senators on this side of the chamber a clear answer. Paragraph
                        <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline>
                        deals with organizations, the policy of which is directed by members of the Communist party or by persons who advocate the principles of communism. Does this clause mean that the whole of such an organization may be declared?

If the honorable senator did say that I have no hesitation in saying that he does not understand the bill. Clause 5 (a) deals with any body of persons that is affiliated with the Australian Communist party. We can put that to one side. If an organization is affiliated with the Communist party there is no question about the Government's right to declare it. Then we come to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> to which reference has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash.</inline></para>

                            <para>- If that is so, it is all right; but that is not what I understood the Minister to say in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash.</inline> What he said on that occasion may have been a slip of the tongue, but it is clear now that (a), (6) and (c) are not cumulative conditions, but alternatives. Coming now to the second point mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> in relation to paragraph (fe), my view of the matter is that the Government is completely free to declare unlawful, and to dissolve, a body if six out of ten members of its management committee are Communists. The whole organization, even if it consists of 3,000 members can be dissolved and its property confiscated. The Governor-General - in effect, the Executive Government - must be prepared to make a declaration first that the body is, in effect, Communistcontrolled and secondly, that it is a danger to security. The entire organization is dissolved, its 3,000 members disbanded, and its property confiscated. I submit that under this clause no action can be taken either to declare the six Communist members of the committee, or any of the 3,000 members of the organization. </para>

The organization must also come within the provisions of sub-clause (2.) before it can be declared.

                            <para>- The bill deals with institutions the principal objective of which is the destruction of the security of this country. If  a  misguided person has contributed to the funds of an organization which is not patently carrying on nefarious work, but which is subsequently declared, nothing in this bill would prevent him from making an application to the Commonwealth for the refund of all moneys so contributed. Under the provisions of clause 8 the property and assets of a dissolved organization are to be vested in a Commonwealth receiver and become Commonwealth property. All applications for the return of moneys paid to a dissolved organization under misapprehension as to its true purposes, will be dealt with by the receiver on their merits. There is no need to provide legislatively for such cases. </para>

The declaration made under the provisions of sub-clause (2.) states, first, that the individual concerned is a Communist, and secondly, that he is engaged in activities that are prejudicial to the security and defence of the Commonwealth. Under sub-clause (4.) a right is given to the declared person to apply to a court to have the declaration set aside. I submit that such a person may apply to the court solely on the allegation by the Governor-General that he is a Communist and that he will have no right of access to the court on the allegation that he is engaged in activities prejudicial to the security and defence of the Commonwealth. Does the Minister agree with that proposition ? </para>

If the declaration is not in fact an allegation of crime, what kind of allegation is it? Would the Minister regard it as praise of the individual or a reference of good character? How otherwise could it be regarded  than  as an allegation of treason, subversion, sedition and sabotage? </para>

                            <para>. -  I shall answer first the last of the honorable senator's questions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has a very good idea of the circumstances which he contemplates, and so also has his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong.</inline> When this matter was debated some time ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> said, " We do not need an act of Parliament in order to sack people. We know those who are dangerous and not fit to be in the Public Service and we can sack them out of hand." Referring to the members of the Stevedoring Industry Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> said, in effect, "  When  we found that they were not behaving in a fit and proper manner, and that they were not worthy of the trust and confidence of the Government, we abolished the board and removed  its  members from office". <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is  well  aware that in many instances insufficient evidence may be available on which to found a criminal prosecution against a member of  the  Public .Service  but  there may be  good  reason for taking action against  him.  Probably we would err more on  the  side of generosity than he would. </para>

                        <para>.- I thank  the  Minister  for  Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> for his very interesting commentary. Unfortunately it did  not  constitute an answer to my question. If  the  allegation that a, man is engaged in activities that are prejudicial to  the  security and defence of  the  Commonwealth is  not.  an allegation of a crime, what is it? The Minister has completely evaded  the  question. However, as I do not wish to delay the committee, I shall proceed to my next question. Sub-clause (5.) reads as follows : - </para>

Notice of the declaration would in the first instance appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> As the honorable senator has indicated, it is conceivable that the notice published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> would not be seen by the person concerned. Provision is made in the bill for the making of regulations. I am certain that that aspect will be properly covered by regulation in order to ensure that the declared person shall have reasonable time within which to take action to have the declaration set aside.. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">What the Minister did not pose to the committee is that, first, the company or organization must, in the ordinary courts of the land, be proved to have committed an offence. It must first be charged and convicted. An abstract body like a corporation cannot be punished by imprisonment, and individuals must be held responsible for its actions. It is provided that the directors or committee of management should be held responsible for an offence committed by that organization unless they can show that they did not know of it or took steps to prevent its commission. The great difference between the procedure under this measure that the Government seeks to justify and the procedure under the act cited by the Minister is that in the latter case an offence must first be proved, by the ordinary processes of law and in the ordinary courts of the land, to have been committed by the corporation. A corporation, being unable to act on its own, must act through individuals. Therefore, every director is liable to be punished for the offence committed by the corporation unless he can establish either that he knew nothing about it or took proper steps to prevent it. Under this measure, no offence need be established. If an individual wishes to refute the allegations made against him, he must go into the witness box, give evidence and present his case. He may, as the Minister said, be given leave to adduce evidence in rebuttal at a later stage. </para>
                    <para>Let us consider the plight of an individual who is declared to be a Communist. I should like to sec one honorable senator opposite who has a wide experience of the law handling a case of that kind. It having been alleged that -his client was .a Communist and a danger to the security of this country, I should like to bear his comments when he was told that no particulars of either allegation would be supplied to him.  His  client could not apply to a court at all in respect, of the allegation that, in effect, he was a traitor. The honorable senator would ask his client, " Why do they say that, you are a Communist?" Under this measure, a person can be declared to be a Communist if he was a member pf the Australian Communist party. Clause  25  provides that evidence that a person distributed Communist literature, attended a meeting of the Communist party, wrote anything in support of the Communist party or that his name appeared on documents found in Marx House, in the possession of a Communist or in the possession of -any person anywhere in Australia, if there is any presumption that the document may be a list of Communist party members, shall be evidence that that person was a member of the Communist party. Where would the lawyer begin to prepare the defence? He would ask his client, " What is the allegation? Is it that you are a member of the Communist party, that you have attended a meeting of the party?", and so on through the various heads to which I have referred. He would ask, " Is the allegation that you espouse communism? If so, what did you say, and where and when did you say it ? " He would tell his client, " I am in a hopeless position to present a case on your behalf, because I do not know the case that I have to meet ". That is the criticism that wc level against this provision. </para>
                    <para>Yesterday, the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> referred to the Black Marketing Act as a measure in .which the onus of proof is thrown upon a person charged. The section of that act that he read is identical with the section of the National Emergency (Coal Strike) Act to which the Minister for Trade and Customs referred. The Black Marketing Act provided that where an offence was proved to have been committed by a corporation, the directors of the corporation were to be held liable unless they could establish that they did not know of the offence or took steps to ensure its prevention. That provision and the provision now before the committee are not comparable. </para>
                    <para>I had no desire to embark upon a debate on this matter until the Minister, unable to resist dragging in the name of the right honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> referred to the National Emergency (Coal Strike) Act. </para>

                        <para>. - Am I to- understand from the reply given by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> that, of the many persons in Australia who are likely to be declared to be Communists or subversive persons under the very wide definition of " Communist " in this 'bill, the only ones who may be deprived of their livelihood are those employed in the service of the Commonwealth or holding office in a trade union? Does the Minister mean that, apart from persons of the type to which I have referred,' anybody can be a Communist, espouse the cause of communism and be a subversive person, but suffer no penalty other than that of being declared under- this measure? </para>

                        <para>. - The only penal provisions in the bill  are those contained in clause <inline font-style="italic">1,</inline> relating to persons who continue to act in violation of the legislation. This clause applies, not to every officer of a trade union, hut to officers of organizations connected with vital industries. The only disability from which such a person would suffer as a result of a declaration being made against him is that he would be ineligible to hold office in a trade union connected with a vital industry. </para>
