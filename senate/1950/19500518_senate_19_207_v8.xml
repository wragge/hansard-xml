              <para>  - Last evening, honorable senators saw a bonny picture of some of the beautiful gardens of England, and were impressed by the efforts that had been made to beautify railway stations and canal locks in that country. The Canberra railway station is an eyesore, and I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior whether he will confer with his colleague with a view to getting something done to beautify the station, either by providing a new building, or by laying out flower beds in the vicinity?

I now ask the Attorney-General whether the Government's powers are, not now greatly extended in comparison with what they were in 1906, when the last royal commission was held, and whether the recent amendment to the Constitution on the subject of health does not now give the Commonwealth power to make any inquiry into health that it desires and to carry out any action' that such an inquiry might show to be necessary. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest that questions which seek legal opinions regarding the meaning of constitutional provisions are, to say the least, not in order. However, in relation to the particular matter that the honorable senator has raised, I point out that the constitutional alteration to which he has referred relates, if I recollect aright, to the provision of medical and dental services and goes no further than that. Offhand, I doubt whether the powers of the Commonwealth in relation to the matter to which the honorable senator ' has&gt; referred are greater now than they were in 1906. As I have said, I hesitate to advance a final opinion on such a question offhand. </para>

If so, will the Minister inform the Senate of the percentage of . money that eventually reaches these charities? Will the Government consider appointing a committee to investigate whether the tours' of other countries by these undoubtedly beautiful young ladies may not, in countries with different standards from ours, cause the very opposite to the goodwill that we' an told Australia obtains through' these, tours and to give consideration to the .-moral effect of this exploitation of our young womanhood in the interests of blatant advertising campaigns conducted under the cloak of charity? </para>

The actual conduct of these contests and the control of the funds that are collected by their means is, I understand, a matter for the States under their legislation. The only funds over which the Commonwealth has control are patriotic funds. I. suggest that the honorable senator place his question on the notice-paper. I shall then have it referred to the appropriate authorities and shall have an answer supplied to him. </para>

Will the Go,vernment give consideration to achieving a uniform divorce law for the whole of the Commonwealth based on humane grounds, with similar laws for husband and wife? Will he also give consideration, if possible, to the introduction of legislation to prevent the publication of evidence in all divorce suits, except the names of the parties and the decision of the court? </para>

                        <para>- I think that the honorable senator will appreciate the fact that the matter to which he has referred is one which involves very great difficulties indeed. I should not be prepared to make any declaration of policy in regard to that matter in an answer to a question. It is very easy to contemplate the possibility of having a uniform divorce law for the whole of the Commonwealth, but when it comes to working .out the precise terms of such a law, great difficulties make themselves apparent owing to the varying character of the State divorce laws as they are at present. </para>

                            <para>- For some time representations have been made in regard to a suggestion that a law making lunacy a ground for divorce should be made uniform throughout Australia. As the honorable senator has said, it is a ground for divorce in some States. Those who seek to have it made a ground for divorce throughout Australia apparently overlook the fact that there is nothing to prevent State parliaments from making it a ground in their own States. Uniformity could readily be obtained by State action. </para>

                            <para>- There is no difficulty whatever, and it might well be that those who desire to get that provision in a State where at present lunacy is not a ground for divorce would more effectively advance their cause, by pressing their State legislators to make it a ground. It seems rather unsatisfactory for the Commonwealth to approach the question of uniform divorce laws merely in relation to one ground rather than to deal with the whole subject. </para>

                        <para>- The matter to which the honorable senator has referred has been receiving my attention comparatively recently. It was placed before mc not along the lines of the Commonwealth building homes, but of the  Commonwealth  subsidizing or assisting other people who require that much needed facility from the National Welfare Fund. At the moment, the matter is being investigated by the permanent head of my department. </para>

                        <para>- In the past the Repatriation Commission has acted as agent for the British Ministry of Pensions in matters affecting Imperial exservicemen. Considerable difficulty and delay frequently occurred because papers concerning particular ex-servicemen had to be sent to London before decisions could be made on the eligibility of applicants for war pensions and other benefits. Recently, at the request of the Australian Government, the British Government sent an official of the Ministry of Pensions to Australia. He visited all States, and subsequently recommended that a permanent officer should be appointed to Australia to deal with British  ex-servicemen. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calder</inline> has been appointed to that position, and since his arrival in this country he has toured all States and met British exservicemen's organizations. He has now obtained an office in Melbourne. <inline font-style="italic">Ml</inline> applications are forwarded to him before they are submitted to the British Ministry of Pensions. The appointment of this official should minimize delay and reduce complaints in the settlement of British ex-servicemen's claims.  His  official title is " Representative of the British Ministry of Pensions ", and his address is " Care of Headquarters, Repatriation Department, St. Kilda-road, Melbourne". </para>

The articles had been sold and the importers encountered difficulty in obtaining from the purchasers the extra customs charges that had been levied. Can the Minister say whether initial customs charges are assessed and collected on an E. &amp; O.E. basis, and that  under-collections  of charges, as the result of wrong computations or incorrect classifications, are collected from importers up to twelve months from the date of the issue of the original assessment? If that be so, will the Minister endeavour to ensure that initial assessments are checked and importers advised of the position within three weeks of the issue of the assessments, so that embarrassment of purchasers and distributors of imported goods may be avoided? </para>

                        <para>. - In continuing my speech on this bill, I  propose  to answer some of the observations of honorable senators.. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> said that the Government's proposal to appoint a board to control the Commonwealth Bank was a simple proposition. I wonder whether he really meant that. He added that, in the case of a dispute between the Treasurer and the board over a matter of policy, the issue would be referred to the Parliament for settlement. Of course, Ave  know that so long as the present Government remains in office, there will not be any disputes over policy between it and the bank board that is to be appointed. However, for the sake of argument, let us assume that a dispute occurs  over  such a matter as the exchange rate, or a proposal to appreciate the Australian £1 in relation to sterling. Does the Attorney-General seriously suggest that such an issue would be bandied about in the Parliament, and decided by the Parliament after debate? Of course, we know that, in fact, the members of the bank board will always apply Government policy, and that the Treasurer will uphold the board. </para>

                        <para>The importance of monetary policy has frequently been stressed in Parliament and the fact that it has a significant effect upon the welfare of the people has been fully recognized. Although it is easy to fall into the error of thinking that monetary policy can cure all economic ills, it is nevertheless true, as the Prime Minister pointed out in his policy speech, that great financial decisions, if they are wron?, arc wrong on so vast a scale as to injure many thousands of people. We therefore believe that such decisions should not be made by one man either in the Bank or in th» Government. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is sufficient to say, in reply, that from 1941, when the Curtin Government introduced regulations barring the private banks from certain activities, it could have over-ridden any decision that the bank board had reached. Those regulations were later put into legislative form. No honorable senator opposite can question the efficiency of the Commonwealth Bank since 1941. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has rightly put it, the men who were in control of the bank after 1941 are men of the highest integrity. During my service in this Parliament, I have come in contact with such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Wheeler, Professor Melville, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Roland</inline> Wilson, and I say that no doubt c;m be cast upon their high integrity. The present Government could not find better men for appointment to the proposed bank hoard. It is worth repeating that those men, who were at the head of the financial affairs of this country during the war years when many national and international agreements were reached, could have been dislodged from their positions by the GovernorGeneral in Council. That is beyond doubt. The fact is that they were not dislodged. In association with those men the Advisory Council of the Commonwealth Bank has played a very important part in our national development. The same statement is true in relation to the Industrial Finance Department of the bank under the directorship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Armstrong.</inline> I say to the Attorney-General that the present issue is not a trifling one. On the contrary, history shows that it contains very dangerous elements. I recall that the Government that preceded the Scullin Government borrowed money at the rate of £30,000,000 a year from overseas, and, as I said last night, when the Scullin Government came into office it found an empty treasury. </para>
                    <para>I now turn to the statement that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate,</inline> who, I am sorry to say,  is not in the chamber at the moment. His attempt to justify his support of this bill was merely ludicrous. He  told  us that the control of various organizations in the trade union movement was exercised by an executive. The executive of the Australian Council of Trades Unions is representative of many  organizations  that are of several political colours, and to compare it with the Commonwealth Bank of this country is foolish. The honorable senator could not find words to substantiate his argument. </para>

                            <para>- Just imagine any one suggesting - even the Minister who has just interjected - that we should appoint a board to administer the Taxation Branch or the Department of Health. During the last general election campaign we heard a great deal from honorable senators opposite and their friends in another place about the bureaucrats of Canberra, but now their Government proposes to establish a bank board to determine the country's financial policy. There is no doubt that the board will determine financial policy. It is no good for us to  fool  ourselves by saying that any paper in connexion with its decisions will be laid on the table of this chamber or of another place. The Treasurer's representative on the bank board will not be the one who will give impartial decisions. The five " secret men ", and the Treasurer, through his representative on the bank board, will make the decisions. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> introduced the subject of the control of the trade union movement into his argument shows that he was at a loss for words to justify his support of the measure. </para>

                    <para>I have listened attentively to some of the statements that have been made in connexion with the actions of the Scullin Government. I do not desire any doubt to be left in the minds of honorable senators opposite - I know that there is no doubt about it in the minds of the Opposition - about who invited <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer to come to this country to investigate its finances. Honorable senators opposite have alleged that he came at the invitation of the Scullin Government. I give that statement an emphatic denial. The Bruce-Page Government, which preceded the Scullin Government in office, was as I have said, borrowing overseas at the rate of £30,000,000 a year right up to the end of its term of office. Tie Bank of England was the authority responsible for sending <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer to Australia. The decision to send him arose from a discussion in London between the representatives of the Commonwealth Bank and the Bank of England. After that discussion the Bank of England decided that one of its representatives would have to come to Australia to investigate our financial position, and without receiving any invitation from the Scullin Government, it sent <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer, who was associated with one of the big banking firms in England. </para>

                        <para>- Ever since 1943 when the Curtin Government applied regulations to the private banks, there has been a continual flow of propaganda in support of the private bank,;-. Farmers in Western Australia recall the days when the banks took their farms and re-sold them. Last month, the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, at its annual conference in Perth, adopted a resolution opposing the establishment of a Commonwealth bank board similar to that which existed previously. That, of course, i9 what it will be - a rose by another name. I place that resolution on record because I am a West Australian and have been associated with the wheat-farmers of that State for many years. It is obvious that the wheatgrowers fear that they will be the victims of another recession or depression, whatever it may be called, just as they were the victims of the last depression. The conference also resolved that, should a board be established, primary producers should have adequate representation on it, and that, at all times, the board should be subject to the control of the Parliament. Knowing the records of governments such as that now in office, we are fearful of the consequences of this legislation. A9 the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> has said, the "five secret men " will control the bank board. I commend to the Government the suggestion that primary producers should have representation on the board. I do not mean, of course, that a Collins-street or St. George's-terrace farmer should be appointed. A representative of that type would not satisfy me or my colleagues, and I am sure that he would not satisfy the wheat-growers or the primary producers generally. I was a member of the all-party parliamentary committee that examined the proposal to establish the Mortgage Bank Department of the Commonwealth Bank. Speaking from memory, I think that Liberal party members of the committee offered the strongest possible opposition to the establishment of that department. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. They also opposed Labour's proposal that advances should be up to 80 per cent, of the value of a property. They wanted to reduce that figure to 65 per cent. It is true that in the past there has been a tendency for the Commonwealth Bank to be saddled with risky mortgages that had been refused by the private banks. On one occasion I had a letter from a man who claimed that the Commonwealth Bank had refused him accommodation. I went to the manager concerned and asked him for the reason for his refusal. The manager told me that he had discovered that his prospective client already had a mortgage of £2,000 with the Agricultural Bank of Western Australia. No bank, whether it be a national bank or a private bank, could accept such a risk, although, admittedly, in banking certain risks are unavoidable at times. I do not accept without question all the stories that I hear about men seeking financial accommodation being turned away from the Commonwealth Bank, only to have their needs met by a private bank. That was the kind of propaganda that was disseminated throughout the community for two years prior to the 10th December last. That story was told not only of rural credits, but also of advances for home purchase or home building. It was said that the Commonwealth Bank's housing scheme was no good, and that a home builder could get a better deal from one of the trading banks. The private banks, of course, paid for that propaganda. I have before me the report on mortgage banking that was adopted by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation on the 15th October, 1941. Wheatgrowers are sensible men. In fact, they  are so sensible that,  a9  I have already pointed out, they have passed a resolution protesting against the Government's proposal to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank Board. The report states - </para>

                            propose to make only a brief incur sion into the debate "which, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along". There are not many things on which the Government and the Opposition disagree in the proposals before us. The actual points of disagreement- may appear to be deep but there are not many, and, in any event, very little has been said about them by those who have so far taken part in the debate. In fact, I think it would not be unfair to s-av of the last  speaker,  that any similarity between the points at issue in this measure and the contents of his speech was purely coincidental, so I shall endeavour to show briefly what the points of disagreement are. However, before doing so I express my satisfaction that there is no= objection to the proposal to repeal that ill-starred piece of legislation, the Banking Act 1947, which is the main proposition in the bill now before us. I do not accept the contention that that act washeld to be wholly invalid by the Privy Council. 1 know that certain of its provisions were held to be invalid, but I believe - and I am supported in my belief" by sound legal opinion - that certain provisions which were not held to be invalid would have made it possible for Labour, if it again attained office, to reach, by rather more devious means, its objective of eliminating all competition in thebanking system of this country.

                            <para>- I do not accept that contention, but even if there wereonly one private bank it would still have to face the competition of the Commonwealth Bank. We need to keep both institutions in order that the peopleof this country may not be unduly influenced in political mat-ers by economicpressure. I am very pleased, therefore,, that we are not opposed in our attempt to repeal the 1947 legislation; although I must say that I attribute that lack of opposition to a realization by the Australian Labour party that that proposal is the most unpopular that has ever been put before the people of this country and the fact that Labour would not again dare openly to espouse it. </para>

                    <para>Passing to the main arena in which discussion has concentrated, the two principal matters for decision are, first, whether there should he a board, and secondly, whether there should be a method by which the Parliament and the people can be informed in the event of any disagreement between the Government and the proposed board. I have been able to discover orly two objections to the proposal to establish a board. One of those objections was expressed quite powerfully by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> last night; it is that the Government would force the board to carry out the Government's policy. In other words, the Government, through the presence on the board of so many of its appointees, would influence the board to do exactly what it wanted. The second argument is that the board might influence the Government to make the Government do what it wanted, because the outside interests represented on the board would have the power to overthrow the Government and therefore, the Government would have to do what they wanted. Whichever of those- objections we accept we must reject the other,  because they are mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, it has not been uncommon for both arguments to be advanced by individual honorable senators opposite in the course of their speeches, apparently, because they suffer from a form of political schizophrenia. However, I shall discuss the two objections separately. The main objection to a board is based on the contention that the relationship between a board and the Government will be the same as it was when the former board was functioning; in other words, that the board will be independent of the Government, and, therefore, control of the credit of the nation will be in the hands, not of the elected representatives of the people, but of the members of the board. If, indeed, the bill did make such a proposal, I should not be in favour of it, because I think that there is no great difference of opinion amongst us on the proposition that the control of the credit of the nation must rest in the hands of the elected representatives of the people. However, the fact is that there is no provision in the bill that would permit such a state of affairs to occur. The vital difference between the proposed board and the old board that whereas the former board was independent of the Government, the new board must do what the Government wants it to do, and in the event of any difference of opinion arising between them, the matter will be resolved by the Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Prom the honorable senator's interjection I assume that he is opposed to the Government's proposal because he thinks that the board will do just what the Government wants it to do. However, honorable senators opposite can take it whichever way they like. The board must do what the Government wants it to do, either because the Government will appoint the members of the board or because, under the provisions of the measure, in the event of disagreement between the board and the Government, Parliament will decide the matter It will be seen, therefore, that it will not be independent of the Government, but must do what it is told to do. I suggest that that disposes of most of the arguments based upon the assumption that the proposed board will stand in the same relationship to the Government as did the board of 1930. </para>

                    <para>The provisions relating to the means by which the Parliament and the people of Australia will control or restrain the board and the Government have not been favorably received by the Opposition. It has been said that they will not be effective. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> said that the proposed procedure would be useless, because the record of any disagreement between the Government and the board that was laid on the table of each House of Parliament would consist on-y of words. I shall deal with that point later. I cannot see how it would be possible to give to the people's representatives any greater control of the actions of the Executive than that which is proposed in this bill. It is proposed that in the event of a. disagreement between the Government or the Treasurer and the board, the parties should first try to reach agreement, and that if they are unable to do so, the board shall submit its views to the Treasurer and that the Government should then instruct it as to the policy to be adopted. The board will be to that degree subservient to the Government. Similar provisions were contained in the old legislation, but now it is proposed that the matter shall be carried a step further and that there must be laid on the table of each House of the Parliament, for all the representatives of the people to see, a statement of the board's views and a statement of the Government's instructions to the board. Parliamentary life being what it is, I know that a Government would be unlikely to be defeated in the Parliament if a vote were taken on the question of whether it had acted rightly or wrongly in instructing the board to adopt a certain policy. That is not impossible, but it is unlikely. The value of the present proposal is that private members of all parties would know exactly what was being discussed, because the views of the Government and the board would be before them. In addition, the people at large would know what was in dispute between their government and their bank, and thus be able to form an opinion as to which party was right. I cannot see why objection should he taken to a proposal that the representatives of the people shall be made aware of relevant facts and thus be able to pass judgment on the question. I hesitate to think that the Opposition has objected to the proposal because it hopes that in future secret action can be taken to override the board or the Advisory Council and further the Labour party's objective of the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. I hope that the people realize that a provision that important issues shall be brought into the full light of day is the greatest possible safeguard against the tyranny of socialism and one to which objection cannot be taken by persons who believe in real democracy. </para>

                        <para>. -  In making my contribution to this debate, I speak not as a legal genius or a great economist, but as an ordinary Australian. I believe that I view the position in the same way as do most of the electors. Before dealing with the bill, I shall offer a few comments upon statements that have been made by honor able senators opposite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> said that it would be a sad state of affairs if there were a GovernmentCommonwealth Bank banking monopoly in this country. If the honorable senator were to make inquiries in the part of Victoria in which he lives, he would discover what the associated banks did to the primary producers there and in other parts of the State during the period when they had a monopoly of the banking business of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator reads the measure under which the Commonwealth Bank was established, he will discover that at no time did the members of the Australian Labour party say that the Commonwealth Bank should have a monopoly of banking business. Labour members of the Parliament who spoke upon that measure stated definitely that the intention was that the Commonwealth Bank should compete, as a trading bank, with other banks in all parts of Australia, and that if the private banks could meet its competition they were at liberty to go ahead. </para>

                            <para>- Then I must have misunderstood the honorable senator. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> was a member of the commission, but he disagreed with many of its recommendations and said so in the minority report. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> has told us that his party believes in the Commonwealth Bank. If that is so, he cannot favour this bill, because the appointment of a Commonwealth Bank Board would defeat the pur pose for which the bank was brought into existence. The Commonwealth Bank is a bulwark between the people and another depression. As we know, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> was once a member of the great Australian Labour party. I am sorry that he is not present now to hear what I am saying. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> sat as a Labour member in the House of Representatives from 1929 until he decided to leave the Labour party and join the anti-Labour forces. I do not quarrel with him on that account. This is a democratic country, and if a man wishes to change his political or other opinions he is at liberty to do so. A few days ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> denied that he had ever signed the socialization pledge of the Labour party, and he challenged me to prove that he had, saying that he would resign his seat if I could do so, and that I should resign my seat if I failed. I do not propose to accept such a challenge- </para>

I hope to prove my assertion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> signed the pledge of the Labour party; but, even if I do, I shall not expect him to resign his seat. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> contested the Bass seat in the House of Representatives as the selected Labour candidate, and every endorsed Labour candidate is required to sign the party pledge. An exception may have been made in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> because of the conscientious and meritorious service rendered to the Labour party by his father, who previously represented the party in this chamber. However, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allan</inline> Guy, as he then was, was addressing a meeting in the Albert Hall, Launceston, in 1929, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> being the  chairman,  he was asked by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgerald,</inline> of Launceston, whether he believed in the socialization plank of the Labour party, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Guy</inline> replied : " Yes, 100 per cent." </para>

I learned in the school of poverty and adversity and that is why I say that the control of the Commonwealth Bank should be left as it is. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> also said that the depression was world-wide. One does not need to be an "Argus boy wonder" to know that, but we say that if the Commonwealth Bank, in 1930 and 1931, had been functioning as it now functions, the government of that day could have cushioned the effects of the  depression, and prevented a great deal of suffering  among the people. During the depression, the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin,</inline> was in a most invidious position. The Easter Labour Conference of 1930 was attended by the then Commonwealth Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> A. Lyons, who afterwards supplanted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> as Prime Minister. Addressing the conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> said : " The country, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> and comrades, is broke. We are in pawn. We are insolvent. The Treasury to-day may be likened to my pockets- - it is empty. And what has made it empty? Nothing but the maladministration of those two political scoundrels, Bruce and Page ". </para>

We appreciate that fact and we are aware of the poverty and misery that afflicted our friends, the workers, in countries overseas. We say also that the depression could easily have been cushioned in Australia if the Commonwealth Bank had been functioning in those days as it now functions. I made some remarks in respect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> prior to the suspension of the sitting when Le was not in the chamber, and as he is now present I shall repeat them. They related to some statements that he had made during the debate yesterday. I am not sure that his statements had anything to do with the bill, but he did make them. 1 said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> was once a member of the Labour party, which is 100 per cent, behind the maintenance of the present control of the Commonwealth Bank. Speaking in Launceston £&gt;s a selected Labour candidate in September, 1929, when the Commonwealth Bank was very much under discussion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> made a certain statement when he was asked a question by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgerald,</inline> whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> will no doubt remember. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgerald</inline> asked whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> subscribed to the socialization plank of the Labour party platform, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Guy,</inline> as he then was, replied, " Yes, 100 per cent. " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> was  chairman  at that meeting. </para>

                    <para>The Commonwealth Bank was established by a Labour government in 1911 because of the failure of the private banks in the land boom in the 1890's. It was because of the fact that the people of Australia had been robbed by the  direc-  rn.ii tors of the associated banks of the money that they had saved to buy allotments of land on which they hoped to build homes, that the wise people who then led the Labour party early in this century decided that something must be done to give the people protection in the future. It has been mentioned here on many occasions that until recently money was still owing to those people who had made deposits with the associated banks in 1890. The Labour party introduced legislation to establish the Commonwealth Bank in 1911. If we could have a re-enactment of the proceedings in the Parliament in 1911, when that legislation was being debated, and also of the proceedings in 1924, when legislation to establish the Commonwealth Bank was before the Parliament, we should find the same arguments being advanced as are now being advanced in relation to this bill. The same defence was made of people who are stooges of the associated banks and big companies as is now being advanced here to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> belonged to a party that believes in socialization, but he changed his allegiance because of some reason that I do not know. I say quite frankly that he is entitled, like any other person, to change his mind, but if he has in the past subscribed to policies that are honorable, he should admit it. </para>

                        said that because of the provisions of the bill .members of the proposed board could not have any associations with private banks. That was also definitely stated in the Treasurer's second-reading speech. It would be quite easy, however, for a Government appointee to the board, who is a director of a private bank or a person closely associated with private banks, to resign his seat on the directorate of a private bank one day, be appointed to the proposed hoard on the following day, and continue to carry out on that board activities that would be in the interests of the people that he represented.

I do, and I am very proud of the fact that to-day, because of the activities of a Labour Administration, most of the people of Australia are able to pay taxes. Under anti-Labour administrations, during the depression they did not have enough income to pay taxes. I do not know why the honorable senator asked that question unless it. is the intention of the party to which, he -belongs to. impose Saxes oil the post office, customs, and ether socialized utilities operating in the various States, It. would be quite useless to. impose, income taxation upon- the post office en1 the Department of Trade- and Customs.,

                        that i£ the Governmentwhom he supports in this* chamber is prepared to submit a panel of names to the electors enumerating the people whom, the. Government proposes to appoint to the board, Labour senators on this side of the Senate would be. prepared to, accept such a plan. We believe that the- people should, be given an, opportunity to. decidewho the seven gentlemen to be appointed to. the bowl will be. If the Government were to do that we would/ have some causa to. believe that. its. proposals, are being made in the best interests of the people. Let us, examine the operations of the Commonwealth Bank Board- after 192.4. The Commonwealth Bank operated as an ordinary trading bank and did a- marvellous job during World War I. and until 1924. The people were called upon to vote on the issue of banking in the 1946 and, 1949 general elections.. It was. also an issue in the 1911 and 1914 general elections when, honorable senators will recall, the Labour party swept the polls because of the fact that the anti-Labour parties were not able bo issue such a flood of propaganda as they have issued ia the- last few years on the issue- of banking! In those years the people supported the policy- of the Labour party to bring down legislation to establish the Commonwealth Bank. In 1924,. however, the stooges of big business took away the charter that was given to the Commonwealth Bank by the electors. They waited until the time was opportuneand they used the "Little Digger", William Morris Hughes, until he outlived his usefulness and was not prepared to play ball any longer, to sabotage theclass that made him. So they got rid of him and

                        or any capitalist newspaper, in 1924, make an issue of what the BrucePage Government had done? Certainly not. Very few people knew anythingabout what had happened because the debates in this House at that time were not broadcast, and the Government's action was never given any publicity in the press. It was a tragedy that onceagain the monetary policy of this country was handed back to the wolves who had misled and mismanaged the country's finances in the 1890's. Now, because theCommonwealth Bank has been operating, in the interests of- the people, it has been made a. political issue, and propaganda against its control has been pouring out through the radio, stations and the- daily press..

                    <para>The Treasurer has claimed' that thepassage of the 1945. legislation was. dueto his administration in 1941.

No, of course they did not because the people had become rest.less,. Even- the great assets of the associated) banks were at stake, and they decided that if- their assets were to hesaved!,, they must fall into line with, the </para>

Why does he want to alter it? </para>
                    <para>The Government claims that it has a mandate from the people to alter the 1945 legislation. I say that the Government has no mandate to alter the constitution of the Commonwealth Bank, because that issue was never mentioned at the last general election except by individual candidates in passing. The issue at the election was the nationalization of banking which unfortunately the people of Australia are not yet able to understand. I hope that the time will come when legislation to nationalize banking will be introduced by a Labour government because it will bring great prosperity to this country. In 1946, at the general election, the people overwhelmingly endorsed the legislation introduced by the Curtin Government in 1945. This Government has no right to set up another bank board except that if one -enters into a contract, it must be carried into effect. The " big boys who control the banking institutions and the combines of this country, who spilled hundreds of thousands of pounds in 1949 for propaganda, are asking for their pound of flesh and the Government is duty-bound to give it to them. Fortunately for the people of Australia there is &amp; majority on this side of the chamber who will protect them and will not allow them to be blindly led astray as they were :at .the general election. </para>
                    <para>The day has arrived when big business is telling the members of the Government that it wants the profits from banking. The big financial magnates who control the associated banks want to do with the Commonwealth Bank the same -.thing as the Bruce-Page Government did in 1934. There is a reason. Nobody would suggest that the Commonwealth Bank failed to make a profit between 1911 and 1924 and from 1941 until 1950. The Commonwealth Bank made a profit of £85,000,000 in those periods and that money belongs to the people of Australia, not to the few who control the </para>

                    <para class="block">affairs of the associated banks. I invite honorable senators to consider the profits that must have been lost by the associated banks during the years from 1911 to 1924 and again since 1945. On the other hand, just imagine the profits that the associated banks must have made between 1924 and the year 1945 when the banking legislation of the Labour Government was brought into operation. The people who made this Government possible are after that money. They are demanding that control of the Commonwealth Bank shall be given back to those who supported the Government. The Government has named some of the bank personnel as members of the proposed bank board but it is not prepared to give honorable senators the names of the other five persons or even a panel from which those five will be selected. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber can draw only one conclusion and that is that the five to be chosen will come from the section from which they were drawn in 1924. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> had exercised his right and appointed somebody who would be more sympathetic to the people, the Labour Government would have been maligned for giving the job to somebody who was sympathetic to the Government. The men appointed to the Advisory Council of the Commonwealth Bank are men of ability, with no interests outside, the position that they occupy. There arc many men of that type in the Commonwealth service who gave all that they had in the war years but were branded then, as they are now by the Government, as the bureaucrats controlling Chifley and Curtin. They are available to-day and could serve this country in its best interests, but the Government is not prepared to give them the job. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Melville</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Roland</inline> Wilson have been named as two who will be appointed but they could be dismissed over-night and two stooges who represent the banking organizations could be placed in their positions.

It states thai the Bank of New South Wales, established in 1817 with a paid-up capital of £7,423,440, made a profit of £825,082 in the year ended September, 1923. The dividend that year was 10 per cent, and reserves totalled £4,054,539. These figures relate to a period prior to the depression and show the profits that were made by the associated banks during those profitable years following World War I. What a sorry spectacle they made during the depression years! Foi the year ended .September, 1924, the Bank of New South Wales made a profit of £S46,834 and paid a dividend of 10 per cent. In 1925 the profit was £973,383 and the dividend 12| per cent. Profit in 1926 was £1,099,559 and in 1927 it was £1,226,247. In 1926 and 1927 the dividend- again was 12-J per cent. </para>

                    </continue><para>It i's not the poor people who hold shares in these associated banks. The only banks the workers of this country knew during the depression were the banks of the rivers and the creeks where they lived, and the only thing they drew was their breath. Only the wealthy control the banking institutions, which have paid such remarkable dividends on such a comparatively small amount of capital. If this Commonwealth is to be developed as a nation the Government must control the national purse. That was proved in the war years when there was in control party which believed in the socialization of the means of life and also that financially the war could be fought internally. Because there was an advisor; committee and a Commonwealth Bank and a federal government to legislate for  the people and not for a few, this country was left after the war with a treasury filled to overflowing instead of being mortgaged to overseas interests. As a result of sane legislation and monetary control during the war, Australia has a credit of £400,000,000 in London  instead  of the deficit that followed "World War I. Loans owing to America have been reduced and the Labour Government left £100,000,000 in the Federal Treasury for the enactment of social services legislation besides about £250.000,000  for  publ  ic  works. That is the position of this country to-day after a second world war. In World War I., the United Kingdom paid for most of the equipment of the Australian Imperial Force. In World War II., Australia equipped, clothed and fed, not only the 2nd Australian Imperial  Force  but also the Allied forces that came to this country. Australia is solvent to-day as the result of the efforts of those people who are opposed to legislation such as this. What are the business affiliations of the private banks? For instance, the National Bank of Australasia Limited is connected through directorates with the following organizations: Australian Glass Manufacturers' Company Limited, Caledonian Collieries Limited, Dunlop Rubber Company of Australasia Limited, Howard Smith Limited, Metropolitan Gas Company, New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company Limited, Trustees, Executors and Agency Company Limited, Goldsbrough, Mort and Company Limited, Union Trustee Company of Australia Limited, Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company Limited, National Portland Cement Company Limited, Strachan, Murray and Shannon Limited, and the Victorian Legislative Council. We want to know who the members of the Commonwealth Bank Board are to be. If the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> is sincere in his approach to this measure, and wishes to be honest with the  people  of Australia, he will announce, not to-day, but on the  next  occasion when the Senate is on the air, the names  of  the men whom the  Government  proposes  to  appoint  to  the board. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- No, and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> does not know, because the controllers of big business have not yet made known the names of their nominees. If the Government really intends to appoint men who are not biased against the Commonwealth Bank, it should have no hesitation in announcing their names as soon as possible. We all know of course that it was the support of big business that made the election of the present Government possible. The Prime Minister and his colleagues would have us believe that the Liberal party depends for its funds upon membership fees at the rate of 2s. 6d.  a  member. In Victoria, a drive for membership was made by means of  a  house-to-house canvass, and I venture  to  say that when the history of the whole affair has been written, the people of the Commonwealth will be startled to learn how many Communists belong to the Liberal party to-day. Only recently the daily press reported that a Communist had been endorsed by the Liberal party as its candidate at the forthcoming New South Wales elections. Apparently, the Liberal party did not know that he was a Communist. During the last Commonwealth election campaign, thousands  of  bank clerks were forced by a gestapolike organization to act as propagandists for the cause of the associated banks. Unfortunately, many people, regardless of their political views, were forced to work for institutions whose aims are diametrically opposed to the Labour outlook on life. That applies of course to the private banks. I know some such people, but I cannot give their names lest they be victimized. Some of them attended political meetings at which I spoke. Although totally opposed to the policy  of  the banking institutions, they canvassed the suburb in which I live because they were afraid that if they refused to do so, they would be immediately dismissed. One life-long friend of mine is the manager of a branch of a private bank in Melbourne. He has been a supporter of the Labour party all his life, but, at the last election campaign, he was unable to give his customary support to Labour candidates because he was close to the retiring age and was afraid that he might lose his job. He was forced by th«  institution of which he is an employee to support the campaign that was waged by the private banks against the Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- Nevertheless it is. true. The honorable senator apparently cannot understand that. In fact I am inclined to believe that some honorable senators opposite wonder how they ever became members of the LiberalAustralian Country party Senate team. I am sure that they were not selected on their ability. Admittedly the leaders of the Government parties are selected on their ability, but then the anti-Labour forces say, " We must get some blind stooges to follow those leaders and support legislation that will suit us ". In spite of the denials of honorable senators opposite, I repeat that during the last election campaign, employees of the associated banks were forced actively to support the policy laid down, not by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'sullivan,</inline> but by the people who control them. Those who claim that the Liberal party depends entirely for its funds upon the half-crown subscriptions paid by members are being deliberately misleading. We on this side know what elections cost. We are not able to use broadcasting, advertising and transport as they are used by the anti-Labour parties at election time. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were expended to ensure that stooges would be sent to Canberra to destroy that great institution, the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline> connects himself with that expression I withdraw it. This bill shows that the banking interests of this country are demanding their pound of flesh from the Government, but we on this side of the chamber will do everything in our power to retain the present administration of an institution which has done so much to ensure the social security of the Australian people. What happened in this country during World War I. when the finances of this nation were in the hands of the associated banks? Prices rose alarmingly. The associated banks made ample money available to the government of the day, but at exorbitant interest rates. Subsequently, when prices fell sharply, people who had 'borrowed money  to build homes or buy farms were forced into bankruptcy because they had no equity in their property. In the depression years, with our monetary system still substantially in the hands of the private banks, it was necessary to pass moratorium legislation to protect Australian farmers. The private banks lent the money to the Commonwealth Bank, which in turn lent it to the farmers to pay their debts to the private banks. Monopoly control of our banking system in the depression years caused the greatest financial crisis in our history. The lot of the Australian people was misery and starvation. Had the Commonwealth Bank been free in those days to operate as it has done since 1945, it could have cushioned the worst effects of the depression. It could have made money available at low rates of interest to build homes and roads, to enable primary producers to fence their properties, and eradicate pests such as rabbits and dingoes. Had the Commonwealth Bank been under the control of the Parliament at that time, unemployment could have been substantially reduced. Under the present administrative system, the board of directors of the Commonwealth Bank is the Cabinet of Australia, and in effect,  every member of the community is a shareholder in the bank and a contributor to its prosperity. Even the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> has admitted the Commonwealth Bank has done splendid work under the control of the Governor since 1945. Why not let the present system of control continue so that this country may continue its march to prosperity? Labour would not object to the re-establishment of the Commonwealth Bank Board if it could be sure that the members of that board would be free of associations inimical to the bank, and therefore would be respected by the people of this country. Under 'the Constitution, members of Parliament are compelled to submit themselves to the will of the people at certain intervals. Whilst we are members of this legislature we are the custodians of the financial system. We are responsible to the people, and it is our duty to ensure that the people shall have all the things to which they are entitled. Control of ihe monetary system of this country rightly should rest with the elected representatives of the people as it has done since 1941, but under such a system, of course, the private banks are unable to make huge profits and pay high dividends. It is not true to say that the Commonwealth Bank seeks a monopoly of banking in this country. All we want is that the Commonwealth Bank should do what it set out to do in 1911, that is, function as a national bank, a people's bank and a trading bank. What was the position of the farmer, the man in industry and the small businessman during the depression? They could not obtain loans to carry on their business without paying exorbitant rates. I know that in order to purchase a motor car during the depression I had to pay 15 per cent, interest to Auto-Terms Limited. That is why big business is cracking the whip over honorable senators opposite now. Big business wants again to be able to exploit the monetary needs of the community. Suggestions have been made that the Government might precipitate a double dissolution of the Parliament if the Senate rejects this measure; but, in view of the result of the successive State elections held on the last three Saturdays, I doubt whether Government supporters are now so optimistic about their prospects. However, even if they are rash enough to force this matter to a double dissolution, I am confident that the good sense of the people will prevail and that Labour will again be returned to office under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley.</inline></para>

                        <para>.- This is a very short bill.  It  sets out to accomplish two things; first of all, to repeal the Banking Act 1947, and, secondly, to establish a board to control the Commonwealth Bank. The repeal of the 1947 banking legislation is vitally important. Although certain sections of that act were declared invalid by the High Court and later also  by  the Privy Council, it is necessary to repeal that legislation in order to make certain that the proposal to nationalize the banks is disposed of once and for all. At the general election on the 10th December last I consider that the people showed unmistakably what they thought of the proposal to nationalize banking. I recall that when the earlier legislation, the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, was under discussion I remarked that the progeny of that legislation could  be  described in racing parlance as " Paper Money by The Printing Press out  of  Caucus ". In amplification of that statement I point out now that when that legislation was enacted the note issue was £100,000,000, but by March of this year it had increased to £225,000,000. In turn the 1947 legislation could be expressed in breeding parlance as " The Blue Duck by The Quack out of The Mare's Nest ". A great deal of confusion inevitably surrounds any discussion of finance and banking. Many of us confuse banking practices with credit. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that  I  can; at least, I am not instructed how  to  speak. I think that the reason why the 1947 legislation was so distasteful  to  most people was that many people have bank accounts and they have had considerable dealings with banks. I bank with the Bank of Adelaide Limited, probably, if I might express it in this way, because it suits my personal, selfish interests to do so. As every one knows* under the present system of private  trading banks no one is . compelled to bank with any particular institution, and since people value the right to do with their own money what they desire, they rejected the idea of nationalizing the banks. I said a few moments ago that a lot of confusion surrounds the idea of bank credits. More misunderstanding and illusion is created on the matter of credit than on any other aspect of banking. In my view credit is simply deferred payment. The Commonwealth Bank Act 1945 established the system of central banking. 1 believed at that time, and I still believe, that the control of credit should be vested in the Commonwealth Bank, which is the central bank. If one approaches a private trading bank to-day for a loan, that bank has to obtain the approval of the Commonwealth Bank before it can advance the loan. I know, because I have an overdraft. </para>

                    <para>I propose to say something now about the connexion between full employment and economic recessions. Full employment has never been subjected to the acid test of reality. Many people have propounded elaborate schemes for full employment. Our present full employment is not due to any theory, but is the result of six years of war. Since the war we have not been concerned with providing work for people or with avoiding the recurrence of a depression; the greatest task that has confronted us has been to prevent inflation. If we can prevent inflation, then we shall be better armed to combat and control any recession that may occur. Full employment is still a theory. Briefly, the advocates of full employment base their argument on three theories: first, that it maintains and stabilizes demand ; secondly, that the Government can improve our economic condition by reducing taxes and can extend social benefits; and, thirdly, that as private spending decreases the Government can increase its expenditure to stabilize the national economy. Those theories may be quite all right in a nation that has a closed economy; but is  not  every nation virtually dependent upon an interlocked economy? Australia, in particular, has not a closed economy, because we are vitally dependent on our great  export  industries, and in that respect our economy is highly vulnerable. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the honorable senator mentioned that fact, because I propose to deal with it in a few minutes. If full employment is to become a permanent feature of our economy, what contributions and what sacrifices have to be made by the community? I believe that it is proposed, in the event of another depression, to expend £743,000,000 on public works. What people do not realize, however, is that the implementation of such a vast public works programme must inevitably mean that men will be removed from their occupations, transported to other parts of Australia to work, and will very likely have to change their permanent residences. Furthermore, have honorable senators considered the time that must elapse before the change-over in our economy is completed ? Looking now at the practical side of the proposals, I ask honorable senators to consider whether proper preparations have been made for such a huge works programme by setting aside the necessary materials - steel, cement, machinery and so on. Of course, it is all very well to say that we have approximately £740,000,000 available for expenditure, but where is the money? When a depression comes it will not be the theorists who will help the unemployed ; that task will fall upon the business men and the trade unions. I said earlier that we are very vulnerable because we are an exporting nation. If the overseas prices of our products fall substantially our national income will fall, and with it will fall the full employment theory. The supporters of that theory argue that a decrease of the national income would be countered by internal inflation; but they overlook the fact that not only will exporters have to suffer reduced incomes, but they will then pl«-o have to contend with rising costs. Whether  we  have full employment or not, the purchasing value of wages is the most important single factor in the volume of employment. It cannot be said that under all circumstances an increase of wages will reduce unemployment; nor, conversely, will a decline of wages necessarily encourage employment. Full employment is very largely built up on Lord Keynes's idea, which found expression in this country during the depression, in the Premiers plan, that an all-round reduction of wages by 10 per cent. i3 necessary at times to restore a nation'9 economy. In times of prosperity we cannot be too careful to avoid sowing the seeds of a future depression. Many people say : " Full employment can be left to the Government " ; but no Government, and no political policy, can hold back a depression. No matter what government is in power, it must have the co-operation of every section of the community if it is even to alleviate the consequences of a depression. I do not want to see another depression in this country. Supporters of free enterprise and persons who, by their thrift and industry have bought houses or established businesses, have a larger stake in full employment than have the members of any other section of the community. If there were another depression, not only would they suffer financial loss, but also they would lose their personal liberty, business initiative and freedom of enterprise., Another depression could destroy all small businesses in this country. The owners of the small businesses of Australia, whom I hope that we represent, are the greatest employers of Australian labour, and all our big industries depend upon them. It is the persons who took their courage in their hands and established their own businesses who gave this country the prosperity that it now enjoys. The supporters of free enterprise - and I include among them thrifty men throughout the community who work for wages and have bought their own homes - would lose much if another depression occurred. It is arrant humbug to say that we want another depression. </para>

                    <para>Clause 3 of the bill provides for the repeal of the Banking Act 1947. Whether that act will in fact be repealed depends upon honorable senators opposite. The measure provides also for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank Board. I support the proposal to establish the board, because I believe in the probity of my fellow citizens. Those who say that, if a man is appointed to the Commonwealth Bank Board, he will forthwith forget his duty to his country and to his fellows, exhibit a sad lack of knowledge of the greatness of human nature. I supported the proposal to reestablish the Commonwealth Bank Board when it was put forward in 1945. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite prepared for the senator to remember it. Honorable senators opposite have said that they cannot think of any five men in the whole of Australia who would be satisfactory as independent members of the Commonwealth Bank Board. Although they do not know who the five outside members of the board will be, they have already condemned them. Let us assume for the purposes of argument that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> is no longer Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and that the position has been filled by one of those five men. Would not honorable senators opposite wish him to have some assistance? If this bill becomes law, the five officials who are specified in the bill or have been mentioned by the Treasurer will be appointed as members of the board, and the five remaining members will be chosen by the Government. When all is said and done, there are men with brains on this side of the chamber. In my opinion, it would be a good thing if five men of experience, drawn from various parts of Australia and engaged in various industries, brought their combined knowledge and experience to bear upon the task of making the Commonwealth Bank function as it should function. It is a great slur upon the men of Australia to say that it will be impossible to find five men of ability, courage, and honesty to act as members of the board. I said in 1945 that I hoped a representative of the trade unions would be appointed to the Commonwealth Bank Board if it were established. I still entertain that hope. It is easy to stand on the sidelines and criticize, but when a man is given a responsible job, he begins to think and his outlook change?. It would be of benefit to the trade unions of this country if they had a representative on the board who would take responsibility for any decisions that were made. I have much pleasure in supporting the bill. </para>

                        <para>. - Two questions that are exercising the minds of persons who are interested in this bill are, first, why has it been introduced, and secondly, why is the Opposition opposing certain of its provisions? The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> told us that the measure can be regarded as another instalment in the implementation of the election promises that were made by the present Government parties prior to the 10th December, 1949. If that be so- and there is no reason to believe that it is not - this measure is a strong indication of the danger of making election promises. A supposedly responsible political party, in the tumult and turmoil of a general election, makes all kinds of promises to the electors, HOt with the object of rectifying a social or economic evil, but in order to catch votes. To use a colloquialism, it becomes vote happy. While it is vote happy, it will say almost anything, regardless of the consequences of its statements or of what is politically and socially necessary or desirable. When such a party is returned to power, it can do one of two things. Either it can admit frankly and _ courageously that there is no need to introduce a certain measure, or it can proceed blindly to implement the rash promises that it made on the eve of the election. We now have a bill before the Senate that suits hardly anybody. Clause 3 contains only one line. It reads as follows: - </para>

The Banking Act 1947 is as dead as the dodo. Yet this Government has written into this bill a clause providing for its repeal. The clause is cheap melodrama. It has been written specifically for the great ham actors of our time. </para>

But when I go to the House of Representatives and listen to the present Prime Minister of Australia speaking to the people whom he represents, after they have dined and wined well and are smoking expensive cigars, I realize how wrong I was. I know that while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> occupies the position of Prime Minister the proceedings of the Parliament will continue to be broadcast, and I believe that eventually he will arrange for them to be televised. If ever a great man fell in love with an inanimate object, it is the present Prime Minister who has fallen in love with the silver microphone on the table at which he sits in the House of Representatives. Clause 3 of the bill is a cheap melodrama written for the ham actors in the Government parties. </para>

                    <para>As I have said, this bill suits hardly any one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> pointed out that the Wheat Growers Federation of Australia condemned the provisions that seek to establish a Commonwealth bank board. Even a section of the Liberal party passed what amounted to a vote of censure upon its parliamentary representatives because of its dissatisfaction with some provisions of the bill. The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> was present at the meeting. When I read the report, I had a great deal of sympathy for him, because I could imagine him, the creature of his own party, being faced suddenly with the venom and hatred that exists only in that party, and being stripped of the one thing with which nature has endowed him to resist the attacks of the outside world. I refer to the charming smile that his Maker has given to him. Doubtless it was not in evidence at that meeting, because no one would expect him to smile in those circumstances. When I read the report, I thought immediately of Adam, who had nothing to protect him from the blasts of the wind. In trying to redeem a rash promise, the Government has introduced a bill that does not suit even its own supporters. </para>
                    <para>I turn now to what may be described as the meat of the bill, that is, the provisions relating to the Commonwealth Bank Board. The proposed Commonwealth Bank Board has a long line of ancestors of which nobody could be proud. It springs from conflict, emotion, promises, capitalism and mass hysteria. To explain my opposition to the establishment of a board, it is necessary to refer briefly to the history of control of the Commonwealth Bank. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> reminded us the other night that the Commonwealth Bank had been established in 1911, and placed under the control of the Government. That is so, and the proposal to establish the bank was vigorously and viciously attacked by the interests which the present Governments represents. We know that in 1924 the Bruce-Page Government did its best to wreck the Commonwealth Bank by placing it under the control of a board. The Attorney-General made an interesting point, although his deductions were illogical. He said that, because a Labour government had placed the bank under the control of a governor in 1911, and another Labour government had reverted to the same form of control in 1945, that was an example of conservatism. He invited us to assume, however, that because an anti-Labour government appointed a Commonwealth Bank Board in 1924, and another anti-Labour government proposes in 1950 to do the same thing, that is not an example of conservatism. The Attorney-General, although a King's Counsellor, is not very logical. He should be careful in declaring people under the legislation which is now before the House of Representatives. I believe that communism can result only in war, and that conservatism tends in the same direction. I suggest that the Attorney-General should be certain of his ground when he sets out to declare any person. There  is,  of course, a logical reason why the Labour party favours the tried and proven method of control of the Commonwealth Bank by a governor, just as there is a good reason why a conservative government - or  a  Liberal one as it now calls itself - wishes to place the bank under the control of  a  board. Prom the time of its establishment in 1911, the Commonwealth Bank, under the control of the Governor, served the people of Australia in the way the Labour party intended that it should. Then, in 1924, a government representative of the present Opposition parties placed the bank under the control of  a  board, after which the bank did what those parties and their supporters wished. It is natural that the Labour party should want to restore a system under which the bank served the people well. It is also natural, in view of its origins and tradition, that the present Government should try to stop the bank from serving the people. </para>
                    <para>The Attorney-General said that, because of the attitude taken up by the Commonwealth Bank Board in 1931, the government of the day appealed to the people, who declared in favour of the board. I remind honorable senators that, during the 1931 election, the minds of the people were more concerned over unemployment than with what was happening in the Parliament. During the third quarter of 1931, unemployment rose to its highest peak of 118,000 persons, representing 28.3 per cent, of registered trade unionists. Does the Attorney-General really suggest that the people consciously endorsed the action of the Commonwealth Bank Board in preventing the Government from taking action that would have <inline font-style="italic">lifted</inline> the country out of the economic morass ? </para>

In 1931, the Labour Government introduced a bill providing for a fiduciary issue of bank notes to the value of £18,000,000. Those who opposed the proposal were able to create the same scare, based on mass hysteria, in connexion with the word " fiduciary " as was recently induced in connexion with the word " nationalization ". To-day, the principle of a fiduciary currency is accepted without question. Perhaps the most contumelious document ever prepared was one issued by the Commonwealth Bank Board during the depression.

                            <para>- To-day, the Commonwealth Bank is under the control of a Governor who works in association with an Advisory Council that represents probably the finest collection of intelligence, so far as banking is concerned, to be found in Australia. The council consists of the Governor of the bank, the  Deputy  Governor, the Secretary to the Treasury, the Commonwealth Statistician, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Armstrong,</inline> manager of the Industrial Finance Department of the Commonwealth Bank. It is the function of the council to advise the Governor, who is himself directly responsible to the Treasurer, just as the Treasurer is responsible to the Government. No Government supporter has questioned the qualifications of the members of the Advisory Council, or criticized the administration of the bank. Indeed, the Government proposes to place three members of the council on the Commonwealth Bank Board. However, it is also proposed to appoint five other members, so far unnamed, who will be able to override the decisions of the three erstwhile members of the Advisory Council. Who are the phantom five to be appointed to the board ? So far it is a closely guarded secret. However, if we note what resignations take place from the staffs of the trading banks between now and the time this bill is passed, we may get some indication of who is likely to be appointed to the board. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited occupies a prominent place in the economy of the country. Perhaps a member of the board will be drawn from that organization. Perhaps the newspapers will be represented also, because the present Government owes much to the support of the newspapers. As I have suggested, there may also be a representative of the private hanks on the board. I wonder whether there will be on the board a representative of the gold-mining industry. It is a great dollar earner, but perhaps it is too much to expect that it will be represented. Western Australia is the principal gold-producing State, but if we may judge from the contemptuous treatment of Western Australia by this Government, which did not even give it representation in the Cabinet, it is unlikely that the gold-mining industry will be represented on the bank board. </para>

                    <para>Is there likely to be harmony among members of the Commonwealth Bank Board, representative as it will be of conflicting interests? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> said that he had great faith in his fellow Australians. So have I, but my faith has been tempered by clashes that I have had at conference tables and in the Arbitration Court. I do not think that we can expect  a captain of industry, who for 30 or 40 years has been actively associated with a particular interest, to break away from his traditions and the environment of a lifetime when some big national issue comes up for decision. We cannot expect an impartial judgment from a man who, for all his active life, has been engaged in promoting the interests of a particular industry. Let us assume that .one of the members of the board will be a large exporter while another will represent the newspapers, and that the board is called upon to decide whether the Australian fi should be appreciated in relation to sterling. We know that the newspaper industry stands to make a cool £1,000,000 if the Australian £1 is put on a par with sterling, whilst the exporting industry would stand to lose many millions of pounds. On such a proposal there would be an immediate clash, and the opinions of the experts would be overborne by those representing selfish interests. The Government could remove much wellfounded suspicion if it were able to point to some mistake that the present administration of the Commonwealth Bank had made since 1945 - if it could say that it proposed to alter the present system because this or that wrong decision had been taken. It would also tend to allay suspicion if the Government were to publish the names of the phantom five who are to be appointed to the bank board, so that the people would be able to judge the proposals on their merits. In the absence of such information, the people have every right to be suspicious. </para>
                    <para>I now come to those provisions in the bill dealing with disputes between the Commonwealth Bank Board and the Treasurer over matters of policy. The Attorney-General has told us that in the case of a dispute the Parliament will have the last say, but I submit that the honorable gentleman's approach to this matter is very naive, indeed. In the first place, a dispute would not come before the Parliament at all unless it were on some vital issue, and I cannot imagine that after the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> has placed bis five outside representatives on the board, it will be likely to disagree with him on any important issue. However, the age of miracles and flying saucers is still with us, so we must assume the possibility of a disagreement between the board and the Treasurer. It is then provided that all the documents relating to the dispute shall be laid on the table in the Parliament - something which I maintain should not be done. There are persons who would pay thousands of pounds, who, indeed, would give their right arms to obtain some of the information that those documents might contain. I have faith in my fellow men, but not sufficient faith to believe that there are not in this chamber some persons who, for a consideration, would carry such information to those who could make use of it. If the dispute occurred over some highly important and confidential matter affecting economic policy, information regarding it should not be spilled out so that any one who was interested might pick it up. What would happen about it if it went to another place with the party numbers as they are at present? The Attorney-General has said that we could move a vote of censure, but what good would that do? If we had taken that course in respect of everything with which we disagree we should have already moved twenty votes of censure against the Government. If we did so move now the Government could gag the debate in the lower House where it has a majority, and that would be the end of it. By the time a dispute between the bank board and the Treasurer is reported to the Parliament the matter will already have been resolved. In other words the Treasurer will have had his way. Because money bills cannot be amended by this chamber much of the debate on them is just so much sheer humbug. This bill has a strange ancestry. The fact is that the Government is not courageous enough to admit that it hates the Commonwealth Bank, which is a purely socialistic undertaking. The Government hates, but cannot destroy the Commonwealth Bank owing to the weight of public opinion and so it intends to do its best to .strangle the bank. The Attorney-General made one of the nicest suggestions that I have heard. He said, " We appointed a banking commission which recommended the establishment of a board of approximately the number of members that we intend to appoint". But he forgot, in his delightful way, to say that that commission's report was issued in 1935 and now, fifteen years later, the Government intends to carry out its suggestions. The facts are that after the commission produced its report in 1935, the Treasurer of the day introduced a bill to implement its recommendations, but it never got beyond the second reading stage and has not been heard of since. Was that its fate because certain people who had some influence  with the anti-Labour government of the day did not want the recommendations of the commission to become law? </para>
                    <para>Apparently it takes fifteen years for an anti-Labour government to move in financial matters, and so to my colleagues who have been asking questions about the Government's promises to put value back into the £1, I now say that they know how long it will take the Government to do so. In 1911, when the Commonwealth Bank was established, the anti-Labour forces of the time said that it would soon be possible to buy " Fisher's flimsies ", as they dubbed Commonwealth banknotes, on the street corners of Sydney and Melbourne for ls. a bag. We shall be able to buy Commonwealth banknotes at that price on street corners only if this Government does not carry out its election promise to check the inflationary spiral. </para>
                    <para>I have tried to explain the reasons why this bill is before the Senate. I submit that there is no logical or valid reason for its introduction. The facts are that the present control of the bank has proved a great success since it was established under the 1945 legislation. In that year the parties opposite had all sorts of things to say about the then Government's proposals to abolish the bank board, but during the debate on this bill not one of the members of those parties has been able to make any complaint about the bank's operations since 1945. They cannot accuse it of having done anything with which they disagree. When an organization has been operating smoothly and successfully, and has been rapidly expanding, why should its control be altered? The fact is that the Government desires to destroy that system of control because of something silly that its candidates said in the heat of the moment during the last election, campaign when they were " vote-happy " and instead of having the welfare of Australia at heart were intent on catching votes. If they have any honesty in their political make-up, which I am beginning to doubt, why do they not tell us who the five mystery directors are to be ? If they were to do that there might be some justification for this bill but there is no justification for it while they withhold the identities of these individuals and so cause suspicion, and while they cannot give one valid reason for changing the control of the bank. The Labour party is opposed to the  reinstitution  of the bank board system because it remembers what happened in 1931 and because of the fact that the bank has been operating successfully since 1945 when the previous board was abolished. Surely we were not elected to this place just to pass legislation for the fun of passing it. Legislation that comes before us should be either necessary or desirable , in the interests of the people. The Labour movement would be less than responsible in its actions if it did not oppose this measure with all the vehemence at its command. Therefore, I say again that there is no need for this bill and that now that the Government has brought it here it should state who the five directors are to be. While the bill is in its present form the Labour movement will oppose it and I am proud to be associated with that opposition. </para>

The Government pledged itself during the election campaign to repeal the 1947 legislation and to establish a small board of directors to direct the policy of the bank. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> asked for one valid reason for the introduction of this measure. I shall give him one in a few words - " To improve the position of the Commonwealth Bank in Australia ". </para>

                            <para>- I am fighting on behalf of the people of Australia. I believe, however, that the bank officers were entitled to take an active part in the election campaign because they considered that they were fighting for their jobs. We often find that during political campaigns statements are made about ourselves and our opponents that we know to be untrue, and we do not like them. The reason is that every enthusiastic worker in an election campaign cannot be kept in check. That has gone on for years and unfortunately it will go on whatever we may do to try to prevent it. I find it hard, however, to believe that there are men in Western Australia, as was mentioned by one honorable senator, who wore undated returned soldiers' badges while they were canvassing during the election campaign although they were not entitled to wear them. When I came to Canberra I had a 1950 returned soldier's badge and I lost it, and so I am guilty of wearing an undated badge. </para>

                            <para>- The control of a bank which is growing and will continue to grow is too great a job for one man. The Commonwealth Bank operates not only in Australia but it has branches in other countries also. It is easy to see how much easier it would be for a board of directors to control the bank than for one man to control it, because the responsibilities of control are growing all the time. Many honorable senators have said that the bank has done a wonderful job in the past few years. Nobody will deny the truth of that statement, but I point out that in view of the conditions of this country's finances as a result of the high prices that we have been receiving for our primary products, any bank could have proved a wonderful success during those years. I do not consider that it is necessary for all directors on the proposed board to be experienced in or authorities on banking. Naturally it is most necessary for some of them to be so qualified and the measure provides accordingly. I suggest that men of ability, sound judgment and experience, whether in the commercial, industrial, agricultural, pastoral or any other sphere, could do a good job on the board. Unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> I am hopeful that Western Australia will have a representative on the board, as all of the outlying States should have. Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia have conditions with which the people of Victoria and New South Wales are not familiar. As far as the number of directors on the proposed board is concerned I remind honorable senators that banks throughout the world have boards of directors numbering from five to 24. I consider, therefore, that a board of ten, as is proposed, is not too large. I believe that two heads are better than one and I believe that there is security in numbers. Many honorable senators have pointed out that under a Labour administration the bank was controlled by a Governor and a Cabinet of about eighteen directors, which was equivalent to a board. Compared to such a board our proposed board of ten is small. Would honorable senators opposite say that all the Cabinet Ministers,  who would in fact be directors of the bank under the system that Labour desires, could be classed as experts on finance ? </para>

Listening to statements that have been made to-day and yesterday, one would believe that the Australian Wheat Growers Federation is opposed to the board system to be provided by this measure. I shall quote from the same newspaper as that from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> quoted this morning, but I shall quote more of it than he did. The paper is the <inline font-style="italic">Farmers' Weekly</inline> of the 27th April, 1950. I point out that in every walk of life people have different political ideas. Some of them are Labour, some of them are Liberal and some are Australian Country party supporters. </para>

                            Scilly  (JT.S.W.) said that the previous legislation introduced by the Chifley Government provided that the Federal Treas urer should be a financial dictator of the Commonwealth. Governments changed, and this was considered far too great power to place in the hands of one man. Whilst a Government was in power, whose views were deemed to be sound by the majority of the people, things might be satisfactory, but Governments were turned out and it was deemed dangerous that such authority should be vested in one individual. Prior to the Chifley legislation there was a board on which provision was made for producer representation. " We should demand representation on any board which may be elected to deal with financial problems ", said

" That the Federation advocate the creation of a Commonwealth Bank Board with adequate representation for primary producers, and that it be subject to the control of Parliament at all times ". Thi3 would mean that Parliament and not one man should be the supreme head. </para>

                            Henderson (Vic.) expressed himself hs  opposed to both the motion and the amendment. He doubted if the point already raised, that the Treasurer should dictate the policy of the bank, was being overcome by the present legislation. If a dispute arose between the Treasurer and the Board, all the latter was required to do was to table the appropriate document in Parliament. If the Government had a large majority it could refuse to even  allow  the matter to be discussed.  " This is a very dangerous motion, and 1 feel the people will resent interference ' with the Bank Board just as they resented interference with the private banks ", said

                        <para>. - A peculiar point about this bill is that no honorable senator on the opposite side seems to know or wants to know who would constitute the bank board. I have heard it said again and again that the Government has a mandate to bring in this piece of retarding legislation. It is true that the policy speech of the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> covered many subjects. The electors were informed through the radio and by page advertisements in the newspapers that the socialists were going to take away their homes, farms, and factories. The people were forced into a fear complex and as a result of its fear campaign, this Government was elected. It now claims that this -bill is part of its policy and that it proposes to do certain things. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Whenever political parties of the same colour as the Government have gained office and attempted to put forward retarding legislation, they have always used the socialist bogy. Away back in 1910 they said that anarchy was hiding in every plank of the socialist platform and similar statements have been made at every general election since then. The Government claimed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> and the Labour party were socialists. If honorable senators on the Government side are to continue to cite me as a socialist, I say that they are fascists. The Prime Minister said in New South Wales that if elected he would ban Communists and " fellow travellers " and that the Labour party was a step ahead of the Communists, Honorable senators do not say that, but they describe honorable senators on this side as socialists. My reply is that they are fascists. </para>
                    <para>This proposed legislation is nothing new to the Australian Parliament or to its people. It is well known that the Bruce-Page Government determined to get rid. of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller. A representative deputation inquired from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller what the Commonwealth Bank would do to retard a depression and promote a scheme of public works and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller replied that the bank would do what it bad done during the World War I. when it found money for the war. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page determined that that was not to happen. They elected a bank board and got rid of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller. This bill proposes to place a stranglehold on the Common-, wealth Bank.  1  believe that it will do all the things that members of the Opposition have claimed. It will retard the business of the bank and bring about a return of that policy under which managers of the Commonwealth Bank were unable to accept any business from a customer if he was then doing business with a private bank. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators on this side of the chamber have been accused of having a grudge and with supporting class distinction. I recall when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Beasley made representations to the Commonwealth Bank on behalf of a constituent. The bank was then under the direction of a bank board. The constituent, who was seeking a position, had good scholastic qualifications, and was able to do any work required by the Commonwealth Bank. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beasley</inline> was told that although the girl had the requisite qualifications, the bank regretted that it could not find employment for her because her father was a tram driver. That is class distinction. </para>

                            <para>- That is the position that applied under a bank board instituted by the Bruce-Page Government, and I believe that it will revert to such practices again if a bank board is formed. A Labour government altered that position. The bank act was amended to provide that those who desired to be employed in the service of the bank would be appointed on merit alone. Just imagine an institution like the Commonwealth Bank telling people who wished to become employees that they could not be accepted because their parents worked in a job of a standard that was not suitable to the bank board ! I understand that the controller of the staff at that time was named Latham. I know that Latham is a name well known in this Parliament. </para>

My authority is the New South Wales Liberal party. At a meeting of the Liberal party in New South Wales there was a motion condemning the Government for its meekness.

The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> is  chairman  of the Liberal party and he was at that meeting. He was able to defeat the motion because of his knowledge of what the Government had to do to get this legislation through. He explained that there was a Senate to get past and that the Government had to do certain things,* He told the conference that the bill was the best that the Government could put up at the moment.  His  statements then demonstrate to me that this bill is- not sufficient as a pay-off to the banks. They will demand more. </para><para>The Senate does not know the names of those who will be appointed to the board, and until honorable senators have more information I hope that the bank board proposal will be excluded from the bill. The appointment of the board would interfere with the Commonwealth Bank. Who are the people to be appointed?

Will the members of the new Commonwealth Bank Board be men who have resigned from the directorates of the private banks ? Will they be representatives of wheat broking organizations such as Lindley Walker Wheat Company Limited? Will they be members of wool broking firms that extract as much as they possibly can from the wool-growers of this country?

                        the Advisory Council, will soon, be supplanted. They will be appointed, to other jobs, and replaced on the Commonwealth Bank Board by men who will do the bidding of the bankers. The Commonwealth Bank has functioned very well during the last five years. It has made substantial profits, advanced millions of pounds for home building and for the expansion of industry. Why then should a board be appointed to curb its activities? If it is doing all these things and doing them well, and at the same time making handsome profits, why alter the system of control unless the object is to sabotage the bank and restrict its activities? Not one honorable senator opposite will deny that the bank is doing a good job. The appointment of a board can only mean the strangulation of the bank. It is true that under this legislation the Treasurer may, if he disagrees with a decision of the bank board, refer the matter in dispute to the Parliament, but as the Treasurer himself, in collusion with the private bankers of this country, will appoint the members of the board, why should he ever have to quarrel with them? The board will do the bidding of the Treasurer, and there will be no occasion for him to report a disagreement to the Government. No Government that had a majority such as this Government has in the House of Representatives would bring such a matter before the Parliament. Therefore I am not misled by the provisions of the bill relating to disputes between the board and the Treasurer. No one will be misled by them. I shall be very happy to vote against the clause providing for the re-establishment of the Commonwealth Bank Board.
                    </para><para>The Labour party's policy is against control of the Commonwealth Bank by a board. Our banking policy has stood for 50 years. During that period, some people have left the Labour party and joined the Nationalist party, the United Australia party, the Liberal party, or perhaps the Communist party. Probably, whilst they were members of the Labour party, they did much to spread the Labour gospel throughout the community. Some may even have lectured for the Labour party and so have educated the working classes in the true meaning of socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. Now that they are members of other parties, it is hoped that their services will he availed of sometimes to instruct members of those parties in Labour's policy. It is a sad day for Australia when we find before us in this Parliament legislation aimed at retarding our national development. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> claimed that he believed in board control. He said also that the trade unions should be represented on the Commonwealth Bank Board. He may have been quite sincere in expressing that opinion, but he knows as well as I do that if this Government decided to appoint to the board one man to represent Labour's point of view, it would make sure that a majority of the other nine held contrary views. I hope that the Labour movement will dissociate itself from any proposal to appoint one trade union representative to the Commonwealth Bank Board. If the Government wants Labour thought to be expressed on the board, let it appoint five Labour men, and five others, with an independent  chairman.  Apparently the Government does not consider it necessary that all members of the board should have bad banking experience. Therefore there is no reason why there should not be five trade union representatives on it. As Australians they would be quite capable of distinguishing between right and wrong and of using common sense. What the Labour party wants to know is who the members of the board are to be. It is sad indeed to contemplate the fate of this great institution which financed Australia in two wars, the first to make this a land fit for heroes to live in, and the second to enable all members of the community to share alike in the national wealth. These fine sentiments were all right when the Japs were knocking at our door, but the war years have passed and, with the security of this country no longer threatened, the Government is attempting to destroy this great institution which is the baby of the Labour party. The bank was unshackled by Labour in 1945; now the Liberal party proposes to shackle it again at the behest of the private banking institutions. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - I shall come at once to what I considered to be the most important part of the bill - the repeal of the Banking Act 1947. Honorable senators opposite say that that legislation is a dead horse, and ask why we should flog a dead horse. I do not think that the horse is quite dead. It is still kicking, and as I am against cruelty to dumb animals, I shall support this bill, which is the bullet that will put the horse out of pain. Undoubtedly the present Government parties received a mandate from the electors, and we intend to carry it out. Banking was the main issue at the last election, and it may be the main issue at future elections. If this debate has done nothing else, it has provided us with valuable information for future election campaigns. We have heard from honorable <inline font-style="italic">senators</inline> opposite a long rigmarole about the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. That is not relevant to the consideration of this measure. We give credit to the Labour party for what it has done, and we take credit for any good that we have done. We admit that we have made a few mistakes, and we consider that the Labour party too has made mistakes.- Looking back over history it is very easy to point to mistakes that have been made; it is more difficult to legislate for the future without making mistakes. Honorable senators opposite accuse us of wishing to destroy the Commonwealth Bank. Beyond making that assertion over and over again, with the voices of successive speakers becoming louder and louder, the Opposition has failed to give any reason why we should be accused of wishing to destroy this bank. We have been accused also of being the representatives in this Parliament of the private banks, and of seeking now to repay those banks for the help that they gave us during the election campaign. Therefore, honorable senators opposite must not object if we, in a few days time, accuse them of repaying a debt to certain other people. </para>

                            <para>- I have not admitted it. Labour's main objection is to the proposal to reconstitute the Commonwealth Bank Board. Apparently honorable senators opposite accept the principle of board control in everything except banking. In Great Britain, the Labour party accepts the principle of board control in banking, because the Bank of England, the greatest bank in the world, is controlled by a board. If that bank can be operated in the interests of the people of the United Kingdom under board control, I maintain that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia can also be operated by a board in the interests of the people of this country. The  Leader  of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> said that he would have no objection to a board that was not subject to outside control. What did he mean by "outside control " ? I assume that he meant control by the private banks. In other words, be was insinuating that the private banks would issue orders to the Commonwealth Bank Board and that those orders would be obeyed. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> said that on the Commonwealth Bank Board theN would be two members who would be officers of the bank or of the Public Service.  They would take very careful note of what the Treasurer said, and would influence the rest of the board. Th:board would then do exactly what the Government told it to do. Honorable senators opposite cannot have it both ways. I say that the board will listen to what the Government says because the bill specifically provides that the Government shall control the policy of the bank. Honorable senators opposite cannot deny that; in fact, the complaint is actually made by many of them that the Government will control the bank. </para>

Proposed new section 9a (2.) makes it clear that the policy of the bank will be " directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia ". Furthermore, by increasing the capital of the bank we shall enable the bank to render even greater service to the Australian people. It is also contended by honorable senators opposite that we are anxious to establish a board so that we can pass on to it the responsibility for deciding contentious matters of financial and economic policy. For instance, it is suggested that a dispute is taking place amongst the parties represented on this side of the chamber concerning the value of the £1, and that that dispute could be resolved by referring it to the proposed board. </para>

                            <para>- Whether or not that is true, the fact remains that the bank is in a flourishing state today. Honorable senators opposite also contend that it will not be possible to obtain five suitable appointees who are not connected with banks. Since the Government will be able to choose from the ranks of every profession and calling in Australia, I think it is absurd to suggest that it will not be able to obtain five suitable appointees. Then, of course, it is said that the appointees will be under the influence of the private trading banks, that they will be wealthy individuals and directors of companies. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. What about the financial connexions of the present Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who receives a very generous salary and must invest a lot of money? He must have substantial financial interests of his own, and I ask whether honorable senators opposite have taken the trouble to " screen " that gentleman and some of their other advisers. Labour supporters also claim that although the five unnamed appointees will be appointed for a term of five years, the remaining two " unofficial " appointees may be dismissed at pleasure. However, the two gentlemen concerned are virtually public servants, and every one knows that a public servant is never thrown out of a job unless he has almost committed murder. ' It is obvious, therefore, that the security of tenure of those two gentlemen will he adequately safeguarded. </para>

                    <para>Having listened to the barrage of criticism directed at us by honorable senators opposite, I say that it would be impossible to bring forward a measure that they would not criticize. We have been accused of all sorts of things. Apparently members of the Labour party believe that we have no political honesty at all. Our intentions are misconstrued and our statements are twisted to support the theories of honorable senators opposite. We are not really a lot of rogues! Whereas we are out to help the Commonwealth Bank by establishing a board of members with very wide interests to control the bank, honorable senators opposite persist in misrepresenting our action as an attack upon that institution. As part of their campaign against us,  honorable  senators opposite contend that the bank has been run more profitably under the present system than it was under th&lt;; former board. However, that statement can be easily disproved by examining the relative figures. I have taken the trouble to look at the balance-sheets of the bank which show that during the last four years of board control the hank showed a rate of increase in  profits  of £1,186,000, and that during the corresponding four years of control under a governor the rate of increase of profits amounted to £2,200,000. I point out that the last four years of board control were the worst years because they included the war, whereas during the past four years when a governor has had sole control the country has enjoyed great prosperity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> referred to the good work done by the hank during the war, and mentioned that loans were over-subscribed and that the interest on money borrowed for the prosecution of the war was only 3£ per cent. However, I point out that the bank was controlled by the board during at least a part of the war. </para>
                    <para>Another allegation made by our friends opposite is that the former bank board caused the depression. Although a great deal was said immediately prior to the recent election about the causes of the last depression, and Labour spokesmen blamed the trading banks and the nonLabour parties for the depression, it is perhaps significant that nothing whatever was said about the former Commonwealth Bank Board. Now we are hearing a great deal about that body. It is alleged that during the depression that board refused to advance money to the Government. What actually happened was that the board advised the Government to take certain steps. What a poor Government it must have been to allow the bank board to dominate it! Allegations are also made that the board proposed to be established under this bill will tie up money and will not make it available for developmental projects. It has been suggested that even such a project as the Snowy Mountains scheme may not be able to obtain finance from the board. Surely it would be a weak government that could not get around the board in such a matter! However, the real position will be that when the Government controls the board, as we intend that it shall, the board will not have the say in such matters. Since the Snowy Mountains project has been mentioned by honorable senators opposite, I ask them whether, when the previous Labour Administration decided to implement that scheme, it had to go to the bank and ask it for the money to finance the scheme? To put the matter more plainly, did the former Government decide that the scheme was to be implemented, or wa9 the decision made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> in that Administration? </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, we claim that the establishment of the proposed board will not only enable the bank to continue to function efficiently and in the interests of the people, but that, because the board will represent a cross-section of the corn-  munity,  including industry and trade, it will also function more successfully. Honorable senators opposite seem to imagine that the board will be composed of multi-millionaires and individuals with large incomes, who wilt resign from banks one day in order tobecome members of the board thenext day. That is not our intention. We intend that the board shall be a cross-section of the Australian community and that, under the control of the Government, it shall manage the Commonwealth Bank for the good of the country. I support the bill- </para>

                    <para>Although honorable senators on this side of the chamber have asked the Government repeatedly to state the reason why it wishes to establish another Commonwealth Bank Board, no real answer has been given to that question. It is admitted that since 1945, under the present system of control, the Commonwealth Bank has done a remarkably good job. The Government must be actuated by some motive in proposing to alter that system. I suggest that the motive is that it desires to sell out to the private trading banks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> referred to the fact that we have not heard one word of protest by the private banks against this measure. I ask the Senate to contrast the present position with that which existed in 1947 when a Labour government introduced a measure to nationalize the banks. It was almost impossible to move in Parliament House here or anywhere else owing to the number of agents of the private banks who were protesting against that measure. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Attorney-General, in reply to an interjection to the effect that the proposed board might do the same things as those that were done by the previous hoard in 1931, said the times are different now and that this proposed board might not do the same things. To my mind, that statement indicates that he believes there is a. danger that it will do so. Almost every honorable senator opposite who has spoken in this debate has referred to the Scullin Government, which was in office during the depression years, when this country was, in effect, under the control of the private banks. During that period the private banks, through the Commonwealth Bank Board, actually dictated the financial policy of this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> said that governments had no control of the factors that caused the depression. We know that they had not. We know that there were outside influences at work over which the governments of that period had no control, but we know also that if the Commonwealth Bank had acted in the interests of the people, as it was intended that itshould act, the privations that were endured during the depression by the people of this country could have been at least alleviated. The Scullin Government was in office, but not in power. The anti-Labour parties had a majority in the Senate. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> was one of the members of those parties in this chamber who voted against a proposal by the Scullin Government to make £18,000,000 available for the relief of distress. Those are facts. Honorable senators opposite will not deny that although tens of thousands of our own kith and kin were literally starving during the depression, we had or could have produced what was required to feed, clothe and house them. Surely they will not deny that those things could have been provided. The only commodity of which we were really short during those years was money. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to go back to 1893, when the private banks of this country literally robbed thousands of people of their savings. In 1924, the Bruce-Page Government established the Commonwealth Bank Board. The members of the board were mainly representative of the interests of the private trading banks. One member was a representative of the trade union movement, but obviously he was only a voice crying in the wilderness. I shall remind honorable senators opposite of one of the first things that the private trading banks did when the Commonwealth Bank Board was established by the Bruce-Page Government in 1924 - </para>

If honorable senators opposite want evidence of the dictation of financial policy, they should refer to the actions of the late " Joe " Lyons, who was the Prime Minister of Australia in 1932, at a time when he had left the Labour party and assumed the leadership of the United Australia party, as the Liberal party was then known. Incidentally, the initials U.A.P. stand for " Unemployment and Poverty ". That is all that we had when it was in power. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> speaking at a public meeting in Adelaide, intimated that it was only because the private banks had confidence in his Government that it was able to carry on.

Honorable senators on this side of the chamber have made it clear that they will not countenance a return to the previous system of control of the Commonwealth Bank by a board. We want to know the Government's motive in seeking to appoint a board. Even Government supporters admit that the bank has done a remarkably good job since 1945. The Banking Act 1947 has been dragged into the discussion for political reasons only. That act is dead. The Government says that it will appoint to the board five men not connected with banking interests. Where will it find thom ?  Does  it  propose  to appoint dress designers or milliners? </para>
                    <para class="block">I suggest that the Government intends to leave the way open for the appointment to the board of representatives of the trading banks. The Government is not game to say who the five members will be, or perhaps it has not yet been told by those who are dictating its actions. We know that any director of a trading bank can resign, and be appointed to the board of the Commonwealth Bank the following day. Moreover, certain appointments to the board can he terminated at any time. We are forced to the conclusion that this bill represents a partpayment to the trading banks in return for the colossal sums they expended on behalf of the anti-Labour parties in the general election campaign. This bill is a sell-out to the trading banks of the same kind as that attempted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richard</inline> Gardiner Casey in 1938. Honorable senators opposite know that, and this legislation is merely an attempt to cover up the Government's intentions. The Government has already sold out everything it can for the benefit of the interests it represents. We have been told that the banks, when they participated in the election campaign, were merely trying to defend their rights. I know one bank manager in "Victoria who refused to go out, on the door-knocking campaign, and hp was sent out into the bush. </para>

                            <para>- I can prove what I say. The man told me himself. I have seen a letter from one of the banks to its employees instructing them what to do at political meetings, what questions to ask at Labour party meetings, and what questions to ask at Liberal party meetings. Bank employees, who were sent out electioneering, received their ordinary salaries, plus overtime. Many of them were required to act against their own judgment. The trading banks are determined to regain control of the nation's economy. It stands to reason that the five unnamed members of the board will be connected in some way with the trading banks. We know how industry throughout Australia is associated, through its management, with the banks. It would be practically impossible to pick on any prominent businessman whose business was not in some way connected with the trading banks. </para>

Australian Labour party as printed in 1948, and, so far as I know, unamended since that date. The document sets forth the objectives of the Labour party as endorsed at a secret conference, and they include the socialization of industry, production, distribution and exchange-. It is stated that industry is to be socialized through the control of banking by the nation, and in the forefront of the objectives are nationalization of banking, credit and insurance. However, in the policy speech of the Leader of the Opposition, pretence, not plain speaking, was resorted to. He did not tell thepeople what were the objectives of the Labour party. On the contrary, besought to conceal from them the intentionof the Labour party to nationalize banking. He knew that if he could succeedin getting back into power for  another  term he could surreptitiously put into effect this foreign and odious doctrine of nationalization. </para>

When I reflect upon it and re-read it I get a certain amount of merriment from the sentiments that have been mouthed in this Parliament during this debate. That act was printed with good British money in the heart of a British community and forced through a British parliament so hurriedly as to prevent the people from having any vote upon it before it came into operation. Even the proceedings taken by those whose destruction was threatened by that legislation were opposed. Those people sought only the protection of the courts of the country which they asked to adjudicate upon the validity of that act. Yet in relation to another matter honorable senators opposite argue vehemently, not in defence of democracy, not in defence of institutions lawfully carrying on the business of banking which is not unlawful in itself, but in defence of organizations that are satellites of the Communist party. The official policy of the Labour party, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is the  Deputy  Leader in this chamber, is the nationalization of banking, and that policy is identical in that respect with the policy of the Communist party. But how did honorable senators opposite and their friends seek to give that policy legislative effect? I shall read to the Senate appropriate passages from the judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Dixon of the High Court in relation to that act.

                            <para>- I pause to state that what I am reading is a relatively brief extract from the judgment of  His  Honour, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Dixon, which was adopted by the highest tribunal to which the Australian Attorney-General of the day appealed. I refer to the Privy Council, which recognized the value of the judgment from the point of view of conveying an understanding of the act and its constitutional invalidity. I point that out because a moment's reflection may elicit even from honorable senators opposite some degree of respect for that very elevated contribution to our constitutional knowledge, which, although it is remote from their level of thinking, may nevertheless some day he reached by them. </para>

                        <para>These private banks, as the act calls then-, are divided into those incorporated in Australia, those incorporated in the United Kingdom and those incorporated elsewhere. The Commonwealth Bank is authorized to purchase by agreement shares in a bank incorporated in Australia or in the United Kingdom. The Treasurer must approve. Shares in an Australian bank so purchased are, by force of the act and in spite of anything the articles of association may say, vested in the Commonwealth Bank, which thereupon becomes a member of the company. This is the first operative provision (secs. 12: 14: 10:). Next, the Treasurer is enabled to publish a notice in respect of any bank incorporated in Australia that on a named date the shares situated .in Australia shall vest in the Commonwealth Bank. The consequences are twofold. On the expiry of the notice shares then on the Australian register, or  afterwards  coming upon it. i-pst in the Commonwealth Bank which, as  before  becomes a member of the company,  notwithstanding  the articles of association. At the same time the directors are removed and nominees of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, approved by the Treasurer, take the place nf the directors and assume a)] the powers of the company.  </para>

                    <para class="block">I shall now paraphrase the judgment without directly quoting it. In the third place the judge referred to the fact that under the act the Commonwealth Bank could compulsorily acquire the businesses of the private banking companies, and fourthly, that under the act the Treasurer took power to forbid the companies to carry on their banking business. Fifthly, he said that, as the Constitution requires, compensation was to be paid to the companies, such compensation to be assessed by a Court of Claims especially established for the purpose. Lastly, the judgment said that the act contains provisions regarding the staffs of the banks. And so, at the arbitrary will of the Treasurer of the day, the shares and assets of the banks were to he acquired by the Commonwealth or its agencies, and the livelihood of those whose futures were wrapped up in  these  banks were compulsorily to he directed by a government agency. When we realize the arbitrary nature of that piece of legislation, and how fundamentally destructive it was of the very roots of these rights of the British people to earn- </para>

                        <para>- I was referring to the rights of the British people to earn that by which they may live and acquire for themselves independence, that it, private property. Is it not the considered view of this chamber that this is a great day fo* the British? The people gave a magnificent majority to our distinguished Prime Minister at the last general election. It is a great day when this legislation can go through this chamber despite the continued existence of a socialist majority. This measure spells death to the foreign and iniquitous piece of legislation that was designed to nationalize this country's banks. Honorable senators opposite are still disparaging the employees of the private banks who took part in the defence of their own livelihood. Those honorable senators have been unworthy enough to defame the bank officers and to impugn them by saying that they simply acted as stooges and not at the dictate of their own consciences. I say that those officers very definitely took their lives in their hands and came out in defence of their livelihood against that arbitrary legislation. Because they did so they were the targets for attack by honorable senators opposite. I say here and now that thosepeople are entitled to a respectful mention, and it is entirely discreditable tothe Opposition that their good name iscontinually besmirched in this chamber.. They were fighting for the continued existence of the banks that provided their livelihood. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> seemed to bridle at the reference that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator George</inline> Rankin had made to my use of the word " independent " and its connexion with the I.W.W. The word " independent " was used in the title of the I.W.W. which meant the Independent Workers of the World, and honorable senators will recall that it was used in that instance as a complete lie because it was adopted to conceal the fact that the I.W.W. was dependent upon a foreign organization. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> chose to give it a different context. Because it is proposed- in the hill to go outside the Public Service in appointing some members of the board <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has suggested that those who will be appointed will not have the independence that was promised to the people by the Prime Minister in his policy speech. If I may humbly say so, that is rather a naive idea. That view presupposes that nobody in the Public Service has any interest in private busi-  ness or in any licence returning profits. It also assumes that none of the previous executive board, the Cabinet of the day, had private interests in shares or in licences or in any property. No honorable senator will readily accept either assumption. It has been said also that if one goes outside the Public Service into the public field it is impossible to get five men in Australia of experience on the level proper to the requirements of the Commonwealth Bank Board who will be free enough from other financial interests to discharge their duty to the bank. The office of a member of the bank board, for this purpose, seems to be no higher than that of a judge of the Supreme Court, a member of Parliament, an income tax commissioner, a member of the Stevedoring Industry Commission, the Coal Mining Industry Tribunal or any of those institutions that Parliament constantly constitutes, and they have a very high level duty to carry out. </para>

                    <para>To suggest that five of the members of the proposed bank board should be proscribed because of the presumption that they will have disqualifying private financial interests seems to me to proceed from a guilty conscience. With all respect to those who have uttered those reflections on the men who might accept those positions, I say that that opinion proceeds from a very warped and unworthy conception of the standards of the ordinary experienced man who would take an appointment on such an organization. It is proposed that the appointee shall not be a director or employee of a bank, but it does not follow that he might not have been a shareholder the day before he entered the job. It is quite common for a man who has held private interests to fell them and be free of their fetters when he is appointed to a position of trust. I remember Lord Bruce declaring that during his term as Prime Minister of this country, he sold all his private interests and held only Commonwealth stock. I refer now to what I consider the most ignominious passage in this debate. </para>

                    <para>I hope that a little consideration of that passage will completely destroy the argument of the Leader of the Opposition. I want to turn next to what I think is the real nigger in the woodpile and the real reason why the socialist Opposition is opposing this part of the bill. When the management of the Commonwealth Bank is left to the sole control of the Governor and the management of the whole Parliamentary machine, when the Labour party is in power, is left to the one-man control of the Prime Minister or the Treasurer, it is not nearly so difficult for secret policy to be put into effect by secret means as it is when there is a completely democratic parliamentary machine, such as the Liberal Government, and completely democratic control of the bank by a board as is provided in this bill. The real purpose of this vital fight to retain one-man control of the Commonwealth Bank is that all the mechanism that characterizes the Labour caucus may be retained, and that secretly and not by means of documents placed publicly on the table of both Houses, the socialist policy may be squeezed into the community whether the people know it and whether the idea is approved or not. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators have heard the old record on the subject of the depression. Honorable senators opposite have said that there was a bank board in existence during the last depression and that it pulled down the depression upon the nation. It is just as true to say that the Labour Government was in existence during the last depression and that it pulled down on the people all the  misery  that the Opposition has described. The truth is that during the great economic depression that involved this country and almost every other country of the "world in the early 1930's, members of the party that now sits in Opposition in this Parliament, pulled down the blinds of their houses. In their shadows they are afraid to face the sunlight, and to see the real remedies that should be applied. A few moments of impartial consideration would be sufficient to convince them that their stories about the Commonwealth Bank Board having caused or aggravated the depression in this country are stuff and nonsense. For those reasons, 1 wholeheartedly support the bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">I shall deal first with the proposals that were contained in the 1947 banking legislation, which provided for the complete nationalization of banking in Australia. In .an excellent speech last evening, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> outlined the reasons that prompted the Chifley Government to introduce the banking nationalization legislation in 1947. History records what happened to that legislation. Our own High Court, and subsequently the Privy Council, decided that the Australian Parliament did not have power to nationalize banking. It is not a matter for congratulation that the National Parliament, which consists of men and women elected by the people of Australia, and is charged with the duty of legislating for the betterment of this country, should be denied the power to do what it considered should be done towards that end. Although supporters of the Government have rejoiced that that legislation was declared invalid, I remind them that in the future some of their legislation may be declared invalid. From time to time since federation legislation that has been enacted by anti-Labour governments has been invalidated by the High Court of Australia. To-day Australia is playing a most important part in world affairs. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is expected by other great nations of the world that we shall play an everincreasing part in relation to the problems associated with countries to the north of Australia. I stress the importance of the provision whereby any act of the Australian Parliament, whether of major importance or otherwise, may be tested before "the High Court, or the Privy Council,  by  any person who feels aggrieved. Over 50 years ago, after much discussion, the founders of the Commonwealth wrote into the Constitution that -the Australian Parliament should have power to deal with hanking, other than State banking. I remind 'honorable senators that the members of the conventions that framed the Constitution which was acceptable to the people of Australia were not supporters of Labour. Indeed there is no evidence that they were men who believed in the socialization of industry or banking. Not long previously the banking institutions of this country had failed. I refer to the great -bank smash of the ^nineties. After seeing the difficulties that had been experienced by the various States they considered it advisable to vest the National Parliament with power to legislate concerning banking. However, nearly 50 years later their desires have been frustrated by a judicial decision. During this debate, as well as during the election campaign last year, honorable senators who now support the Government have made a great display against nationalization of banking, despite the fact that the High Court had previously announced its decision.  Vast  sums of money were expended by the private banks, which employed persons to travel from one end of the country to the other, canvassing for votes for antiLabour candidates. I recollect that on one occasion, when I was in a train travelling from my home town to Melbourne, a lady sitting opposite to me said to her friend, " My word, it's terrible to think that the Labour candidate has won the Bendigo seat, considering the way that my husband worked during the campaign. He was released by the bank for twelve months, and personally canvassed 8,000 houses in the electorate of Bendigo and the adjoining electorate of Lalor. We thought we would win Bendigo." Of course she did not know who I was. The election results that had just been announced showed that the Labour candidate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> J. Clarey, had been successful. 1 also recollect an occasion when I was travelling to Colac by train to open my election campaign. When the train was nearing Colac I said to a fellow-passenger, with whom I had been conversing, " This is where I commence to woo the electors ". He said, " I am on the same job". As I did not identify him as a candidate I asked him which party he represented. He then informed me that he was representing the banks. There were four other representatives of the private banks travelling with him. During the campaign in" the western district of Victoria I saw them almost nightly at political meetings canvassing for votes for non-Labour candidates. Obviously the private banks wished to destroy the Labour Government. It was most significant that the private banks were willing to expend large sums of money  canvassing for votes for non-Labour candidates, because as an honorable senator remarked this afternoon, following the decision of the Privy Council nationalisation of banking was as dead as the dodo. </para>

                        has suggested that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                        had a sinister motive when he stated that he favoured the nationalization of banking. I remember addressing a political meeting at which a representative of the banks asked me whether it was not a fact that the Australian Labour party believed in the nationalization of banking, and whether it was not a fact that I had stated on a previous occasion that the Constitution should be amended. I replied that Labour -did favour the nationalization of banks. He said : " How do you expect that it will be brought about?" I said: "By an alteration of the Commonwealth Constitution ", and the matter was subsequently discussed and debated during the campaign.  At a later meeting he asked me: " Can you tell me and the audience when the referendum will be held?". I said : " Yes, I can tell you almost the exact date." Let me tell honorable senators now that whilst the Privy Council has declared against the validity cf our proposals to nationalize banking, and whilst the nationalization of banking might be a dead issue at the moment, it is quite possible that that issue will be resurrected later. It will be resurrected and a referendum of the people will be taken, and I prophesy now that the referendum will be carried if it is taken on the next occasion on which the private banks of this country seek to inflict upon the people a repetition of the misery, degradation, starvation and poverty suffered by the people during the depression. ,  If  Labour had had a majority of supporters in both Houses of the Parliament during the regime of the Scullin Government it might never have been necessary for that Administration to consider submitting a referendum to the people, because, undoubtedly, the former Commonwealth Bank Board would have obeyed the direction of the Parliament. Those who have read the history of the depression and know the efforts made by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline>

                    <para>Of course, we know that there is a great difference between a decision of the Government and a decision of the Parliament. It is quite obvious that a decision made by a government need not necessarily be approved of by the Parliament. A decision of the Parliament connotes the approval of both Houses of the Parliament.  Had a direction to the bank come from both Houses of the Parliament, I believe, as I have already said, that the bank board would have carried out that direction. However, since it was not possible to obtain the concurrence of the Senate in the giving of any such direction, the Government had to consider the alternative of holding a referendum; and I believe that if the Scullin Government had submitted a referendum to the people on the nationalization of the banks the referendum would have been carried, and we should not now be discussing this important matter. But that is all in the past. To return to the present, I say that whilst the banks may have escaped nationalization recently because of legal technicalities, L suggest to them that they beware of the future and behave themselves. They should recognize that they play a most important part in the economy of the  nation.  They are quite welcome to any little crumbs of comfort that they may obtain from the first portion of this bill, which merely enacts formally that the Banking Act 1947, which has already been mutilated by the decisions of the courts, is no longer pf any force and effect. However, the provisions of this measure which affect the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945 must be a sad disappointment to the private banking inst;tut:ons and those who spent so much it on nv before, and during the recent election campaign in the effort to remove Labour from office. After all, their real intention was to destroy the effect of the 1945 legislation, sp that they would be able to continue along the  road  that they followed before that legislation was enacted. Those who take the trouble to peruse the speeches made by anti-Labour members of the Parliament during the passage of the 1945 legislation must be bitterly disappointed with the present legislation, and if ever political  parties  were guilty of an act of cowardice, which let their supporters down, they are the political parties who are represented opposite. </para>
                    <para>One of the most serious of the cr: plaints made against the 1945 legislation was that banking would be subjected to political control. Later it waa suggested that Labour introduced the 1947 legislation in order to give effect tr its policy of socializing the means of production, distribution and exchange. Those who attacked the 1945 legislation during its passage through the Parliament declared that it was iniquitous that the trading banks should have to deposit with the Commonwealth Bank their surplus assets, because, it was suggested, those surplus assets might be made use of by the Commonwealth Bank to compete against the private trading banks. Tt was also contended that, the Commonwealth Bank would be in a much more favorable position than that occupied by the trading banks, inasmuch as the Commonwealth Bank would not have to pay rent, rates and so forth. It was argued that all the advantages enjoyed by the Commonwealth Bank over its competitors <inline font-style="italic">would</inline> enable it to exterminate them. Comparing those criticisms of the Commonwealth Bank with the provisions of the present legislation, I cannot discover any provision to remove the bank from political control. Of course, the verbiage of the present legislation is somewhat different from that of the 1945 legislation, and this measure contains certain elaborate provisions to apply in the event of a difference in policy between the Treasurer and the members of the proposed board. Where the 1945 legislation mentioned the ". Governor " we find that in this measure the words " the Board " are substituted. But does this legislation represent any real departure in substance from the 1945 act? Another consideration that I commend to supporters of the Government is that the present measure when passed, will be on the statutebook for use in a few years' time when Labour returns to office. </para>
                    <para>Adverting to Labour's 1945 legislation on the Commonwealth Bank, I point * out that if there was anything sinister in it one would expect that the present Government would have sought to repeal it. But, as I have already pointed out, this measure does not propose to repeal any substantial part of that earlier legislation. It is of particular interest to recall the speech made by the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> who was the Leader of the Australian Country party and sitting in opposition, when the 1945 legislation was being enacted. In fact, that measure was so obnoxious to the right honorable gentleman that he moved an amendment that the bill should be virtually abandoned and the Government instructed to introduce legislation to restrict the note issue and to achieve a number of other objectives. I ask honorable gentlemen to contrast the right honorable gentleman's utterances on the note issue on that occasion with the speech that he made when he introduced this measure in the House of Representatives, which was repeated by the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> when he introduced the bill to this chamber. On this measure both Ministers said - </para>
                    <para>So far as the note issue is concerned, the Government, in preparing this bill, considered whether statutory provisions should be made for a limitation upon the amount of notes that could be issued, but, having made provision fop the Government to bring policy issues before Parliament where the bank is required to adopt a policy determined by the Government, it has decided that further statutory provision in respect of the note issue is not necessary. </para>
                    <para class="block">The references made by the Treasurer in 1945 to political control of banking are particularly amusing in the light of the foregoing passage. Apparently, at that time political control of banking was a sentiment that, presumably, existed only in the minds of Labour supporters, who, it was alleged, regarded it as an opportunity to socialize the means of production, distribution and exchange. However, the Commonwealth Bank Act has operated since 1945, and the Commonwealth Bank has played a most important part in promoting the economic welfare of the nation. The following is another very interesting passage from the speech delivered by the Treasurer in the House of Representatives and repeated by the Minister for Social Services in introducing the bill to this chamber : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Tt is clear that in Australia to-day, as in other modern communities, the note issue is a.n indicator of the general credit situation rather than a means of controlling credit and. to reverse trends in the note issue, it may be necessary to  modify  the whole credit policy. The  policy  of the bank in relation to the note issue is thus  part  of the monetary and banking policy of the bank, and is a  matter  upon  which  the bank is required to keep the Government  informed  and one which the Government mav. if  necessary,  bring to the notice of the Parliament. </para>

                    <para class="block">That i's n very nine statement to make to the Parliament to-day! Of course, the Minister was not a member of the antiLabour Opposition in 1945, but the Treasurer was one of the most bitter critics of that legislation. Now, he gives one of the most important principles of the 1945 legislation his unqualified blessing ! The reason why we do not find representatives of the banking institutions in the lobbies now is probably that they are heartily disgusted with this legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> asked, by way of interjection, why we were oppos-  ing this measure. "We are opposing it for good and sufficient reasons. We object to an institution that, for the last five years, has played a prominent part in the economic life of this country again being controlled by a board. The history of banking, and especially the history of banking institutions controlled by private persons, is not a very happy one. The Commonwealth Bank, during its comparatively short life, for some period of which it was prevented from playing the part that it should have played in our affairs, has been subjected to great stresses and strains. It has been called upon to finance two wars in which the nation was engaged and to provide money for rehabilitation and reconstruction. I believe it to be one of the greatest financial institutions in the world. Believing that, I am very interested in the way in which it is controlled. Honorable senators opposite have stated that it was the Bruce-Page Government that invested the Commonwealth Bank with authority to act as a central bank. I do not wish to detract from that achievement of the Bruce-Page Government, and I am prepared to give the present Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> all the credit that he deserves for it, but it must not be forgotten that the legislation that invested the Commonwealth Bank with that power also reduced its ability to serve the people of this country. </para>
                    <para>In the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Commonwealth Bank Bill 1 945, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> who was then Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, made reference to the suggestion that the Labour party wanted the Commonwealth Bank to be converted from a bankers' bank into a people's bank. He felt that there was something very sinister in that suggestion. The right honorable gentleman, in discussing that bill, said - </para>

                        <para>The measure professes, on the face of it - and, indeed it was so explained by the Treasurer - to be one that is enlightened and' progressive, and designed to give increased security to the people, whereas in fact, carefully analysed - and I propose to-night to submit it to analysis - it is reactionary and unsound. </para>

                    <para class="block">He comforted himself with the thought that, because a general election was to be  held approximately eighteen months from then, there would be some soft-pedalling and that the Government would not be in a hurry to expand the Commonwealth Bank in the manner for which the bill provided. The right honorable gentleman's expectation was not realized. At the 1946 general election, the people of this country expressed in no uncertain manner their confidence in the Labour Government that had introduced the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, which some persons thought would destroy the country and which the present Prime Minister described as " reactionary and unsound ". During this debate, honorable senators opposite have been forced to admit that the Commonwealth Bank, under the powers conferred upon it by that act, had proved to he a great and wonderful institution. </para>

                    <para class="block">One would have thought that the Government,having in mind the success of the Commonwealth Bank since 1945 and knowing that the private hanks are now immune from socialization or nationalization for as long as they behave themselves, would have approached this matter in the spirit suggested by the Minister for Social Services, and that instead of throwing the apple of discord into the political arena it would have been satisfied to permit the present system of control of the Commonwealth Bank to continue. Repeated requests from honorable senators on this side of the Senate to be informed of the way in which the hank has failed while under the control of a Governor and why it is thought to be necessary to alter the present system of control have been met by the Government with complete silence. Honorable senators opposite have not given one reason why the proposed change should be made and why, once again, banking should become a live political issue in this country. In view of past history and having regard to the fact that our requests for information have been met by silence, and notwithstanding the bitter disappointment over the terms of this measure of the interests that supplied the money to defeat the Labour party, I think I am justified in believing that there is a nigger in the woodpile. I feel that if this measure is passed, the institutions that have fought the Commonwealth Bank may once again be able to utilize it for their own purposes, or at least to prevent it from playing the part that it should play in the development of this country. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed that in future the Commonwealth Bank shall be subject to control by a board. We have very unhappy recollections of the members of the previous Commonwealth Bank Board. Despite the protestations of honorable senators opposite, we know how easy it would be to evade a provision that no person who is actively associated with banking may be appointed as a member of the Commonwealth Bank Board. When the present Viscount Bruce became Prime Minister of Australia, he resigned from his position as a director of his firm in Melbourne, but immediately he was defeated at an election he again became an active member of that firm. Does the Government consider that we are so simple as to believe that men whose whole lives and prosperity are dependent upon the success of commercial undertakings with which they are associated will be able, immediately they are appointed to the Commonwealth Bank Board, to divest themselves of all their previous associations? There are not many persons who believe that that could happen. Those of us who have studied the ramifications of industry realize that the interests of various commercial organizations are interlocked. The 1945 banking legislation provided, among other things, for the establishment of a department of the Commonwealth Bank to which small industrial undertakings that desired to expand their actitivies could apply for financial assistance. That phase of the  legislation was bitterly opposed in this chamber and in the House of Representatives by the present Government parties. It was opposed because the interests of the great captains of industry are interwoven with the interests of banking institutions. Those of us who happen to be acquainted with captains of industry know where their sympathy lies. We know that they make use of their positions in order to promote the development of the various industries with which they are associated. From time to time, honorable senators receive circulars and booklets from financial institutions. They also receive copies of prospectuses of new companies, setting forth the names of the directors, and after a while one begins to notice that certain of the directors are interested in a wide range of industries. Those who control industry in Australia do not want the Commonwealth Bank to be free from the domination of vested interests so that it may serve men who are trying to establish new businesses. To-day, Australia is entering an era of great development. Indeed, since the outbreak of the last war, industrial development in this country has been very rapid. Despite assertions that the workers have been " going slow the fact remains, as is proved by the balance-sheets of companies, that industry is constantly expanding. Of course there are those who wish to prevent small industrialists from extending their operations to the point of challenging established monopolies. I believe that there is a sinister motive behind the Government's proposal to appoint a Commonwealth Bank Board. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> said, it will bc impossible to find, outside the Public Service, disinterested men to appoint to I he board. We shall find, when the board is appointed, that the Commonwealth Bank has once more been brought under the control of the representatives of private enterprise, and for that reason 1 oppose the bill. </para>
                    <para>I also believe that the bank board, when appointed, will be used by the Government as an excuse for evading responsibility in the event of another economic crisis. In spite of the fact that it is proposed that the Treasurer shall retain power to direct the bank board on matters of policy, and that in the event of a dispute, the issue shall be laid before the Parliament, I do not believe that the present Treasurer would ever push the matter so far. He would shelter behind  the formula, " The board has recommended this, and the Government accepts its recommendation ". The Attorney-General has said that, in the event of a dispute' coming before the Parliament because of the refusal of the Treasurer to accept recommendations of the board, the elected representatives of the people would rise in their wrath and, by carrying a vote of no confidence in the Government, ensure that proper action was taken. The days when governments could be defeated on the floor of the House on a motion of want of confidence have long since gone by. There was a time when a Prime Minister did run the risk of defeat over an unpopular measure, but can any one imagine that the House of Representatives, constituted as it is to-day, would ever carry a motion of .want of confidence in the Government over some policy sponsored by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> who is also Leader of the Australian Country party? Therefore, what the Attorney-General said was just so much moonshine, and merely served to emphasize the Government's hypocritical approach to this matter. </para>
                    <para>No good purpose can be served by passing this bill, because there is no need to alter the method of control of the Commonwealth Bank. In 1945, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> speaking as Leader of the Opposition, said that if his party were returned to power, it would appoint a hoard to control the Commonwealth Bank. It is a poor excuse for this legislation that the Government feels obliged to give effect to an idle boast made five years ago. Neither the present Prime Minister, noi1 any one- associated with him, believed in 3945 that he would be in power within five years' time. In their hearts, they believed that their record was such that it would take them many more years to regain the confidence of the people. However, the age of miracles is not yet, passed. By a miracle, the present Government finds itself in office, but. although it has been there for more than five months very little constructive legislation has yet been submitted. The Government seems to be content to drift. If it were suggested that the Commonwealth. Bank Act 1945 prevented the Government from giving effect to its policy to restore value to the £1, the Government might have some excuse for introducing this measure. Even then, if the Government really wishes to put value back into the £1, the best way to set about it would be to assume control over the financial institutions of the country. I wonder whether the Government believes that it can put more value into the £1 by putting the primary producers back into the position they occupied before the Labour Government assumed effective control of the Commonwealth Bank. When the bank was controlled by a board, there was certainly good value in the £1 for the person who had any pounds, but the primary producers were getting very little for their products, and the wage-earners were getting very little for their work. Those who had money were able to buy property cheaply. They became rich out of the poverty of their fellows. There was plenty of value in the £1 - for those who had a £1 - when the Commonwealth Bank Board refused to allow the elected representative of the people to help the nation out of the depression. </para>

                        <para>- This is a most important matter. The banking legislation has run the gamut of many vicissitudes since the inauguration of the Commonwealth Bank. The Privy Council has decided that nationalization is beyond the power of this Parliament, but that decision was not easily obtained. When the matter came before the High Court of Australia there was a great deal of dispute between the legal fraternity and when one saw the legal talent assembled to argue the case one appreciated the difficulties. The decision of the Privy Council was a unanimous one. I understand that that is the form in which the Privy Council reports to His Majesty. I am not going to dispute the unanimity of the Privy Council's decision although it has been suggested to me that it was unfortunate that several of the learned councillors passed away during the hearing of the case. </para>

                <para>The fact is that in the High Court of Australia, where the justices are able to express their individual opinions and majority decisions count, there was a marked disagreement between them about the power of the Parliament. I mention that in passing because I have noted a certain smugness among honorable senators on the opposite side, especially those who are members of the legal profession, when they recalled that the majority of the High Court had a greed with the contention of the present Government. Disagreement between the members of the legal profession is nothing new. If they were unanimous they would be out of a job. It is regrettable, and nothing to rejoice about, that all the actions of this Parliament are subject to legal scrutiny in the High Court. The fight that took place on the banking issue was no ordinary fight. Wealth and privilege were linedup on one side and the ordinary people on the other. Unfortunately wealth and privilege won for the time being. That is only a continuation of the fight that has been going on throughout the ages. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I know the struggles that have taken place. The Government has obtained a pyrrhic victory, but the day of reckoning will come sooner or later. The fact is that the great cause for which the Labour party stands and for which it pleads in this Parliament cannot be kept down permanently. It is like a cork in the water. Pressure can keep it down for a time but immediately the pressure is lifted it rises again. I remind honorable senators opposite that other people have believed themselves to be safely entrenched on the benches of privilege, only to find that they had made a mistake. Sooner or later, they have been displaced. The present Government parties were fortunate to gain their victory as they did; but they will not enjoy the fruits of that victory for long if they permit the return to this country of conditions that existed during the regime of the previous Commonwealth Bank Board. Already there are signs that such conditions are recurring. In America to-day, there are millions of unemployed. That problem has to be met. We on this side of the chamber know that the Government parties are bankrupt of ideas for meeting that problem. By introducing this measure, they are impairing the capacity of the only institution that is capable of meeting a financial crisis in this country. The Opposition will do everything in its power to thwart the Government's attempt to stultify the Commonwealth Bank; but we shall do it constitutionally. We shall ensure that the fullstory shall be told to the people. </para>

This legislation may wound the Commonwealth Bank, and may perhaps retard its progress, but I venture to say that, in the years to come, the people of this country will rejoice to think that there was at least one party that stood for the protection of that great institution. I oppose this bill because I believe that it is not in the best interests of the nation.

                    <para class="block">That article bore the signature of a wellknown political correspondent, Oliver Hogue. No one can argue, that, over the years, the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Sun</inline> has shown Labour leanings. With many clauses of this bill, the Labour party cannot find fault. Apparently, therefore, there is still some hope for the vilest sinner. Sooner or later, and perhaps sooner than many people think, even greater recognition may come our way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and some other honorable senators opposite have expressed the fear that the 1947 bank nationalization legislation may be revived. In common with other political parties, Labour believes that the law of the land should be observed. We realize that constitutionally, the nationalization of banking is impossible at present. It is sheer hypocrisy for the opponents of Labour to suggest that Labour anted contrary to the best interests of this country by introducing its 1947 banking legislation. I refer honorable senators to my remarks when that legislation was before this chamber, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> volume 195, at page 2498. They would he of particular interest to anti-Labour South Australian senators. Some honorable senators opposite have stated that the nationalization of banking would stifle competition. I point out, however, that the private banks are an associated body. There is virtually no competition between them to-day. In saying that, I am fortified by an incident that took place at the depth of the depression, when I was a member of the South Australian Parliament. I refer to the remarks of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Butler, who was for many years Liberal Premier of South Australia. When he made his statement he was Leader of the Opposition in the House of Assembly in that State. In reply to an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archie</inline> Cameron, who at present occupies the Speaker's chair in the House of Representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Butler said - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>That is what members of the Australian Labour party have said for years. Our political opponents have declared time and again that members of the Australian Labour party have said that they were firmly convinced that the private trading banks were solely responsible for the depression. I contend, however, that had the policy of Labour that was given effect in the 1947 legislation been implemented prior to the depression, many of the happenings of those years would have been averted. Principally for the benefit of South Australian senators, I shall relate an incident that occurred at Birkenhead, a suburb of Port Adelaide, during the depression. Early in July, 1928, the United Milling Company's premises were destroyed by fire. Shortly afterwards the company's bankers, the Bank of Adelaide, petitioned in the courts of South Australia against the company for £53,957, with the result that the company " went through ". It was common knowledge at the time that large quantities of wheat destroyed in the fire belonged to the wheat-growers, who received no compensation. In 1931-32 Verco Brothers had branches in many country districts in South Australia, including one in the immediate vicinity of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford's</inline> homestead. At the commencement of the harvest in November, 1931, they commenced business in the usual way, and acquired wheat offered to them by farmers. The Bank of Adelaide forced them through the insolvency court, as a result of which many farmers lost the result of a year's efforts. Although legally right, that action was morally wrong because the bank must have known the financial position of Verco Brothers before the commencement of the season. Had Labour's policy in relation to banking been in operation at that time those unfortunate incidents would not have occurred. During the debate in 1947 I referred to a most disgraceful episode concerning a former Treasurer of Queensland in a Nationalist Government. The following is the introduction to an article that was published in <inline font-style="italic">Smith's Weekly</inline> of the 8thSeptember, 1934:- </para>

                <para> Some Queensland senators will remember that incident very well. In view of what has happened in Australia in past times of adversity, the sooner the people realize that Labour's policy in relation to nationalization of banking should be implemented the better. After the 1947 measure had been introduced it was not long before various sections of producers were voicing their complaints and doubts. Even the members of industrial organizations were taunted because they held out on various aspects. 1 repeat what I have said on many occasions before during my quarter of a century in politics, that if the primary producers of this country were united their lot would be much easier. They are very interested in the measure that is now under consideration. This is borne out by the following report that appeared in the West Australian on the l0th April— </para>

The overseas credits of that institution amounted to 2,000,000,000 dollars expressed in Canadian currency, but the number of unemployed in that country in November, 1949, amounted to over 152,000, and was increasing. The cost of living based on the 1937 index of 100 was 197. Passing now to South Africa, the journals to which I have referred show that the Reserve Bank of South Africa, is managed by a board of eleven individuals. That ' bank had overseas credits of only £104,300,000, and the number of unemployed white people was then 10,000 and was increasing. The cost of living based on the same index as Canada was 169. I pause to point out that South Africa is the greatest gold-producing country in the world. The Bank of New Zealand, which is managed by a board of ten directors, had overseas credits of only £41,000,000. The cost-of-living index was shown at 167. The. figures of unemployment are, fortunately, not disturbing. I invite honorable senators to compare those facts with the present financial and economic condition of Australia. Our present prosperity is undoubtedly due in large  measure to the operation of the Commonwealth Bank, particularly during recent years since that institution has been liberated from control by vested interests. Australia has no unemployed and has accumulated overseas credits of £418,000,000. The cost of living index is the same as that of New Zealand. When the International Monetary Fund's statistics were compiled Labour was still in office in this country, and our overseas credits were even higher then than they are now. Those facts prove beyond any doubt that the Commonwealth Bank has done a magnificent job. I refer honorable senators now to a statement that appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> of the 31st J anuary, 1950, under the heading " Company Meeting - Union Bank Reports Rapid Progress ". The report is as follows : - </para></speech><para>Level of Overseas Funds</para><para>The gross figure of Australia's international currency reserves rose very sharply during the year, and, at 30th June, 1949, amounted to £A.450,000,000. In view of the present high values of commodities, the probability of a greater fall in export than in import prices in the event of a decline in world trade, the unstable nature of part of the capital inflow, and the need for goods for replacement and expansion, the level of external funds is not perhaps unduly high. </para><para class="block">That is eloquent testimony to the efforts of the Commonwealth Bank, operating under its present control. The Curtin and Chifley Labour Administrations must also share the credit for that institution's success. I submit that in the face of the evidence that I have placed before the Senate, the present proposal to transfer the control of the Commonwealth Bank to a board is both unnecessary and unwise. Apart altogether from the successful operation of the bank under its present control, the hitter recollection of the part the bank was forced to play during the depression, when it was under the control of a board, must awaken every honorable senator to the danger of placing the bank again under the control of a board, and satisfy even our critics that Labour would do wrong if it supported this measure. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>2855</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KMN</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">GRANT, Donald</name><name role="display">Senator GRANT</name></talker><para>. -  I did not intend to speak on the bill, but as the debate progressed I became impressed more and more with the fact that members and supporters of the Government had no real idea of what was involved in the arguments advanced by the Opposition. Honorable senators opposite seem to entertain the idea that only a trivial difference divides the Government and the Opposition on this measure, and that that difference concerns only the proposal to place the bank under the control of a board, which they have been inclined to treat as of little or no importance. However, I submit that the subject of board control is of the greatest importance, because the proposed board would be able to decide who should obtain credit and who should not. In other words, it would be able to assist its friends and to refuse assistance to ite. opponents. I point out briefly now, as. did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan,</inline> that the strugglethat is now taking place has gone on eversince the days of the Jewish dispensation,, when the faithful were told that theusurer was a curse. Ever sin.09 then the struggle for. the control of the means <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> life has proceeded between those who sought to dispense the means of life for their own profit and those who had to obtain the means of life in order to exist. With the rise of the intelligence of the people, the idea has grown that man is a social animal, that he must purchase things for his social needs, and that, therefore, things must be sold to satisfy his social needs. Primitive men lived in villages, and the commodities that they exchanged were primitive commodities. Their needs were few and their knowledge was slight. They may have known about the people in the next village, but, apart from that, they knew nothing of the rest of the world. If they wanted to trade with the people of the next village, they took their primitive commodities there and exchanged them. It is probable that the human race was on this earth for millions of years before the idea of some medium of exchange was conceived. While men could easily carry from one place to another the articles that they wished to exchange, they did so, but as their horizon became greater, as science, step by step, wiped out superstition, as commercial relationships became more complex and when comparatively heavy articles were used which could not easily be carried from place to place, it became necessary to evolve some medium of exchange. If a man had to carry an article that he wanted to exchange from one place to another, and the man with whom he exchanged lt had to carry it to another place, quite obviously much unnecessary labour was involved. Therefor, a medium of exchange was evolved, but many ages passed before gold as a medium of exchange was known to the human race. The expression, " All Lombard-street to a half-penny orange " is a common one. Lombard-street is the street of bankers in London. The name is derived from Lombardy in Italy. In Lombardy, people began to get precious stones, gold and valuable ornaments. In those days, a great risk was involved in carrying such articles about, and some people conceived the idea of getting safes. Then they asked other people to come to them with their valuables and deposit them in their safes. People actually paid money for the right to have them in the safes, in which they were protected from thieves who might wish to steal them. As time went on, the people who had the safes discovered that very few people who had put valuables in the safes came along to claim them. They said to themselves, " We can make money out of this ". They gave receipts for the articles deposited in the safes, and they kept the articles. Then other persons came to them who wanted to use some of the articles. In other words, they wanted credit. The safe owners discovered that they could lend some of the things that were not their own, and could lend them at interest. That was the modern banking system in embryo. It has since developed to the international burglars' outfit that it is to-day. </para></talk.start><para>I was interested to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> say that bankers had safeguarded the interests of the people. A statement of that kind can be made only by some one who is exceedingly ignorant of the evolution of banking. I have yet to learn that private bankers have any interest in the people at all. I have yet to learn that banking, as an institution, was brought into existence for the benefit of the people or that when bankers lend money, they do so because they are interested in the purpose for which it is wanted. I am not one of those who blame the bankers, as bankers. If somebody wanted money to produce poison gas or to build a house of ill-fame, I should, if I were a banker, lend him the money, provided the security was adequate. I have yet to learn that banking has anything to do with humanity. Honorable senators opposite have talked about wasting time. One could talk to them about banking from now until a double dissolution - perhaps disillusion is a better word - and they would not understand it then. The Bank of England was founded by a Scotsman. When he received his charter, he said, in effect - I do not suggest that these are the words he used - that it was a charter to get money from people and to give credit on money that did not belong to him. In other words, it gave him the right to rob the people with impunity, not by lending them something but by giving them credit on their own deposits. One would not expect a Scotsman to engage in banking because he wanted to be a philanthropist. Banking has nothing to do with humanity. All the bourgeois history about banking that has been peddled is dope and nonsense. If some one came to me, as a banker, and said that he wanted to build a hall for Saint Vincent de Paul. I should fay, if I were a Catholic, " That is a very laudable object, but I am not in business to assist either masonic lodges, the Catholic Church or atheists. What is your security ? " If the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church approached a Scottish banker for a loan, that banker would not give him a better hearing than he would give to a Mahommedan if the security that he offered was inadequate. The motto of the bankers is, " No advance without security ". If some people came to me, as a banker, and said that, in their opinion, there was going to be a bacteriological war and that they wanted to establish a factory for the production of bacteria, it would not be my business to tell them that that was not a very laudable object. As a banker, I should say, " What is your security ? If you can show me that by the development of  bacteriological warfare you will gain control of markets upon which I can have a lien, I shall certainly give you credit ". A banker has nothing to do with morals, ethics or humanity. If he had, he would soon go broke. </para><para>The members of the Commonwealth Bank Board that is to be established will be persons whose ideas are similar to those of the Liberal party.. Otherwise they would not be appointed. I do not expect that the Government will wait until Comrade Sharkey is released from Long Bay gaol and then appoint him to the board. We do not blame the Government for doing what it wishes to do, if it can do it, hut we object <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> honorable senators opposite saying that it will be done because the Government wishes to look after the interests of this country. It will be done because the banks subsidized the last lying and fraudulent election  campaign  of the present Government parties. That campaign was a fraud from  beginning  to end. Everybody knew that nationalization of banking was dead. Everybody knew that the Communist  party  and the Labour party were not the same party, but the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> stated at meetings throughout the country that they were. Everybody knew that it was a lie to say, as the present Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eric J. Harrison)</inline> said again and again, that if the Labour party were returned it would conscript labour at the point of the bayonet. There was never such an organization in Australia as that which existed during the last general election. One could hardly get to the polling booths through the bank clerks who were distributing how-to-vote cards. All that has got to be paid for. It was not clone for nothing. The question asked was, "What is your security  ' " The present Government replied, " If we are successful we shall ensure that the capital that you invested in the election not only is returned to you but also is returned with interest ". If honorable senators opposite do not admit that, they do not know anything at all about capitalism. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline>showed that he had at least a little knowledge of economics. He said that we had stated that the </para><para class="block">Labour party could prevent a depression. We said nothing of the kind. I agreed with the honorable senator to a certain  degree  when he said that if the prices of agricultural products fell it might  be  impossible to implement our social services programme. I remember saying much the same thing some time ago. I think it was the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> who was opposing the continuous increase of wages - incidentally, if is not continuous - on the ground that the country could not afford it and that it would lead to disaster. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>2857</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZI</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">O'SULLIVAN, Neil</name><name role="display">Senator O'Sullivan</name></talker><para>- I have never opposed increases of wages. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>2857</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KMN</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">GRANT, Donald</name><name role="display">Senator GRANT</name></talker><para>- It might not have been the Minister.

The idea was that the price of agricultural commodities should continue to go up and up, while the money value of wages should remain stationary. I admit that if prices of agricultural products fell, wages should  fall  also, and then the whole social structure might be in danger of collapsing. I pointed out that; it was wrong that one section of the community only should benefit from rising prices. The only thing to do in the circumstances was to increase pensions, which we did on three occasions,  and  also to increase child endowment, &amp;c. We know-- that we are living in a time of deflation, and unless we are careful our last condition will be worse than the first. However, by exercising wise control over banking something could be done to improve the position. Let us take any Australian town at random - Inverell for instance, which is a wealthy place. In that town, the system for dealing with sewage is unworthy of the middle ages. In the days of the Soman emperors Rome had its aqueducts and sewerage. Versailles, however, in spite of its wonderful buildings and gardens, had no sewerage! at all. In Inverell, the system of -...... is not even as good as that in Rome more" than 2,000 years ago. During the depression, employment could  have  been provided by setting people to work installing sewerage in various parts of the country. Visitors to Australia are astonished to learn that even in a suburb like Wahroonga, which is. the home of the elite, the sewer system is very primitive. Had there been no Commonwealth Bank Board during the depression, improvements such as the installation, of sewerage could have  been  effected, and the efficiency of the people would have been increased. I know that under the capitalists' system it is not possible to issue money <inline font-style="italic">ad lib,</inline> because, unless production increases correspondingly prices will rise. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me give another illustration : During the war, our friends the Americans came here.

Its job was to build roads that should have been built during the depression, but, of course, the banks at that time could not see any profit in such undertakings. I am not blaming the bankers themselves. They are a part of the system-. They are- there to protect the interests of the shareholders, and they cannot afford to lend money unless the security is safe, and the remuneration immediate. Under pressure of war, however, old men were forced into the Civil Construction Corps to build roads that should have been built in the time of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> will not reveal the names of the five men who are to he appointed to the Commonwealth Bank Board, because he does not know.

We know, however, that the men to be appointed to the bank board will be of the same kidney as <inline font-weight="bold">.Sir Robert</inline> Gibson. Does any one think that the bank board will be interested in providing hospitals? The trading banks poured out their money to support the United Australia party, or the Liberals, or whatever they call themselves, in the last election. The banks will not be able to obtain a return of that money except through profitable investments, and there is. no- profit to be made, in the opinion of the bankers, out of hospitals. Our lunatic asylums,, in New South Wales at any rate, are a disgrace to the country. Much as, I love Australia, I am compelled to say that - and this has been a good country to me.

Despite all the: efforts of the chemists, no synthetic substitute has been found for our wool, and no other country can produce wool to compete with it. When I was in Canada,, I was shown some, of the wool grown there, and it was as hard as a board.

In the United States of America, despite its wealth, 5,000,000 persons are out of work all the time, and at present the number is 15,000,000. Already there is a great surplus of primary products, and the authorities are destroying foodstuffs, particularly potatoes. They are terrified that when Marshall Aid ceases no employment will be available for the people. The other day, I read in a conservative Canadian magazine that on the West Coast of Canada 15 per cent. of the workers are out of employment, whilst over the whole of Canada there is 7 per cent. unemployed. While Britain is buying meat and other foodstuffs from Argentina, there is in Canada more bacon, eggs, milk and flour than any one knows what to do with. We know that as soonas the glut becomes serious, international trade agreements will go by the board, just as our social services went by the board during the depression. In Belgium there are hundreds of thousands of persons out of work. In France there are strikes, upheavals and economic chaos. The powers that be can see that a depression is coming here, and they are terrified of it. They know that under capitalist economics rises are inevitable. We are told to produce more, but already in Sydney entrepreneurs in the clothing trade say that clothing is being overproduced. The purpose behind the appointment of a Commonwealth Bank Board is quite plain. If there is to be another war, the same people will pay for itas paid for the last one. If civilization is not destroyed there will be a new order for the bankers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> spoke of the Bank of England, but without the wealth-producing energy of the workers, the banks could do nothing.

A confidence man has to take his victim in first and then he takes the lot. The Prime Minister has taken a few tricks before but he will not take this one. Who is to be on this bank board?

                    <para>. - Recently I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture a question about flour-milling in South Australia, and the shortage of mill offals that has been created by reduced milling operations. Since I asked that question I have been informed that the position has become more acute, and that it is not possible to buy pollard, bran, and other mill by-products. Consequently, poultry- farmers, pig-farmers and other users of these offals are facing a difficult problem. I asked the Minister to ascertain whether arrangements could be made to have more wheat gristed in this country, so that we could export flour instead of whole grain. I urge the Minister to regard 4hifi as an urgent matter, and to endeavour to arrange for increased sales of flour overseas, so that mills in this country may be kept in full operation and the shortage of mill offals thus relieved. If it is not possible to make contracts now for the sale of more flour, the Government could consider advancing credits to build up stocks of flour in this country to fulfil contracts that may be made in the near future. It is most desirable that our flour mills should be working full time and that the scarcity of mill offals, particularly in South Australia, should be relieved. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> stated that the Senate would meet to-morrow until some unspecified hour. I asked him at what hour he expected the Senate to rise, and his reply was that that would depend on the progress that was made. That leaves many people in a state of great difficulty. Many honorable senators travel to Canberra from distant States. Transport arrangements have to be made with at least some notice. Air travel is involved in almost every instance, and uncertainty about the sitting hours of the Senate can cause great embarrassment to the staff of the Parliament. It is necessary for bookings to be made many days ahead, and I am sure that the Minister for Trade and Customs will appreciate the grave difficulties that officers of the Senate will have in making those arrangements. It was expected, perhaps without reason, that the Senate would not sit to-morrow and most senators made arrangements to leave for their homes to-morrow morning. Accordingly bookings were made, and will now have to be recast in view of the Government's decision. That, of course, is unfortunate, not only for the transport officers and the airline operators, but also for honorable senators. I do not question the Government's decision that the Senate should meet to-morrow morning. I ask the </para>

                <para class="block">Minister to endeavour to give an indication to the Senate of the probable hour of rising to-morrow. Obviously that would be a convenience to tha Senate staff, who are. required to make transport arrangements. Furthermore, it' would enable honorable, senators to determine whether, in the unexpected circumstances, they would return to their homes for the week-end or remain in Canberra. I am sure, that my submission will appeal to the Leader of the Government as a reasonable request, having regard to the convenience not only of the staff, but also of all honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- The Government should have anticipated the interest that the Opposition has shown in this measure, because honorable senators on this side of the chamber have evinced great interest in the debate from the. commencement. I point, out that until 8 o'clock this evening the Government had not decided whether the Senate should sit to-morrow. That is an aspect of the matter to which I personally take great exception. I agree with the objections that have been stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> If the Government knew its business, its leader in this chamber should have been able to announce much earlier than this evening that the Senate would meet to-morrow: The Minister has said that the measures coming before the Senate are so important that it may be necessary for this chamber to sit from Mondays to Fridays in future., Personally,, I have no intention to agree to the principle of legislation by exhaustion. </para>

However, the fact remains that honorable senators on both sides of the chamber have contributed to the debate. Tuesday's sitting was wasted discussing a motion of dissent from the ruling of the  President,  based on a very flimsy ground. The Opposition discussed that matter at length in order to teach <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> - who moved the motion - a lesson, and to show him how little he knew about the Standing Orders. I remind the Senate that both the mover and the seconder of that, motion were, supporters of the Government. I shall do all that I can to prevent the Senate from sitting from Mondays to Fridays to consider this legislation. </para>

                    <para>. -  I take grave exception to the exhibition of ill-breeding, ill manners, and discourtesy that has been displayed by the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> in this chamber to-night.  I  recollect that during the regime of the Scullin Government a select committee held up a bill for ten months. The present. Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> was one of the first members of this chamber to move that the regulations should be disallowed. What has happened in this chamber tonight is a reflection of the state of confusion of the Government. Although it is obvious that the Government is seeking legislation by exhaustion, surely the wives and families of honorable senators are entitled to consideration. At  9  o'clock this evening I asked the Leader of the Government what hour he expected that the Senate would be sitting till to-morrow. He replied that he did net know. Obviously the Minister did not know his own mind. If a government does not know at  9  p.m. what it is going to do on the next day, surely the country is unsafe under its control. Many members of this chamber bring to Canberra with them sufficient clothing to last them, with normal changes, only two or three days. They are not being shown any consideration in this instance. In the past this chamber has sat all night on occasions, but honorable senators have received timely notice of the Government's intention. I protest against the Minister's exhibition of discourtesy to-night. Should Labour have acted similarly I should have protested likewise. I hope that better counsel will prevail when the heat has passed. </para>

                    (Victoria)  [11.8  J. - I consider that the Minister for Trade and Customs
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline>
                    is entirely out of order in the way that he treats the members of the Opposition. The time has arrived when both he and the other supporters of the Government in this chamber should be realistic. The Minister has stated that the matter that we have been discussing was not of much importance. I consider that it is one of the most important measures that has been brought down for many years. The Minister should realize that the Opposition is numerically stronger than the Government in this chamber. All honorable senators owe a duty to the people of the States that they represent. I owe a duty, also, to many branches of organizations in which I am interested in Victoria. I normally visit them during recesses of the Parliament. All of the branches to which I have referred have carried resolutions against the Government's proposed legislation on banking. Although the Minister , has become piqued because things do not suit him. I remember when he apologized to the Senate a few weeks ago for his hastiness. I wish to point out that I have brought my wife and family with me to Canberra, and have arranged to remain here during the coming week-end. Hovever, honorable senators who have certain obligations to the people that they represent have in many instances made arrangements to travel to distant places to-morrow. I always advise the transport officer of my intended movements, because I realize that his job of arranging transport for members of this chamber is an onerous task. I venture to suggest that if, because of the cancellation of seats that have been reserved for honorable senators on tomorrow's aircraft,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Sullivan</inline>
                    could not obtain a seat when he required  it, he would be very hurt.  Of course I  realize that Ministers enjoy  a priority. which he would probably exercise, whilst other members of this chamber would be forced to remain in Canberra, instead of returning to their homes. I remind honorable senators, also, that the Leader of the Government in this chamber is a political accident so far as the leadership  of  the Senate is concerned. His experience has been  very  limited. He has little knowledge of the manner in which business has been transacted in this chamber during the last ten years. During the most critical years of the war, the then anti-Labour Opposition held up the business of this chamber by frivolous tactics. The Opposition at that time used its numbers in this chamber to delay the business of the Government, which was conducting the war on behalf of this country. Those things should not be forgotten. To-day the Opposition is numerically stronger than the Government in this chamber. It is therefore necessary that we should take more time than Government senators during debates on important measures. In connexion with measures that have been introduced to diminish the social rights of the people of this country, it has sometimes taken honorable senators on this side of the chamber five or ten minutes longer than usual to complete their addresses because of the necessity for them to trace the ramifications of the organizations that brought about the depression in Australia in the 'thirties. I realize, of course, that honorable senators opposite have no say at all in what legislation will be brought down; their minds are made up for them. I want to warn the Leader of the Government in this chamber that, along with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong,</inline>
                    I shall not be a party to carrying legislation through this chamber to suit the party that he supports if that legislation will act to the detriment of the people that I represent. I am prepared to come here at all times that the Leader of the Government desires to call the Senate together. In fairness, however, he should credit honorable senators on this side of the chamber with being intelligent men. He should have informed honorable senators this morning that the Government had decided that the Senate would be required to sit tomorrow. Recently he assured honorable senators that in future this chamber would rise normally on a Thursday night, but that if it was intended to sit on Friday he would warn honorable senators in ample time. The Minister's statement in this connexion is recorded in
                    <inline font-style="italic">Barnard.</inline>
                    I suggest, therefore, that he should reconsider the matter before the motion is carried. I should not mind sitting throughout next week, if the Leader of the Government in thi? chamber considered that that was necessary. If Government business demanded that course, I am sure that the Opposition would be prepared to assist him. I remind the Minister that honorable senators have obligations to their wives and children, whom they respect. If the Minister is not prepared to respect honorable senators on this side he should at least respect their families by informing them of the expected time of rising to-morrow, so that they can advise their homes. In many instances honorable senators are compelled to travel by air to attend the sittings of this chamber, and their wives are anxious until they arrive home. I repeat, that it is recorded in
                    <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard,</inline>
                    that the Minuter promised to give honorable senators timely notice if the Government decided that this chamber should sit on a Friday.

While we waste the time of the Senate discussing a matter like this, we could be getting on with the job. If we meet for two hours to-morrow morning we cannot accomplish any more than we can by sitting for another two hours now, which would obviate sitting to-morrow. Many honorable senators have made travel bookings to go to different States, and if the Senate has to sit to-morrow it will upset their plans. Goodwill and common sense must be shown in our approach tn this matter, and I appeal to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> for co-operation. Let us continue sitting until  1  a.m., in order to meet the legislative requirements of the nation, and so avoid the need to meet to-morrow. After all, the Government has a legislative programme to complete, and if the Senate is to rise in June that programme must be completed by then. </para>

During the present Parliament I have given every cooperaton to the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> to facilitate the proceedings of this chamber. All day I lave inquired about the Government's intentions concerning the sitting of the Senate. I told members of the Opposition privately that the Senate would probably be sitting to-morrow, hut they have not all been able to reserve accommodation for to-morrow. From my point of view it is immaterial whether the Senate completes its business to-morrow or on Saturday afternoon. Aa Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, I have given much greater co-operation to the present Government than was given by some honorable senators opposite when we represented the Government in this chamber during, the war. Some honorable senators opposite took every opportunity to waste time and obstruct us in every way possible. Having taken this stand, I must intimate that in future no arrangements will be made with the Leader of the Government. In order to meet the convenience of the Government I agreed that the debate on the Commonwealth Bank Bill should proceed immediately after the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> had made his second-reading speech. However, there will he a clean sheet in the future, and the Opposition will conduct itself in the manner which seems fitting to it. There will be no further arrangements with the Government. </para>

It must be understood that, although we on this side of the chamber represent the Government, we have not the actual control of the proceedings of the chamber. It is not so much a matter of the length of time that the Senate sits, as of how much legislative business it transacts. Since it is the business of the Government to have its legislation passed,, the Senate must sit until that legislation is passed. That can be done in a short, medium, or a very long time, according to the degree of co-operation shown by the Opposition. Therefore, when the Leader of the Opposition asked me whether the Senate would meet to-morrow, I said then that it depended entirely on himself and' his supporters. </para>

                        <para>- It is a deliberative chamber and it must deal with the business placed before it with reasonable expedition. Tt is not for me to criticize the speeches that were made by Opposition senators in this chamber to-night. The merit or otherwise of their contributions to the debate is a matter for the people to decide. We must make progress with our legislative programme. The speed with which we dispose of it will depend entirely on the extent of the co-operation we receive from the Opposition. </para>

                    has asked how long the Senate proposes to sit tomorrow. ' I remind him that that, too, depends entirely on the programs we achieve. We have not asked the Senate to meet merely for the purpose of putting in hours. .We do so in order that the legislation placed before this chamber may' be considered with . reasonable despatch. The days and. hours of our sittings will be determined by the progress we make with the legislation before us. The Opposition, being in the majority, knows more than I do about that matter. When I discussed it with the Leader of the Opposition I asked him if I could have his assurance that the Commonwealth Bank Bill would- be completed by the hour at which the sitting would normally be suspended for dinner on Wednesday next.

It would he presumptuous of me to request honorable senators opposite unduly to restrict their speeches; hut it would not he presumptuous of me to ask them not to unduly prolong their contribution to the debates. That matter rests between them and their electors. I see no reason for becoming heated . about this matter. The Opposition has the numbers;. it has called the tune.
