            <para>- I direct the following questions to the Leader of the Government in the Senate: - (1) Is it a fact that because of an increase in the population, approximately 17&#189; to 20 per cent, more meat is being consumed yearly in Australia than in1943? (2) Is the Government aware that meat prices sky-rocketed on the previous abnormal prices in Adelaide last week? (3) Is the Government aware that lamb chops were 3s.5d. per lb. (11d. rise), forequarters 1s.11d. per lb. (6d. rise), shoulder 2s.1d. per lb. (6d. rise) and leg 3s. per lb. (9d. rise) in Adelaide and that charges for other meats were also increased, and that the secretary of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation has said that to cover normal overhead charges those prices were necessary? (4) Does the Government agree that because of the high wool prices and the bountiful rains over much of our stock country, consumers generally will be adversely affected for many more months? (5) Will the Australian Government, with its very limited constitutionalpower consider the necessity of conferring with State governments, in order that some immediate practical form of sane price control, which must begin at the hoof, is introduced at the earliest possible moment to relieve the position, thus making this necessary part of our diet available to the people at reasonable prices? (6) Is the Government aware that many small master butchers cannot continue in business unless this bad practice is checked ? </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of the details to which the honorable senator has referred. I have seen statements that the population of Australia has increased by about 15 per cent, in the last ten years so that the figures given by the honorable senator would be approximately correct. Pursuing that line of thought, naturally the consumption of  foodstuffs  would be increased considerably. In regard to the prices charged in Adelaide, I presume that there are State laws in South Australia requiring prices control, just as there are in other States, and I do not think that it would be desirable for the Commonwealth to intrude in matters which are exclusively within the province of the States. I am quite sure that if the Commonwealth were requested, and it were within its capacity and ability, it would assist the States in carrying out prices control policy. </para>

Although the previous Chifley Administration &#34;was aware, twelve or eighteen months ago, of the unhappy situation of the classes of pensioners mentioned by the honorable senator, in its wisdom, or lack of wisdom, it did nothing to alleviate their distress. I assure the honorable senator that at the appropriate time, and as soon as possible, legislation will be introduced to alleviate the distress .suffered by incapacitated members of the services and the dependants of deceased ex-servicemen, in view of the present higher costs of living. </para>

              <para>- In my previous answer I should have said, &#34;brought before Parliament &#34;. Honorable senators know that no legislation has actually been placed on the statute-book since the Government took office. The reason is that in this Senate, the Government has been hindered and delayed on every occasion. If the honorable senator desires to see the enactment of this very important legislation which has been before both Houses of the Parliament since the early part of the year, I suggest that he and his colleagues in the Opposition give a little more co-operation than they have in the past. </para>

          <para>- The question is based upon a misconception. It is not correct to say that many grave errors were disclosed in the speech to which the honorable senator has referred. In fact, only one error was made in describing a person as a Communist. The other errors related merely to the offices held by the persons referred to. If my recollection is correct, these persons had held the offices that it was said they held, but they did not hold them at the time the speech was made. There is no justification for an overhaul of the kind to which the honorable senator has referred. </para>

I point out that if that action is taken, it may involve us in war. Will the Minister say whether it is a fact that eight Royal Australian Air Force transport aircraft are scheduled to leave Australia for Malaya? Will those aircraft be used against the Malayans? Has any military equipment been sent from Australia to Malaya? If so, will the Minister state the quantities and types of equipment that have been sent? In view of the fact that it has been agreed at international conferences that small nations shall have the right to elect their own governments and administer their own affairs, and since the suggested action of the Australian Government will conflict with that agreement, will the Minister advise the Senate why the Australian Government does not mind its own business, and allow the Malayan people to mind theirs? </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, whether the Postal Department will give consideration to having the name of the keepers of small country telephone exchanges and the names of the exchanges published, free of charge, in telephone directories? Owing to the extension of telephone facilities to many new subscribers, the many alterations in telephone numbers and dialling letters, and the amount of new work being done by the Postal Department, will the PostmasterGeneral consider the publication, when circumstances warrant it in any State, of a supplementary telephone directory, approximately six months after the publication of the annual directory ? </para>

            <para>- I preface .my question to the Minister for Social Services by pointing out that legislation has recently been enacted in New South Wales to increase superannuation payments by 25 per cent. Will the Minister inform the Senate whether the Department of Social Services has been directed to ensure that the means test will not be applied detrimentally to the pensioner spouse of a superannuated person, thus offsetting the increased superannuation payment? </para>

            <para>- It is quite apparent from the debate that occurred in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly last year tha t when the New South Wales Government decided to increase superannuation payments it was known that they would be affected by the means test. The accusation that has been made by the Premier of New South Wales that the Department of Social Services is acting against the pensioners is totally inaccurate and made solely for electioneering purposes. When the proposal was in contemplation I interviewed a deputation from the Retired  Tramwaymen&#39;s  Association. I went through the whole of the range of superannuation payments that were involved and endeavoured to differentiate between those that would attract the means test and those that would not. I told the deputation that at the appropriate time I would do what I could to assist it by making some readjustment of the means test just as I would try to assist all those persons who were contributors to superannuation schemes at the time of their retirement. It is entirely uv.fair of the Premier of New SouthWales to say that the Government has, in some way, victimized recipients of superannuation benefits. </para>

            <para>- Oan the Minister for Trade and Customs say whether it is true that the supply of newsprint is becoming very low and is causing concern throughout Australia? Did the Government recently refuse Western Press Limited dollars to permit suspended Canadian contracts for the supply of newsprint to be maintained % Is it a fact that Western Press Limited desired to renew Canadian long-term contracts for a ten-year period from 1949, and, because of growing dollar difficulties, sought Government approval, which was given but subject to progressive reductions as the dollar stringency increased ? Is it a fact that Western Press Limited asked the Government in April last for dollar accommodation to purchase 23,500 tons of Canadian paper for the balance of 1950 and that the Government refused such accommodation? Is the Government aware that, if Canadian contracts are not renewed this year, Canadian suppliers may cancel all contracts in view of the demand for Canadian newsprint from countries other than Australia ? As the livelihood of many Australian workmen depends upon an adequate supply of newsprint, and as Western Press Limited has utilized all means to obtain sufficient newsprint from sterling sources, will the Government reconsider its refusal to make available sufficient dollars to maintain the Canadian supplies? </para>

            <para>Employment in the civilian staffs of the service departments is subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. Whilst service personnel after retirement from the forces have in a number of cases been employed  in  civilian positions under the Commonwealth Public Service Act it is not practicable to &#34; transfer &#34; any considerable number of service personnel on their retirement from the forces to the civilian staffs of the service departments. It is pointed out that when the earlier retiring ages for members of the forces were introduced the question was raised of their employment in a civilian capacity in the service departments. In view, however, of the relatively high number of officers and other ranks serving&#34;  in  the forces who would become due for retirement from time to time in the future on reaching the earlier retiring ages, such a proposition was found to be impracticable as there would not be sufficient positions, particularly in the  higher administrative posts, to be allocated to  these  personnel. In the circumstances the lie fence Forces Retirement Benefits Act was enacted to provide for payment of pensions on a contributory basis to members of the forces on their retirement on reaching the earlier retiring ages. The rates&#39; of pension for service personnel on retirement are very heavily subsidized by the Commonwealth over and above the normal Commonwealth subsidy payable to civil servants. This heavy loading was included as an additional compensation for the earlier retiring age3. It is also pointed oi.t that in the event of a member of the forces on reaching the age for retirement being appointed in a civilian capacity to a permanent position under the Commonwealth Public Service Act, his pension rights under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act may be exchanged for equivalent rights under the Superannuation Act. In the case of a service pensioner accepting temporary employment mi the civil staff of one of the service departments, his pension would be paid at the full rate for 28 working days in each twelve months and automatically reduced thereafter by the amount of the government contribution to the pension. The question of the amount of the reduction of pensions in such cases is, however, at present under review. </para>

            <para>. - When the Senate adjourned last week, I had just named three honorable* senators opposite who had attacked the trade union movement. They hope that this hill will have the effect of removing certain trade union officials from office, and of ensuring that those appointed to take their places will do only what the Government wants them to do. It is clear, as I have already pointed out, that some honorable senators wish to smash the trade unions. Indeed, all honorable senators who support the Government have discussed this problem exclusively in its relation to trade unions and their leaders. They have attacked the trade union movement and its leaders, and said that the movement is associated with the Communist party. </para>

          <para>It seems to me that any person who points to injustices to which our present methods of government and system of society give rise can be declared under this bill, especially if he confides his ideas to any of the persons upon whose advice the Prime Minister apparently acted recently when he read in the House of Representatives a list of names of individuals who were said to be Communists and in control of some trade unions. The officers of the security service, who are, I suppose, the persons used mainly by the Government for this purpose, obtain their information from all kinds of sources, but mainly from persons who have an obsession on the subject of communism. Some honorable senators opposite have exhibited that obsession by branding everybody who holds leftist views or wishes to reform our system of society as either a Communist or a fellow traveller. Persons who are obsessed in that way are not reasonable human beings. When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> was speaking on the motion for the second reading of this bill in the House of Representatives, he referred to a man named Hibbens and said that he was South Australian  president  of the Builders Trades Federation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibbens</inline> has never held that office. The statement was afterwards corrected by the Prime Minister- </para>

              <para>- I shall tell the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> in a few moments. The Prime Minister, shortly afterwards, corrected the statement that he had made, and said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibbens</inline> was  president  of the Builders Labourers Federation. The right honorable gentleman was supplied with inaccurate information. I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibbens</inline> for nearly 50 years. He has never been a member of the Communist party.  His  political affiliation has always been with the Australian Labour party. It is admitted that he is an industrial leftist and also, for that matter, a leftist in the political Labour movement, but he has never been a member of the Communist party. Some time ago he was elected as  president  of the Builders Labourers Union, and because he carried out the wishes of the members of that union and sought better conditions of employment for them, he has been declared by the Prime Minister of this country to be a Communist. I have referred to that matter to show, first, that mistakes can be made; secondly, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hibbens</inline> was declared to be a Communist because some persons have an obsession on the subject of communism, and thirdly, that the Government, by introducing this bill, appears to be aiming only at the industrial trade union movement of this country. </para>

              <para>- The AttorneyGeneral will see. I have said previously that the Liberal party and the Australian Country party slavishly follow the huge monopolistic interests that are behind measures of this kind. The war shifted the control of international finance and economics from Europe to America. Huge  Credits  have been made available by this band of monopolists to various countries in order to protect their trading interests. The combines and the cartels of pre.-war days have not been broken up ; they have only shifted their venue of control. They have made huge sums of money available for the purpose of enlarging their spheres of interest, whether by cartels or straightout monopolies. Having done that, it is necessary for them to protect, not only their original, -but also their newer and enlarged spheres of interest. It is their desire to protect their trading interests that is- responsible for the introduction of bills of this kind. </para>

              <para>- The whole of it, propaganda and all, has been initiated by the war-mongers of the world. In all countries there is a growing demand for a better deal for the great industrial and primary producing masses, as distinct from vested interests or investments. There is a . movement for peace in this country. Honorable senators opposite have commented upon men and women who attended a certain peace conference recently. Because some Communist organizations or individual Communists have become linked with moves for peace, propaganda has been directed against them throughout the world. That is applied in Australia. It is applied usually in one or two countries at a time with the object of defeating a peace movement in one country, and subsequently using that propaganda to defeat a peace movement in another country. It is a matter of politics. A similar process is adopted to defeat popular governments. It is largely a matter of economics or materialism. I recall that Marx; wrote a book on materialism.

          <para>In the Australian Labour party and also in social credit movements and land reform leagues there are what are termed &#34;leftists&#34;. There are leftists who are opposed to certain religious denominations, as distinct from Christianity. There are leftists who believe that Christianity can be applied to every phase of life. They are advanced thinkers. However, under this measure, they could be declared because of their desire to effect a revolutionary change in our system in order to achieve what they sincerely believe would be a better way of life. There is an ever-growing band of people who are learning that our economic system is ruled by a small minority and they rule despite the system of parliamentary government that has been established in Australia, because they control certain financial economy. It is not to be wondered at that when these -people become exasperated at the system they use words against it. Under this measure those words could be construed to mean that they were outright Communists or fellow travellers. If those people were seen talking to a Communist, or were heard advocating a theory that had previously been expounded by Marx and Lenin - of whom they may not even have heard before, much less read their books - they could be declared. There would be no redress. Even if provision were made for redress, it would be utterly impossible for these people, because of lack of money, to defend themselves. Every word that they uttered could be misconstrued by clever lawyers. Thereafter the fact that they had been declared would operate to blight the best part of their life. By slow starvation the dependants of the people so declared would be murdered: I point out that a person could be declared although he had never been a Communist and had had no connexion with Communists. He may be a member of a union that&#39; had been deregistered and declared an illegal body because a minority of its members had acted contrary to the Australian laws. Every member of it could likewise be declared because, in the opinion of the Government - not a matter of fact, but merely an opinion - he was likely to en- gage in activities prejudicial to the defence of this country. I stress that there would be no redress for such a person either before or after being declared. Some people are confounding Christianity with sectional religious denominations. Christianity does not deny the right of any one to seek a complete change in the methods used to apply the teachings of God to everyday life. Individuals of some creed, with an obsession, may try by ranting and raving, or even by forge. to prevent social changes. The true Christian never does any of those things. I am indebted to the Reverend Percy H.  Chennell,  a Methodist minister, who is opposed to. communism. As a result of his research he has published a pamphlet called <inline font-style="italic">A</inline><inline font-style="italic">Catechism</inline><inline font-style="italic">on Communism.</inline> In his foreword he says that Christians can and must  outthink,  outplan, and outlive the policies of Marx, in order to defeat them. He points out that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. William</inline> Temple, who was a very high dignitary of the Church of England, stated&#39; that Christianity is and must be materialistic, because there  exists a soul and a body. He -also stated that  President  Roosevelt, the day before he died, made a statement about these things, particularly about the Christian point of view.  President  Roosevelt said that if civilization is to survive we must develop the science of human relationships, the ability of peoples of all kinds to work together in the same world for peace. The Reverend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chennell</inline> stresses that various high church dignitaries had expressed the view that Marx was doubtless influenced not only by the conditions that culminated in the French Revolution, but also by those that led to revolution in Russia. Professor Saintsbury,  in a commentary on Voltaire, who said, &#34; Crush the infamous Thing&#34;, pointed out that some people had contended that Voltaire had stated that religion and Christianity should be crushed. Professor Saintsbury however, said he was dealing with materialism because it encroached upon Christian ethics in certain churches. In his book, the Reverend P. H. Chennell deals with the materialism that has attached itself to religion, and he gives statistics of the Orthodox Church and other religious denominations in Russia, and quotes <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Maynard to the effect that the church was an oppressor. He gives details of oppressive acts. In all those instances, the material lism  of the religious denominations was overriding the ethics of Christianity, and I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chennell</inline> for the illustrations that he has given. I point out again that a great deal of the propaganda directed against the Communistic party, and the so-called &#34; fellow travellers &#34;, is, in reality, directed against the Australian Labour party. We had an example of that in the remarks made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> in New South Wales a few nights ago. </para>

              <para>- Yes, through the bill. It has been said that where materialism supersedes the ethics of any church, it causes violent disagreement even amongst the adherents of that church, and, more so, amongst the leaders of the great mass of the people. That remark applies, even to-day, although perhaps not so much to Australia, as to other countries. In this country an individual may occasionally denounce the ethics of the churches, but the great bulk of social reformers, whether Communist or otherwise, challenge only the materialism of the churches, which is more pronounced in some religious bodies than in others. In any event, materialism characterizes a church only when it has placed the ethics of Christianity in the background. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The bill is an attempt to bolster up the materialism of capitalism, and is founded upon the lie that the Communists and the so-called &#34; fellow travellers &#34; have repudiated the ethics of Christianity, and have denied God. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;Sullivan),</inline> who introduced the bill, said that the Communists have denied God. Another supporter of the Government has said that the objectives of the Labour movement are the same as those of the Communist party. Who are the antiLabour parties after? I challenge them to prove that any member of the Opposition has denied God. Because we continually criticize the material aspects which are permitted to override the ethics of Christianity, that is not a denial of God ; it is upholding the principles enunciated by Christ on this earth. What do the opponents of Labour want with this bill? What is the necessity for its introduction? The purpose of the bill is undoubtedly to attack the great Labour party, whose objectives, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher,</inline> are identical with those of the Communists, and whose policy is also, according to the Treasurer, the same as that of the Communists. The anti-Labour forces want to smash this live Labour movement. They want to get back to the old system so that they can exploit the people of the country as they did before. </para>
          <para>I repeat again that I am opposed to the whole bill, and I know that some of my remarks will be misconstrued. I am quite aware that I will be told by honor- able senators opposite that I do not understand the purposes of the bill. I do understand them ; in fact, I understand them only too well. I understand also that all those people who have been trying to do some good for the ordinary people of this country, and, in doing so, have run up against authority, are to be endangered. In Victoria inquiries are already being made about the operation of certain Jewish bodies. No one knows why those inquiries have been undertaken, and no one will admit responsibility for having undertaken them. However, the fact is that, because of the inquiries that have been undertaken, the Jews are &#34;up against it &#34;.. Every J ew who has subscribed to the building of the Zionist city in Palestine is in danger of being &#34; declared &#34; under the bill. In fact, all my friends, including members of the Society of Friends and myself, are in danger because from time to time we preach the doctrine of Christianity, and are opposed to the materialism of religion and to those people who set aside the ethics of Christianity. In our activities we have bumped authority. In fact, we are always humping authorities. Another section of the community who will be liable to be &#34; declared &#34; under the bill are the members of the land reform leagues, who want to take away the rental value of land from those who own the land in this country. Although Marx also advocated such a step, the aims of the land reform leagues are not at present referred to as &#34; Communist activities &#34; but it is &#34; expropriation of the land &#34;. The plain fact is that because the idea of the land reformers happens to coincide with one of the Marxist theories, they will be liable to be &#34; declared &#34;. I could go on to enumerate many other sections of the community who will be .liable to be &#34; declared &#34; under the bill. In conclusion, I repeat that I am opposed to the entire measure, which was born in iniquity. </para>

Honorable senators who support the Government have made very dear where they stand in this matter, but I find it difficult to understand exactly where members of the Opposition stand. If we compare the views expressed by the first Opposition member to take part in the debate with those expressed by the last Opposition member who has spoken, we find that there is a great difference in those views.

          <para>The last <inline font-weight="bold">speaker, Senator O&#39;Flaherty,</inline> said - &#34; I am opposed to the entire measure &#34;. Other honorable senators opposite have expressed similar views or have given half-hearted support to the bill. All sorts of arguments have been advanced, such as the suggestion that we have not enough gaols to contain those who will be &#34; declared &#34; under the bill, and other criticisms have been put forward by members of the Opposition who half-heartedly support the bill. I support this bill because 1 believe that we are faced with a great national danger. A state of emergency exists to-day. &#34;We have heard a lot of talk about the possibility of a &#34; hot &#34; war. Some people are even prepared to argue that there is no &#34; cold &#34; war at present. That is not for us to decide. The people of Australia have already made a decision. They made it at the last general election when they elected a Liberal-Country party Government to fight communism. Undoubtedly Russia&#39;s objective is world domination. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> expressed it in a slightly different way. He spoke of Russian imperialism; but they are much the same. The fact remains that Russian communism constitutes a threat to our ideals and our way of life. The situation in the world to-day is akin to what it was in 1913 and in 1938. The present crisis is just as great as were the crises of those days. </para>

          <para class="block"> Commos &#39; ? &#34; I Iia ve fought with the &#34;Commos&#34;. For some time during World War II. I was commanding officer in southern Persia. The Russians were in northern Persia. For a while we lived side by side with them in Teheran, and I had ample opportunity to observe their way of life, and their standard of living. 1 saw, too, fear in their faces and in their actions. I saw the power that their commissars had over them and I knew that, although the Russians were fighting as our allies, they were set on world domination and the spreading of communism. Even when the war situation was very black and it seemed that within a few weeks we should be fighting side by side with the Russians in the Caucasus, they would not co-operate with us. They would not allow us to move into the positions in which they expected us in the near future to fight alongside them. They were afraid that their men would see the liberty that our men enjoyed. I know all those things from my own personal experience. There is much more that I could tell were I not bound by the Official Secrets Act. Incidentally, I remind the Senate that should the Official Secrets Act be contravened, the onus of proof is on the offender; yet I have not felt that act to be a very great threat to my liberty so far. I do not think that this bill will affect the liberty of any citizens of this country any more than the Official Secrets Act has affected it in the past. I once saw a Russian general shoot a Russian sergeant dead with his own revolver, on the spot and without a trial, for an offence which, if committed by an Australian sergeant, would have resulted in no greater punishment than the offender being confined to barracks for ten days by a. court martial. </para>

              <para>- That is so. I was in India for some time before and after my period of service in Persia, and I can say without breaking the Official Secrets Act that the Russians established cells in our battalions and regiments which caused mutinies in furtherance of the Russian objective of world domination. Because of trouble stirred up hy Communists, while the Japanese were advancing through Burma we had to keep hundreds of thousands of troops in India when they should have been fighting the Japanese. </para>

          <para>I know exactly where I stand on this bill, and I know from my own experience that there is a grave threat to this country. Amongst honorable senators opposite there are several who held ministerial rank only a few months ago. They must have had access to information, either on the same level or at a higher level than I had, and I am sure that in their hearts they appreciate the danger that is facing this country. In spite of the talk that we have heard from the Opposition during the debate on this bill, the main difference between us is on the method by which this menace should be dealt with. Honorable senators opposite know that there is a menace. My belief is that we should resort to every possible means to combat communism. Let us look at the Labour party&#39;s policy. I agree with quite a lot of it. An important plank of Labour&#39;s platform is that the standard of living of working people should be raised. </para>

              <para>- I, too, say &#34; Hear, hear ! &#34; to that. If honorable senators opposite will examine the policy of the Liberal party they will find that its aim is to raise the standard of living. We should like to have the assistance of the Labour party in achieving that end. The standard of living must be raised. That is beyond argument. Labour believes that communism should be fought in the trade unions. I concede that the trade unions are doing a very good job, but, after all, trade unionists do not number more than 50 per cent, of our population. Why should they alone have to fight the Communists? I should not have a very high opinion of any parliament or any government that refused to help the trade unionists in this fight. The Government seeks to assist the trade unionists through this bill. We believe that every section of the community should participate in the battle. Communism must be fought in every possible way. Another argument advanced by the Opposition is that the Government has enough power under existing statutes to fight communism. Mention has been made of the Crimes Act. I think that honorable senators on both sides of the House will admit that they would not favour the use of the Crimes Act, and the people of Australia adopt the same attitude. If the Government contemplated acting against communism under the Crimes Act, the uproar that arose after the introduction of this bill would be nothing compared with the public reaction that would follow. </para>

          <para>A feature of the Crimes Act is that the onus of proof in most cases is on the individuals concerned, a,nd that is a principle to which honorable senators on the opposite side of the chamber take the strongest exception. I shall quote an extract from a pamphlet entitled <inline font-style="italic">A Charier of Freedom</inline> which contains a report on &#34; a conference for democratic rights &#34; held in the Lower Melbourne Town Hall on the 22nd April, 1950. This is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brian</inline> Fitzpatrick, secretary of the Council for Civil Liberties, said about the Crimes Act - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Since the political and industrial sections were inserted into the Crimes Act in 1926 and 1932, public protest has generally been sufficient to restrain Governments from daring to use its worst provisions. </para>
            <para>Section 30a leaves a single judge, without jury, to decide if an association is unlawful. The onus of proof is on the association. A similar burden of proving innocence of membership of, or executive office in, an association declared unlawful, is placed on individuals, who may be penalized if they do not clear themselves. But how can I prove I am not a member of a party which has no records? </para>
            <para>Section 30ab imposes a penalty of &#163;100 or six months for not answering questions - that is, for refusing to be an informer against another person or an association involved. You are counted a member of an organization if since 1926 you attended one of its meetings or distributed its literature. A year&#39;s gaol oi- deportation can be imposed for taking part in an industrial disturbance in interstate transport or in the government service. </para>
            <para>Labour Governments were in office for eight years, from 1941 to 1949. The platform of the party provided for repeal of the political lections of the Crimes Act. The Council for Civil Liberties took the matter up with the Government, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> said it was under review in May, 1947. Yet in July, 1947, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline></para>
            <para class="block">Evatt introduced the Defence Projects Protection Act, which embodied some of the worst features of the Crimes Act and wa.even more repressive. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is what the Crimes Act provides with regard to onus of proof to which honorable senators opposite take so much exception. The onus-of-proof provision is contained also in many other acts including the Customs Act, regulations concerning taxation, the National Emergency (Coal Strike) Act, National Security Regulations and numerous State acts. There is nothing new about it and if the onus-of-proof provisions is to be removed from this bill, it should also come out of many other acts which could have been amended in the past. </para>
          <para>I invite honorable senators to consider how the declaration of a person will affect the man in the street. Speaking on this bill in another place, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> remarked on how few Communists there were in Australia and said that in Tasmania, at the last general election, only 80 persons voted for Communists. Therefore, everybody else in Tasmania has nothing to fear for his liberty, because I presume that most people who are Communists or supporters of communism would vote for the Communist candidates when there was no restriction on the way that they cast their votes. For the purposes of this bill and its penalties, everybody in Tasmania except 80 persons can be overlooked. If a man- is declared, he must be a Communist or not a Communist. If he is a Communist, he should be declared. That is the way to bring him out in the open. But if a man is innocent, all that he needs to do is to go into the witness-box and say, &#34;I am not a Communist, I have never been a Communist, or, if I have been one, I am not a Communist now. I have not taken part in subversive activities and do not intend to do so in the future &#34;. He must swear that on oath, and he should be able to produce without difficulty three men of repute to bear him out in his assertions. When he has done that, the onus of proof is at once transferred to the Crown. If the Crown does not produce the evidence, any judge would dismiss the case. if a person is a Communist, the Government would like to get him into the witness-box. Should an employee of the Government be declared and clear himself  in  the witness-box, he would certainly be reinstated and the same thing would apply to trade unionists. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> asked, in effect, during his speech, &#34; Where do you go after declaring a man? Take the case of Roach or Healy. If those men are declared, they would lose their job in the Waterside Workers Federation. What is to stop either  of  them from working in his ordinary capacity as a wharf labourer and spreading communism? Where do you go from there ? &#34; I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> where does he go in his plan to get rid of communism through the unions? If the union kicks  a Communist  out, apparently he is to be free to go round the wharfs spreading communism, whereas under this bill a man who went about preaching communism and sedition would be charged.. The onus of proof would be on the Crown, but when it was proved that the man had done what he was alleged to have done, he would be sentenced to five years&#39; gaol- </para>

I agree with him on the point, if he has any good ideas like that and  puts  forward amendments to that effect, they will be accepted with  thanks.  This is a fight against a real danger and a threat to the liberty of Australians. One or two innocent men might suffer as a  result  of this bill. Innocent men are liable to suffer &#39;under any act. Some men  who  were innocent of the crimes charged against them have been hanged, but the mere chance of a few people losing their liberty cannot be considered when the liberty of a whole nation is at stake. I support this bill wholeheartedly. </para>

              <para>- When the honorable senator says that socialism as preached by the Labour party is the twin brother of communism, she bringsto my mind the teachings that have been pushed into her little head since she has been a member of the party that she represents to-day. As communism i&#187; supposed to be the objective of this bill, what is the position of the Labour party and those who support it? Most of the people of Australia voted for the Labour party in the last general election and those who did so believe in socialism. Had it not been for the insidious propaganda of those whom the Government represents, the Labour party would still have been in office. </para>

          <para>This bill should be withdrawn. It cannot do the things that we hoped it would be able to do. It is not intended to dc them. I would support any measure that would rid Australia, and the rest of the British Commonwealth of Nations and other parts of the world of the Communist scourge, but this bill is not one to remove Communists from Australia because it preaches and claims that it will do exactly the same things as we object to the Communist party doing. </para>
          <para class="block">It is proposed in this bill to do the very same things as the Russians did. Even the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> with all his oratorical powers, could not convince me that the Chifley Government would not have been able to deal effectively with the Communists in Australia. Let it be remembered that the Communist party in this country was founded when a non-Labour government was in office. Only a Labour government can remove the conditions under which communism has thriven. This legislation was promised by the present Prime Minister before the last election during a period of hysteria. It was drafted under the influence of hysteria, as is shown by the fact that already nineteen amendments have been made to it since it was introduced in the House of Representatives. The honorable member for Chisholm. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kent Hughes)</inline> proposed that this legislation should- operate for a period_ of twelve months only. In my opinion, it will take more than twelve months to undo the mischief for which antiLabour governments have been responsible. </para>
          <para>When introducing the bill in the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister mentioned the names of men who, he said, were Communists, and officers of trade unions. The names had been supplied to him by the security service. Afterwards, he had to make a correction in respect of some of the persons named, but the damage was already done. They and their families might well lose their livelihood as the result of the mistake. They have suffered grave injury, which cannot be repaired by punishing the officers responsible. The fact that such a mistake was made is a further indication that the bill was prepared in haste, and without proper consideration.  If a mistake is made in the case of only one man out of 100, an injury is done to him, and to society as a whole. </para>
          <para>We have been told that this legislation was introduced because of the state of unrest that exists in the world to-day. If the bill is passed, the Communists in Australia will be driven underground. We should remember that, during the war, the French resistance movement operated very effectively underground, even though the country was under the iron rule of Hitler&#39;s army. When &#34; D &#34; day arrived, the men of the resistance movement came out into the open, and were of the greatest assistance to the invading forces. If the Communists in Australia are driven underground, the authorities will lose track of them. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> pointed out, it is impossible to kill thought except by killing the thinker. Should war break, out, the Communists would be in the army with our own boys, probably opposed tothe Russians and could do great damage as saboteurs. But if they were allowed to remain in the open, and we know who they are when war breaks out, we can put them in their proper place, a detention camp, where they can do no harm. </para>
          <para>Incidentally, we may be faced with a war very shortly because of the policy of the present Government in regard to Malaya. I understood the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> to promise, on behalf of the Government, that before Australian forces were sent to Malaya, the Parliament would have an opportunity to discuss the matter. That waa my understanding, but if I was mistaken, I am sorry. In any case, under our system of democratic government, the Parliament should be consulted before the Government sends any of our armed forces, whether of the Navy, Army or Air Force, to fight overseas in other people&#39;s capitalistic quarrels. </para>
          <para>This hill is essentially similar to the legislation enforced in Germany in 1934 under Hitler. The Minister for Trade and Customs, in his second-reading speech on this bill, referred to the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe, who sat as a royal commissioner to inquire into the activities of the Communist party in Victoria. During the investigation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe was himself mentioned by one witness as a friend and fellow traveller of the Communists in Victoria. That may have been wrong, or it may have been right, but the fact remains that the man who was appointed to inquire into the activities of the Communist party was himself stated to have supported that party, or to have been a fellow traveller with Communists.

            <para>- I say again to the honorable senator that fools rush in where angels fear to tread. If she waits and listens, she will learn that members of the party to which I belong are not disciplined by an executive body but by the people who constitute the party. There are branches of the Labour party in every city, town and hamlet in Australia. Each year, a federal conference of the party is held, at which the platform of the party is decided. The humblest members can say what they think should be in the platform. If a member violates the platform, we say that he is to be expelled, and then he is given an opportunity to, go before a conference or the branch of the party towhich he belongs and show cause why he should not be expelled. That cannot be said of: the Liberal party. I venture to say that some members of the Government parties have no idea how they were selected. They were certainly not selected by the rank and file of the Liberal party or the Australian Country party, because if the decision had been made in that way they would not have been selected. </para>

The Government did not propose to put him in gaol or to deprive him of lis livelihood. It intended to send him back to China, which incidentally, is now under Communist domination.

          <para>Statements upon this bill have been made which not unfairly could be well described as maudlin rubbish. In opposing provisions of the bill, it has been said that repressive measures have never suppressed an idea, and the survival of Irish nationalism has been quoted as an example. To such, I reply that throughout their centuries of struggle the Irish people were sustained by their devotion to their faith and their love of country. The Communist wreckers against whom this bill is aimed deny their God and are traitors to their country. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That may be so, but I remind honorable senators opposite that ideas cannot be suppressed unless the men who express them are killed. The Irishmen who were prepared to fight for their rights, their families and their country were given only token trials and were then transported. To mention some of them, they were Wolfe Tone, Robert Emmet, O&#39;Sullivan,  Meagler,  Maher and 0&#39;Neill. I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs will read the book <inline font-style="italic">Speeches from the Dock</inline> and see what those men suffered when they fought the tyrants in England that we have had to fight through the ages. The conditions that we enjoy now were not created by the people who controlled the slave class or the working class, from which I come, 100 years ago in England. The men to whom I have referred were victimized and transported to Van Dieman&#39;s Land because they had the audacity to say that they were entitled to some stake in the country of their birth, yet the  Miniser  for Trade and Customs has sneered at them and said that they did not have the same cause to  fight  for as we had. I hope that neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline> nor the Minister for Trade and Customs is descended from the Maher or the O&#39;Sullivan I have mentioned. If they are, doubtless their ancestors are now turning in their graves. </para>
        <para>The trade union movement and the Labour party of this country have been fighting communism for many years. I ask honorable senators opposite to tell me what they have done at any time to combat communism.. I believe that communism is bred by starvation, misery and poverty. Those conditions existed during the years of the depression owing to the actions of  anti-Labour  governments. All that the anti-Labour parties have done in regard to communism is to support it. In 1946, the Liberal party advised its supporters to give their preferences to a Communist rather than to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bryson,</inline> the Labour party candidate for the Bourke division. That cannot be denied. The Communists, in return, advised their supporters to give their preferences to the Liberal party candidate for Geelong, in order to defeat Jack Travers, the Labour candidate. Those are facts. The Liberal party in Victoria said, in effect, that it would rather have the fellow traveller or Communist who stood against Bill Bryson than a member of the Labour party to represent the electors of Bourke. All that the anti-Labour parties have done is to assist the Communists to establish themselves as a force in this community. Communism in Australia was born during the years of the depression, from 1929 to 1932. It is no wonder that any man who was dealt with as members of trade unions were dealt with in this country during those years should be somewhat sour. After the war of 1914-1S they built homes and tried to provide for their families. However, those homes were taken from them overnight. That is an example of the things that, have been responsible for the growth of communism throughout the world. I remind honorable senators, that in 1917 soldiers in the Russian armies ate raw fat and candles. The fear of starvation was very real. In such misery was communism born. It is true that the Russian tyranny was overthrown and that since the war not one shot has been fired but that is because the alleged democratic governments, of those countries have starved the inhabitants. I venture to say that not one country has gone &#34; commo &#34; under a Labour administration. The people of Australia would have been wise to return the Chifley Labour Government to power if they wanted to get rid of the Communists in Australia. If men and women are given social security they become good citizens. I consider that the bill is wrong in principle. It is not intended to do the things that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has told the people of Australia that he hopes it will do. If the right honorable gentleman bans the &#34; Comms &#34; he will lose a weapon that could be used against the Labour party. Even in 1924 the right honorable gentleman told the people of this country that if he was given a mandate to do so., he would wipe out the Communists. Although anti-Labour governments were in office from 1925 to 1929, and from 1931 to 1939, the &#34; Comms &#34; were not touched. Therefore, I claim that this measure has been introduced merely to fool the people. If it becomes law the Communists will merely be driven underground, and we will be faced with conditions similar to those that existed in Prance when Hitler&#39;s armies invaded that country in the early part of World War. II. </para>
        <para>Much has been said about interference with the trade union movement. As honorable senators know, the members of trade unions have the right to elect their officers, either annually or triennially according to the constitution of the union. During the depression, trade union secretaries were &#34; tuppence a pound &#34;. Many members of this chamber will recall that the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and the bosses took away from the trade union movement all of the things for which its members had fought prior to 1931. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator who has just interjected was a saboteur, who left the ranks of Labour and went across to the enemy, after climbing up on the sixpences and &#34; bobs &#34; of the workers. Yet he has the audacity to imply that Labour was responsible for those conditions. I remind honorable senators that the Government could not expect to extinguish in five minutes in 1929 a fire that was started in 1917. During the depression the &#34; Comms &#34; worked on the psychology of the poor people that were out of work and in effect said to them, &#34; If you select us for the leadership of your unions we will lead you to emancipation &#34;. Before the outbreak of World War II. Communists were in control of most of the key unions in Australia. Because of the exigencies of war and shortages of man-power and material, each time they appealed to the court they obtained wage increases and better conditions for their members. Therefore it is no wonder that the rank-and-file members of the trade union movement still vote for Communists to be secretaries and leaders of the unions. The great Victorian Railways union polled 98 per cent, in favour rf Labour candidates. A Communist candidate would have lost his deposit. Most of the members of that union claim that, irrespective of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown&#39;s</inline> political beliefs, he is a capable union secretary. </para>

            <para>- Had it not been for the sane government of this country under the Chifley Government, thousands of workers in Australia would not be so well off financially as they are to-day. The railway workers claim that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brown</inline> handles their union affairs efficiently. Therefore they support him. The same applies to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Healy,</inline> in the Waterside Workers Federation. I appeal to the Leader of the Government in the Senate to withdraw this bill and reinstitute the policy of the Chifley Government. By so doing the Communist element in Australia will be eliminated within eighteen months. If we have to face another world war very shortly - and we might - it would &#39;be to our advantage to know who are the traitors in this country so that we could deal with them. They should not be forced into the Army with our children, where they could sabotage Australia&#39;s efforts. Irrespective of the amendments that the Government proposes to move, this measure should be replaced by legislation that will afford Australia a reasonable opportunity to rid the country of a great scourge. I refer to the Communists. As  president  of the Trades Hall Council and a member of the executive of my union since 1930, 1 would whole-heartedly support such a measure. I am opposed to the clauses of this measure that my party does not favour. </para>

          <para>. - Honorable senators have beard quite a number of -speeches by members of the Opposition in relation to this bill. There appears to be no doubt that the Opposition is divided  in  its outlook. Some honorable senators opposite have told us that they are totally opposed to the bill as it stands. Others  Iia  ve said that they are in agreement with the principles of the bill, but object to certain clauses. Others say that, although they are against communism in this country, they are opposed to the method by which it is suggested the Government should rid us of this menace. We must get the actual provisions of the bill in a clear perspective. It has been introduced ro carry out the wishes of the people expressed on the 10th December last. In his policy speech, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> clearly undertook that, if elected to office, he would introduce a measure to combat the Communist influence  in this country, and ban the Communist organization. In the first place, we have a clear indication that the majority of the people of this country desire some form of a legislative ban to deal with the Communist menace. Whatever attitude  the  Opposition takes, it must acknowledge the fact that we are carrying out the policy on which we were elected. It would also appear that the people of Australia recognize that a state of emergency exists. Communism is a menace throughout the world, although it is more apparent in other countries than in Australia. Although we have not yet felt the full impact of communism, our time will come  sooner  or later. It is in the light of such circumstances that we must approach the consideration of this measure. The real method of approach is that this bill deals with the security of the country. It is linked with considerations of defence. There is no doubt that if we agree, and i think that we must agree, that communism is  a  menace to the peace of the world, we must admit that it is a menace to the security of this country. This measure deals with the security and defence of Australia. That is my second point. Since the bill deals with the security :ind the defence of the country, how can any honorable senator dissociate himself from it? </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson,</inline> who has just spoken, pointed out many honorable senators have witnessed, not one but two world wars. In fact, some members of this chamber have witnessed the occurrence of three major wars, and a number of us have taken an active part in one or other of those wars. I feel that I echo the thoughts of the people when I say that we do not want another world war; That being so, we must not be like the ostrich and say: &#34; Everything is all right with our country &#34;. We must take note of the trend of world events. Wherever we look we see countries which, if not actively engaged in war, are involved in the &#34;cold war&#34;. The picture is not a pleasant one. The doctrine of communism propagated by Russia is an everincreasing danger to the free countries of the world. We need only to look to the north of Australia to realize what is happening. Russia now dominates approximately 11,000,000,000 of the world&#39;s population, and the number is increasing all the time. That is the background which we must keep in mind when dealing with the bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> said that it is misery which breeds communism, and I do not think that any one will controvert that statement. We know also that Russia has fostered the development of communism in various countries. But is there any need for communism to develop in this country? In view of our high standards of living, our educational system, our civil liberties and all our other advantages, is there any justification for communism being tolerated at all in this country? I have no doubt that even members of the Opposition would immediately denounce any proposal to promote the development of communism in Australia. However, although our people would probably not turn willingly to communism, the fact is that Australia appeals very much to the Russian imperialists as a useful base for the propagation of Communist influence. That is where the danger lies. Whilst we may be complacent about the dangers of communism, we must realize that the Communists regard this country as a plum. We need only have regard to the tactics pursued by the Communists in one country after another. We know the way the Russians infiltrated various European and Asiatic countries. Recently we have had a good example of their methods in the struggle that has taken place in China. Class hatreds were stirred so that sections of the community came to regard other sections as traitors and oppressors. Employers were denounced as the exploiters of the workers. We can understand, in the light of that background, the reason for the attempts made to foster antagonism between different classes in Australia. The fostering of class hatred and distrust, the encouragement of strikes and the introduction of certain trouble-making techniques, such as the &#34; rolling strike &#34; on the waterfront, all conform to the Communist pattern of infiltration. Those tactics have been successfully pursued in other countries. I feci, therefore, that we have reason to fear the efforts of the Communists in this country, and that we must do something before it is too late. Whilst the efforts made by the Communists in Australia are probably not so advanced as those made in other countries, I remind honorable senators that we do not know die exact degree of Communist penetration of this country. </para>

            <para>- The bill itself is probably as far ahead of the legislation of other countries as are the other measures that the present Government has introduced. Notwithstanding that the people of Australia enjoy a high standard of living, and have the greatest freedom that it is possible for a people to enjoy, we must face the fact that the Communists are seeking to undermine our standards of living and to destroy our freedom. For that reason we have to get rid of them. Members of the Opposition have indicated in their speeches that they are somewhat complacent about the danger of communism. In fact, they do not believe that there is any considerable danger. They are, apparently, prepared, to permit the Communists to obtain even greater &#39;control as time goes on. The fact is that to-day many key unions are dominated and led by avowed Communists. That fact is well known, not only to members of the Parliament, but also to members of the trade unions. The acquisition of control of key trade unions follows the standard pattern used by Communists in other countries, and I have no need to remind honorable senators that that pattern has been remarkably successful. Shall we stand by complacently and say : &#34; The great key unions will gradually rid themselves of Communist domination &#34;, and do nothing about it, or shall we say: &#34; We will give you a hand to get rid of this Red menace&#34;? The passage of the bill, which I hope will receive the co-operation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> and other honorable senators opposite, will assist the trade unions to rid themselves of the Communists, whose efforts are so intense at present- </para>

            <para>- We are hearing the voice of the members of the small Communist executive which controls the trade unions, to which we have had to listen for so long, but we do not so often hear the voice of ordinary trade union members. Indeed, that fact was recognized, although belatedly, by the Chifley Government. The right honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> who was Attorney-General and also Minister for External Affairs in that administration, had to introduce legislation to protect the guided weapons range project from Communist infiltration. He recognized the danger to that undertaking, and he had no compunction in introducing legislation to deal with that menace to our security. When that legislation was passed it had the effect of removing from association with the project all Communist-inspired trouble-makers, leaving only men and women who had been thoroughly &#34; screened &#34; by the security authorities. The right honorable gentleman introduced that legislation because he found that it was absolutely necessary to protect a vital defence project. The present Government finds itself in a similar position. Here again, it is a matter of protecting our country. We are following the pattern established by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> as the responsible Minister in charge of the security service of this country while the Chifley Government held office. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> realized that foreign agents were working against the security of this country.  His  sole aim was to ensure our security. That too is the aim of this bill. The Chifley Government&#39;s action to end the coal strike last year, although belated, was another example of the Administration acting in the interests of the security of this country. The Chifley Government knew that there were saboteurs in this country whose aim was to disrupt industry. By means of advertisements in newspapers and posters on hoardings throughout the Commonwealth, that Government declared to the people of the Commonwealth that the coal strike was a Communist conspiracy. This Government does not intend to wait until the Communists act, as the Chifley Government did. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> knew that the Communists were planning last year&#39;s disastrous strike he took no action until the strike had started. He did not take the Parliament or the people of this country into his confidence when he first learned that the strike was being planned. This bill will give power to the Government and through it to our security service to prevent the recurrence of such widespread disruption of industry. Some honorable senators opposite have dwelt on the happenings of 100 years or 150 years ago. </para>

            <para>- We are dealing with the manner in which the teachings of Marx are being given expression to-day. Honorable senators opposite argue that this bill will smash the trade unions. A press report that I happened to read last Friday gave some idea of what is happening in this country at present. The report stated that, at a meeting in Sydney, the miners, waterside workers, and seamen, had agreed to assist each other in their fight against this bill. </para>

            <para>- The bill will not be amended at the dictates of any Com.munistdirected industrial group. The Government may amend the bill to improve it, and to make it more workable, bat no amendment will be made at the behest of any Communist-inspired organization. I realize of course that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> is drawing a &#34;red herring&#34; across the trail, but I have been in this chamber long enough to know his methods. As I have said, the waterside workers, coal-miners, and seamen agreed at a meeting in Sydney to render mutual assistance in their campaign against this bill. The meeting carried a resolution declaring the bill to be the most far reaching attack on the fundamental rights and liberties of the working people of Australia in our history. The bill was designed, the resolution said, to smash the trade union movement in preparation for an all-out attack on the living standards of the workers by the coal barons, the ship-owners and other sections of big business. It was part of the preparation for a third world war, but united action by workers could defeat the bill and bring about the downfall of the Menzies Government. Reading that resolution one could be pardoned for imagining that it was an account of a speech made by an honorable senator opposite in this debate, because, word for word, that is what most Opposition speakers have said about this bill. Apparently these militant unions copied their resolutions from the speeches of members of the Opposition or honorable senators opposite obtained a copy of the resolution in advance so that they would know what to say about this bill. The three unions that I have mentioned are Communistdominated. No honorable senator opposite will deny that. The people of Australia have been warned by the executives of those unions that no ships will sail from Australian ports, no work will be done on the wharfs, and no coal will he won, if this hill is passed. That reminds me that, during the term of office of the Chifley Government, waterside workers in this country refused to load ships that were to sail to Netherlands East Indies ports and no ships sailed to those ports. T assure honorable senators opposite, however, that we shall not emulate the inactivity of the Chifley Government in the face of such a threat. &#34;We shall ensure that ships shall sail from Australian ports, that cargoes shall be handled, and that coal shall be mined. During the ban on the loading of ships for the Netherlands East Indies, vessels were tied up at Australian ports for months, and even years, instead of carrying merchandise to various parts of the world in which it was urgently required. </para>

        <para>I believe that rather than smashing the trade unions, this bill will save them. If the trade unions are smashed, they will be smashed not by this bill, but by communism. Trade unionism is being used by the Communists for their own purposes. &#34;When the Communist objective lias been attained, the trade unions will be the first to go. </para>

            <para>- Instead of this legislation smashing the unions it will assist to preserve those that are dominated now by Communists. The danger is that the trade unions will be used by the Communist party until it gains sufficient strength for its own purposes, and when that objective is achieved, the unions will be the first organizations to go. This measure will safeguard the trade union movement and the unions themselves. </para>

        <para>I venture to say that the rank and file of unionists realize that. It is rather remarkable that only yesterday, when a 24-hours strike was proposed, the Communistdirected executive of the Transport Workers Union in Melbourne received a severe setback, inasmuch as the members of the union defied the executive. That indicates that the rank and file members of the unions are beginning to use their strength within the unions to depose the Communists who have gained a large measure of control. During the last few months that feeling has been gaining much strength among moderate trade unionists. There is no doubt in my mind that the moderate unionists feel that they have a govern- * ment in power now which will back them in reorganizing their unions. Previously, they did not have a government which would give them the support that they know they are getting now. I believe that the moderate trade unionists have every confidence, that this Government will give them every assistance in cleaning up the disastrous position that has been reached by some of the unions, particularly the key organizations. </para>
        <para>The speeches of some honorable senators on the opposite side indicate that they have no intention of falling out with the Communist controllers of the unions. In one breath, they have said that they want to get rid of Communist control, hut they have avoided saying anything that would discount them in the eyes of the militant unions. The Government is searching every avenue to make this bill acceptable to the Opposition. The Government desires the full co-operation of the Opposition in this matter. It has made every endeavour to meet some of the requirements of the Opposition and to allay the doubts that have been engendered in the minds of some people in this country. Those doubts probably have been raised by members of the Opposition, and in many cases they are groundless, but in order to allay them, the Government will introduce into this chamber five amendments. </para>
        <para>There has been quite a lot of discussion in another place and in this chamber regarding the declaration of a person. It has been said that two Ministers can constitute the Executive Council. It is suggested that a Minister might be a little liverish one morning and would get another Minister with him and they could go to the Governor-General and declare any person without further investigation. In theory, that could be done, but the Leader of the Opposition knows very well from his experience with the previous Government that no responsible government governs in that way. A responsible government is seised of its grave responsibilities, and would not act in the way suggested, although in theory it could do so. Obviously, the </para>
        <para class="block">Cabinet would have control, but to make the position more secure, an amendment has been forecast to provide that a committee of five persons shall be set up including the Solicitor-General, the Secretary of the Department of Defence and the Director-General of the security and intelligence organization, and two others. One might be a retired judge, or a. retired public servant, but they would be persons in whom the people would have the utmost confidence. That small committee would investigate the evidence before a recommendation went on to Cabinet or the Governor-General that an individual should be declared. </para>
        <para>I want to make it quite clear to the public that the responsibility for declaration will be treated very seriously as a Cabinet responsibility, and that the Cabinet will desire to have before it an objective statement of the material evidence collected by a group of responsible people such as I have mentioned. </para>

The Government is trying to bring some reason and common sense into this debate, and, if possible, to meet the wishes of the Opposition in regard to the different clauses of this bill, but if the Opposition has already made up its mind that it will not accept any amendments or play ball, it is futile for me, or for any other member of the Government, to try to explain exactly what we desire and are prepared to do to meet some of the objections that have been raised. </para>

        <para>There has been quite a lot of misconception regarding the onus of proof. Clause 9 has been the subject of contentious debate, both in another place and in this chamber, and the Government has been very concerned to establish that a person declared to be a Communist should be required to give evidence on oath if he wishes that declaration to be set aside. It proposes that if a declared person is prepared to enter the witness box, the onus of proof shall be upon the Government, but the person concerned must give evidence in person. </para>

The next question that has evoked much criticism is. the period for which this measure will remain in operation. It has been suggested that it shall be in force for one, two, five, or seven years, and there is some merit, probably, in making it possible for the measure to be repealed at some future date. The Government does not agree that it could make the law operate for a set period of years, because no one can tell what the position will be in regard to the Communist menace in this country in one, five, or seven years&#39; time. It may be less or it may be more, but we believe that a future government should be able to have  the legislation repealed when there is no longer any need for it. </para>

            <para>- Yes, on proclamation by the Governor-General. That provision should meet the objections that have been raised. The Government is not devoid of common sense. If it can be shown a better way of doing what is desired, it is prepared to listen. Amendments have been brought forward in order to allay the suspicions, not only of the Opposition, hut also of the community, that hardship may be inflicted upon some people by the existing provisions in the bill. We hope that the Opposition will now co-operate with the Government. </para>

        <para>Many well-intentioned people give support in some way to Communist doctrines. Some of them are good Christians and their support is theoretical only. Unfortunately, they do not understand the full implications of communism, or of how it has operated in Russia, and in the Russian satellite countries. In an interesting book called <inline font-style="italic">Behind Europe&#39;s Curtain,</inline> John Gunther has written about t.lie liquidation of human values as we know them. At page 36 of this book, he says -   . . Stalin is seeking to isolate the consciousness of the Soviet people from the living consciousness of humanity as a whole. . .- . There is your real Iron Curtain - the conditioning &#91;of the Russian&#93; into unquestioning and more or less painless acceptance of an intolerable state of affairs. </para>
        <para>Devolving from all this are difficult questions in human values. An orthodox Marxist would say that the power and pressure of the great Communist Idea, that of an egalitarian economy destined in time to be operated by the people for the people&#39;s good, with the disappearance of the state as such as an ultimate goal, is bound eventually to enhance such values. But they are certainly not enhanced at the moment. In fact most human values as we define them are being liquidated steadily. Consider - just to name one point - how the free intellect has been dispossessed. Another point is that nobody has much of a private life - which is indeed a lamentable hallmark of most dictatorships. Wise Communists recognize that the cost of their system is the sacrifice  &#91;they  say &#39; temporary &#39; sacrifice! of human values: hence, it has become a minor tenet of the faithful to encourage love for the family and so on, as an effort to counteract other anti-social tendencies implicit in the system as a whole. f!231 </para>
        <para>It is clear, therefore, that the triumph of communism leads inevitably to the destruction of human freedom. The purpose of this bill is to safeguard Australia. Whatever our politics, that is our .primary concern. Members of the Opposition will show by how they vote on this measure whether they are really concerned with the safety of the country. </para>

          <para>. - The Government has claimed that it received a mandate from the people to ban the Communist party, and the Opposition does not propose to dispute that. However, when the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> made his policy speech before the election, he did not indicate that the legislation to be introduced would be so wide in its scope as is this bill. For instance, he did not say that the onus of proof would be placed upon the accused ; or that, instead of the Crown having to prove that the accused person was guilty, the accused would have to prove that he was innocent. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> has told us about the amendments which the Government will introduce. No doubt they will be helpful, but they will not remove some of the principal objections to the bill. Honorable senators will agree that the bill provides that a person may be declared if, in the opinion of the Governor-General, he is a Communist, or a fellow traveller with Communists; if he is, or is likely to be, engaged in subversive activities detrimental to the safety and welfare of the country; or if he supports or advocates the objectives, policies, teachings, principles or practices of communism as expounded by Marx and Lenin. The bill provides that a declared person may appeal, but what exactly is he to appeal against? </para>

            <para>- I am glad to hear the honorable senator&#39;s interjection, because it bears out what I propose to say. If he is declared to be a Communist, he may appeal, and then the onus of proof will be on the prosecution, which must prove that he is a Communist. However, it may be that he will not be declared to be a Communist, but only a member of an organization that supports or advocates the objectives, policies, teachings.  principles or practices of communism as expounded by Marx and Lenin. In that case, be will have no right of appeal. He will be branded as a person engaged in subversive activities because of his associations with such an organization, but he will have no right of appeal. The Communist who is charged with practising communism is to be given the right of appeal, but a Communist would probably be proud to affirm his belief. On the other hand, the man who may be quite  innocently  associated with a declared organization is not to be given any right of appeal, even though charged with being engaged in subversive activities, and the foreshadowed Government amendments will not affect that situation a-t all. Such a man need not be a Communist, but he could be charged with being engaged iia subversive activities, or with being associated with an organization that was  influenced  by the doctrines of Marx and Lenin. I assume that even honorable senators opposite  support  the Commonwealth. Bank, in which every Australian citizen is a shareholder, and with the Postal Department, in which every citizen nas  an interest. All of them support State railways and tramways, and are in favour of free education. Therefore, all of them are open to the charge that they support the principles of Marx and Lenin. My point is that the proposed amendment regarding the onus of proof does not satisfy our real objection to the provisions in the bill. </para>

        <para>The Minister for Repatriation has said that no  Labour  Government has  ever  done anything to protect the trade unions of this country from&#39; Communist infiltration, and that it has been left to this Government to take the necessary action to do so. All that the Government proposes to do to protect the trade unions is to declare the Communist party to be an illegal organization and to prohibit Communists from holding office in unions connected with essential industries. That will not prevent Communists from spreading their poison, forming &#39;cliques or causing stoppages. The banning of a, name will not hinder a man&#39;s thoughts and actions. </para>

            <para>- I am not arguing that it should not be abolished. I admit that the Government has a mandate to ban the Communist party. What I am trying to show is that the operation of this measure will not prevent the Communist party from carrying on its subversive activities in the industrial organizations of this country. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and his colleagues have given much consideration to this. bill. I know that the Government wishes it to be passed by the Parliament, and Ave desire to assist its passage, but only in a form in which it will be of benefit to the community and will not put us back to the year 1200, before the signing of the Magna Charta, when men could be imprisoned without trial. It cannot be denied that this bill, despite the amendments that have been, made to it in the House of Representatives, provides for the imposition of the penalties without trial. </para>

        <para>The Minister for Repatriation has stated that the Labour party has done nothing to protect industrial organizations in this, country from the Communist menace, although he has also said that the action of the Chifley Government during the coal strike represented a very belated attempt to do something in that regard. Can the Minister tell me of any Australian: government other than the Chifley Government that has taken any action against Communists in Australia? The Chifley Government caused charges to he laid against Communists for making subversive statements,, and those Communists were subsequently imprisoned. It was also responsible for the passage of the emergency legislation that smashed&#39; the recent coal strike.. The Minister is-&#39;  aware  of those facts, but he does not like to  admit  them. He knows that the  only  government that has ever faced the issue of communism is the Chifley Government. The Minister believes that Communists have been guilty of subversive activities and acts of treason, but, although the Government of &#39;which he is a member has been in office for six months, and although there is legislation on the statute-book under which those Communists could* be prosecuted, it has done nothing at all to bring them to justice. There has been a lot of talk about what the Government will and will not do with the Communist party. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber have stated that this measure is designed to smash the trade unions, and I am inclined to believe that honorable senators opposite are now becoming a little frightened that the bill will, if they are not very careful, destroy the Government. I hope they realize that if we go back to the year 1200- </para>

            <para>- I do not say that all those who furnished information to the committee would be pimps, but doubtless some of them would lay them selves open to that charge. The peace officers or security police will be stationed in various parts of Australia, from which they will forward their reports to the committee. The committee will make its decisions only upon information furnished to it by the investigators. The members would not, as individuals, check the accuracy of the information. I cannot see that there would be very much difference between a case being decided by the committee or by the Attorney-General, because the committee would have no more evidence at its disposal than would the AttorneyGeneral. The measure will provide opportunities for peace officers to &#34; frame &#34; people, if they so desire. It will be necessary at the outset to have an army of peace officers, and as time goes on and some of the peace officers find that it is difficult to keep themselves fully employed legitimately, they will begin to pimp rather than lose their jobs. That is where the danger lies, and that is why the onus of proof should be upon the Crown. It is easy to say that it is not likely that an innocent person will be declared under the measure, but I remind the Senate that in 1940, in this chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> accused a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoare</inline> of being a Communist. He made a speech in. this chamber about this outlaw Communist. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoare,</inline> the then  .president  of the miners&#39; federation, was never a Communist. In fact, he fought communism. Yet that charge was made against him. The Prime Minister of the day made similar charges in another place. That indicates that peace officers, or members of the security service, do not always supply hard cold facts, and that mistakes can be made. </para>

          <para>. - I support the bill with all the earnestness which I possess because I believe that we should make a grave mistake if we underestimated the strength of the Communist party. We should also be making a mistake if we believed that communism was just a political philosophy, as was expressed by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> If it were just a political philosophy, we could debate it, and it would not harm any one. I very much regret that in this chamber and in the House of Representatives the real importance of this legislation has been distorted. Members of the Opposition have definitely refused to face the facts as they are. Quite a lot has been said about what constitutes the basic theories of communism as expounded by Marx and Engels, and whether the Communist party came into being in Australia in 1920 or in the years of the depression. I remind honorable senators that it is just 102 years ago that a foreigner in London commenced to write the Communist manifesto. That foreigner was Karl Marx. He began that work with these words, &#34;A spectre is haunting Europe &#34; ; and I say that 102 years after he wrote those words the spectre of communism is haunting the whole of the civilized world. Communism is not an abstract political theory; it is a matter of national and international political, social, industrial and ideological importance of the greatest magnitude. It has a direct bearing on the life of every citizen, because unfortunately its aim is destruction. The report of the royal commission that was recently appointed in Victoria to inquire into the activities of the Australian Communist party includes a quotation from a Communistic manifesto which states - </para>

        <para class="block">The Australian Communist party is only one section of an international secret society. It admits of no allegiance to Australia, and, as was pointed out by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer),</inline> the constitution of that party seeks to withdraw Australia from the British Commonwealth of Nations and to re-aline it, in the terms of the Communist manifesto, with the &#34; peace-loving progressive forces of the world, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics &#34;. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline>said, during the course of his remarks, that there was no immediate prospect of war, and he endeavoured to support his contention by reading an extract from a newspaper. In the light of existing world conditions only a very bold person would dare to prophesy the possibilities or contingencies oi&#34; either a &#34; cold &#34; war or a &#34; hot &#34; war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> dealt extensively with the international activities of Russia, and the infiltration of Europe and Asia by communism. However, in reply to the very rash statement that there is no immediate prospect of war, I should like to add another thought. I remind honorable senators that in 1948,  President  Truman and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Attlee</inline> were told by competent observers that Russia would have possession of the atomic bomb by 1.949. However, those two statesmen preferred to disbelieve what they were told, feeling certain that Russia would not acquire atomic strength before 1957. It is now a matter of history that they were wrong in their estimation of the preparedness, or the increasing preparedness, of Russia for war. Very recently, the Government of the United Kingdom announced the most extensive defence preparations in British history. General Eisenhower is recorded as having said that disarmament in America had already gone beyond the limit of safety. In our own newspapers to-day, we read that the Australian Government is pushing on with its defence programme. &#34;We would be most unwise if we prepared to defend our country from assault without, but refrained from dealing with the traitors inside. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett,</inline> who is not present in the chamber at the moment, twitted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline> by saying that no Queensland newspaper is in favour of the &#34; onus of proof &#34; provision in the bill. </para>

          <para>The Bill does not propose to stop any one else from being a Marxist, a Leninist, or from persuading any one else to accept that pernicious philosophy and social doctrine. It proposes to suppress a political movement organized for treason and social sabotage under the direction of a foreign power, and to adopt adequate measures for removing those associated with it from certain positions where they can disrupt the nation&#39;s economic life or endanger its defence. If this aim is disapproved, let those who disapprove it make their position clear; . if they deny the menace let them justify their denial in face of facts known to all. But if the aim is good and the danger is real, then the method must obviously be an efficacious one - and the emergency justifies exceptional measures for the security of the State against public enemies. No reasonable design of &#34;liberties&#34; includes criminal perrons or organizations in its protective scope. </para>

        <para class="block">Let us see how the unions are settling strikes. A one-day stoppage occurred in Victoria this week, notwithstanding that the Australian Council of Trades Unions, speaking for all unions, decided that a protest against the bill should be on a political and not on an industrial level. Did that stop the impudent minority? No. After the railway men had decided by a majority of twelve to one against a strike a certain resolution was adopted by the executive of that union, and in consequence the people of Victoria had no trains for one day&#39; and railway em ployees lost a day&#39;s wages. An article which appeared in a recent newspaper summed up the position as follows: - </para>

        <para class="block">I should have imagined that instead of honorable senators alleging that the bill was an attack on the trade union movement, they would recognize it as a measure to enable the trade union movement to clean itself up from within. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> said that the unions have a right to elect their own office bearers. No one disputes that right; what we say is that they have no right to elect to office men who are declared enemies of Australia.

        <para class="block">At the present time, the strength of the Communist-dominated unions is about one-third of the strength of the whole trade union movement. If any member of the Senate wants a better demonstration of how a minority can obtain complete sway over a majority he need only look  at the  Ear East, where, at the present time, a Communist army of 3,000,000 people has almost completely subjugated 475,000,000 people. In one province alone, where there were 20,000,000 people before the Communist occupation, there were only 14,000,000 when that occupation ended. In addition to striking. Communists have made killing their business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murray</inline> said that in the world to-day there were two philosophies - the Christian and the totalitarian. Earlier in my remarks I referred to the ideological aspect of communism. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murray,</inline> and I believe that the danger is greatest at the ideological level. Communism is an ideology of materialism, conflict and hatred, and complete lack of consideration for human life. The Communists preach a doctrine of atheism. </para>

          <para>.- The bill now before the Senate does not bring the aims of world communism into dispute, because there can be no doubt about them. Events immediately prior to 1939, the ultimate battle between Germany and Russia on the eastern front, the inexplicable things that Russia has done in the United Nations, and many very informative books, leave little room for a quarrel with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wedgwood&#39;s</inline> words to-night, or for doubt about the ideological line-Tip in the world to-day. However; I should like to bring this discussion back to the bill now before the Senate. This hill does two things. First, it bans the Communist party. Secondly - and perhaps more important - it sets up machinery to deal with organizations and individuals suspected of having or having had association with the Communist party. The important point is that whereas the bill itself bans the Communist party, in relation to the other matters with which it deals, it merely empowers the Government to do certain things. Where does Labour stand on the two purposes of this bill? We have not raised our voices in protest against the proposal to ban the Communist party, nor ha,ve we sought to amend the provisions of the bill relating to the imposition of that ban. Our criticism of the bill is confined to that section of it which constitutes the machinery for the &#34;declaring&#34; of certain individuals and organizations. That machinery includes penal clauses and others which, although not prescribing penalties, will stigmatize a &#34; declared &#34; person. In relation to this part of the hill, we have proved by the amendments that have been moved by the Opposition in the House of </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Representatives, and hy press statements that have been issued on the matter, that we have a very definite quarrel with the Government. I repeat, however, that the Opposition has no illusions about the Communists. The Australian Labour party knows only too well that should the Communists ever gain the hold in this country that they seek the greatest damage will be done, not to the chambers of commerce, the chambers of manufactures, or private companies, but to the great trade union movement. The Australian Labour party is an industrial party that has risen from the masses of the industrial people. We fully realize that the industrial side of the Australian Labour party would be the first to be injured in a Communist dominated Australia. Men of my age in the Australian Labour party were born into it during the struggle against communism. I remember when my colleague from Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash,</inline> who then held a high office in the trade union movement, was vilified by the Communists. The Labour party took a stand with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> on that occasion. It is rather galling when we hear people tell us that we do not know anything about the menace of communism and have never fought the Communists. We were fighting the Communists when the present Government parties were only fighting amongst themselves. We are still fighting Communists because it is our interests that they seek to capture. It is Labour men whom they vilify. In the last few weeks members of the Australian Labour party have had to stand up to the barrages of the Communists. Because this Government was elected to office by the people of Australia on the 10th December, and because it believes that the Communists can be best dealt with by banning the Communist party, we on this side of the chamber do not protest against that proposal. Our opposition in the past to the banning of the Communist party has been based on our belief that banning would be ineffective, and that the menace of communism in industry can be best handled by the trade unions. However, the people of this country have made their decision and </para>
        <para class="block">Labour will not oppose the banning of the Communist party. We have taken a firm stand on the other proposals contained in this measure, and we are pleased that, on two occasions at least, the Government has listened to the voice of experience from the Australian Labour party and has written into this bill amendments that will, to some degree at least, preserve the rule of law which the Government parties have gone close to wrecking. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong,</inline> because of his experience of governmental administration, was able to point to the administrative weaknesses in this bill.  His  strongest point was that the administration will not rest solely in the capable hands of the Attorney-General. That is a physical impossibility. Obviously, he could not handle every detail of administration throughout the Commonwealth. Therefore, two dangers arise. The first is that mistakes may be made, and shortly, I shall give an illustration from my own experience of how mistakes can occur. The second danger is that personal venom may result in a miscarriage of justice. Because of illfeeling a person may pass on to the Attorney-General a file containing false information about an innocent individual. In these circumstances the AttorneyGeneral could not avoid administrative errors. Speaking in this chamber on the 22nd April, 1940, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan said - </para>

          <para>We have heard a good deal about the menace of communism. Doubt seems to have arisen in the minds of certain honorable senators as to where the Communists <inline font-style="italic">are,</inline> but we need have no further doubt upon the matter. A non-Communist Labour party hae recently been formed in New South Wales, and this surely shows where the Communists are to be found. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> referred vaguely to this matter.

He seemed to confuse <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoare</inline> with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Orv, the secretary of the miners&#39; organization. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hoare,</inline> the  president  of the Northern Coal Miners Association, has never been a Communist, and has been fighting Communists practically all his life. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>That shows how a grave mistake can be made owing to a similarity of names. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> himself, in his second-reading speech on this measure made five mistakes in listing the names and union offices of 50 &#34; ace &#34; Communists in this country. I am reminded, too, of something that happened to my former senior officer a couple of years ago. A large number of employees were being brought into the department, and the usual &#34; vetting &#34; was carried out. An officer  went to the Criminal Investigation Bureau to check on the records, if any, of the new employees. Ohe man was suspended because he had a criminal charge on his record. However, two months later when my immediate superior was going through the names, he thought that the employee concerned must have been remarkably young when the charge was made against him. He checked up and found that he had suspended an innocent man whose father, who had the same name, had a criminal record. He said, &#34; This is one injustice that we can put right. This is the second time I have done this. On a former occasion I suspended a man because he had a criminal record, but I found out later that the record belonged to his brother. I put that right, too, but what I often wonder is how many men have been suspended by mistake and not reinstated &#34;. I cite that incident merely to show that mistakes can be and are being made in the Public Service. It shows how careful the authorities will have to be in declaring a man to he a Communist and a menace to his country. There is no doubt that this legislation will open the way for the terrible venom of the poison pen writer which unfortunately works in so many places. I have seen letters that have been written about officers in the Public Service. On one occasion I saw a letter that had been written about myself suggesting that I was not a fit person to be in the Public Service, simply because I had contested an Australian Labour party pre-selection. </para>
        <para class="block">Anonymous letters and a signed letter were received on that occasion. </para>
        <para>Even before this bill was mooted, an attempt was made to plant Communist literature on people and so attach to them the slur that the word &#34;Communist&#34; has brought on the Australian people, particularly in the last decade.  From  time to time, efforts have been made by Public Service organizations to do away with secret reports because of the harm that they can do, not entirely because of venom but because some senior officer honestly believes that a junior officer in a certain department should not advance. He may think it would not be in the best interests of the Service or that the man would not be fit to be in charge of men. If this bill is allowed to continue, that practice will be on a much more severe scale than before. </para>
        <para>I have been amused to hear Government members one by one close their speeches by saying, &#34;I whole-heartedly support this bill in its entirety &#34;. I put a fair question to them. Would they have used that phrase if the original bill that was introduced by the Prime Minister in another place had been brought before this chamber without the proposed five amendments? Which bill do honorable senators on the Government side support in its entirety? Were they talking about the bill that the chamber was debating this afternoon? In the press this morning, I read that there was to be no stepping down on the onus of proof. This afternoon honorable senators find that there has been an alteration. </para>

            <para>- That is correct. There have been five alterations. Which bill do honorable senators support in its entirety? Is it the first one that was introduced before the Opposition indicated that it would move certain amendments? Or do they support the second bill or the third bill which will include the amendments that presumably are to be moved to-morrow? I suspect that some of these proposals are not so vital and that maybe, unfortunately, they have a political flavour. The first bill included the right of entry which honorable senators on this side of the chamber criticized so trenchantly. Under that provision, an unknown peace officer or anybody else the AttorneyGeneral named could break down a front door, search the house whether the owner was in or not even if there were only impressionable children in the place. The officers could take away any documents. Would the honorable senators on the Government side have supported that provision had it come before this chamber and if the Opposition had not amended it? </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The people of Western Australia were particularly interested when they noted that it was provided that a case could go only to the High Court. That meant that anybody in Western Australia who was declared would have to travel over 2,000 miles by air or train together with witnesses whose fees he would have to pay, if he decided to defend the case. If he escaped the trap, he would have to pay their fares back without any recompense. Were honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber planning to support that provision? I suppose they will continue to say that they support the bill in its entirety, although five amendments have been added. </para>
        <para>I suggest to the Prime Minister that the next time he introduces a bill as important as this one, he should take his own party into his confidence and try to bring before the Parliament something that shows common sense and decency, and not so many fascist tendencies. When the right honorable gentleman brought this bill down he said, &#34; There will be no amendments to this legislation &#34;. This morning he said that there would be no amendments to the onus of proof clause but in the afternoon an amendment was foreshadowed. It is not fitting that a man in his position should say one thing early in the morning and change his mind in the afternoon. </para>
        <para>Two sets of people in the community have been singled out by this bill. I  happen  to have been a member of both sections. One is the trade union movement and the other is the Public Service. I suppose the Government believes it has the best of reasons for doing that. Under this legislation every trade union officer in Australia whether in a vital union or not and every public servant will retain his job at the pleasure of the Government in office. It has been thi proud boast of every public servant that regardless of what government was in power, he could cast his vote on  polling  day and carry out the policy of the government afterwards irrespective of whether he agreed with it or not and that he need not fear losing his job. If this bill is passed in this form, that boast has gone forever. It is a great pity. </para>
        <para>The Attorney-General was very naive when he  said  that no penalties were attachable to a person who was declared. In effect, the Minister said a person would merely be declared a Communist or one who was plotting against the security of the country; but whether the declared person was a public servant or a trade union officer, he would lose his job. Anybody in the community could be declared and thereafter he would be unable to hold a. job in either of the two organizations that I have named. This bill involves not only the people who could be named. It carries an everlasting threat that a government would be able to say what appointments a person could hold. The sword of Damocles would be suspended continually over his head. </para>
        <para>It would not be difficult to name a Communist under this bill. A person need only to be influenced by the teachings of Marx and Lenin and he could be declared. If an officer were to say to a members of the Australian Labour party, &#34; Do you believe in socialism ? &#34;, and if the answer were in the affirmative, would not that coincide with the teachings of Marx and Lenin? Or a person could be asked, &#34; Are you against sending troops to Malaya ? &#34; If the reply was in the affirmative the person who was questioned could be regarded as being opposed to the security of the country. </para>
        <para>One of the dangerous features of this bill is that it touches something beyond the tangible. The progress of any country comes from those people who are possessed of what might be called a divine discontent. They are in the bowling clubs as well as in the trade unions. But while this threat is held over them, people will think twice before they stick their necks out, to use a colloquialism, because information will come back along the dreadful grape vine, and inquiries will be made. The stigma will last whether they are condemned or not. When I was an industrial advocate freelancing for a union, we had a stormy meeting one night and one man spoke against me. Somebody said to me, &#34; They used to inquire about him when the Communists were first banned &#34;. I had nothing against that man. He was a decent fellow. He had never been charged, but some so-called kind person is ever ready to talk about such activities. The moment that becomes possible, the nation sinks to the level of those countries which have ever been open to the poison pen writer, the liar, the informer and the &#34; pimp &#34;, who have always been hated by the Australian people. </para>
        <para>If the Government believes that this legislation will be effective, it must fix a definite time  limit  to its operation. If the bill becomes law and operates effectively within a certain period, whether short or long, it will do  awaY  with the Communists, and peace and harmony will reign again. If that happened there would be no reason to maintain this bill on the statute-books. I did not quite understand the reference made by the Minister to the Governor-General deciding in his own good time when the necessity for this legislation would pass. If the Government is to be consistent, this legislation must have a time limit. </para>
        <para>Pictures have been drawn showing terrible desperadoes who will do all they can to see a. foreign power in Canberra and it is said that the Labour party wants to provide loopholes for them to escape. Nothing could be further from the truth. It will not be difficult to catch the leading Communists. If any section of the community proposed to do those terrible things in Australia, they would bring down on themselves the full penalty  of the law. But when some perfectly innocent person is taken in charge and put in a court and told, &#34; You are guilty ; prove that you are not&#34;, he will need protection. Honorable senators know perfectly well that if some individuals are put in the witness box and told that they are Communists and should not be at large because they are opposed to the safety of the country, they would be so inarticulate that they would not be ableto defend themselves. There are misguided people who get dragged into &#39;all sorts of things. Honorable senators have been told that not all Communists will be declared. Some will be and some will not. That would be left to the discretion of the Attorney-General. It is a complete caricature to suggest that the Labour party wants to let the desperado and the treasonable person go free. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber want to do no such thing. If the Government can prove its case by law, the Labour party will not try to protect the persons concerned. The Labour movement has had to fight for freedom. Its members remember the time when things which were taken for granted now had to be fought for. Those things are not going to be thrown overboard &#39;by an irresponsible government while the Labour party is in opposition. </para>
        <para>Statements have been bandied about this chamber that certain persons are Communists. The Government has notgrasped the fact that if a person is called a Communist, either under this bill or before it becomes law, the epithet is a serious one. Before a person is solemnly declared a Communist, there should be a full survey of the position and the facts should he clear. Declared persons will be denied jobs in the trade unions and in the Public Service, and no (private firm will want to employ them. As in the totalitarian countries, the person against whom action is taken will be denied the rights of citizenship, and will he left to starve. It has been said that the Opposition is trying to prevent the banning of the Communist party in Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. It has been said that we have tried to obstruct the passage of this legislation without justification, but that charge has been refuted by the action of the Government itself in introducing amendments to give effect to the suggestions we have made. For instance, we opposed the right of entry. The Government has yielded on that point. &#34;We suggested that there should be a right of appeal to the Supreme Court of a </para>
        <para class="block">State, and that point has been conceded. Still the Government accused us of being obstructive, but only to-night fresh amendments have been introduced to meet some of the more serious objections that we raised. Thus it has been proved that our criticism, far from being obstructive, has been constructive in the highest sense. </para>
        <para>Honorable senators opposite have mentioned the Stevedoring Industry Commission, hut their remarks were a travesty of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> said. It has been claimed that the Labour Government kicked two Communists off the Stevedoring Industry Commission without trial, and without offering proof of guilt. &#34;When the Labour Government, caine into office in 1941, conditions on the waterfront in Australia were chaotic. Because of the intricate nature of the work, the Government appointed the Stevedoring Industry Commission, as an adjunct of the Arbitration Court, to deal with matters peculiar to shipping. Both the &#34;Waterside Workers Federation and the ship-owners were asked to nominate representatives, and the federation nominated two &#39;Communists, who were duly appointed. However, they deliberately sabotaged the work of the commission, and the Government invited the federation to nominate two other representatives. The first two were removed from their positions, not because they were Communists, but because they failed to do their job. Whether they had been Communists or Jews or gentiles it would have been all the same. The Government asked the federation to nominate two other representatives, but the federation said that it would have its first nominees, or none. The Government made it clear that it was not to be pushed around by Communists or anyone else. </para>
        <para>The Immigration Act has  also been mentioned, but there is no real comparison between the onus of proof provision in the Immigration Act and that in the present bill. If a person is charged with being a prohibited immigrant in that he is a member of an oriental race, all he has to do to disprove the charge is to put his hand in his pocket and produce a birth certificate showing that- he was horn in Malta, or some other </para>
        <para class="block">European country. Indeed, he is the only person who can readily prove where he was horn. Place of birth is a physical fact capable of demonstration. It is easy for a man to prove where he was born. However, a person who is declared to be a Communist is really being charged with being in a certain state of mind. Communists carry no outward mark of their belief. They dc. not wear a special kind of clothes. If a man is charged with holding certain beliefs, it is not easy for him to prove the contrary. The Minister for </para>
        <para>Trade and Customs, when introducing the bill, said - </para>
        <para>Under communism, it is not a matter of rendering to Ceasar the things that are  Ceasar&#39;s  and to God the things that are God&#39;s, but rather that the Communist State presumes to take the place of God. The Christian concept that man&#39;s responsibility to God transcends his responsibility to the State irritates and offends the Communist dictators who acknowledge no authority above their own. This, to an extent, explains the universal hostility of communism against Christian, Jew, Moslem and all .people who believe in God and in a moral law. The entire Marxist philosophy fails if the Christian system stands. Christian philosophy demands the recognition of man&#39;s natural rights as a creature of God. Marxist philosophy denies any such rights. As Marx himself stated, &#34; Communism begins where Atheism begins.&#34; </para>
        <para class="block">The Minister has given a great deal of thought to this matter, and the passage I have quoted goes far beyond anything contemplated in the bill. If I know anything about the trade union move ment, the bill will fail to achieve its purpose. If the Minister really believes v. hat he said, and I think he does, what is he going to do about it? If communism begins where atheism begins, because of the difference between the Christian and Communist concept, then the task of the Government is far greater and more profound than anything that this legislation is designed to accomplish. I believe that there is something in what the Minister said. Communism has not -just developed out of thin air. If the problem is to be solved, we must, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cole</inline> said, begin in the schools. </para>
        <para>The Government has  already  accepted some of the suggestions of the Opposition, and has asked for our co-operation. I respectfully  suggest  that there are men on this side of the chamber who know a great deal about the trade union movement. No one attempts to tell a baker or a mechanic how to do his job, but whenever an industrial disturbance occurs, every Tom, Dick and Harry knows what should be done, how the strike should be conducted, and what the Arbitration Court ought to do. As a matter of fact, the trade union leader has one of the most difficult and intricate of jobs. There is never a dull moment for him from 8 o&#39;clock in the morning until the end of the last meeting at midnight. The handling of industrial disturbances is a job for men who are experts by aptitude and experience. The Government has, very wisely, I believe, accepted suggestions from members of the Opposition, men who are older and much more experienced in industrial affairs than I am. As this bill stands the Government could, and might, declare members of the Australian Labour party. It is certain that innocent members of the community could, and might, be declared in error. &#34;We would be less than a responsible Opposition if we allowed that to happen. </para>

          <para>. - While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> was speaking, the amendments foreshadowed by the Government were circulated, and so I propose to discuss the bill together with the proposed amendments. I was interested in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee&#39;s</inline> statement that persons with no knowledge of industrial matters are prepared to rush in with their advice when a strike occurs. I remind honorable senators that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> at one time consistently represented trade unions in the Arbitration Court, and he knows far more about Arbitration Court proceedings than does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> and most other honorable senators opposite. The fact that the Government has introduced amendments to this bill shows that it has kept an open mind. </para>

            <para>- Certainly it has. Many of the amendments were framed after Ministers had heard suggestions by the Opposition. The function of the Opposition is to put forward arguments which it believes to be good, if the Government also believes them to be good, it will incorporate them in the bill in the form of amendments. The amendments that have just been circulated cover some of the points regarding which doubts were raised in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. For instance, the first amendment provides for the setting up of a committee consisting of the Solicitor-General, the Secretary to the Department of Defence, the Director-General of Security, and two other persons, to consider the evidence against any person whom it is proposed to declare. Only after the committee is satisfied with the evidence will the person be declared. Honorable senators will agree that that is a valuable safeguard. The second amendment provides that if a declared person goes into the witness box and gives evidence on oath, the onus of proof shall revert to the Grown. If the declared person refuses to give evidence, then the onus will remain on him to prove his innocence. T think that is fair. If a man is not willing to go into the witness box and give evidence on oath, there must be something wrong. The third foreshadowed amendment deals with officers of an organization, and the last is designed to ensure that the measure shall remain in force only for as long as, in the opinion of the Governor-General, it is necessary for it to do so. </para>

        <para>In the course of the debate, honorable senators on both sides of the chamber have dealt with the  question  of whether the Government has a mandate for this measure. Prior to the last general election, I spent over five months wandering round Queensland. Instead of making speeches from soap-boxes or in halls, I went amongst the people. When men were working on a job, I had a yarn with the foreman and asked permission to talk to them. I tried to get them to talk to me, rather than to listen to me. I found that the feeling against Communists, then, was very strong, and I think it is just as strong now. I believe that the Government has a very definite mandate for this measure. I do not pretend that communism was the only issue upon which the Government was elected, but I believe that it played a very large part in the election, and honorable senators opposite have, in  effect,  agreed that that is so. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline>complained that during the general election campaign, we tried to tie the Australian Labour party to the Communist party. I cannot speak for all members of the present Government parties, but I know that I did not do that. The Labour party has only itself to blame if some people believe that it is tied to the Communist party. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lloyd</inline> Ross, writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Loft: News</inline> in March, 1947, stated - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The effects of the war and the Russian revolution were revealed in the changes of 1921. The Federal Executive of the Labour party requested the industrial organizations to meet and discuss the formation Of a new programme. After this programme of 1921, they formulated and adopted as their objective . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">He went on to refer to the objective that has been bandied backwards and forwards in this chamber during the last three months - the socialization of industry and the means of production, distribution and exchange. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lloyd</inline> Ross is well known in the Labour party. The Liberal party cannot be blamed for linking the Australian Labour party with the Communists, when the Labour party&#39;s own writers have done so. That is one of the accusations that has been hurled at us by honorable senators opposite in support  of their contention that we did not play the game when we were on the hustings during the last general election campaign. </para>
        <para>Many suggestions have been made by honorable senators on both sides of the chamber as to when the scourge of communism began. I believe that, for all practical purposes, it started with the -Seventh Internationale in 1927. It was from the Seventh Internationale that the beginnings of communism, as we now know it, emerged. It was then that the Communists bogan to put out feelers and send their agents to various countries, including Australia. I am dealing now only with Australia. Who were the people that the Communists sent here? Who were the recruits that they got, and what kind of people were they ? My knowledge of Communists, which is fairly extensive, has led me to the conclusion that Communists are different from ordinary people. Honorable senators opposite have their Labour ideas and we have our Liberal ideas, but they are a part of, and not the whole, of cur lives. The Communist eats, sleeps, talks and lives communism. Every minute of his life is devoted to the cause of communism. That is something that we cannot understand. Perhaps the only people who have some glimmer of knowledge of how Communists feel about communism are those who are very much taken up with religion. I realize that the cases are not parallel, but I think that perhaps people devoted to religion may realize how all-enthralling communism is to the Communists. I have talked to many Communists, and I have a fairly good idea of how they feel about communism. They have absolutely no conscience in relation to the things that we hold dear. Their one aim in life is to further the teachings of communism. An example of that is that when Sharkey went to Malaya eighteen months ago, he was reported - and it was not denied - to have suggested to people throughout that country that they should continue to murder, pillage, and to do all the things that the Communists are now doing in South-East Asia. I wonder whether it was only by coincidence that shortly afterwards, three young Australians were killed in Malaya. How did that hit people here when they heard of it? The members of the Australian Labour party must have felt precisely the same about it as did the members of the Liberal party. We are up against persons of that type. </para>
        <para>A bill to deal with the Communist scourge cannot be produced, as it were, out of the hat, in the same way as small bills like that providing for the payment of child endowment to the first child in every family. In one sense, that is not n small bill, but it is not as important to the nation as is this one. This measure was very difficult to draft, and allowance had to be made for possible amendments. Honorable senators opposite, in criticizing the Government, have referred to the fact that the bill was amended in some respects in the House of Representatives, but I believe that that was a very good thing. I admire the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> for the way in which he has accepted amendments in an effort to ensure that the bill will be passed. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Flaherty,</inline>speaking of communism, said that Marx had never advocated bloodshed, revolution, or anything like that. He used what, in my opinion, was a rather childish simile when he said that he, too, wanted to overthrow the Government. I suggest to the honorable senator that he should consult the dictionary and learn what the word &#34; overthrow &#34; means. What he meant was that he wanted to &#39;change the Government, not that he wanted to overthrow it. To overthrow a government, means to throw the government out, not merely to change the party that is in power. We had to listen for approximately half an hour to statements along those lines. I considered that some of them . were rather vindictive, and they were certainly not a great help. </para>

          <para>I have already laid stress on the fact that Bolshevist &#91;propaganda is sufficiently astute to adjust its teachings to its hearers. Bolshevist propaganda may be religious or  anti-religious,  to suit the circumstances. It is utterly without conscience, and all means are justified by the ends they serve. All over the world this propaganda has at its disposal a complex machinery that is made up of the Communist sections of the various countries. It only needs to press a button to ,put  this  machinery into operation. In every country it operates, either secretly or in the open. Woe to the nation that allows it to function! One day that nation will be undermined by this seditious activity and will he disrupted, merely because this phenomenon has not been seriously taken into account. </para>

            <para>- I have already stated that I do not subscribe to that comment. During the debate not very much has been said about how the various strikes in the last five years have affected the unfortunate people who have had to do the actual striking. I refer not to the leaders of the unions hut to the people who struck and lost pay. I think it is generally agreed by honorable senators on both sides of the chamber that, in the main, strikes have been caused by Communists. From a perusal of the records it is clear that Communistcontrolled unions have been responsible for SS per cent, of the total man-days that have been lost through strikes in the last five years. That, in itself, is a serious indictment of the Communist party.- </para>

            <para>- A Communistcontrolled union with only 250,000 members lost 5,250,000 man-days, while other unions with 1,000,000 members only lost 1,750,000 man-days. If those figures are reduced to the same common denominator, it is found that the Communistcontrolled unions have lost twelve times the number of man-days as the other  non-Communist-controlled  unions have lost. That is another indictment, if it were needed. During that period about ?2,000,000 was lost in wages. That did not come out of the pockets of the Communists. but out of the pockets of people, many of whom are not members of the Australian Labour party. </para>
