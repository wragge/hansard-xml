                    <para><inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - On Thursday, the 25th May, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morrow</inline> addressed a question to me concerning the importation of petrol into Australia and the allocation of dollars for that purpose, which I asked should be placed upon the notice paper. A number of other questions were also addressed to me on this subject by honorable senators and I undertook to furnish a considered reply. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Practically all remittances in payment for petrol and other petroleum products imported into Australia, are made, in the first instance, in sterling to the London accounts of oil companies, into which are also paid amounts in respect of imports into other sterling area countries. As and when it is necessary to provide dollars against the balances standing to the credit of these aggregate accounts, approval of the United Kingdom Exchange Control authorities must be obtained. It will be apparent, therefore, that the country of origin of shipments of petrol imported into Australia does not necessarily indicate the extent to which payment for the cargoes is ultimately made in dollars, and for these reasons it is not practicable to provide for and to restrict the importation of petrol to a pre-determined dollar allocation. Petroleum products are therefore excluded from the general dollar budget from which allocations are made for the importation of other products of dollar origin. </para>
                <para>For the reasons indicated, it is not possible to ascertain whether any additional dollars have been expended by reason of the abandonment of petrol rationing in Australia. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine whether the quantities of petrol which have been consumed since rationing was abolished are in excess of the&#39; quantities which would have &#39;been permitted for consumption, under rationing. I mention, however, that the registration of new vehicles, the bulk of which are obtained from the United Kingdom, results in an appreciable increase of consumption month by month. The Australian Government is fully aware of the necessity to make the maximum use of sterling oil supplies,, and in co-operation with other members of the sterling area is at present considering the means of achieving this objective. The availability of increased supplies of sterling oil should result in a reduced dollar outlay by the sterling area, and this has doubtless influenced the British Government in its recent decision to abandon petrol rationing in the United Kingdom. Insofar as stocks are concerned, the quantity of petrol held at seaboard in oil company installations at the end of April, 1950, was 75,207,000 gallons. The average quantity held at the end of each month of this year has been 70,732,000 gallons, compared with 41,497,000 in 1948 and 53,777,000 gallons in 1949. </para>

                    <para>- <inline font-style="italic">No.</inline> Britain has been able to abolish petrol rationing because of the increase of its petrol refining capacity. The United Kingdom has been unable to sell all the motor spirit and fuel oil that its refineries are capable of handling. To help Britain to save dollars, negotiations are proceeding for an agreement under which the Empire countries will ask American companies to purchase a percentage of their motor spirit imports from the surplus stocks held by British refineries. </para>

Is the Government barren of such a policy? If not, when will its policy be given effect so that the fears of not only the Victorian Chamber of Commerce, but also of people throughout- the Commonwealth may be allayed? </para>

                        <para>- My attention had not been directed to the report to which the honorable senator has referred. The Government does not consider itself to be under any obligation to chambers of commerce. Our main consideration is the welfare of the people of Australia as a whole. As I have endeavoured to explain to the honorable senator previously, the restoration of the purchasing power of the &#163;1 is not exclusively a matter for legislation or regulation. It can be accomplished only by the utmost cooperation of all sections of the people, and I appeal again to honorable senators opposite, who have quite considerable influence with large sections of the people, to do their best to achieve the objective which we all so earnestly desire. </para>

The right honorable gentleman stated then that if he were returned to power, his Government would institute a sub-committee of Cabinet consisting of ex-servicemen to investigate the whole position of pensions and allowances under the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Act. The report of the subcommittee has been finished. I know that the honorable senator is very concerned about this matter and I assure him that that concern is shared by honorable senators on this side of the chamber. ow that the report of the sub-committee has been completed, the investigations on this important question will be finalized as early as possible. </para>

In the calendar years 1947, 1948 and 1949 9,837 permanent houses and flats were built by the New South Wales Housing Commission. That figure does not include work done by authorities such as the Rural Bank for whom the Housing Commission sponsors material requirements. During the same period the total of houses built by private and government agencies and firms was 50,892. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport seen a report in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> of to-day wherein it is stated that Mr. C. M. Vertigan said that 70 per cent, of wharf difficulties were caused by lack of shed space and slowness in clearing cargo? He added that it was useless to ask why waterside workers did not clear ships more quickly if more space could not be found on the wharfs for them to work in. In view of the reported statement that waterside workers are not to blame for at least 70 per cent, of the slowturnround of ships, will the Minister retract his previous statement in which he blamed the waterside workers? Will he take action against the importers, warehouse-owners and others, who are really responsible for the slow turn-round of ships? </para>

                        <para>- I did not make a general attack on the waterside workers, but I can prove that, in some areas, where Communists are in control, the output of work is only 50 per cent. of what it should be. During my trip to Hobart, my attention was drawn to the fact that there was a serious shortage of shed space, and that applies to all the main wharfs in Australia. I discussed the matter with the Premier of Tasmania, and every effort is being made to solve the problem. Unfortunately, there was a fire on the Hobart wharf which added to the difficulty. At the ports where the waterside workers are free from Communist interference they are doing a good job, but where they are still controlled by Communists they are doing a bad job. </para>

                        <para>- I remind the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport that during the last war the loading and unloading of cargoes in Australian ports was under the control of committees. Will he cause inquiries to be made to ascertain whether it would be possible to evolve a system under which there would be State cargo control committees and a central body with overriding authority? A similar system operated most effectively during the last war, and, to a great degree, eliminated shipping delays in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Committees similar to the control committees that operated during the last war have been established in all main Australian ports. On most of them there are representatives of all sections of the shipping industry. They have been doing exceptionally good work. I do not think that there is any need to establish a central body with overriding authority. I point out, however, that my department has an officer in Tasmania and that in other ports liaison is achieved between my department, port committees and the State Government. </para>

                        <para>- The matter of urgency that has activated the Opposition to submit this motion is the failure of the Government in aspects of national health. The particulars of that failure have already been submitted. I say at once that not in any governmental matter that I have ever known has there been such muddle and confusion, such constant change of front, such kite-flying, such a lack of frankness, such contempt for the Parliament and such abject surrender and subservience to sectional interests as there has been in this all-important matter of the health of the people of Australia. It is completely clear to any one who has given one minute&#39;s consideration to this matter that neither the Government nor the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has any policy. The tactics that they are following in pursuit of a policy are also completely clear. The technique of the Minister has been made abundantly clear. </para>

                </interjection>
                <para class="block">He submits proposals to all the sectional interests in the field, the doctors, chemists and friendly societies - and when I use the term &#34; friendly societies I incorporate, for the purpose of brevity, all the various medical and hospital benefit schemes and the like - sees representatives of each of those sectional interests, explains to them a limited part of his proposals, and then gracefully retires. As parts of the proposals begin to leak through the press to the public and to other interested bodies, those sectional interests that are directly concerned engage in mutual conflict and criticism. The Minister gracefully skirts around the area of conflict, picking out any little points of agreement that he can find, pieces them together like a patchwork, and then throws them into the area of conflict again, where they receive further criticism. He again patches up his proposals in the light of the added criticism, and throws them once more into the arena. Apparently he hopes that ultimately he will emerge from the process with a scheme that will have the co-operation of the doctors, the chemists and the friendly societies. Notwithstanding that any such scheme will be born of the conflict of those sectional interests, he will acclaim it as a national health scheme that has been approved by all. I do not have to point out to the Senate that a scheme born in those circumstances is a pure hybrid, a thing of shreds and patches, the child of ineptitude and compromise. Yet, that is plainly the course that is being pursued by the Minister. </para>
                <para>The right honorable gentleman is an expert in the very old game of kite-flying. It is perfectly apparent that he sends his kite into the sky, and when, the first brick is thrown at it and it crashes to the ground, he patches up the kite and sends it up again, and repeats that process. At the moment the Minister&#39;s kite is flying all over the sky in a most ill-balanced and erratic fashion. However, the really serious aspect of the whole matter is that in all his discussions with doctors, chemists and friendly societies, the Minister has overlooked the one vital and fundamental consideration, which is the interests of the people of Australia, particularly of the sick and suffering amongst them. To-day  the sick and suffering people are looking for help, for some financial relief from the burden of sickness. At a time when the costs of living are rising, and the expense incurred in diagnosis and treatment of disease is rising daily, notwithstanding that people are already paying for medical services out of their social services contributions, the people are entitled to look for their champion in the National Government and to find him in the person of the Minister for Health. However, it is clear that the sick and suffering are not finding any champion in the present Government. </para>
                <para>The one clear course for the Government to follow is to determine what is right in the interests of the people. Having determined that, it should then determine what is right in the interests of national health. Having made those determinations, let its members talk to doctors, chemists, and the other sectional interests grouped in this field. Any one who attempts to evolve a scheme in the manner in which the present Minister for Health has been doing must fail to achieve the purposes that are necessary for the attainment of national health. If we are to wait until doctors, chemists and friendly societies agree, we will wait for ever, because each of those bodies - and I have had a great deal of experience of them - will urge that true justice demands that its particular point of view be accepted. When we find that the conception of justice entertained by each of them collides head-on with the conceptions entertained by the other interested bodies, we realize that they cannot all be right and that they cannot all have justice on their side. There is only one thing that a government of courage, vision and ability should do, and that is to determine, in the interests of the people and of the health of this country, what course it should follow ; and then to do as complete justice as possible between the three sectional interests in the field. </para>
                <para>I have already indicated that one of the reasons for submitting the motion is the utter failure of the Minister for Health to give complete, or for that matter, any, information to the Parliament. He has consistently evaded or ignored questions that have been asked in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. </para>
                <para class="block">Although he has had three months in which to do so, his representative in this chamber, the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper),</inline> has not yet conveyed to the Senate one clear piece of information concerning the Government&#39;s proposals for national health. However, we find that the press of the country is full of the most complete details of the Government&#39;s health proposals, pharmaceutical and medical benefit schemes, and all sorts of other proposals. The consequence is that the Opposition finds itself in the grave difficulty that it has to look to the press for information, instead of being able to rely upon authoritative pronouncements by the Government or upon statements made by the Minister for Health or his representative in this chamber. </para>
                <para>I propose to trace very rapidly the course of events in the last few months. On the 19th December, 1949, the day on which he was appointed to office, the Minister for Health made a statement which appeared in the press the following day, and in the course of that statement he made two statements to which I shall direct attention. The first was that he had asked the Prime Minister to arrange as early as possible talks with State Health Ministers to work out a policy of full CommonwealthState co-operation. That was on the 20th December. On the 11th March the Minister said that the Commonwealth Government would soon hold a number of conferences with State Health Ministers, and that it might be necessary to add to the national health bill provisions covering the decisions of those conferences. To-day is the 30th May. There is no sign of -the conferences, and no suggestion that they be held. The second point that the Minister referred to according to the newspaper report of the 20th December related to another matter. He said that as soon as Parliament met he would be able to present legislation to carry the Government&#39;s immediate policy into effect. The Parliament met on the 22nd February - more than three months ago. Not only have we no information, and most certainly no legislation, but also we find that the Minister, on the 16th May, said - again according to the press - that the national health plan had been deferred until the next session of the Parliament and that legislation would not be introduced before September. But that i9 not the latest report. Let me bring the Senate right up to date. The Minister has now stretched the time from September to December. The following press report of a statement by the Minister was published to-day: - </para>

He said that talks had been purely exploratory and that no firm decisions had been made.

According to what we have read in the press, one feature of the Government&#39;s scheme was that pharmaceutical benefits would be confined to approximately 40 drugs. Here is a new horror upon us - a disease test. To become eligible for pharmaceutical benefits one will have to select one&#39;s disease. The  president  of the Pharmaceutical Guild in this country has stated that the 40 drugs listed would be applicable in only from 5 to S per cent, of the cases of sickness in this country. The Government&#39;s plan, particulars of which appeared in the press in February, also provided for a means test. In addition, people were supposed to join friendly societies or medical benefit schemes according to the level of their incomes. The present Government parties which had so much to say about freedom prior to the 10th December last, proposed in the scheme originally presented to the British Medical Association, according to newspaper reports, that the people of this country should be compelled to join friendly societies or medical benefit schemes !  </para>
            <para>Referring further to the conferences which took place in January, I draw attention to the fact that for the first time in the history of negotiations between the Government and the British Medical Association on this matter, there was no written record of what transpired. To the best of my knowledge, a verbatim record was taken of all previous conferences. The proceedings were recorded by official shorthand writers ; but of course the Minister for Health wanted no witnesses of his abject surrender to the British Medical Association in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits. He wanted also to leave himself free to run for cover when criticism was voiced by sectional interests. If proof is required of that, or of the Minister&#39;s lack of frankness, one has only to refer to questions that I asked in this chamber on the 1st March. I  asked  - </para>

            <para class="block">If a Minister is to speak in this debate I invite him to answer my questions. They certainly have not been answered yet. </para>
            <para>I come now to the second kite that the Minister flew on the 13th May. If one refers to the press of that date one finds a large heading &#34; Pay Doctor from Taxes - New National Health Plan under Review &#34;. The proposal was, briefly, that the patient should find the whole of the fee in advance and, in due course, obtain a refund of taxation for amounts in excess of &#163;5. As soon as the Minister realized that that proposal was hopeless and missed the fundamental point that people want relief at the time of sickness and not twelve months or fifteen months later as soon as he realized that many family men in this country are not paying any taxes at all, and therefore are not receiving refunds he let that kite stay on the ground. We have heard nothing more about it although it was flown as recently as the 13th May. </para>
            <para>Now we come to the <inline font-style="italic">piece de resistance,</inline> namely, the proposals made at the British Commonwealth Medical Congress on the 23rd May. They occupy fourteen pages of typescript. I defy anybody to produce in any language, on any subject, a more hopelessly confused document. One can read it ten times without knowing what it is about. Any person who reads it &#34;will be in a state of utter bewilderment. One will find if one reads it that it is full of praise for a concept for which he is lost in admiration, hut of which he does not give the slightest particular. Looking at it under a microscope, and using imagination, these appear to be some of its features: The Government is to prepare a schedule of payments which it will make in respect of each service that a doctor renders; the doctor will be paid on a fee-for-service basis; those payments are not to be made to the doctor or to the patient, but to the friendly societies which operate on a capitation basis. They pay a. doctor so much a year for each member. The proposal of the Government intends to superimpose a fee-for-service system on a capitation system. </para>
            <para class="block">Only the Minister for Health knows how the two are to be reconciled. </para>
            <para>The scheme proposes that all people except pensioners shall join a friendly society group, to which they must pay their fees, although they are already paying social services contributions. It is clear that there is to be no payment by the Government to the friendly societies for the administrative work that they will do in connexion with this scheme. &#39;But the friendly societies will not undertake the work for nothing, and it is dear that their charges to each of their members must and will go up. </para>
            <para>The statement does not give the slightest intimation of what work the doctors will be called upon to do. There is no indication whether the friendly societies will expand their dispensing systems under this scheme, although the chemists need the information urgently. No regulation of the doctors&#39; fees is suggested, and the inevitable will happen as it did with maternity payments. The Government assistance will be purely a benefit for the doctor and not for the patient. </para>
            <para>Not the slightest provision is made in the scheme for people in the outback. A contribution towards a doctor&#39;s fee matters nothing to  outback  residents. The heavy charge on the country people is for the mileage that a doctor has to travel. He may have to cover hundreds of miles over rough country. </para>
            <para>If ever one wanted proof of confusion of mind, I invite attention to page 14 of the statement, on which the Minister for Health seta out a list of voluntary insurance organizations. Honorable senators can imagine my surprise when I found included among health, medical, hospital and sickness benefit bodies the Federal and State superannuation schemes. They are merely a provision for retiring allowances and have nothing to do with sickness or pharmaceutical benefits. The whole -document proves conclusively the confusion in the Minister&#39;s mind and in the minds of the members of the Government. </para>
            <para>How were these proposals received? This was the third kite that had been flown. I refer the Government to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 24th May, which contains an article raider the heading - </para>

                <para>Now I come to the fourth kite. The political liaison between the British Medical Association and the members of the present Government was shown plainly at the last general election, but no more plainly is it shown than in the terms of the published so-called agreement that has been reached between the British Medical Association and the Government. If honorable senators will refer to the story in the press to-day and study the headlines, they will get the impression that complete accord has been reached, but, in fact, two other significant facts are recorded. The first is that certain resolutions have been presented for the consideration of the Minister and the Government as to the procedures to be followed. The details will not be released. The second fact is that there are to be further discussions between the British Medical Association and the Federal Minister for Health. That is a nice piece of political timing between the British Medical Association and the federal Minister, both of whom knew full well that this motion was coming before the Senate this week. </para>
                <para>Each one is fooling the other. The Minister for Health is fooling the British Medical Association that he has put up firm proposals. Those proposals have not yet been considered by the Government, and the Government members themselves are worried. For confirmation I refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 14th May, which points out that, at a joint party meeting of Liberal and Australian Country party supporters, members strongly pressed the Minister for Health to give details of his scheme and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> had to go to his aid at that meeting. The members of the Government are in distress. The British Medical Association, whose form has been well exposed, is also fooling the Government. It will agree in principle with anything that any government likes to put up but when it comes to administrative details and the machinery provisions, it will be found that there is no co-operation from the British Medical Association. I venture to say that this fourth kite will come crashing to the ground and the first to have a shot at it will be the chemists. </para>
                <para>I invite the Minister to reply to the four charges of lack of frankness that I made against the Minister for Health in this chamber on the 23rd March and to which the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> made no reply, although he spoke immediately after my speech. What proposals has the Minister for Health made? Has he Cabinet authority for all or any of those proposals? Why hold secret conferences? Why not make statements to the Parliament? When will he make a statement? When will the States be consulted? What is the Government&#39;s intention regarding the existing pharmaceutical benefits scheme in which some 200 doctors are co-operating, writing 40^00 prescriptions a month for tens of thousands of people? Is it to continue or to lapse?  Those are some of the questions I ask the Minister to answer and I do not want him to tell me that the whole answer is that an agreement has been reached at last between the Government and the British Medical Association. Everybody knows that that is purely a pose for to-day&#39;s debate and will be thrown overboard to-morrow. </para>
                <para>In all my criticism of the meanderings of the Federal Minister for Health, I do not include officers of the Department of Health. I know their minds and abilities too well to believe that they would ever have sponsored the harebrained useless schemes that have been thrown around this country. I invite members of the Government to give some thought to public opinion.

                            <para>- The Opposition has not taken this action in order to discuss the health of the citizens of Australia. Its action is in direct conflict with the promise of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that the Communist Party Dissolution Bill would be considered with celerity to-day. It is common knowledge that, at the present moment, negotiations are in progress, and are being brought to fruition, for a national health scheme. The action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> to-day may have been inspired by pique, seeing that he himself struggled in a quagmire from 1943 to 1949 without producing any health scheme acceptable to the people, whereas the present Government, after being in office for only a few months, is on the verge of producing a scheme that is acceptable to the medical profession, as well as to the chemists and the nurses, and all those whose cooperation will be necessary if the scheme is to function. When the Labour Government&#39;s legislation for the inauguration of a national medical scheme was before the Senate in 1948, I moved that the bill be withdrawn and redrafted after the Minister for Health had consulted with the medical profession, the nurses, the dentists, the chemists and the friendly societies, whose co-operation is essential if we are to have a medical scheme that will really work. Labour Ministers derided the proposal, but it is beyond my understanding how sensible people can believe that a health scheme will work effectively and efficiently without the cooperation of those persons upon whom reliance must be placed. While the time of the Senate is being wasted on this discussion, outbreaks o&#39;f lawlessness are being caused throughout the land by Communists who wish to delay, if they cannot defeat, the Communist Party Dissolution Bill, which has been designed to deal with them. It is more than a coincidence that the tactics of the Opposition in this chamber are also designed to delay, if not to prevent, the passage of that bill which the Government believes to be vital. I have finished. My colleague, the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper),</inline> will have something to say, and I trust that we shall then get on with the business before the Senate, the vital legislation to deal with the Communist menace. </para>

                        <para>. - It is extraordinary that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> has not been able to utter one word in defence of the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> or in contradiction of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> ha3 said.  His  failure to do so proves beyond doubt the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that the Government&#39;s national health scheme is so obscure that even leading Ministers know nothing about it. The minds of the people are greatly concerned over the failure of the Government to implement a national health scheme, which is of the utmost importance to hundreds of thousands of Australians; yet the Minister for Trade and Customs suggests that the subject is not worth the time that will be taken to debate it, even though that time will not be more than three hours. Honorable senators have repeatedly asked Ministers what is being done to put a national health scheme into operation, so that the people may obtain some relief from crushing medical expenses. When can the people expect the Government to honour the promises that were made on the 10th December? The Minister for Trade and Customs has made no attempt to answer that question, but has told us, instead, that the entire attention of the Senate must be concentrated on the Communist problem. When the Communist Party Dissolution Bill is disposed of during the next few days, what excuse, I wonder, will the Government then offer for its continued refusal to supply information about a national health scheme? The Government cannot be allowed to thrust the matter contemptuously aside. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> made out a good case, and it is evident that there is utter confusion in the minds of members of the Government. Men and women suffering from illnesses are now subjected to an almost intolerable financial strain. </para>

                    <para>Some years ago, the non-Labour parties, realizing the urgency of this problem, brought out from England experts to advise them upon a national health scheme.

Yet, from 1946 to 1948, its cost increased by 58 per cent. </para>

                        said that the costs of other hospitals had increased to an even greater degree. A similar problem confronts us in Australia. The cost of hospitalization in this country is increasing rapidly. Because of increasing prices - about which the Government intends to do something some day - it is now impossible for the ordinary Australian citizen to afford a period of illness. He cannot afford to pay for an operation or for skilled medical attention without incurring a burden of debt that will hang around his neck for years. We ask the Government to give the people some relief. The matter is so important to the people of Australia, that the Government must do something about it. We are now in the midst of a period of prosperity, when our people ought to be able to afford to pay for medical attention, but they are unable to do so. What will happen if a recession occurs and unemployment is again prevalent? It has been said from time to time that the two sections of the community that are well cared for medically are the very rich and the very poor. I wonder whether honorable senators opposite know how well cared for are the very poor people ? Those of us who have to attend out-patients&#39; departments of hospitals know how forbidding those places are. We know that although we have received medical attention there, we have had to pay for it very dearly in human dignity. Even if it were true that the very rich and the very poor persons in Australia are well cared for medically, the majority of Australians go in fear and trembling that if they become ill, not only will they lose their incomes, but also they will be compelled to meet medical expenses. They know that if they have to go to hospital to have an operation, they will be crippled financially for many years.

                    <para>The members of the medical profession are engaged in a business as are the members of other professions. Some medical practitioners are very good men, but there are others who are unscrupulous, just as there are unscrupulous members of other professions. In one big Australian town now a controversy is raging. The medical superintendent of the general hospital has told the people of the district that they are entitled to receive free medical attention at that hospital, but some unscrupulous doctors in the area have stated that patients cannot obtain attention at the general hospital because there are no beds available there and that they must go into private hospitals. Some poor people, because of their lack of knowledge, and because they have been influenced by unscrupulous doctors, have entered private hospitals and paid large sum3 of money for attention that should be made available to them by the Government. </para>
                    <para>We had hoped that before now a bill for a national health scheme would be presented to the Parliament. We believe that a measure of that kind is one of the most important measures that could be presented to the Parliament. I assure the Government that the people of Australia, who have for long looked forward to a comprehensive national health scheme, will bless the political party that enables them to obtain the best possible medical attention at a cost which it is possible for them to bear. Apart from the question of cost, I believe that there should be a new conception of medical services. Australia is very backward in regard to national health, and particularly in regard to specialist services. The need for the provision of specialist attention on a larger scale has been apparent for a long while. At the present time, a person cannot obtain specialist treatment unless he is able to get into the public ward of a hospital or is fortunate enough to have sufficient money to pay for the services of highly skilled practitioners. We look forward to the Government - if it is capable of doing so - introducing a medical scheme that will cope satisfactorily with the medical problems of the people. In addition to providing for medical attention it should make adequate provision for related matters. I remind the Senate that towards the end of the regime of the Labour Administration, arrangements were made for the provision of a dental service to the children of this country. Why has not that scheme been put into operation in order to enable hundreds of thousands of children in Australia to receive urgently required dental attention? </para>

                    <para>In December, 1943, the then Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Eraser)</inline> held a conference at Canberra with representatives of the Federal Council of the British Medical Association to discuss a report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Social Security. At that conference the representatives of the medical profession were informed of the Government&#39;s intention - without consultation with the British Medical Association - to introduce pharmaceutical benefits legislation, which would require doctors to prescribe on Government forms, from a restricted formulary, and be subject to penalties. The measure thus foreshadowed became law in March, 1944. Li the following June the 4rst of a number of conferences in connexion with the matter was held at Canberra. Both the Minister for Health at that time, and the then Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> were present. After an outline of a complete national health service had been given, the Federal Council of the British Medical Association enunciated the following three principles that it considered to be indispensable, and which it desired should be incorporated in any legislation&#34; or agreement with the profession: (1) Preservation of the existing doctor-patient relationship; (2) Lie free choice of doctor; and (J) that  private practice, general consultative and specialist, should continue within and without hospitals. I understand that agreement was not reached at that conference. However, the then Treasurer made it clear that the aim of the Labour Government was to introduce a. nationalized  medical health scheme. At the conference  be  said - </para>

                        <para>As a responsible Minister of the Cabinet, I inform the conference that a  plan  has been laid down which includes a  number  of the things that have already been done, and provision for thu future, particularly in connexion with tuberculosis, hospitalization  benefits  and treatment, and medical treatment. The stumbling block to the implementation of this plan would appear to be reluctance on the part of the medical profession to co-operate with the Government. It may be that many of our proposals are not likely to prove acceptable. Nevertheless, the Government intends to go ahead wit;; its plans. I hope that it will receive from all members of the community, irrespective of their political colour, what any Government could reasonably expect, namely, co-operation in the achievement of its objectives. I believe that the people of this country as a body, irrespective of political thought, consider that there must be at least some semblance of security for our citizens. If cooperation be not given, we shall have to seek for other means to achieve our object. It will be to the benefit of the medical profession to 6ee that co-operation is given. We may have to di.&#39;card some of our ideas. It is also necessary for the B.M.A. to realize that a static position is not possible in a world of evolution, but that all must move forward. There are in the defence services thousands of members of the medical profession who have never practise!. The Government has sought to have training in the higher professions stimulated by the subsidizing of university courses. 1 hope that after the war the university quotas will be increased and that, if the financial position be favorable, subsidies will continue to he {riven. Out of that pool will emerge a considerable number of medical graduates, who, after the war, will be pledged to give their services to the Commonwealth Government for n period of years. </para>

                    <para>It is abundantly clear that a nationalized medical service was the objective of the then government. The medical profession assumed that that government intended ultimately to introduce a medical scheme which had been fully nationalized. The 1946 election was held  shortly  afterwards, and at that election a referendum of the people was taken on the desirability of amending the Constitution to authorize the Government to provide social services, including pharmaceutical benefits, sickness and hospital benefits, and medical and dental services for the people, which, however, included the proviso &#34; but not so as to authorize any form of civil conscription &#34;. At the election Labour was returned to office with a substantial majority in both Houses of the Parliament, and the referendum concerning social services was carried. In the new La&#39;bour Ministry <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> was given the portfolio of Minister for Health. It would appear that during his occupancy of that office he was unable to make any further progress towards introducing a national medical and health scheme than had his predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> I understand that a conference was held in April, 1947, to discuss the provisions of the new Pharmaceutical Benefits Act, which was intended to replace the 1944 legislation, and that act was ultimately passed in June, 1947. However, it contained many of the objectionable features  of the 1944 legislation, although subsequently the penalty provisions for doctors who infringed the act were withdrawn, and instead the Governor-General was authorized to impose penalties by regulation, which was even worse than the original proposal to provide statutory penalties. </para>
                    <para>In the few minutes that remain to me I point out that nearly three years after hostilities had ceased, out of approximately 7,000 practising doctors, including some thousands who had served in the defence forces, only 150 co-operated with the Labour Administration by using the Government&#39;s formula and prescription forms. That number included government medical officers and all known Communists in the profession, which indicates quite clearly that of the younger doctors who the Government had hoped would be enamoured of the scheme practically none were in favour of it. In the previous Parliament the Government, although it had a majority in both Houses, could do nothing towards evolving a practicable national health service. When the present Government assumed office it found that it was hampered by two  useless acts, that the medical profession was openly hostile to the previous administration, that the pharmaceutical profession was somewhat cynical because of the failure of the Labour legislation and that the friendly society movement was worried because it felt that Labour&#39;s activities might destroy it. It is evident that the success of a national scheme depends finally upon the co-operation of the medical profession, not only in the interests of the profession itself, but also in the national interest. The two examples of nationalized health services which &#39;.ave been supplied by Labour&#39;s experiments in the United Kingdom and in New Zealand are far from encouraging. In England the scheme cost &#163;167,000,000 i.u 1946, when it was introduced, &#163;308.000,000 in 1948, and &#163;450.000,000 in 1949. For the five months that have elapsed of the current year the revised estimate of the cost is &#163;484,000,000. In New Zealand the actual cost also greatly exceeded the estimate. It is clear that the money that is necessary to finance the national health schemes in each of those countries will continue greatly to exceed the estimates. No government objects to spending money on a national health scheme that can be properly administered and will give the public proper benefits. However, it has been shown that in the two countries mentioned the introduction of a national health scheme has meant that those who should receive the first priority in any such scheme have not received the full benefits to which they are entitled, and that the implementation of the schemes has cost much more than was estimated. Tremendous waste and inefficiency have characterized the nationalized health schemes of Commonwealth countries, and the experience of the people of those countries strongly supports the need for a new approach to a national health scheme in this country. It was clear, therefore, that the present Government had to start from scratch, because the only previous scheme was based on nationalization. </para>

Despite the honest and earnest efforts of the Labour party to introduce a national health and medical benefits scheme for the benefit of the &#34;people of Australia, that very important and delicate matter has been subjected to all the heat that accompanies discussion of party political matters. The anti-Labour parties&#39; willingness to approach the medical profession, and their success in inveigling them into political controversy, even to the extent of inducing some of them to speak from public platforms, has resulted in all sorts of controversial political matters being introduced that have nothing to do with the health of the people of Australia. The consistent policy of the anti-Labour parties to introduce controversial political matters into consideration of national health was carried a stage further in January this year, when the present Minister for Health said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Labour says that, come what may, and however tortuous the maze through which it will have to travel, may be, when it returns to office a national health service will be introduced for the people  of Australia. Furthermore, Labour believes that the whole system of social services must be based on a national health scheme. The people whom we represent include those with large families, who will be the first to be affected by any inflationary or deflationary trend. They are always worried about the possibility of sickness in their families and the expense that they will have to bear in consequence. A great deal is said from time to time about the need to free our people from the fear of being in want. A married man who is trying to rear a family is always worried about the cost of treatment for the sickness of members of his family, and he can never be entirely freed from that fear. All national health schemes should be aimed, not merely at alleviating the financial distress caused by sickness, but also at leading people to have confidence and to accustom them to visit doctors regularly so that they may obtain the benefits of modern medical science. Therefore, I felt sorry when both the Ministers who have taken part in the debate so far referred to their sense of frustration, and to other matters that have disfigured their conduct in the last few weeks. The provision of an adequate health service is important, and I believe that the people want the Government to do something, instead of staging sham fights and gagging debates in the House of Representatives. The majority of the people do not care whether or not a board is to be appointed to control the Commonwealth Bank, or whether that board is to consist of one, ten or 50 members. However, they are anxious to know what will happen to the cost-of-living spiral, and to a national health scheme. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> made an unfortunate reference to Labour&#39;s plans to socialize medical services. When will members of the antiLabour forces realize that the election campaign is over? They criticized the previous Labour Administration because it had not introduced a national health scheme. However, the two Ministers who have taken part in the debate know perfectly well that the previous Government was not empowered, under the Constitution, to nationalize health services. They also mentioned that the scheme introduced by Labour would interfere with the liberty of the subject. How could it interfere with the relationship between doctor and patient, and the community&#39;s right to choose their doctors freely ? I can go to my doctor  in Western Australia, quite freely, and under Labour&#39;s scheme all- that would happen is that I would pay only half his fee, and when I visited the pharmacist to have my prescription dispensed I could obtain the medicine free of all charge if it came within the Government formulary and was prescribed on a government form. How would such a procedure conflict with the rights of the people ? The question has been asked : &#34;What did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> do that the present Minister for Health has not done?&#34; The answer is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> when he was Minister for Health, laid down a scheme with fear of some and with favour towards none. He made public in the Parliament everything that he did. As the honorable senator has himself pointed out, although the present Minister has flown kites all over Australia, he has not come before the Parliament in  order to tell the representatives of the people who will be most concerned, that is the sick and suffering, what is happening. Behind closed doors, he has conducted all sorts of negotiations with the vested interests of Australia. I do not want to drag this matter into the realm of party politics. I have the greatest sympathy for the Minister for Health or anybody else whose task it is to formulate a national health scheme. The British Medical Association has led its members into a morass. I believe that general practitioners throughout Australia deplore the fact that their federal body has projected them into a political controversy. I have talked with several doctors about this matter. Some of them have expressed genuine grievances u bout the Labour Government&#39;s national health scheme. They have a perfect right to offer such criticism, and to seek rectification of the anomalies they consider to exist; but, generally speaking, they favour the scheme and would welcome its full implementation. Their only quarrel is with their leaders, who, as I have said, have led them into a political fight. If the Minister for Health finds that, because of the opposition of the British Medical </para>
                    <para class="block">Association or any other section of the community, it is impossible to introduce a national medical scheme, he should be honest enough to say so in this Parliament. We, on this side of the chamber, would have every sympathy for him, and would offer to him whatever co-operation he sought. When Labour sets its mind on a reform, it will support any government that seeks to introduce that reform. Whether Labour is in office or in opposition, I, for one, shall be prepared to support any equitable national health scheme; but we want something better than a scheme that will provide against only from  5  per cent, to S per cent, of the sicknesses that afflict our people. It is necessary not only to provide the means of curing sicknesses when they occur, but also to encourage people, particularly women who to-day especially are always worried about budgets, to seek medical advice from time to time and take advantage of the vast store of medical knowledge that has been acquired over the years. I appeal to the Government to make a statement to the Parliament on its national health plans, even if it is only an admission that, so far, it has failed to obtain the co-operation of the organizations that are essential to such a scheme. There is no disgrace in a failure as long as one is honestly trying to do something for the betterment of the people. If the Government is honest enough to admit that it has failed, it will gain the admiration of the people of this country and of the Labour party for its frankness. Such an admission would be far better than a continuance of the Government&#39;s present secrecy about the whole matter. When I go back to Western Australia and attend meetings, I have to admit to questioners that the Parliament has not been taken into the Government&#39;s confidence in connexion with the national health scheme and does not know what is going on. That is wrong in principle. A continuance of the present disputes and suspicions can only do further harm to the national health scheme which already has been thrown into the political arena. I appeal to the Minister, even now, to make a clearcut statement on the Government&#39;9 proposal. Again I assure him that he will have the sympathy of the Labour party in the problems that he is facing. </para>

                    <para>Only two honorable senators opposite have participated in this debate so far. Whether that is because the case made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is unanswerable, I do not know. The history of the Government&#39;s national health scheme has been one of&#39; muddle and confusion, statements and retractions. Arguments have not been confined to the medical profession. Dentists, chemists and friendly societies have been drawn into the controversies. Expression has been given to the views of almost everybody except the common people of Australia, who, after all, are the most concerned in any health scheme and who, through their social services contributions, will have to pay for it. It is the duty of every member of this Parliament to find out when the Government is going to do something. Why should  an attempt to obtain information about the Government&#39;s proposal be described as delaying tactics? Health is of major importance in our national life, and we on this side of the chamber have a perfect right to bring this matter to the notice of this Parliament and the people. Surely, in the various reports of the Social Security Committee, of which the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> was a member, there is ample information on which to establish a national health scheme without continuing the seemingly endless consultations, discussions and arguments that have been going on since the Government was elected. Statement has been followed by retractions, and a wordy battle has been carried on between the Government and the various organizations that are concerned with a national health scheme. In the various announcements about the proposals of the Minister for Health. I have not seen any reference to the peculiar problems of country people and country doctors. No mention has been made, for instance, of payments in respect of mileage travelled by country practitioners in the course of rendering their service to the community. Nor, apparently, has any provision been made to meet transport charges incurred by outback patients who have to travel long distances to visit doctors. Responsibility for the administration of the national health scheme is to be saddled on various agencies such as the friendly societies. Are these agencies to compete with one another? What will happen to the 200 or more doctors who co-operated in the Labour Government&#39;s pharmaceutical and medical schemes? Why is it necessary, merely because there has been a change in government, to alter a scheme that had the approbation of the people of the Commonwealth? Surely, if a scheme is good, _it should be retained whether it was initiated by a Labour government or a nonLabour government. The claim that a new plan is required  is only foolish procrastination. The Labour Government&#39;s scheme would have operated well had it been supported by the British Medical Association. Now it is to be thrown overboard. Not one adequate reason for the abandonment of that scheme has been offered bv the Minister for Health or by any Government supporter. However, if new plans are to be formulated, the Minister for Health could well consider the incorporation of some of the features of the medical services scheme now in operation in Tasmania. Under that scheme, salaried or subsidized doctors provide a medical service in remote areas. That is an important consideration in any plan that has for its object the raising of the health standards of all the people in all places, and not merely those of some of the people in some places. In Tasmania, area doctors are providing a service in distant forestry settlements, mining fields and other isolated regions. They are doing a splendid job. Consideration could he given also to an extension of the bush nursing service, which is so valuable to residents of the outback. That service could well be improved and extended. There is a need, too, for the provision of travel facilities for country people who cannot afford to visit the cities or large provincial towns where specialist services are provided. The Government of Tasmania has shouldered the heavy burden of providing air travel for necessitous patients at such places as Flinders Island and King Island. Patients are brought to Tasmanian hospitals either in Launceston or Hobart. Air travel is provided also to carry patients from Tasmania to hospitals on the mainland. </para>
                    <para>If the Commonwealth Government is sincere in its professed desire to provide a comprehensive health services, some attention should be paid to research. In this connexion I refer again to work of the Social Services Committee. In addition to the Minister for Repatriation, that committee included <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> C. Barnard, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold,</inline> the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maurice</inline> Blackburn, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> A. Perkins, and the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr., Ryan).</inline> The report of the committee made on the 1st July, 1943, is comprehensive. I insist that if the Government had taken into consideration recommendations made by this committee a greater part of its troubles could have been ended and the foundations laid for an acceptable health service. Among the recommendations made by them was one railing with the provision of medical servi pps for remote areas which now have difficulty in maintaining even one medical practitioner. The committee advocated a full-time medical service for such areas. I bring this to the notice of the Government so that even at this late hour that provision for the outback might be included when the scheme -is finally approved. </para>

                        <para>. - The motion is of very great importance and affects a great number of people throughout Australia who are receiving benefits at present under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. According to the threats that have appeared in the press and as a result of the bungling of the Government, it appears that those people will be deprived of the service that they are receiving unless they arc prepared to be conscripted into friendly societies. It is all very well for some people so say that this scheme should he administered by the friendly societies but many people do not want to become members. Up to the 10th December when a conflict was raging about the national health scheme, the members of the British Medical Association complained that they would be conscripted. The same argument can be applied to those who would be forced to join some type of friendly society if they wanted to obtain medical benefits under the national scheme. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> said that nationalization of the medical profession was planned under the Labour Government&#39;s legislation but the Minister knows very well that that legislation incorporated a specific provision that the health scheme would not authorize any form of civil conscription. The High Court decided that under that provision doctors could not be forced to write a prescription on a prescribed form. That should clear the minds of the doctors of any possibility of conscription of their services. </para>

                    <para>Two hundred doctors have voluntarily joined the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and are prescribing 40,000 prescription? a month or between 400,000 and 500,000 a year. Those doctors have not been conscripted. They came into the scheme voluntarily and in conjunction with many doctors in hospitals and institution? throughout Australia have shown conclusively that the scheme introduced by the Labour Government can be successful. I have discussed with a number of chemists the negotiations that have been referred to in this debate and I have found that they are happy about the scheme that is now in operation but which i? threatened by this new long-winded and nebulous project which has come to honorable senators through the press in bits and pieces. The chemists are not happy about the new proposal but they find that the scheme which was introduced by the Labour Government is working satisfactorily. Doctors who are prescribing under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act are able to supply to people who are paying social services contributions something to which they are justly entitled. Every time the national health scheme and pharmaceutical benefits are mentioned, those who support the Government quote the English and New Zealand schemes. Inevitably, they select the worst features of. those schemes for comment. They talk of people who obtain wigs and never wear them hut they do not speak of the enormous benefits that those schemes have given to the people of the countries concerned. </para>

                            <para>- The benefits are worth the cost. Honorable senators opposite measure everything by pounds,  shillings and pence. While they have that approach to every aspect of life, there will never be any social justice in this country. Health cannot be bought. Money can only assist towards health. The people of Australia have contributed &#163;100,000,000 to the National Welfare Fund and they are entitled to some benefits for their money. Those benefits should be distributed as equitably as possible. I have heard quoted the case of a doctor working under a national health scheme in another part of the world who was receiving &#163;20,000 a year for fees. It is simple to quote the unscrupulous doctors who would impose on his fellow men and on the Government, but they are the exception to the rule. When children were to be evacuated from London to protect them from bombing- it was said that they would only put coal in their baths. They were prejudged. All these things must be given a trial, and the people must learn as they go along. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme has been used as a political football and, as a result, neither the people nor the doctors have been able to give it a fair trial. The Labour Government prepared a scheme which it considered to be equitable. The fear of the doctors that they were to be conscripted was cleared away by the High Court. Two hundred doctors cooperated voluntarily, the chemists were satisfied and people who are known personally to me have benefited. Their incomes have shown the benefit of the scheme, and their health has improved by the removal of fear of the prospect of sickness, but the bungling of the Government is undermining the little that has been gained by the Labour Government&#39;s legislation and nothing concrete has been given in return. </para>

                    <para>Those people who are in receipt of medical benefits at present should be consulted and advised as to what they are to have in return. Are they to be offered only compulsory membership of a friendly society? Will the chemists have to alter their present plans? What is the policy of the Government? Honorable senators on this side of the chamber, as representatives of a big section of the Australian people, want to know the facts so that they can pass them on. Honorable senators opposite raise the bogy that the Opposition is using delaying tactics against everything that is brought forward. This chamber is an open forum for members, and honorable senators are entitled to express their opinions on matters of national importance. Any charge that this is not an important issue is part of the attempt to keep a smoke screen before the Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 and to cover the mistakes and the bungling of the Government which attained office by false pretences. The whole field of health in Australia has been given the closest consideration. Recently I heard an authority on industrial medicine liken the present setup in Australia to the stone age. He said that Australia was not keeping in touch with developments in other countries. Judging by the progress that is being made by the Minister for Health, the Government will get nowhere in a long time. It seems that the main object of the Minister for Health is to try to reach a compromise which will be neither one thing nor the other. The people who should benefit most should have access not only to life-saving drugs but to all healthgiving medicine. This is a matter of great importance to the people, and I hope that the Government will sort out its ideas on the subject. Honorable senators should be advised of what the Government has in mind, not only regarding the disposal of the money in the National Welfare Fund, but also regarding the Government&#39;s national health proposals. </para>

                        <para>.- The last thing that any honorable senator on this side of the chamber would say is that the health of the people is not of the first importance, but I think we are justified in claiming that no good purpose is served by bringing the subject up for discussion at this time. There is on the notice-paper one bill that has reached the committee stage, and another, consideration of which has barely begun. No effective action regarding a health scheme can be taken until those bills are out of the way. We shall then be able to concentrate on legislation to implement a national health scheme. We  &#62;hall be able to discuss it, and, if necessary, amend it. During the debate which was initiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> honorable senators opposite have spoken as if a concrete national health scheme were actually before us. </para>

He has been working to obtain the co-operation of the various interests whose goodwill is absolutely essential if any national health scheme is to work.  His  method has been in direct antithesis to that of the Labour Government which sought to impose a scheme on the medical profession, saying, in effect, &#34;Do this, or else ! &#34; We want to avoid the possibility of a repetition of what happened in the Northern Territory when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Webster</inline> was dismissed by the Labour Government for making public the appalling state of the nationalized health service in operation in the territory. That is the sort of thing the doctors feared might happen to them under the Labour Government&#39;s proposed national health scheme. That is why the Minister for Health has had to calm their fears, and also the fears of the public. He has been working hard to achieve the greatest possible amount of co-operation with the medical profession and the chemists. Eventually, legislation will be brought before the Parliament providing for a scheme that will have the approval of all the interests directly concerned. Then we shall be able to take some really effective action to provide a medical service such as the people want. They have not been able to get such a service hitherto because of the obduracy of the Labour Government in insisting on provisions which would enable it to nationalize the medical profession. This Government will introduce a national health scheme that will work, and will demonstrate the administrative bankruptcy of the Labour Government which, for eight years, tried to implement a national health scheme, and failed. </para>

                    <para>The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;Sullivan),</inline> replying to me on behalf of the Government, was on his feet for about three minutes, during which time he said not one word about public health. Apparently, he was not in a position to do so, because members of the Government have no information at all about what their own Minister for Health is doing. They are even more in the dark than are member** of the Opposition. The Minister did not attempt to answer even one of the questions that I posed. Neither the Minister for Trade and Customs, nor the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper),</inline> could utter one word in defence of the Minister for Health or of the Government. One can readily understand why. There is no answer to the charges made hy the Opposition. The Minister for Repatriation filled in his quarter of an hour discussing matters relating to the development of a national health service.  His  speech was interesting, but there was nothing new in it. We have heard it all before. He mentioned the nationalization of the medical and dental professions. Surely, he must remember that the Labour Government, in 1946, when asking the people in a referendum for power to legislate in respect of medical services, put these words into its proposal - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is sufficient to dispose of any suggestion that it was intended to nationalize the medical or dental professions, whether doctors, nurses or persons belonging to auxiliary bodies. Indeed, the High Court went so far as to hold that the Government, under that power, could not even tell a doctor on what piece of paper he should write his prescription. The Minister, in talking about the fear of nationalization of the medical profession, was like Don Quixote tilting at windmills, even a.=) the British Medical Association is now doing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> is obviously not in the confidence of the Minister for Health, because he said that no proposals had been made by the Minister. As a matter of fact, I have a fourteen-page memorandum prepared by the Minister, and. laid by him before the British Medical Association. But I can understand that Government supporters know nothing of these matters. They have not been taken into the confidence of the Minister for Health, nor, indeed, has the Government itself. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Repatriation, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton,</inline> both charged the Labour Government with having made no progress in national health schemes. Let me remind honorable senators of some of the things that were achieved by the Labour Government. First, I mention the vast tuberculosis scheme initiated by the Labour Government in full cooperation with the States. It was evolved, not by the States, but by the Commonwealth, and was submitted to the States, and accepted by them. It is now being put into operation at a cost of approximately &#163;2,000,000 a year. That was a major contribution to the health of this country. Have the members of this Government anything, even in their heads, to match it? Have they anything to match the establishment of a Division of Child Health of the Department of Health? Can they match the establishment in the University of Sydney of a Chair of Child Health, fully endowed and maintained by the Commonwealth? Can they match, even in their thoughts, the establishment in that University of a unit of industrial hygiene to study all the diseases and ills that afflict men at their work? Can they match the establishment of acoustic laboratories throughout the Commonwealth to look after, not only deafened ex-servicemen and women but also deafened school-children and to provide them with free hearing aids? What can they show us in the matter of performance? What has the Government done in regard to immunization? </para>

                            <para>- The Government has been in office for six months. We made provision for the supply of prophylactics against diphtheria, whooping cough and goitre. We were on the point of launching a vast scheme under which all children in this country under sixteen years of age would have their teeth cared for freeof charge. What has the present Government done in regard to that matter? It has not had even one consultation with the dentists since it took office. The present Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has only one portfolio, to which he can devote the whole of his attention, but what has he produced? He has flown all the kites to which I have referred, and he will continue to fly them. He is, to use the words of a leading article that appeared recently in a newspaper, &#34; Headed for the Rocks &#34;. I invite honorable senators opposite to consider the vast record of thought and achievement in the broad field of national health of the Labour party, and, in future, to be as silent upon that subject as they have been this afternoon in defence of the Government and the Minister for Health, and in the face of the allegation that the Government has no health proposals even in mind. I have never known such a frank confession by members of Government parties of utter ineptitude and lack of knowledge of what a Government is doing as that which has been exhibited this afternoon by honorable senators opposite. Although they have had the fullest opportunity to contribute to this debate, they have not said one word in defence of the Minister for Health or the Government, or in answer to the questions that I have posed and the allegations that I have made. </para>

                            <para>- I gather that honorable senators opposite would like to know what the Labour party has done to relieve the financial plight of the people. We conceived a pharmaceutical benefits scheme designed to help the sick and suffering of this country and to cover all the medicaments that they needed. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Act is on the statute-book, and regulations have been made under it. The scheme has been operated with complete satisfaction by nearly 200 doctors in the community. If honorable senators opposite will refer to the regulations made under the act that were published on, I think, the 19th November last year, they will find in them the fullest details of Labour&#39;s medical benefits. I invite them to make an intelligent criticism of it on some future occasion. That is our scheme, and it can be read from start to finish. I venture to say that, in the long run, if the present Minister for Health will labour on the trail and the Government will address its mind to the problem, we shall come back to that scheme, because it is designed to serve, not the interests of one section of the community but the interests of the people of Australia as a whole, leaving doctors, dentists and others completely free to co-operate if they wish to do so, or to stay out if they so desire. </para>

                        <para>. - The Communist Party Dissolution Bill, with which we are now concerned, deals with a very serious matter, and deals with it by very serious steps. The broad purposes of the bill are, first, to destroy communism in Australia, and, secondly, to remove Communists from key positions in trade unions and in the Public Service. With those particular purposes the Labour party is in complete accord. The Australian Labour party is the greatest force in Australia against communism at the present time. It is the force that has waged unrelenting war against communism. It has done so not only by word but also by deed. When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> introduced the measure in the House of Representatives, he was good enough to refer to a resolution of a conference of the Australian Labour party, which condemned communism in unqualified terms. The Prime Minister referred to a conference of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labour party. I propose to quote from a resolution adopted at the level of the federal conference of the party, and I shall place before the Senate the words of the most important part of that resolution, which is binding upon every branch of the Australian Labour party and upon every member of it. I propose to read clauses 1 and 2 of the resolution. The third one is not relevant, but if any honorable senator thinks that there may be something in it that he would like to hear I shall be pleased to read that also. The resolution was as follows: - </para>

We therefore declare that the Autsralian Labour party, through its branches, affiliations and members must carry on an increasing campaign directed at destroying the influence of the Communist party wherever such exists throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">There could be no better definition of the attitude of the Australian Labour party than the words of that resolution. Furthermore, I remind the Senate that that resolution was adopted as long ago as September, 1948. It represents the uncompromising stand of the Australian Labour party on communism. But the Labour movement has not been content with words alone. I propose to occupy a few minutes of the time of the Senate to tell them briefly of ten acts that were performed by the previous Labour Administration in order to demonstrate that Labour is not content with words, but is also prepared to fight against communism. I refer, first of all, to the Approved Defence Projects Act, which was passed not very long ago by the Parliament. At the time that act was introduced a boycott against work on the long-range weapons project in South Australia had been mooted by the Communists. Labour met that challenge, branded it for what it was, and introduced legislation which was speedily passed by both Houses of the Parliament, and which imposed the most, severe penalties on any one who interfered with that project. The point which I interpolate now is that, although that legislation was introduced to combat the attack launched by the Communists upon the long-range weapons project, it applied to everybody in the community; it did  :not merely select the Communists or the Australian Communist party. In accord.ance with the rule of law, it had broad general application against any one in the community who sought to interfere with that project. I refer next to the Kemira Tunnel dispute, which occurred about twelve months ago, and during the ;time when I was Acting Attorney-General, in the unavoidable absence of the right honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt).</inline> A dispute was generated between the miners&#39; federation, which was Communistled at that time, and the great Australian Workers Union, about which body should undertake the Kemira Tunnel job, and work was held up. The Chifley Government intervened, and after seeking, and obtaining, the co-operation of the Government of New South Wales, legislation was passed by the National Parliament and by the State Parliament to deal jointly with the Communist threat. Under a joint arrangement, it also provided for the&#39; appointment of an arbitrator to settle the dispute according to recognized principles of conciliation and arbitration. </para>
                    <para>My third point concerns the action taken by the Chifley Government against three members of the community who were prominent members of the Communist party, and had said things about what -would happen if Australia were invaded. I was Acting Attorney-General at that time n iso. so that I know the facts at first hand. The Government believed that the utterances attributed to the three individuals were subversive, but it did not judge them upon its own beliefs or suspicions. The individuals concerned were prosecuted according to- the ordinary processes of law in the ordinary courts of the land. Each had the option to select a jury for his trial. One of them, Sharkey, the Secretary of the Communist party, did elect to be tried by jury. He was subsequently convicted by a jury of his fellows and sentenced to imprisonment. Of the two remaining individuals, one elected to be proceeded against summarily. Subsequently, both he and Sharkey appealed to the High Court, and were able to exercise a full right of appeal. However, their convictions were upheld. The third individual, named Healy, who was a prominent Communist in Western Australia, also was prosecuted, but was acquitted. I invite the Senate to consider those three prosecutions as examples of effective action against communism. They indicate the kind of action taken by a Labour government not only in respect of communism but also in respect of every member of the community who breaks the laws of the land by sedition, treason or any activity that is adverse to the welfare of the country. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the fourth example of effective action by a Labour administration to deal with communism. I refer to the coal strike that took place in New South Wales last year, which had most disastrous results to the people of Australia, interrupted the production of coal for seven weeks, engendered considerable bitterness amongst sections of the community, and caused untold inconvenience to many people. As the present Prime Minister was good enough to acknowledge, the previous Labour Administration branded the instigation of the strike for what it was, a Communist conspiracy. With the support of the legitimate trade union movement, the Chifley Government confronted <inline font-style="italic">the Communists,</inline> fought them and smashed the strike. By that act it delivered the greatest blow against the prestige of the Communist party that has ever been struck in Australia. </para>
                    <para>I pass on to my fifth point of action. Honorable senators will recall that the preceding Labour Government did great things for the waterfront. It established the Stevedoring Industry Commission, a body which included representatives of the shipowners and of the wharf labourers and was presided over by a judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. The Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, after a free election, elected two Communists to the commission. Those Communists were not appointed by the Labour Government, nor, for that matter, could they have been appointed by any government. As I have already said, they were elected to the commission by the Waterside Workers Federation. </para>

When it was found that they were sabotaging the work of the commission, flouting its orders and behaving in a manner that was unthinkable, the Chifley Government removed them from office. In fact, it abolished the commission, and both the waterside workers and the shipowners lost the body on which they had been represented, because the Government substituted a board which was not representative of any sectional interests at all. </para>

                    <para>Passing now to the sixth example of effective action by Labour against Communists, I refer to a regulation that was introduced by Labour under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act to deal with the victimization of certain unionists. It is a fact that certain unions were under the domination of Communists, and that nonCommunist members of those unions were harassed and persecuted. When the factwas brought to the Chifley Government&#39;s notice, legislation was introduced to provide machinery whereby any individual who had been victimized in his union could approach the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and, subject to making out a reasonable case to the Registrar, could obtain relief at the expense of the Commonwealth. He did not have to jump a financial hurdle in order to do so. </para>
                    <para>I come now to what was probably the most important blow struck against communism in this country. I refer to the alteration made to the Commonwealth </para>
                    <para class="block">Conciliation and Arbitration Act in July, 1949. The Chifley Government, with the full concurrence of the legitimate trade union movement, altered the law in order to provide the heaviest penalties for malpractices or irregularities in the election of union officials. That &#39; measure dealt exhaustively with such offences. It conferred on registered trade unions the right to go to the Registrar of the Arbitration Court and have him conduct an election of officials. It provided a penalty of &#163;100, or twelve months&#39; imprisonment, or both, for individuals who interfered with union ballots. Any one with intelligence who has surveyed the position will find that union after union, branch after branch and unionist after unionist has availed itself of the opportunity so provided to uproot Communists from the control of its affairs. Communist after Communist has been ejected from union office. Almost the first example of the effectiveness of that legislation was provided immediately after the coal strike in New South Wales last year, when the northern section of the New South Wales branch of the miners&#39; federation, which was under Communist domination, rejected out-of-hand the Communists who had previously led their executives. In addition, that legislation has had one vastly important indirect result. In the interim the Communists have been afraid to fake union ballots, or to carry on the malpractices and irregularities, that formerly characterized their activities. I refer honorable senators to what happened in the Boilermakers Union only a week or two ago. I quote from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Agc</inline> of the 15th May - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Communists who last year secured control of the Boiler Makers&#39; Union by winning all key positions in a two-to-one ballot, lost it yesterday after a fresh vote on appeal. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The legislation to which I have referred brought that result. Had time permitted a. more extensive research, I could have brought to the Senate a most imposing list of branch after branch, union after union, that has had recourse to this legislation to replace Communists with nonCommunists in official positions. Had action under that legislation been allowed to develop a little longer, I doubt whether the Government would have been faced  with the problem of removing Communists from key positions in trade unions. </para>
                    <para>I shall refer to one more point: It was a Labour Government - the Chifley Government - that established the security service, which the present Government favours so completely. This Administration has confirmed appointments made to that organization, and has confirmed its charter. I know quite a lot about that charter, because I had a hand in drafting it. I know that our security organization has a very important function to discharge. Will any honorable senator opposite who has any knowledge of the matter say that Labour failed to attend to the security of this country? The present Government has adopted to the last detail every matter that the Chifley Administration undertook in relation to security. I challenge any member on the Government side who knows anything about security precautions in this country to say that absolutely effective action was not taken by the Labour Administration to weed Communists out of key positions in the Public Service. How that was done I am not prepared to disclose or discuss here, because the information is confidential. However, I issue that challenge to any Government supporter who will follow me in this debate. The debate will continue for days and there will be ample opportunity for any one to take up that challenge. So much for the actions of the Government ; I return again to the ten points in our record of action against communism by referring to the action of the Australian Labour party in setting up industrial groups, in shop after shop, and industry after industry to fight communism on the job. The Australian Labour party has been most active in the field. Members of the Parliamentary Labour party too have been active. During the coal strike last year, members of the then Government, with their Labour colleagues from the New South Wales Parliament, went to the coal-fields throughout New South Wales and Queensland. They were given hostile receptions too in the early days. Considerable courage was required to visit the coal-fields. but members of the Labour party went there and they did a magnificent job in convincing the miners that they were being misled by their Communist leaders. Members of the Labour party also went to the Domain in Sydney and public meeting places in Melbourne. I visited these places myself, and here may I interpolate this comment : I did not see one member of the Liberal party or the Australian Country party on the coalfields or in the Domain in connexion with that disastrous strike. It is true that it was our responsibility. I concede that. We were the Government and the responsibility was ours. I merely record the fact that members of the other parties were not there. I think I have said sufficient about both the line of thought of the Australian Labour party and its actions to give the lie direct to those people who say that the Labour party was an appeaser of communism. The story I have told confounds that allegation, and those who repeat it, as it has been repeated even in this chamber in recent hours, should hang their heads in shame, if not for their false statements, at least for their ignorance. </para>
                    <para>Whilst supporting the broad principles of this bill which I outlined at the commencement of my speech, namely, the destruction of Communists and their eradication from key positions in trade unions and in the Public Service, we, on this side of the chamber, are in direct conflict &#34;with the Government on the methods that it has chosen to adopt to fchieve these ends. At the outset, putting on one side what we all understand as a well-known concept of British justice, there are certain rules of natural justice that are recognized by every court in the whole of the British Commonwealth, and in every civilized community. I shall read them to the Senate. They are as follows : - </para>
                    <para>No man shall be punished - without a trial ; without being given particulars of what is alleged against him; without being given reasonable time to prepare his defence; without, a hearing at which he can face his accusers and cross-examine them ; without an opportunity to be heard with his witnesses in his own defence ; without an impartial trial authority. </para>
                    <para class="block">These principles are enforced by the courts, except on the rare occasions when they are expressly negatived by the legislature. They are applied by the courts of the British Commonwealth even in  relation  to offences by or in relation to members of mere social clubs. That is how deeply ingrained they are in our judicial system. </para>
                    <para>There are two other great principles of British justice which also are  applied  universally by courts except in rare cases where they are expressly negatived by the legislature. The first is the presumption of innocence in favour of an accused person until he has been proved, according to due processes of law, to be guilty. The second is the obligation on an accuser to satisfy the trial tribunal beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of a person accused. In other words, the accused and not the accuser receives the benefit of any doubt about his guilt.&#39; Those are great principles of natural justice and I am proud to say they are principles of British justice. They have been evolved and safeguarded right down the centuries. They have been observed by courts whether of high or low degree. Their importance is that they constitute a safeguard to the individual of his life, liberty, reputation, property, and everything that he holds dear as an individual. In the comments that I shall make on this legislation my most stringent criticism will be made on behalf of the individuals who may be affected by it. The principles that I have mentioned to the Senate may be summed up in a phrase that lawyers understand perfectly - the rule of law. That rule has been revered by lawyers ever since there- have been lawyers, principally for its protection of individuals against arbitrary action by the executive government of any country. The principles underlying that rule have only to be stated to win instant warm approval from every person in the community. People have fought and died to preserve those very principles. Even outlaws in any community have,  intinctively,  a deep respect for laws founded on those principles because they know in their hearts that those laws are based on natural justice - what would be described in the Australian vernacular as &#34; a fair go &#34;. The rule cf !nw has been the subject of discussion by eminent authorities in the British Commonwealth.  Lawyer  members of this chamber will recognize Dicey as perhaps the greatest of those authorities. &#34; The rule of law during war&#34; was the subject of the thesis with which the Bowen prize was won at the University of Melbourne in 1917. It was written, of course, during the 1914-18 war. A foreword to it was written by a most eminent jurist, Professor W. Harrison Moore, under whom I, myself, was privileged to study. Professor Moore, writing while the war was still in progress, foresaw the difficulties of the coming peace. I shall read to the Senate only the concluding sentence of the foreword - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Our danger lies less in the present submission to emergency legislation than in the fear that an inconclusive war with an intensification of the &#34; armed peace &#34; may leave us under the yoke, for the menace of war is hardly less fatal to liberty than war itself. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That is the very situation that exists to-day. Professor Moore, if he were alive to-day - unfortunately he is not - would have used those very words, and with the utmost power at his command, to  describe  conditions to-day. I propose now to say a word or two about the thesis itself. The writer was dealing with emergency legislation under the Defence of the Realm Act, which was the counterpart in the United Kingdom of our War Precautions Act. At page 4 he had this to say - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>Should the almost arbitrary power of the Executive prove to be anything else but temporary, a very great disaster would have befallen the English Constitution. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The man who wrote those things in 1917 was Robert Gordon Menzies, Ll.B. His thesis was an excellent exposition of the rule of law, a brilliant work, that earned him the Bowen prize. How far has the right honorable gentleman departed from those views in the interim! </para>
                    <para>I turn now from my general observations to the bill itself. The first thought that occurs to me is whether this measure is constitutional. In the preamble to the bill, the Government founds the measure on three great constitutional powers. The first is the naval and military defence power, which is necessary to preserve the security of our land; the second is the. Executive power which is not expressed in any way in <inline font-style="italic">tha</inline> Constitution, but which is a power inherent in any Executive to take such action as will preserve its own continued existence. That is a power well recognized by the courts, and the third power is the power to do anything incidental to the execution of any other power. </para>
                    <para>The constitutionality of this bill is not beyond doubt, and for that proposition I have only to refer to the case which concerned the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses in 1943, when the High Court of Australia decided by a majority that regulations made under the Subversive Associations Regulations, effective under the National Security Act, were bad in law as being too arbitrary, too capricious and vesting too much arbitrary authority in the Executive or a Minister. I mention that word of warning. I recognize that whenever a federal government of any colour embarks on legislation, it must always take the risk that the validity of its measure will be challenged in the courts as long as there is a written limited Constitution. As to whether this will be challenged is for other people and, ultimately, is a matter for the court. I express no opinion on it. I merely say there is a doubt. I do not express any opinion on the other proposition as to whether a body such as the Australian Communist party, which is dissolved by statute and declared no longer to exist, can preserve a sufficient semblance of continued existence to test the validity of this act in a court. I am not prepared to venture an opinion as to whether, if it can, it will still be an offence for the Communist party <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> do so under the bill as drawn at present. </para>
                    <para>I shall now review the methods which have been chosen by the Government to achieve the purpose upon which all parties are agreed. This bill does three main 1 hines. In the first place, it dissolves the Australian Communist party, it appoints a receiver of the party&#39;s assets and appropriates its property to the Commonwealth. It completely wipes out the Australian Communist party as a living entity and takes its property and appropriates it. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely describing what the bill does. The bill also follows the members of that party into other organizations which also may be dissolved and have their property similarly expropriated. Thirdly, the bill authorizes the Executive - and I emphasize that, word ; it means the government of the day - to declare publicly certain individuals. The consequences that flow from that declaration under this bill - that the person declared may not hold office in a union and cannot hold a position in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I was thinking of that qualification and I thank the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer).</inline> The person declared may not hold office in a key union, that is, in one declared by the Governor-General of the day. The term comprises every&#39; vital union in heavy industry, transport, mining or in any other industry that the Governor-General may declare. It does not allow the union itself to say what is a vital industry. I propose to deal with the three methods, one by one, and I shall take first the dissolution of the Australian Communist party and the expropriation of its assets. In the preamble to this bill, the Government justifies its action by levelling the most serious accusations possible against the Australian Communist party. I can believe that there could be no more serious accusations against any body or organization. I summarize them as the cause <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> revolutionary activity, of seeking the overthrow by force of the established government, of espionage, sabotage, treason, and the disruption of work and production in vital industries. </para>

                    <para>The point to which I draw attention is that each of these acts is a crime under the Crimes Act, with one exception, and that is the disruption of work and production in an industry. That could he made a crime under the Crimes Act, but that has not been done. Those crimes carry the most severe penalties under the Crimes Act. Treason, which is one of the things alleged against the Australian Communist party, is punishable by death. That is how seriously the legislature views treason, and very properly so. The point that I make is that the Australian Communist party, being regarded as a mere organization, cannot itself commit any one of these acts. It can only commit, those acts through its officers, agents and members. Persons have to do the acts in the party which is the entity known as the Australian Communist party. If those individuals were known and were charged under the Crimes Act, the rule of law would apply. They would be given details of the charge, would be faced by their accusers, have the right of cross-examination, tie right to be heard in their own defence, and the important right, if they wished, of trial by jury. The Government has seen fit to &#39;by-pass the Crimes Act altogether and abolish the rule of law in relation to the banning of the Australian Communist party. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not be obscure. I shall state the Opposition&#39;s position quite clearly. I make the point, that if the Government&#39;s allegations are true and it can prove them, then the Government could and should use the Crimes Act and the ordinary processes of law. There can be no answer to that. If the Government merely believes or suspects that its grave allegations in these recitals are true and is not in a position to prove them, I can only say that it must have the very strongest ground for its beliefs or suspicions before it is justified in following the method that it has chosen to adopt. In this bill it proposes to cast aside the ordinary processes of law, brush aside the courts of the land and make itself the accuser, the judge and the punisher. It thus makes inroads on the two great freedoms - freedom of expression and of association. It must have the very strongest ground for its beliefs or suspicions and if it does entertain them, it is relying no doubt on a position which was perfectly set up by Chief Justice <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham in the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses case when he made reference to the philosophy of this particular matter.  His  Honour referred in part to John Stuart Mill&#39;s essay on liberty, which is to be found in volume 67 of <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Law Reports,</inline> at page 131. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That puts the position from the philosophical point of view in perfect perspective. In the light of its special knowledge, the Government has decided that the Australian Communist party is a threat to the continued existence of society as we know it. It makes that decision in the light of the facts that are known only to itself, and which justify the grave allegations that it has made, and therefore the Government must take the full responsibility. The decision is a grave one that no government should lightly embark on ; and only a government can make it. No Opposition could have the facts that would justify such a decision being made by it. The Government has accepted the responsibility of being accuser, judge and punisher of the Australian Communist party, and it is proposing in this bill, not that the Government abolish it, but that the Parliament shall do so. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour Government has shown by its actions that it believed and suspected certain things. When people took action which could bring them to the courts of this land, the Labour Government took them there. I concede that there is extraneous support for the Government in the fact that when it went to the electors of this country it told them unequivocally and plainly that, if returned to office, it would abolish the Australian Communist party and take its property. There is no argument about that. It put the position plainly before the people, and I think there is further support for it in my belief that at least a majority of the people of Australia favour that course. But I add that neither of those factors justifies arbitrary action being taken against the Australian Communist party unless the facts known only to the Government justify that course. </para>

If this bill succeeds in destroying communism - and I say deliberately that I hope it will - then the Liberal-Country party Government is to congratulated. But we believe, as we have stated on many occasions, that the Government has chosen the wrong method to exterminate communism. No law can suppress thought, whether it be good or evil. The only way thought can be suppressed is by killing the thinker, and that is where legislation of this kind ultimately leads one. Any one who denies that denies all the lessons of history. Christianity thrived and grew on persecution, on crucifixion and on martyrdom. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely pointing out how ineffective is repressive legislation in dealing with ideas. The best way in which to make an idea flourish is to persecute it.  Honorable  senators opposite may not be familiar with all the examples of persecution recorded in history, so let us take an example from very recent history. During the last war, Germany, possessing the greatest military might in the world, over-ran France. Before long, an underground movement was organized in France to fight German military power. The organization had its own radio station, and published its own newspapers. The resistance movement was organized, and its adherents were armed, in spite of the efforts of the great German military machine, and when the Allied forces landed in France in 1944, the French resistance movement emerged from its hiding places, organized and fully armed, and was a powerful help to the Allies. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> has ako changed. Neither in the United Kingdom nor in the United States of America, where real trouble has been encountered with Communists, has the Communist party been banned. Canada has banned the Communist party, but the banning is completely farcical, and communism has reared its head in another guise. Only the other day, the Prime Minister of Canada spoke of the futility of banning the Communist party. That has been demonstrated by the situation in the Communist-ridden Balkan Peninsula to-day. The men at the head of affairs in the Communist states in the Balkans are those who were previously gaoled as Communists. There is Rakosi,. the  Deputy  Premier of Hungary, whospent fourteen years in gaol, three of them in solitary confinement, because he was a Communist. One of his colleagues is Vas, who spent sixteen years in gaol. He was sentenced to death as a Communist at the age of sixteen. He was reprieved, and now sits at the right hand&#39; of the dictator of Hungary. Dimitrov, former Premier of Bulgaria, was once banished as a Communist. He returned to Bulgaria at the tail of the Russian, armies, and. became dictator of Bulgaria. I pass on with the comment that, whilst in our opinion, the method chosen by the Government to achieve our joint purposeis futile, we are not opposing it, and&#39; the Government must accept full responsibility for its decision. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the second phase of the bill, that dealing with the banning of affiliated and auxiliary organizations. Of course, conceding the banning of theCommunist party, I concede at once that the Government must be in a position tofollow that party into other organizations which it establishes or infiltrates.- How far has the Government gone in dealing with such organizations? Once an auxiliary organization is declared, it will bedissolved, and its property confiscated. The bill contemplates four classes of such organizations. First, there is the organization that was affiliated with the Australian Communist party at any time after the 10th May, 1948. It may have been affiliated on the 10th May, 1948, but not affiliated on the 11th May of that year. Nevertheless, it would come under the definition to which I have just referred. The second kind of organization is one in which either a majority of members were Communists at any time after the 10th May, 1948, or in which a majority of the executive are persons who were Communists at any time after the 10th May, 1948, even though noother members of the organization are Communists. </para>
                    <para>The third class of organization is one which at any time after the 10th May, 1948, supported or advocated the objectives, policies, teachings, principles, or practices of communism, as expounded by Marx and Lenin. I wonder whether those who were responsible for drawing up- that clause know anything about the objectives, policies, teachings, principles or practices of communism. I have in my hand a copy of the Communist manifesto by Marx and Engels. Some of the objectives in that Communist manifesto would be approved by every one in this chamber, even by members of the Australian Country party. The first is - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>A heavy, progressive, graduated income tax. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That has been the objective of every Australian government during the last ten years. The next objective is - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That would catch every member of the Australian Country party. The third objective is - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>A more equitable distribution of the population of the country. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Surely every one in Australia would agree to that. Finally, we come to this objective - &#39; </para>
                    <para>Free education of all children in public schools. </para>
                    <para class="block">Under this legislation, any member of an organization which advocates or teaches the principles or practices of communism may be proceeded against, and I have just recited a few of the teachings and policies of communism. </para>
                    <para>There are two very bad features in this bill, the first being the retrospective provisions. It is a grave legislative fault that an action which, when performed two years ago, was perfectly innocent according to the law of the land, and carried with it no penalty, should in 1950 lead to proceedings that could destroy an organization or deprive a man of his freedom. The Prime Minister recognized that, and had the grace to apologize for it when introducing this bill in the House of Representatives. I give him full marks for that. The second bad feature of the bill is that the net which the Government is casting to catch organizations associated with communism is too wide. </para>
                    <para>The fourth kind of organization to which the legislation applies is one the executive of which is wholly or substantially influenced by Communists, that is, by persons who have been </para>
                    <para class="block">Communists at any time after the 10th May, 194S. First of all, what do the words &#34; influenced substantially &#34; mean? Let us consider organizations which are not registered under the law of a State or of the Commonwealth. I concede that the provision would not apply to trade unions at thi9 stage, but it could apply to the Australian Council of Trades Unions, and to various Trades and Labour Councils throughout Australia. I invite honorable senators to consider the case of the Australian Council of Trades Unions. Suppose that, in an executive of fourteen members, there are two Communists, and that, in the consideration of ordinary, everyday industrial matters three out of ten motions are moved or sponsored by the two Communists. Would that be interpreted as meaning that the Australian Council of Trades Unions was substantially influenced by persons who are Communists? Such an interpretation could certainly be placed upon it under the terms of this clause. </para>

The real danger that I see in this wide net that can pick up almost every organization in Australia is its effect upon individuals. I shall develop that theme later. I think that, although I have not said all that I have in <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> mind, I have said enough about the auxiliary organizations that can be banned to show that the net cast by the Government can pick up practically every organization in Australia. It certainly could pick up the Australian Labour party, because we have advocated those things. I ask the Attorney-General, who will be charged with the administration of this measure, whether the Australian Labour party is to be banned under it. Is he prepared to say &#34;Yea&#34; or &#34;No&#34; to that, or does he reserve his defence? </para>

Now he has made the wise observation that they are the same but that there is a difference. Again I congratulate him. I believe that the net cast by the Government is so wide that it can, at the will of the executive government, pick up any organization in Australia, without exception. I. could tell the Senate of two kindergarten associations that are influenced in their decisions by Communists. I could name school committees that are influenced in their decisions by Communists. </para>

They will, in fact, make it dangerous for any one in Australia to belong to any organization. Very soon nobody will join a club or organization in Australia unless he gets a certificate from the security service regarding every club member or member of the committee.

                    <para>Concerned as I am with the effect of this bill upon organizations, I am infinitely more concerned with its effect upon individuals. My colleagues and I entertain the gravest anxiety about that. It behoves every man, woman and youth in this country to understand what this measure does. Clause 9, the vital clause dealing with individuals, covers three classes of persons who may be called Communists. They are, first, persons who were, at any time after the 10th May, 1948, members of the Australian Communist party. That is all right ; we shall pass that. The second class consists of persons who, after that date, were members of the four kinds of organizations that I have already discussed. I think I have said sufficient to show that the net is sufficiently wide to pick up nearly every individual in Australia if the government of the day, armed with this great power, likes to exercise it. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has said too much already. Clause 9 provides that the Governor-General may declare a person upon two counts. He must state two things when he declares a man : first, that the man is a Communist according to the definition in the bill, and secondly, that he is engaged in activities prejudicial to the security of the country. Let nobody forget that. The Governor-General does two things: he says, first, that the man is a Communist, and secondly, that his activities are dangerous to the security of this country, or even only that they are likely to be dangerous to the security of the country. That is all that he has to say. I do not want there to be any misunderstanding about the term &#34; Governor-General It does not mean that the Governor-General himself will be involved in this matter in any way. When the term &#34; Governor-General &#34; is used in a bill of this kind, it means, according to the Acts Interpretation Act, the Governor-General in Council. That means the Governor-General sitting with the Cabinet. The Cabinet is the effective Executive Council. It is as well for everybody in this country to realize that the Governor-General so functions effectively when only two Cabinet Ministers attend an Executive Council meeting. It will not even be necessary for the Minister who has prepared a declaration that a man is a Communist to be present. If two members of the Cabinet are present when the  Clerk  of the Council reads the nature of the matters that are to bo considered, and if they say, &#34;Aye&#34; to a list covering pages and pages, that is all that will be required to declare a man. The final responsibility is that of one man - the Minister charged with the administration of the bill. I wonder how many of the electors realized on the 10th December last year that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spicer,</inline> K.C., of Victoria, a candidate for election to the Senate, was to be the man in the Parliament of the Commonwealth who could, with the concurrence of one of his colleagues, in the presence of the Governor-General, declare a person to be a Communist. Is any honorable senator prepared to say that at the last general election the people were told that that position could arise? I point out to the Senate that although the Government had a long time in which to consider this bill, it has been amended by the Government itself. Many of the criticisms emanating from the Opposition have been met. For instance, it is now provided that a man may appeal to the Supreme Court of a State, and the wide powers of search that the Government imported into the bill have been reduced to reasonable and proper proportions. </para>

Put what of the other consequences that will follow? What of the social damnation that will afflict a man -who has been declared publicly to be an enemy of and a traitor to his country? What of the social odium that will attach to him until his dying day, and to his wife and his children? It will be an odium that he will never begin to discard. </para>

If an officer had a grudge against another, or wanted to replace him in his position, he could &#34; plant &#34; Communist literature in his desk and in his clothes. If the desk were searched nightly, the result would be obvious. That public servant could be declared under this measure. Of course the fact9 would look all right to the Attorney-General. That the man was found with Communist literature in his possession would probably be sufficient justification for his being declared. The sole judge would be the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. Doubtless the present Attorney-General is an estimable gentleman. But what a dreadful power to repose in any man! The reputation, indeed the very life of a man and his children would reside in the dictum and decision of one man. I warn the Senate that this bill paves the way for Such actions by persons of evil intent. Under its provisions nobody will be obliged to substantiate his statement about another. The Government should be influenced by the press of this country.

            <para>More than 500 students of the University of Melbourne yesterday vigorously applauded four professors who attacked the Communist Party Dissolution Bill as an implicit threat to freedom of thought and personal liberty. The speakers - Professors K. D. Wright, I. Maxwell, H. MacLean and 0. A. Oeser - described the proposed legislation as &#34; dangerous &#34; and &#34; frightening and in contradiction to the teaching of history. . . . Professor Wright said one clause aimed in effect, at abolishing an organization and then accusing a person of being a member of it. From that viewpoint the placing of the onus of proof on an accused was &#34; devilish &#34;. </para>
            <para class="block">Incidentally, Professor Wright is a brother of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I sincerely trust that the honorable senator will listen to the voice of his brother. The report continues - &#34; Only one person can say if you are a member of an organization, and that is the recording officer. The bill would start off by abolishing him &#34;, he added. Professor Wright said the community would become prey to abuses if the measure became law. Strength would go out of thinking, but what was said now would in future be said behind locked doors. </para>
            <para>When introducing this measure the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;Sullivan)</inline> referred to a view that had been expressed by an eminent prelate in this country about the Government&#39;s approach to this matter. He quoted  His  Eminence&#39;s remarks with approval. I point out that  His  Eminence, in referring to the broad aspects of this bill, was doing no more than commenting on its broad purpose to attack communism and had no reference to the machinery chosen by the Government to achieve that purpose. This statement was included  in an independent Australian Broadcasting Commission news broadcast at 7.45 a.m. on the 23rd May. </para>
            <para>South Africa&#39;s House of Assembly yesterday approved n government proposal to refer the anti-Communist Bill to a select committee. It is hoped that consultation with the opposition  might  produce a united front against communism. Earlier the Opposition Leader, Field-Marshall Smuts, had published an amendment before the debate on the bill. The amendment asked the Government to appoint a select committee, as the present form of the measure gave the Government tyrannical control over political activity through the &#34;onus of r,rn. f &#34; clause.  &#91;Ill&#93; </para>
            <para class="block">So far as I know, it was not published in any Australian newspaper.

I cannot resist referring to one more wholly delightful authority that I think the Senate will enjoy.

            <para class="block">The Labour party is doing its best to make the Government realize that in dealing with one evil it may create another. The Government has two inescapable duties before it. It has the great responsibility of protecting the security of this country, and ako the responsibility and the duty of preserving the very high standard of justice enjoyed in Australia. If it does not face up to those responsibilities we shall degenerate into a very low-class race. Australia will become a country in which no decent man will have pride enough to live. He will lose his pride in his country. I beseech the Government when considering the amendment that the Opposition will move, to have regard to the very strong views that the Opposition has expressed, the need for safeguards, and the feeling of the people of Australia as expressed so strongly by the press of this country. I urge the Government, as Professor Murdoch did, to let us not import into this country the very set of conditions from which many new Australians have just escaped. We should not make them feel ashamed of their new home. I believe that the Government will long regret it if the Government lightly abrogates the rule of law. If the principles of natural justice are disregarded, retribution will follow in many ways. I invite the Government to consider the &#39; arguments that I have addressed to it on my own behalf and on behalf of my colleagues. I have endeavoured to develop my opposition without heat. The Government should heed the reasoned arguments of the Opposition. It should not treat them merely as arguments that have been used because of a political situation. We are gravely concerned to our foundations about the Government&#39;s approach to this matter. In the interests of the Australia that we all love, whether we be supporters of the Liberal party, the Australian Country party or the Labour party, I implore the Government not to make a mess of its treatment of this subject. It should review this legislation and look objectively at the amendments that will be proposed, which, for Heaven&#39;s sake, it should accept. </para>

                    <para>. - I am becoming accustomed to hearing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> commence by telling us that the party to which he belongs proposes to support the measure before the chamber and then devote practically the whole of the remainder of his speech to an attack on the bill. I venture to say that if any one had come into this chamber to-night at almost any stage of the honorable senator&#39;s address, he could not have escaped the conclusion that the honorable senator was opposed to this measure. However, he has stated two or three times that the Opposition is not opposed to the measure, but supports it. The Opposition is going to vote for the abolition of the Communist  party and also for the clause of the bill which provides for the abolition of affiliated bodies and other  bodies  into which the Communists might form themselves. In the long run the Government is asked to believe that the Opposition confines its attack to specific clauses that deal with the onus of proof and the extent to which a person who is declared under the measure is placed under an obligation to prove that he is not a Communist or a member of a Communist body. The preamble to this measure, which has been transmitted to the Senate from another place, contains a number of very serious allegations against the Communist party of Australia. They are allegations that that organization is engaged in operations that are designed to bring about the overthrow or dislocation of the established system of government in Australia; that it engages in activities and operations of a treasonable and subversive kind, and that it directs its activities to the carrying on of strikes and stoppages of work for the purpose of retarding production in this country and of interfering seriously with the operations of vital industries. Those declarations now appear in a bill which has been passed by the House of Representatives, and so far as I know, no Labour member of that House criticized that preamble. At any rate, no Labour member of the House of Representatives voted against the adoption of that preamble. I want to know whether or not any of the Opposition in the Senate will vote against the adoption of the preamble. I will not accept the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that that preamble is solely the responsibility of the Government. It. is not a mere statement by the Government, but will, if accepted, be incorporated in an act of Parliament and will go into the statute-book. It represents the voice not only of the Government but also of the National Parliament of Australia. No member of the chamber, when faced with the question whether or not he shall support the bill, can escape the responsibility of making up his mind whether he approves the allegations made in that preamble. Unless members of the Senate are prepared to vote against the preamble, then we must proceed upon the basis that this chamber, as well as the House of Representatives, has solemnly declared that the statements in the preamble represent the truth, and that the matter of what we propose to do with the Communists must be determined in the light of the allegations of which we all approve. </para>

When one reads, for instance, that Australia is to be withdrawn from the &#34; imperialist war-mongering camp of the Anglo-American monopoly capital imperialists &#34;, that is to be regarded simply as a plain statement that Australia is to be withdrawn from its association with the British Commonwealth of Nations and from association with its kith and kin in the United States of America - and forsooth, we are to do that in order to join with the very people to whom the epithets quoted are most appropriate.

By his interjection <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> agrees that, having regard to the actions of the Communist party, that party should be dissolved out-of-hand. We are satisfied, and, as I understand it, the Opposition is satisfied, that it is the type of organization that we have described in the bill. So, as I understand it, we are on common ground up to that point. We accept the preamble and the conception that the Australian Communist party is to be dissolved, on the say-so of the Parliament, without trial, and without any appeal whatever; and I believe that that is sound common sense. We propose to dissolve an organization that is an enemy to the welfare of this country- </para>

It must be apparent to members of the Opposition that merely to dissolve the Communist party would not achieve the result that we desire. It is quite obvious that those who are at present members of the Communist party will, if nothing more is done about it, simply turn themselves into another organization. They might perhaps call themselves &#34; The Australian Peace Council &#34; ! </para>

                        <para>- I think, ineffectively. That clause is designed to bring about the effect that I am indicating and no other. I cannot but doubt the sincerity of those who say that they believe in the dissolution of the Communist party, but at the same time create all kinds of fanciful objections to a provision that is designed only to prevent the Communist party from functioning in another form. Let us examine the clause. Members of the Opposition accept the fact that the Communist party should be dissolved. Do they think that organizations affiliated with the Communist party should also be dissolved? If not, why not? What is the sense of abolishing the parent body but not abolishing organizations that tire affiliated with it? So, presumably, the affiliated bodies must also go. </para>

The next step is to deal with an organization, &#34; a majority of the members of which, or a majority of the members of the committee of management or other governing body of which, were, at any time &#34; after May, - 194S, and before the date of commence-  ment  of the act, members of the Australian Communist party. In other words, the clause will apply to any organization that is controlled by Communists. </para>

                            might just as well say that we should not abolish the Australian Communist party itself because it has existed since the 10th May, 194S, and that therefore any action taken against it would be retrospective action. In this clause, all we say is that we shall abolish certain organizations, and we define them as being organizations that have been controlled or managed, in the very real sense, by members of the Australian Communist party during the time that that party existed under its present constitution. I do not intend to go through each. of the clauses at present, but I say now that it is fanciful and absurd to suggest that clause 5 will be directed against any organization other than organizations that were affiliated with the Communist party during that party&#39;s existence, or organizations into which the members of the Communist party see fit to enter after that party has been dissolved in order to carry on activities similar to these carried on by the Communist party itself. I confess that

                            disappointed me very much when he tried to belittle a declaration that would be made by the Governor-General. Under clause 5 of this bill, no body can be declared unless the Governor-General is satisfied that it is a. body to which the clause applies, and that the continued existence of that body would be prejudicial to the security and defence of the Commonwealth or to the execution or maintenance of the Constitution or the laws of the Commonwealth.&#39; The Governor-General would make such a declaration on ministerial advice.

                        <para>- It would be made on ministerial advice. It might be the advice of the entire Cabinet; but, in any case, I cannot accept the notion that a responsibility of the Crown such as that envisaged in this clause would be carried out in an irresponsible manner. I do not know whether honorable senators opposite, in expressing their views on this subject, are indicating the manner in which  they  approached their ministerial responsibilities. I hope not and I do not believe it. I ask the Opposition to consider the processes of thought that a Minister would necessarily go through in dealing with a problem of this kind. Is it seriously suggested that any responsible Minister of the Crown who has taken the oath of office would ask the Governor-General to make such a solemn declaration, unless he had the soundest possible evidence to support his request? Every  time a Minister acts in relation to a serious matter of this kind, he must be satisfied that there is on his files, among the material on which he acts, all the evidence that is required to support his signature. </para>

The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> himself, in answer to a question, indicated that certain mistakes Cad been made. For most of those mistakes he himself took responsibility. Under this measure, Ministers will be required to advise the Governor-General that certain organizations come within the provisions of clause 5 and are carrying on subversive activities. I cannot imagine any one on this side of the chamber, or on the other side of the chamber for that matter, doing that unless he was perfectly satisfied with the information on which he was acting. </para>

                        <para>- Quite sure. I shall amplify that statement. For instance, clause 9 deals with individuals who mav be declared. It creates no offence. It merely SH VS that the Governor-General, if he is satisfied that a person is a person to whom the clause applies, and is carrying on subversive activities, may make a declaration to that effect. That is all that happens at that stage. The actual makins of a declaration creates no offence by any one. </para>

                        <para>- I submit that I have quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> quite fairly. I understood him to mean that, during the regime of the Labour Government, if that Government found a man in a key position whom it suspected of being a &#34;Com&#34;, it did not declare him; it did not give him a right of appeal to the High Court or to the Supreme Court as this bill proposes; it just tossed him out. What honorable senators opposite are suggesting in regard to this legislation is that if there is in government employment a man who is believed by the Executive Council to be a person engaged in subversive activities, he must be permitted to continue in government employment,  free to carry on his subversive activities, unless the Government can prove to the satisfaction of a court that he is in fact engaged in such activities. That is the effect of the Labour party&#39;s proposed amendment. There is no escape from that. What the Opposition says is that it is not fair to dismiss from government employment a man who is a Communist and is suspected of being engaged in subversive activity. According to the Labour party, the onus of proof should be on the Crown, and unless the Government can prove that a man is in fact engaged in subversive activities, he should be allowed to continue in his employment, presumably until he engages in direct acts of sabotage for which action could be taken against him. That would be the effect of the Labour party&#39;s proposals in relation to this bill, and I suggest that a government that was prepared to accept such a situation would not be worthy of remaining on the treasury bench. If that is the view of the Labour party as to its obligations in regard to this matter, it is not surprising that the people of this country should have found it necessary to make a change on the 10th December. I shall take another illustration to drive home the point because I am afraid that some honorable senators on the opposition side still do not understand it. Is it seriously contended that if I had in my employment a person whom I suspected strongly of taking money from the till, I would not be justified in questioning that person, and if he could not satisfy me that he was not doing what I suspected that I should dismiss him? Would that be unreasonable conduct? I suggest that that is exactly the course of conduct that members of the Opposition would follow in those circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- Now the attack is changing. I have chosen to deal with the attack made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> As I understand it, that attack centred on the onus of proof. The moment members of the Labour party see precisely where their proposals will lead them, the attack changes.. The complaint then is not this question of onus of proof, but the question of declaration which is another matter altogether. The complaint of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> as I understood it was that the obligation would be thrown on the person concerned to prove that he was not a Communist. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> wanted to substitute for the provisions of the bill, a provision which would enable the person concerned to escape the consequence of the declaration unless the Government could prove the allegations made against him. In other words, suppose that a man in government employment were suspected of being a Communist and carrying on subversive activities and the ultimate state of mind of the judge on an appeal was, &#34; I am not sure whether this person is carrying on subversive activities. He may be or he may not be&#34;. In those circumstances, the Labour party would suggest that the man must continue in government employment. That is a proposition which I cannot accept and I suggest that no self-respecting government could accept it. I believe that the Labour party itself, on reflection, will see that such a proposition is quite unacceptable to any one who is responsible for carrying on the government of this country. </para>

                        <para>- The interjection suggests again that when one objection is broken down, up comes another. The objection first was the onus of proof. Now it is the declaration. Having regard to the nature of the organization named in the bill and the kind of activity which its members are carrying on, it is just as well that the people of this country should be informed authoritatively by their government as to who are the members of the organization. A great deal has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> on this question of onus of proof. He sought to rely on the rule that a man should be presumed innocent until proved guilty and the rest of it. </para>

                        <para>- The reference I am making has nothing to do with the question of law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> made that point in answer to an interjection of mine. He said that when it was found that there were Communists on the Stevedoring Industry Commission, the commission was abolished by the Labour Government. In other words, the Labour Government sacked the members. When I interjected and suggested that that action was taken without trial, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> tried to suggest that I was being very silly indeed. He said that there was no trial because there was no offence. The position under sections 5 and 9 of this bill are precisely expressed in those words. There is no offence. A declaration by the Governor-General carries with it certain consequences. They are the consequences which flow from such a declaration, but the Government proposes to give to the person in respect of whom-the declaration was made the right of appeal to the court. It says to him, &#34; If you can satisfy the judge of the court on the balance of probabilities that you are not the sort of person we have declared you to be, the declaration will cease to have any operation &#34;. </para>

                        <para>- I can quite understand the honorable senator thinking that that was very kind indeed. I could understand him saying that he might think the proper thing to do would be to dismiss such a person out of hand. That comes from members of the Labour party who told honorable senators that they were carrying on unrelenting war against the Communists in this country. Yet they are hanging on tenaciously to the conception that a man as to whom there are doubts whether he is a Communist or not, and whether he is carrying on subversive activities, must remain in government employment to carry on his subversive actions. </para>

That is the effect of the amendments that have been foreshadowed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> I want to make one other observation in relation to this question of onus of proof, because it has been completely torn from its context in the debate. The question that an offence, if there is one, is normally proved by the prosecution is a very good and sound rule of English law. It is one which I would not like to see discarded. But it does not represent all the wisdom  of  English law by any means. The rule operates in its proper place, but it has always been subject to very real exceptions. If I am not boring the Senate  I  shall quote a passage from a legal  work  entitled <inline font-style="italic">Legal Duties,</inline> by Professor Allen, a very highly esteemed and well-known writer on legal subjects, who is recognized as being among the most liberal  of  the legal authorities of to-day. He wrote on this subject under the heading &#34; Presumption of Innocence &#34;, and stated, at page 294 - </para>

                    <para>One governing principle can, I think, be gathered from the decisions and it may be thus stated : The burden of proof at common law rests where justice will be best served having regard to the circumstances both pub.ic and private. There are some primary and general rules, and these are sometimes required to give way in presence of special circumstances. Judges have, by a process of reasoning, evolved these rules and subsidiary rules which in essence are judicial legislation, and which now govern all judicial tribunals as firmly as if enacted by statute. The broad primary principle guiding a court in the administration of justice is that he who substantially affirms an issue must prove it. But, unless exceptional cases were recognized, justice would be sometimes frustrated and the very rules intended for the maintenance of the law of the community would defeat their own object. The usual path leading to justice, if rigidly adhered to in all cases, would sometimes prove but the primrose path for wrongdoers and obstruct the vindication of the law. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that the difference is so great. The immigration laws are directed against persons who improperly claim the advantage of citizenship in Australia. This bill, in its final analysis, is directed against persons who do not understand the full obligations of citizenship, and seek to destroy the&#39; institutions under which they now shelter. The very principles to which they are appealing now they would destroy immediately if they had the opportunity. Because we wish to prevent them from carrying on their nefarious activities, we have brought in this legislation. I wish to emphasize once again the fact that this is special legislation to deal with a real emergency now facing the country. The legislation is based on the facts and allegations which appear in the preamble, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> and his associates cannot escape the responsibility of either accepting the statements in the preamble or of voting against the bill. If he does not vote against the bill he admits, in effect, that the statements are true. A solemn responsibility devolves on every honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. If</inline> we accept the truth of the statements, it follows logically that the organization attacked in the preamble must, for the security of the country, be dealt with, and the various measures set forth in the bill must be taken in order that we may preserve Australia for those who are entitled to enjoy its institutions and freedom. </para>

                    <para>.- The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> devoted a great deal of his time to attacking the Labour party because we admitted that, when we were in power, we either sacked Communists from the Public Service, or removed them from employment in which they might endanger the safety of the country. The Attorney-General tried, to show that what the Labour Government had done in that connexion was the same as the present Government proposes to do under this legislation, but he confused the issue, whether deliberately or not. I had experience of this sort of thing in administering my own department. When I was convinced that a Commonwealth employee was likely to constitute a danger to the safety of the country, I either had him sacked, or had him removed from the employment in which he might do harm. That was a matter between him and me. He was still able to obtain employment elsewhere, perhaps even in some other branch of the Commonwealth Service. We did not deny him the right to work. Under this legislation, however, the Government proposes to publish the name of a declared person in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette,</inline> which circulates all over Australia. He will be branded as a subversive person, and yet Government spokesmen say that it is not proposed to do anything to him ! We know that if such a person gets employment elsewhere it will not be long before the calumniators get to work. The character assassins will attack, and that man will probably not be able to get a decent job all the rest of his life. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,&#39;</inline> in an extraordinarily fine exposition of the feelings and views of the Australian </para>

                        <para>- They believe him, but for political reasons they deny it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> showed that, throughout the years, the Labour party has been the only organization to attack the Communists consistently. Notwithstanding this, our political opponents have stumped the country in an attemptto tie the Communist party to the Labour party. When Marx wrote his first thesis upon which the revolutionary Communist movement was founded, his first words were : &#34; I hate all the gods &#34;. Atheism and communism go together. All decent men abhor the principles of communism. The Labour party has fought communism more successfully in recent years than has any other organization. I brand the Communist Party Dissolution Bill as a piece of political stunting by the Government. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has deliberately run away from his stated policy, and this bill has been brought in for the political advantage of the LiberalAustralian Country party coalition Government. Honorable senators will recall the manner in which the bill was introduced in the House of Representatives. In every newspaper there were advertisements paid for by the Liberal party calling on the public to listen to the Prime Minister&#39;s speech on the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. Every door and window of Parliament House, except the front door, was locked so that the Prime Minister&#39;s person would be safe. In order to get to our accustomed places, we had to enter the building by the front door through a phalanx of security men and attendants. However, when the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> introduced the bill in the Senate, and it was identical except for nineteen amendments, there was no locking of doors or windows. Apparently, the person of the Minister for Trade and Customs is not nearly so important as is the person of the Prime Minister. Honorable senators will recall the packed galleries in the House of Representatives, and the theatrical atmosphere. When the Prime Minister finished his second- reading speech, he laid his papers on the table and said, in effect : &#34; This is the answer. This finishes the Communist party. As from to-day, the Communist party is no more &#34;. The press of the country took the matter up next day, but since then some of the newspapers have come to realize how wrong the legislation is. The Prime Minister introduced the bill six months after the Government had come into office, but it was just two days before the Queensland State election. The timing was perfect, a9 has been the timing of everything the Prime Minister has done since he took office. In everything that he has done he has sought to gain votes for his party. We remember that before the by-elections in New South Wales, he abolished petrol rationing. We are all agreed that communism must be fought, but the Prime Minister has used the Communists in an attempt to gain political advantage. The Labour Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon,</inline> stated clearly where his  party stood on the Communist issue, and he was returned at the recent State election. Immediately after the Prime Minister introduced this bill, the Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hollway,</inline> jumped onto the band wagon, declaring that he supported the measure. He declared that if he were returned to power, he would sack all the &#34; reds &#34; in the Victorian Public Service. He had been Premier for some years, and had not sacked one &#34; red &#34;. All the anti-Labour premiers attack the Communists at election time, but between elections they do nothing about the matter. The personal integrity of the Minister for Trade and Customs stands very high, but in this connexion he has gained no marks. He has attempted consistently to tie the great Labour movement to the Communist party. He has said to-day that during the last eight years we have been cheek by jowl with the Communists, although history proves that we have fought them al every turn. No one knows that better than does the Minister and other honorable senators opposite, who are even only reasonably well-informed. When au honorable senator on this side of the chamber related how we had fought the Communist party, the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> said, sneer.ingly. &#34; That will be the day &#34;. Tor the last twenty years the non-Labour parties have endeavoured to create a Communist fear complex. All that Australian Country party speakers talk about on the street corners of country towns is the Communists - the men in the cities who tie up industry, who want to collectivize farming and do in Australia all the things that have been done in Russia. They say that the Labour party is the Communist party in this country. In Sydney yesterday I saw Liberal party banners that referred to the &#34;Labour-Communist party&#34;. To my mind, the real reason for the introduction of this legislation is that the Government believes that it will gain a political advantage from it. </para>

This great document, this brain child of the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister, as it has been described by the press of this country, was presented with all the pomp and ceremony that normally accompanies a coronation.

                        <para>- The Prime Minister, in the House of Representatives, read a list of 53 Communists. The persons to whom the right honorable gentleman referred were the really bad Communists. They were the ones who had to be dealt with if this country was not, as it were, to sink beneath the sea. They were hanging on trees, ready to be plucked. Almost immediately, the right honorable gentleman, in a public statement, had to revise the list that he had read. We have not in this country a security service in which I have complete faith. The events to which I have referred justify that lack of faith. For an hour and a half the Prime Minister enthralled the people of this country with the wonderful story of what the Government was going to do to combat the Communists. It must be assumed that his speech was checked and doublechecked in an endeavour to ensure that every statement in it was completely accurate. He read a list of 53 Communists. Included in the list was a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Ticehurst,  who was described as the  President  of the Newcastle Branch of the Transport Workers Union of Australia. A week before the right honorable gentleman made his speech, the Newcastle transport workers stated publicly that if a Communist union was represented in the May Day procession in that city they would not drive a truck or a wagon in that procession, yet he referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Ticehurst  as the  President  of the Newcastle Branch of the Transport Workers Union. The truth of the matter is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ticehurst</inline> had been removed from office four years - not four months - previously. We shall have to depend upon a security service that undoubtedly provided the Prime Minister with inaccurate information. It is had enough to have to put up with a security service in war-time, but it is worse in peace-time. My personal experience is that a security service is too often a refuge of the coward. What he cannot prove  he states. I remember that in the early part of the war I tried to discuss one or two cases with the security service, but I was told on each occasion, &#34; This is a security matter ; it cannot be discussed Later I referred to other cases of men who I knew had been treated wrongly, and I was given the same answer, but I refused to accept it. It is true of all security services that when they cannot prove, they make statements. </para>

                    an American magazine, published the interesting story of an American G.I. who married a German girl and brought her to America with him. When she reached Ellis Island she was stopped by officers of the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service. Standing on their war-time rights, they would not say why she had been stopped. They said that she was not a fit person to enter the United States of America and that she must leave. She was given a reprieve twice. Then the newspapers learned of the story of this girl, Ellen Knauff. A special House Judiciary Committee of the American Congress investigated her case. They found that she had worked with the Royal Air Force during the war and with the United States forces after the war. The theory was that a jealous rival for the affections of her husband had spread false rumours about her. The House Judiciary Committee fumed when the Department of Justice refused to state a case against her. All that they could discover against the girl was a letter from a former Attorney-General to an  un-named  friend in which it was said that the Department of Justice was convinced that Ellen Knauff was a paid agent for the pre-Communist Government of Czechoslovakia while she was working for the United States forces. Congress passed a law to enable her to be admitted to America as an American citizen. Before the law could become operative, an appeal that she had lodged with the Court of Appeal was dismissed. Within twenty minutes of the dismissal of the appeal, the immigration authorities put her in a motor car and took her to La Guardia airport, her trunks having been packed, with the intention to put her on an aeroplane going to Germany.  Her  attorney rushed to the judge who had decided against her, and. in view of the circumstances, she was given another reprieve. The judge, Justice Robert Jackson, said -

                <para class="block">The point is that once these things start they are not run only by Ministers. Do not let us delude ourselves. They are sometimes run at very low departmental levels, and, because of the iron curtain that hides security activities, when Ministers ask what is happening to certain persons they are told, as I was told during the war, &#34; It is a security matter , we cannot discuss it with you &#34;. The case that I have quoted shows how the administration of the laws of a country can be removed from the control of the government. I am referring to the congress of the United States of America, a powerful democratic establishment. Even after it passed a law to keep this woman in the country the Department of Justice tried to .put her on an aeroplane bound for Germany, in order to defeat the democratic set up of the country. Nobody can have complete faith in a security service, because it cannot be perfect. We have teen how M.I. 5 in the United Kingdom fell down on its job. Similarly the body established by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Edgard  Hoover in the United States of America did not accomplish its purpose. I By and large we must be careful. I  admit  that during war-time it is essential that a security service should have wide powers. However, during the last war, Labour made a tragic mistake.  which  affected the lives of many people. We cannot  run  away from that fact. The Australia First movement, which the Australian security service harassed, comprised men who were able to prove their complete innocence so far as the safety of Australia was concerned. We know how the security service worked in North Queensland. My opinion is that a list of Italian cane-growers was compiled and almost every second man named on it was interned. In another instance, a man who was  overheard  to make a certain remark when drinking freely in a hotel in the Riverina was grabbed and thrown into a concentration camp, where he remained for a number of years. On another occasion a city man sold an interest in his business to two refugees. When it became evident that they wanted to run the business other than in accordance with his views, he made representations to a man, who is now a senior Minister in the Government, and those two refugees were placed in a concentration camp. 1 stress, that  unless  great  care  is exercised, these things will recur. The Prime Minister has said that we are not, in a technical sense, at peace. That  seems  to be the Government&#39;s excuse for establishing a set-up that will endanger the things that men and women have fought through the years to safeguard and develop. Despite the right honorable gentleman&#39;s assertion, we encourage the Russian buyers to bid our wool up at the auction sales every week, so that they can establish a stock-pile. The price of rubber in Malaya has risen 300 per cent, in twelve months, because of Russian buying. If the Prime Minister honestly considers that a war is imminent, why do we continue to sell to the Russians the necessities of war? The truth is that the right honorable gentleman knows that the prospects of war materializing are fading as the days pass. This completely political approach to the matter has earned very great disfavour amongst every section of the Australian community. Bishop Moyes, of Armidale, in a letter that was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline><inline font-style="italic">Morning</inline><inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> recently, stated - lt is obvious that Communists are doing what they can to disrupt Australian industry and that they cannot be allowed to do this as a first step to further disruption. But it is essential that in seeking to defeat them we should not deny the principles of our way of life and thus give them a victory. For the Australian  Commonwealth  to develop an or ler that has even faint resemblance to the police state of totalitarian countries, with its huntin;.&#39; for victims, is to give communism ite first victory. For we shall be adopting its methods and using Satan to cast out Satan. That could only mean that communism had already debauched our way of life. It may be replied that in order to break up this subversive group it is expedient to make people accused of being Communists prove their innocence. Expediency is a  treacherors  guide. It may bring short-term success, it always brings long term disaster: and the violation of an accepted  axiom  of British law, that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty, for the sake of the immediate safeguarding of our security, may lead to untold trouble in the future. The <inline font-style="italic">history of</inline> Europe in the last 20 years- is sufficient evidence of the danger of expediency as a guide. </para>

                        <para>- That is where the honorable senator is in error. In this citadel of Canberra, some honorable senators are out of touch with what many people are thinking. When one moves around amongst the great masses of the people and talks with them in trams and buses he finds that there is a fear of this legislation. Ninety per cent, of the people agree that the Communist party must be banned but all disagree with the methods suggested by the Government. I think that the Labour party will vote with the Government on this measure although its members know that in order to make it effective certain other things must be done automatically. The people of this country know full well that when the antiLabour parties banned the Communist party previously, that party did not in fact disappear. For the first time in the electorate of Hunter, a Communist candidate did not forfeit his deposit by polling an insufficient number of votes at the general election. The Communists got their impetus in other forms. </para>

                        <para>- To make a ban effective it would be necessary to turn this country into a police state, in which officials would have the right to open letters and go to the front doors of people&#39;s homes at night and take them away. Those are the methods that are used in Communist-dominated countries throughout the world. It would be  necessai y  to do in Australia what Stalin does in Russia, and Tito in Yugoslavia, in order to make a ban effective. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has said that it is not possible to kill an idea unless the person who thinks it is killed. Under this measure the Government will bear an obligation to do certain other things which lead finally to concentration camps and to prison walls studded with lead. Although supporters of the Government have always won the wordy battle against communism, they have not yet embarked on the battle of action. It is the men who attend trade union meetings night after night that will in the long run defeat communism. It will not he a short, sharp battle, but rather a long and severe grind. Communists must be beaten gradually and firmly as our people become educated about their activities. The Opposition will support the second reading of the bill. In doing so it will say in effect, &#34; This is the mandate that the Government got from the people. Put it into operation quickly and show the people of Australia that the supporters of the Government are men of action rather than men of words and straw&#34;. The people of Australia must be shown in a tangible way that the Government parties are sincere in their desire to ban the Communist party. </para>

                    <para>. -  I rise to support this bill, because probably it will be the major legislation introduced by the Government during its term of office. The Communist party has done more to disrupt conditions in Australia than has any other political party in the history of this country. To-day that party is at times supported by various members of the Labour party. Recently we had in Australia a person known as &#34; The Red Dean &#34;. </para>
