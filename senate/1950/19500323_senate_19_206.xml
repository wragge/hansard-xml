            <para>A committee was set up by the Australian Transport Advisory Council on the 25th July, 1040, to consider and recommend uniform national road traffic laws for the Commonwealth. The committee, which is known as the Australian Uniform Road Traffic Code Committee, comprises one representative from the former Commonwealth Department of Transport, who is chairman, as nominated by the Commonwealth Minister for Transport, one representative from each State,as nominated by the State Ministers for Transport, one representative of both the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory, as nominated by the Commonwealth Minister tor the Interior, and one representative of the following non-governmental organizations associated with road transport: - The Australian Automobile Association, the Australian Road Transport Federation, and the Trans- port Workers&#39; Union of Australia. </para>
            <para>Delay in convening a meeting has been due to awaiting the nomination of a representative from Western Australia. Advice has, however, been received that a representative will be nominated on 24th March, 1950, and when this is received a meeting &#39; will be arranged at an early date. In the meantime, considerable preliminary research work has been undertaken by the former Commonwealth Department of Transport, and business papers for the meeting have been prepared and are in readiness for circulation to representatives. </para>

            <para>Tt is proposed to establish an automatic telephone exchange at Launceston, hut the installation cannot be  effected  until a new building is provided to accommodate the equipment. A site has been acquired and plans are being prepared for a multi-storey building. It cannot be indicated at this stage when the work is likely to be undertaken, but the honorable senator may rest assured that the matter will bc expedited as much as possible. In order to meet telephone development in the meantime, the manual exchange at Launceston will be extended and exchanges have been provided at Launceston East and Mowbray Heights. </para>

            <para>- It is true that certain portions of the War Service Moratorium Regulations were declared invalid by the High Court. I think it is also true that since then in most of the States provision of a character similar to that which applied under the federal regulations has been made. Recently an amendment of the federal regulations was made to enable the States to give complete effect within their own territory to laws of their own operating similarly to those which previously operated under federal jurisdiction. I do not know if those new regulations have been proclaimed, but provision has been made for them. </para>

            <para>- I preface my reply to the honorable senator, by saying that hearing aids are being made available in this country to returned soldiers who have suffered deafness from war causes. That type of aid is now being manufactured in this country at the Commonwealth acoustics laboratory in Sydney. Parts which are being assembled there have been brought to Australia under licence. They are from the best types of hearing aids in the world, and a very good type of hearing aid has been evolved. It is less costly than those that are entirely manufactured in Australia or imported complete,&#39; and is designed to suit the varying degrees of deafness. The question of whether these aids could be made available to school children suffering from deafness is a matter for the Minister for Health, to whose notice I shall bring the honorable senator&#39;s question. I shall let the honorable senator have a report on it as soon as .possible. </para>

          <para>. -When I sought leave last night to continue my remarks at a later stage. I had been discussing certain statements that hadbeen made by the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay).</inline> The Minister had dealt in an authoritative manner with certain aspects of shipbuilding in this country. One of his statements was that a vessel built in a private yard at a cost of approximately  &#163;500,000,  would cost  &#163;700,000  in a socialist yard. The Minister sought completely to mislead the Senate by citing these figures. </para>

            <para>- That is so, but I consider that when a Minister speaks in this chamber on an important matter such as this, he should endeavour to stick to facts and. to give honorable senators reliable information. It is wrong for any honorable senator to convey false information by juggling figures or by any other means. Shipbuilding costs in this country have varied considerably for manyreasons. At Whyalla in South Australia, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">Limited has built a modern shipbuilding yard that is a credit to Australia. That yard is capable of producing fine ships. However, I remind honorable senators that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited also owns steel works, and&#39; therefore has ready access to raw materials required for shipbuilding. In addition, it was able to proceed with the construction of ships without interruption. The Minister referred to a shipyard in Melbourne that is owned by the Melbourne Harbour Trust. That shipyard was engaged mainly upon the repair and construction of dredgers and also upon work for the Navy. Consequently, when it undertook the construction of a ship for the Australian Government, work upon the ship was constantly interrupted. As a result, the completion of the ship was delayed and the cost of construction was increased. If the shipyard had been in a position to secure some continuity of the work of construction, the cost of the vessel would have been much less than it in fact was. I remember that two vessels of the same class, the specifications for which were identical, were built at Cockatoo dock in Sydney. The work upon the two vessels began almost simultaneously. The construction of the first vessel proceeded without interruption, and the job was completed in eighteen months, but work upon the other vessel was constantly interrupted because naval craft required urgent repairs, and the job took three years to complete. The result was that the second ship cost  &#163;100,000  more than the first one. That was not the fault of the shipbuilders; it was due to the emergency that then existed in Australia. The shipbuilders were compelled to interrupt their work upon the ship and do more urgent work that was required to be done. I have made those points because I consider that it was unfair for the Minister to pick out figures and then to say, in effect, &#34; This is an example of how a socialist organization does the job. Let us compare it with the successful activities of private enterprise&#34;. Tactics such as that are unfair, and I have taken advantage of this opportunity to correct the statement that the Minister made. </para>

            <para>- I cannot accept that. The honorable senator must not accuse the Minister, even by inference, of deliberately misleading the Senate. If his point is that he misunderstood the Minister, I do not think there is any reason for him to withdraw the remark, lit is quite possible for a  speaker  to make a statement and for those who are listening to him to misunderstand him and to be misled. That is one thing, but it is quite another thing for an honorable senator to say that a Minister has, knowingly and deliberately, misled the Senate. If an honorable senator does that, he must withdraw his remark. </para>

            <para>- It was probably an unfortunate coincidence. I think that I am in order in directing the attention of the Minister to an inaccurate statement that he made last night. The Minister said that he had been supplied with information by the Joint Coal Board to the effect that in 1939 11,100,000 tons of black coal was won in New South Wales, compared with 11,700,000 tons in 1941, and 10,700,000 tons in 1949. I have before me the <inline font-style="italic">Monthly Bulletin of Australian Production Statistics</inline> compiled by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics, which reveals that 9,9S7,000 tons of black coal was produced in New South Wales in 1938-39; 9,973,000 tons in 1939-40; and 11,737,000 tons in 1948-49. </para>

            <para>- It is all very well for the Minister to shelter behind that explanation. The fact remains that he told the Senate that certain conditions applied in Australia. If the Minister was misinformed, he should take up that  aspect -with his department. However, in fairness to my colleagues sitting on the Opposition side of the chamber, I consider that I should draw attention to inaccurate information supplied to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- It has been very worrying to the Opposition to observe &#34;the state of affairs that has developed on the coal-fields, particularly in New South Wales, during the last few months. Whenever I have directed the Minister&#39;s attention to the position that was developing he has suggested that with my help he might be able to get somewhere. Of course that is very flattering to me. It is very nice for one to- know that even when he is sitting in Opposition he can do something to help. It is particularly flattering when it is remembered that only a few months ago members of the Australian Labour party were designated by honorable senators opposite as a crowd of socialists who were trying to destroy Australia. Now, however, the Government is not only prepared to accept our help, but is also eager to have it. I therefore cannot resist the thought that honorable senators opposite do not completely lack a sense of responsibility. </para>

        <para>During the last ten years a tremendous loss of coal-production has- been caused by strikes and absenteeism, and because the pits have been closed frequently. Although I have detailed figures before me I shall not weary the Senate by citing them at length. However, each year during that period between 400j000 and 500,000 man-hours have been lost in the coal-mining industry. In the early stages of the war, in 1941, the Labour Government decided to try to bring peace to industry by the introduction of new methods. A special coal reference board was established. Judge DrakeBrockman, as  chairman,  an employer, and an employee constituted the board. Because it heard the miners&#39; claims fairly and quickly the judge was accused of appeasement - a somewhat constant cry from honorable senators opposite. Things were very &#34; sticky &#34; in those days, but we were not able to get all of the coal that Australia required. Even in 1943, which was our best year, we were not able to overcome absenteeism, and strikes. We subsequently appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> C. Willis, a man who had been a Labour Minister in New South Wales and a miners official, chairman of the board. Even then we were not able to get the production that we wanted. Not only was it difficult to have decisions made, but it was also difficult to have those decisions carried out. In a. time of great stress we appealed to the miners&#39; leaders to assist the Government to increase production. Both the leaders and the miners undertook to try to discipline their own members. However, it was then found that some miners&#39; lodges were not  prepared to send delegates to meetings. We were therefore not able to do all the things that we wanted to do. We tried fining the men, but that did not help very much because other men came out in sympathy with them. We tried putting men into the Army. Of course, I realize that honorable senators opposite will say, &#34;You did the wrong thing. You appeased them &#34;. But after putting them into the Army we had to let them out again, because we were unable to obtain sufficient men to go into <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> pits. All those things were happening during that time. My mind goes back to a commission held in 1930 under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Davidson. A report on the coal mines of that time was made but little was done. In 1946 the same judge under another commission made a recommendation to the Parliament that there should be some kind of dual control over the coal mines. He suggested that the Government itself should take control of the policy of the mines and should give general direction, but that private enterprise should be responsible for winning the coal. That has been tried. The Joint Coal Board was set up with the assistance of the Australian and New Sou th Wales Governments and has been in operation for three or four years. In passing, I want to pay a compliment to the  chairman  of that board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. K.</inline> A. Cameron, a man who took on a very thankless and difficult task and. performed it very well. I regret that he has now found it necessary to leave that work for another appointment, and&#34; compliment him on the manner in which lie accomplished his arduous task. </para>
        <para>Now a point has been reached that, despite efforts to carry out what the Davidson report suggested for dual control, it has been found that the arrangement has not been a success. The Minister would be the first to say that the method of getting coal in Australia at present is not successful. It is impossible to get what the nation requires. What is to be done? Is the coal-mining industry to drift along as it is doing or is a return to be made to the arrangement that was tried years ago ? Does the Minister think it is possible to do what the coal-owners did in 1929 when the miners were locked out until they were forced to surrender? If any good is to be achieved in the coal-mining industry, very bold steps are necessary. I want honorable senators to appreciate the attitude of the coal-miners, and the bitternessthat is in those men. Theirs is a task different from that in which 99 percent, of the workers are engaged. Theminers go away in the morning and descend into a hole in the ground. Most of the mines are dusty, dirty, hot, dark,, and lonely. The air is stagnant and the miners feel that they are closed in. There they work in twos and threes for six or seven hours a day, until eventually they come up again into God&#39;s sunlight. In. those holes in the ground all the bitterness of the ages is perpetuated. Theyoung men learn from the older miners the bitterness that is in them. They hear about the happenings of twenty years ago when the miners were locked out from their living for eighteen months,, when the coal-owners themselves disputed&#39; and disregarded arbitration and, throwing it aside deliberately, cut the miners&#39;&#34; wages by 12&#163; per cent. The men werelocked out for eighteen months before they crawled back to their jobs. In themeantime there were such riots on thecoalfields that the police on one occasion in an effort to keep order shot and killed an Australian on the northern coalfields. Those are the things that the coal-miners have as a legacy and&#39; a heritage. I have been in coal mines. I know that the Minister has been down a shale mine, which is much the same as a coal mine except that probably the shalemine that the Minister inspected is a much nicer place than are 90 per cent, of the coal mines. Several years ago a member of this chamber told the Senatehow he had gone down a coal mine at Newcastle. He was from Melbourne, and represented the Liberal party <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> the United Australia party. He said heknew what a coal mine was like. He was amazed when he saw nice green lawnsaround the mine and a painted entrance. He went down in a beautiful car with electric lights. He thought that that was acoal mine. It was one of the finest in-, the world, but that is only one. Ninetynine per cent, of them are as I havedescribed them to honorable senators and the conditions are dreadful. I know of <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> mines where the roof is hanging, the dust is 6 inches thick, there is no water, and electric wires are a constant menace. </para>

            <para>- The fact is that many honorable senators do not know the conditions in the coal mines. Many believe, as the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> believes, that there is a Joint Coal Board charged with the responsibility of caring for the men, giving them amenities and providing safety measures and that therefore all is well. I emphasize that the mines are completely run down. It will take years for an authority, even with all the material that, is needed available, to bring proper conditions to the coal mines, but, unfortunately, the Joint- Coal Board, like everybody else, is not able to get materials and cannot do the things it ought to do, and so we have these conditions prevailing. </para>

        <para>There is another great irritant in the coal-mining industry. I mention it because I am sure that many members of the Government parties are not aware of its existence. From time to time the press of Australia contains references to strikes that occur for apparently trivial reasons. I remember that about two years ago the press made great play on the fact that a certain coal mine was idle because a miner&#39;s hat had been stolen and the miners had walked out of the pit as a result. The fact is that every coal-miner wears a safety helmet, which is a very important part of his equipment. If the safety helmet does not properly fit the wearer he can be placed in serious danger in the event of coal falling on him. On the occasion to which I refer, the miner who lost his hat tried to obtain another one, but because there was some quarrel over the fact that the management wished to supply the man with a hat that did not fit him, a dispute followed and the mine was closed for the day. That position was unnecessary, and perhaps both sides were at fault. The management could have given the man a suitable hat, or possibly the men could have overcome their grievance in some other way. Such apparently trivial stoppages have a sound basis, but becau.se they are played up in the press the public gains a wrong impression about them. The press also stated that strikes by miners over taxation were wrong. I suppose that statement could be true, but do not forget that the miners were not the only ones who were striking against taxation. There were men in this community, much more happily placed than the miners, who continually struck against taxation. In my district, when the miners pour the water out of their cans and go home for the day, thereby closing the pits, they walk home past bowling greens and golf courses that are full of people playing games. </para>

            <para>- Those people are not on strike. They are entitled to have a couple of days off because they are more fortunate than the miners. But because the miners take a day off, and. because their work is so necessary to a coalstarved nation, the press tells the people that the miners have no right to strike. Another of the frequent irritants on the coal-fields concerns safety issues, about which the men come into conflict with those who have the responsibility of determining what is safe and what is not safe in the mine. There are frequent disputes on such issues. I can remember one occasion last year, at the Standford Main mine, at which an accident had arisen from a cause that should not have existed. The men came up out of the pit and refused to go back until the matter had been rectified. It was in fact rectified on the day following the stoppage, but the management did not consider it worth while to inform the miners that it had been rectified, and so the men stayed on strike for two days longer than was necessary. Those are the kind of irritations that exist in the coal-mining industry. A few years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Collingridge,  a member of the United Kingdom Parliament, visited Australia. He had been for some years a miners&#39; union official in Great Britain. I accompanied him on an inspection of Australian coal-fields and he told me that not even in England, which has a long association with misery in the coal mines, was there such bitterness between employers and the employees in the industry as there was in Australia. </para>

            <para>- Miners feel that in other industries the manager, and even the directors, will come through the industry and see the conditions under which their workers are employed. In most surface industries the managers take part in the industry, but in contrast to that, the miner works down in the mine and nobody comes near him. He is expected to get as much coal to the surface as he can, but when he himself comes to the surface nobody has any interest in him. The conditions of living in mining towns, whose inhabitants have won millions of pounds&#39; worth of coal from the bowels of the earth, are unparalleled. The directors and shareholders who benefit from the work of the miners live in the big towns and spend the wealth won by the miners in those big towns, while dreadful conditions continue to exist in the mining towns, which have none of the amenities of the big capital cities or big country towns. Yet, because the Joint Coal Board talks about providing amenities in the coal-fields, our friends on the Government side say, as the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport said yesterday, that the miners are always after amenities and always asking for something. If we wish to get more coal in Australia we must adopt a new approach to the problem of the coal-mining industry. It is true that in Australia development and production are being retarded because of an insufficiency of coal. We are reminded day after day that we are short of coal, and we know that during the coming winter there will be many black-outs, because there is not enough coal to keep industry going. Since we recognize those facts, what is the next step that we should take? What can we do to correct the position? Is there not some way that we can try that will possibly get us the coal that we require? I suggest that such a way exists. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Davidson recommended to this Parliament, in a report, that there should be dual control of the coal-mining industry, and that the Government ought ai least to have a say in the general policy and direction of the coal-mining industry, while private enterprise attended to the details. I consider that the Government must have more say in the coal-mining industry. Seventy per cent, of the best coal in Australia is left in the ground. We are frittering away our heritage of coal by extracting not more than 30 per cent, from the seams and locking the remainder away in the ground, never to be recovered, because the methods that are in use to-day in the coal-mining industry are based on the fact that the owners desire to make a profit. Those methods mean, as I have said, that 70 per cent, of the most valuable resources we have in Australia are lost. <inline font-style="italic">All</inline> that valuable coal is left in the ground at a time when the whole nation is crying not for coal. The problem of coal is twofold. Our first need is to conserve our  coal-fields,  our second is to win enough coal to keep Australia going. There is only one way in which that can be done. We shall have continuing bitterness and disruptions in the mines while the miners believe that they are being used for the purpose of making profits for people who are not interested, except financially, in coal mines. I suggest, therefore, that the Government take its courage in both hands and do what the British Government has done to nationalize the coalmining industry. </para>

            <para>- No. I do not desire to be sidetracked about this matter by interjections from the honorable senator. This is a very important problem. If it is a question of private enterprise versus government enterprise let us, at least in this instance, not be swayed by prejudice against government enterprise. We know that both have faults. Some government enterprises have been very costly failures; but have there not been bankruptcies in private enterprise? </para>

            <para>- Yes ; but, invariably, losses incurred by a government enterprise are always played up as evidence of governmental inability to conduct an enterprise. Honorable senators opposite point to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited as a marvellous example of private enterprise. I agree that that company is doing a good job, but many years ago it reached the stage when it became an absolute monopoly in the field of private enterprise. Under those conditions, all of the directors of that organization would be fools if they could not run it at a profit. Nevertheless, let us cite that organization as a good example of private enterprise. But is not the State Electricity Commission in Victoria a good example of government enterprise? I remind the Minister for Fuel. Shipping and Transport, who comes from South Australia, that the Liberal Government of that State appointed a royal commission to report upon the control of electricity services in Adelaide. That commission carefully considered whether such services should be left in the hands of a private company and, later, it recommended that the electricity undertaking in Adelaide be taken over by the Government. The Government accepted that recommendation and that undertaking is now under socialist control. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>So long as private enterprise continues to run the coal mines, we shall always have the difficulties that we are now experiencing in the industry. I repeat that under private enterprise we are losing 70 per cent, of the coal in the seams in New South Wales. If the industry were conducted in the interests of the people, that loss could be obviated ; but so long as it is controlled by private enterprise for the purpose of making profits, that percentage of coal will always be left in the ground. If the Government wants the coal-miners to work for longer periods, in order to increase the production of coal, it must give them some incentive to do so. Production will be increased only when the coal-miners are convinced that they have a stake in the coal-mines. They must be assured that, should bad times come again, they will not be tossed aside as they were twenty years ago. After all, twenty years is not a very long period and the coal-miners have bitter memories of their experiences in the past. They were told that they must abide by arbitration and do this and that as the court ordered, but, later, when things in the industry became a litis tough, the mine-owners said that they would not accept arbitration but that if the miners accepted a reduction of <inline font-style="italic">12i</inline> per cent, in their wages, they would open up the mine:: again. When the miners refused to  accept  that ultimatum, they were starved into submission while the pits v/orc closed down for a period of eighteen months. In view of those facts, what is the natural reaction of the coal-miners to-day when the community is short of coal and the mine-owners tell them that if they go to the Arbitration Court and abide by its decisions they will be given a fair deal and greater amenities? It is only natural that the miners should regard such a proposition with suspicion. They realize that, to-day, they are in a strong position and that the mine-owners are in a. weak position. In such circumstances, when the mine-owners resort to subterfuge and offer a little advantage here or there, the miners do not believe that they are sincere but are convinced that, should the tide turn again as it did 20 years ago, the mine-owners would immediately take those benefits from them. I have been closely associated with the coal-miners and I know something of their psychology. Australia wants more coal and must get it ; but that coal will be obtained only if the Government takes its courage in its hands and convinces the miners that the nation itself wants them to enjoy good conditions, continuity of employment and security for the future. If that is done, the miners will respond whole-heartedly; but the only way the Government can do that is by nationalizing the mines. </para>

My experience of the press has been long, and I have utter contempt for its methods. </para>

            <para>- I shall tell the  honorable senator what it was. In support of my advocacy of the comprehensive social welfare schemes envisaged by the Labour Government I stated that such schemes would destroy the greatest single cause of international strife, namely, man&#39;s acquisitiveness. My story was this : Young men entering industry feel that they should make some provision for the evening of their lives. A social welfare scheme, guaranteeing to every law-abiding citizen, comfort and security is his old age, would destroy entirely the urge to acquire. No longer would people feel obliged to trap every Id. or to take little points on their friends in the belief that they would never know. I said to the pressmen, &#34; When you and I started our working careers, we all had before us the example of our own aged parents or acquaintances who found it necessary to work for their subsistence up to the age of 70 or 75 years. We decided there and then to put by what we could to guarantee for ourselves some sort of comfort and security in later years &#34;. Working people may be placed in three categories. First there are those who, throughout their lives, are imbued with the desire to save money. They become so absorbed in their endeavour that, saving money, instead of being a means to an end, becomes the end itself. These people grow richer and richer, until, in their 60s. or 70&#39;s, they realize that they have plenty of money but have &#34; missed the bus &#34; in life. Secondly, we have those people whose aspirations are denied because of sickness which continually saps their income and prevents them from providing for their years of retirement. The third group consists of people in excellent health who rear splendid families of useful Aus- tralia.il citizens. These people become so absorbed in the struggle to rear their children that they are prepared to make any sacrifice at all in the interests of their families. They too, are unable to provide adequately for their old age. They reach retirement with nothing but a healthy spirit of independence. They would die rather than depend upon their children for sustenance. One effect of our social welfare scheme would be to guarantee economic security for our people in the evening of their lives. </para>

            <para>- That is a fairy tale. There is some literature that I never look at, and I am not in a position to answer that question. One newspaper made my remark the subject of a headline which read, &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator believes</inline> every one should retire at 45 &#34;. I did not say anything of the kind. That is an example of the methods that are used by the press. To be fair, I say that the newspaper that published that headline also dealt to some degree with my claim that a social welfare scheme, by ensuring economic security for the people, would tend to destroy man&#39;s acquisitiveness. It published a few lines dealing with that subject. </para>

        <para>Honorable senators opposite say that I do not love the press. I do not. I know that the members of the Government parties are the tools of the press and that they represent the interests that the press represents. If I had the necessary authority, I should be strict with the press. In fact, I have urged the members of my party to introduce penal legislation providing that when a lie is published by a newspaper - and I point out in passing that retractions of untrue statements are now published only in obscure portions of newspapers - the proprietors of the newspaper should be mulcted of Id. for every copy of the newspaper in which the lie was printed. That would quickly bring them .up with a round turn. The commercial radio stations have been misused and abused in much the same way as has the press. They were used against the Labour party at the last general election. When I point out that the present Government parties had an army of supporters and that we had nobody but our-  selves, honorable senators will realize what I meant when I used the word &#34; dingo &#34; just now. I was ordered to withdraw it, but I used it as a simile. I did not intend to refer to anybody in this chamber as a dingo. Having regard to the forces that were arrayed against the Labour party at the last general election, the result of the election does not provide anything for honorable senators opposite to crow about. During the election campaign it was almost impossible to listen to a broadcast from a commercial radio station for more than ten minutes without hearing some references to the socialistic aims of the Labour party. </para>

            <para>- There is too much &#34; mock &#34; in their democracy. Then, for the first time, the banks were stirred from their lethargy. They had been making annual contributions to the funds of the present Government parties, but last year they were told that they would have to dig much deeper into their pockets and provide the sinews of war on a much more liberal scale than they had done in the past. The banks were organized against the Labour party. They realized that if the Chifley Government was successful at the election, they would lose some of the power they wielded and that probably some authority would make an examination of their activities and accounts. Believe me, there will be a terrible smell when that egg cracks, as it will crack eventually. What has happened recently can be compared with an attempt to stem a torrent with, a straw. The banks poured out hundreds of thousands of pounds. </para>

        <para>In addition, the doctors opposed the Labour party. They want to be a law unto themselves, and they will brook no interference with their activities by governments. The present Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> is beginning to find how recalcitrant and difficult to deal with they really are. Recently I told of the treatment that an eminent medical specialist meted out to me many years ago. He said to me, &#34; You are one of the so-and-sos that are on strike. If I had my way I would shoot you &#34;. * There are some good doctors but, generally speaking, that has been the attitude  of the medical profession. Honorable senators opposite often talk of the miners holding a gun against the people&#39;s head, but I know of no institutions that are more conservative than the British Medical Association and the Law Society. That sentiment will doubtless be echoed by many persons. The anti-Labour parties also received assistance from the pulpit, although spiritual matters should be kept separate from economic matters. The Labour party has been accused of being favoured by one section of religion, but that section did not favour us much last year. On the contrary, it was very active in opposition to tis in Queensland. Another factor that influenced the election result was the psychological effect of the defeat of the Labour Government in New Zealand, which was caused mainly by its decision to introduce a system of compulsory military service in that country. When we consider all the forces that were arrayed against the Labour party at the recent election and compare the strength of the two rival armies, as it were, it will be seen that the members of the Government have very little of which they can be proud. </para>

        <para class="block"> The anti-Labour parties promised to de-ra.tion petrol. It is true that that promise has been fulfilled, but at what a price! It was done at the expense of the dollar-earning ability of the British people. Our political opponents said that that would put value back into the &#163;1. Honorable senators will recall a  very  fine speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> recently on that subject. I formed the opinion at the time that the contention that he advanced was correct, that if the Government was unable to&#39; appease the press there would be a boil-over, and that the Government would encounter trouble in the not far-distant future. Of course there is another way of restoring value to the &#163;1, but I hope that the Government will not adopt it. On the same day that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> spoke about this subject, a Minister said in another place that it did not necessarily follow that value would be put back into the &#163;1 as a result of one particular action. As I am an industrialist of many years standing, I sincerely hope that a brawl will not starton the coal-fields, resulting in largescale unemployment, because I have a vivid recollection of events during the economic depression in the &#39;thirties. During that period value was restored to the &#163;1 in a way that I hope will never again be resorted to in this country. The method to which I refer was adopted at the request of people who were drawing interest on fixed deposits in the banks. They claimed that due to post-war inflation the &#163;1 note was only worth 10s., and they declared that they wanted their interest cheques to represent their full value. The only way that that could he achieved was to stifle business, withdraw overdrafts, and cause a depression. I find it hard to resist the thought that the present Government may contemplate similar action in order to put value back into .the &#163;1. However, I doubt whether this Government could restore the value of the &#163;1 by either method. </para>
        <para>The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> delivered a very fine speech when introducing the Government&#39;s proposed legislation in connexion with child endowment. He foreshadowed what would happen if the Opposition dared to interfere with that legislation. Whilst I shall not give away caucus secrets, I repeat what other honorable senators on this side of the chamber have already declared, that the Opposition will consider the Government&#39;s legislation on its merits. If honorable senators on this side of the chamber are of the opinion that legislation will operate in the best interests of the people of Australia we will pass it unhesitatingly. If, however, we consider that it will serve the interests of only a few people we will vote it out. The Opposition will not be fearful of a double dissolution. Although, perhaps, honorable senators on this side of the chamber did not go to the same, schools as honorable senators opposite, and do not wear the &#34; old school tie &#34;, I remind the Senate that the Labour party is very solid. The Minister referred to decentralization, a subject that was dealt with also by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> and other honorable senators. </para>

            <para>- The trouble with honorable senators opposite seems to bethat they cannot imagine any incentiveother than sordid personal gain - the putting of money into their purses. Some of the finest achievements in this world have been by voluntary effort without thought of pecuniary gain. The kind of incentive that the Attorney-General has in mind is not the kind that has been responsible for the great works and great institutions that have been established in various parts of the world. However, the Minister is more reasonable than one of his colleagues, who thought that I had called him a &#34; dingo &#34;. </para>

        <para>Both the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> and the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> referred to increased costs. The former suggested that there was room for a vast improvement of the housing position. I hope that this Government will be able to make an improvement in that sphere. I remind the Senate that when Labour was elected to office in 1941 about three-quarters &#39; of the housing lag existed then, and the demand for houses was accelerated subsequently as a result of Labour&#39;s successful administration. Much prosperity was achieved in this country during Labour&#39;s regime, resulting in people having money in their purses and a feeling of independence. Many people who were formerly content to occupy only half a house now want a house to themselves. The Government is faced with the necessity for an accelerated immigration scheme, which I sincerely hope will be successful. The Minister for Repatriation implied that Labour had fallen down on its job in some respects. I contend, however, that if the present Government is only half as successful in connexion with the housing problem as was the Labour Government, it will do a good job. He also stated that the Government was importing coal. I imagine how pleased the members of the Cabinet must be because the Labour Government established such a splendid &#34;kitty&#34;. There was a credit of &#163;100,000,000 in the National Welfare Fund, and Australia&#39;s sterling balance in the United Kingdom was about &#163;450,000,000. The Government has a struggle in front of it to get coal at grass. Since 1929 the miners  have never wanted to take the chance of having a lot of coal in stock. In 1940 a strike lasting ten weeks brought the miners to their knees and forced them to return to work; but it also forced consumption of all the coal at grass. Obviously the coal-miners have determined that never again will they be put in the position of building up huge reserves for any government to use as a weapon against them. I wish the Government luck in getting stocks of coal at grass, but I do not like its chance. When the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport was speaking last night, I asked him to give the chamber a comparison of the prices of coal that the Government proposed to import, but without result. Since then I have received some figures on the subject. In the United Kingdom the price of coal is 122s. 6d. a ton; in India, 144s. 8d. ; in America, 74s. 4d. a ton f.o.b. ; in Ceylon, 138s. 5d.; in Canada, 118s. 7d. Australian prices are: in New Zealand, 59s.; in Greta, 33s. 6d. ; in Newcastle, 31s. 9d. ; and in South Australia, 56s. 3d. Those are some of the figures I wanted from the honorable senator last night. The others were the actual production of coal. In 1938-39, coal won totalled 15,750,000 tons. In 1948-49, the total production was 22,100,000. </para>

            <para>- Yes,but with 2,000 fewer men in the industry. Do not forget that. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold</inline> talking about how to get coal. I do not know what honorable senators want coal for. Some honorable senators may have read of Ramsay&#39;s scheme of gasification. I would not expect a private coal-owner to introduce such a scheme. It would be expensive, and it would mean burning coal underground instead of leaving 70 per cent, of it in pillar formation. That method was adopted for a while in the Ukraine until the Germans destroyed the factory. What has happened since then I do not know, but why could not Australia get all the power from the coal in that way? Nothing would be lost and all the by-products would be there. The heat could be transferred through pipes or cylinders all over the country and the holes could be filled with debris. </para>

        <para>I have offered congratulations to most honorable senators on the opposite side of the chamber on their maiden speeches, but I cannot say the same of a diatribe we had from an honorable senator from Tasmania. It was his maiden effort in this chamber, but not his first speech in a legislative chamber. Had I known that, I, as well as other honorable senators, would not have listened to him without making some comment. The honorable senator from Tasmania accused honorable senators on this side of the chamber of everything that was bad, while attributing everything that was good to honorable senators on his side. I think he must be a Johnny Horner, sitting in the corner. It was unwarrantable presumption on his part to try to teach grandfather to suck eggs, and Burns&#39;s lines came to my mind - </para>

            <para>- The Labour party had a lot of voluntary effort and zeal, and idealism. The honorable senator&#39;s side had the cash. I am convinced that honorable senators on the other side do not understand socialism. Fifty years ago, if socialism was mentioned, a vision was conjured of somebody with a sombrero pulled down over his eyes, a cloak around his shoulders and all sorts of lethal weapons concealed about his person, lurking around a corner. It was a hideous picture. Realizing how hideous it was,&#39; the Liberal party revived it. Strangely enough, it was the Liberal party that did the conjuring 50 years ago, but it has boxed the compass since then and encircled the globe. The Liberal party felt that if it could bespatter this hideous picture with a little more mud, it should be possible to win an election. Since 1910 there has never been an election that did not evoke the Socialist bogy. The Liberal party has never had an election without it. This time the bogy was disrobed. The Liberal party excelled itself in painting the hideous thing and the press helped to make it a wonderful work of art. It worked overtime. Honorable senators talk about production depending on more effort. Nothing could have worked harder than th&#39;c Socialist tiger on this occasion, and it had some result. It frightened people who really did not like to be frightened. The Liberal party did not tell the people that this country&#39;s successful emergence from two world wars was due to the fact that socialism was introduced to help to win them. The Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport has told the chamber about certain ships not doing too well. I do not suggest to the Minister that he get rid of his ships. They are costing the country &#163;500,000 a year. Get rid of them to private enterprise and freights will go up so much that the people of Australia will lose not &#163;500,000, but &#163;10,000,000 a year in freights. That actually did happen, and I hope the Minister will be more successful than his predecessor in his efforts. I was sorry about that unsavoury expression for which the Minister was responsible yesterday. I could not help thinking about the cherubic new arrival in this chamber who was eulogizing the other side and condemning honorable senators on this side as a rough, uncouth lot of people. Had the honorable senator been here and heard the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport using the epithet that he did, his opinions might have been revised. I could have jumped to my feet, but I thought that the Minister was so wide open that I would wait and hit him back. As I was reflecting on this, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> rose to his feet and asked for a withdrawal, and I thought perhaps he was right, as it would merely be lowering the tone of the chamber to attack the Minister on that point. There was great excitement and tenseness in anticipation of the British parliamentary election. </para>

I say, in all candour, that I hope that the Government will get through the next two or three months, perhaps the next twelve months, in. comparative peace. I give it my blessing. I am afraid, however, that it will find its life rather turbulent. The Labour party will appraise all legislation submitted to the Parliament, on its merits, and will vote accordingly. It will not be frightened by any threat of a double dissolution. J_ am glad that I have had such an attentive hearing. My only regret is that I was not &#34; on the air &#34;. I repeat my congratulations to the GovernorGeneral for the splendidly lucid manner in which he delivered his Speech, and I express again my pleasure that His Majesty has recovered from the illness that prevented him from visiting Australia, and I hope that in the not too distant future I shall see him again. </para>

          <para>. - I was very pleased to hear the Governor-General announce that Their Majesties will visit Australia in 1952. I am sure that the people of Australia will welcome them loyally. I wish also to convey my congratulations to the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> on his being elected Leader of the Government in the Senate. I am also very pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> has been appointed Minister for Repatriation. I know that in that capacity he will do excellent work in administering the business of ex-service men and women. He has always extended sympathy to, and battled very hard for, ex-service personnel, and I am sure that he will do his utmost for them by making recommendations to Cabinet for an increase of pensions and other conditions. In&#39; the repatriation hospitals throughout Australia there are many ex-servicemen of World War XL, and also of World War I., and I am sure that they will obtain every satisfaction from the Minister. The portfolio that the Minister holds is one which can crucify the holder of it. The previous Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnard,</inline> was the victim of his office. I consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnard</inline> was one of the most conscientious Ministers who have held the portfolio, although he was not himself a returned soldier. I know that he made a good impression on returned soldiers&#39; organizations in Western Australia during his visits to that State, and I have never heard any one speak ill of him. I extend my congratulations also to the honorable senators who were entrusted with the responsibility of moving and seconding the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. They performed their task well, as also did the two new Opposition senators, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan.</inline> No government ever came into office in more favorable circumstances than the present Government did. As an honorable member in another place has stated, those circumstances could be described as a Prime Minister&#39;s dream. When the Government came into office it inherited a very sound financial structure. The national coffers were full, the nation&#39;s finances were buoyant. The Chifley Government had balanced its budget for the two previous financial years, a feat of which it justly could be proud. So other government has ever had such a clean sheet handed to it. That circumstance arose from the excellence of the Labour Administration led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley.</inline> It is possible that after the new Government has had twelve months in office it will be able to present a balanced .budget to this Parliament. Should it prove able to do so there is no doubt that the press will take advantage of the fact, and will do everything in its power to convince the people of Australia of the magnificence of such an achievement. But I guarantee that not one word of credit will go to the previous Government for its presentation of a balanced budget in respect of the two preceding financial years. </para>

        <para>I consider that the Government&#39;s policy, as expressed in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, provides for legislation that is a mere continuation of the legislation passed by the Chifley Government. The  Government&#39;s  proposals are amazing when we recall how the Government parties indulged in pre-election shouting about the Chifley Government, and when we also recall their election promises. T have watched the moves of the Government very carefully since the election and </para>
        <para class="block">I am surprised at the attitude that it has adopted towards more than one of the items referred to in the GovernorGeneral&#39;s Speech. It has watered down considerably two most important promises that its members -made during the election campaign, and I wonder what is going to become of those promises in the long run. The Government parties promised drastic action, but I do not know whether they are prepared to go ahead with it. By watering their promises down considerably they are running true to form. They made promises during the election campaign that they could not carry out, or even attempt to carry out. </para>
        <para>Honorable senators opposite have discussed, during this debate, the problems of housing, the shortage of labour, coal and communism. We have heard quite a lot about communism. I shall deal with that matter later in my speech. But I did not hear many honorable senators on the Government side speak about the attitude of the members of the federal executive of the British Medical Association towards the Chifley Government&#39;s pharmaceutical benefits legislation. Not one word has been said about the boycott that that association used to deprive the people of Australia of the very valuable service that the legislation was intended to make available to them. Very little was said about the rising cost of living. Honorable senators opposite have side-tracked those issues, which are two of the main issues referred to in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. The cost of living, as honorable senators know, has increased considerably during the last two years. The previous Government attempted to cope with that rise. The former Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> immediately after the war ended, broadcast to the people of Australia, not only once, but many times, warning them that we could expect high prices if the conditions that occurred after the end of World War I. were allowed to recur. He said that if the Australian Government did not have control of prices we would be placed in a position in which our fi would be worth only about 5s.  His  Government tried to prevent such a position by proposing in a referendum of the people that this Parliament be given permanent control over prices, rents, and other charges. It placed before the people of Australia the sincere and honest argument that a national government should control prices after the war just as it had during the war. He pointed out that the Commonwealth had effectively controlled prices during the preceding four years. Unfortunately, the people rejected the Chifley Government&#39;s proposal at that referendum mainly because its political opponents urged the people to get rid of &#34; Canberra controls &#34;. Those parties said that the States could, control prices more effectively than tieCommonwealth could. I do not need! todetail the position that developed afterthe Commonwealth relinquished prices, control following the defeat of the; Chifley Government&#39;s proposal. Some1 States said that they could carry om effectively,  but prices rose immediately ant? as the result the basic wage has also been increased. </para>

            <para>- Yes. In Western Australia the basic wage has been increased practically every quarter as the result of rising costs of living. However, we know that every increase of the basic wage causes a further increase of the cost of living. A gentleman who gave a lecture recently in Perth on this subject put the position very aptly when he said, &#34; While the basic wage goes up the stairs, prices go up in the lift&#34;. In Western Australia the basic wage now is &#163;6 15s. a week, whilst all of us are aware that an application is now before the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for an increase of the basic wage to &#163;10 a week. I repeat that the blame for the present high cost of living must be laid at the door of supporters of the present Government because they were mainly responsible for the defeat of the Chifley Government&#39;s proposal that the National Parliament be given power in peace-time to control prices on an Australia-wide basis. </para>

        <para class="block">Every Australian is directly interested in the development of our national resources. That problem should be above party politics. We realize that we have a population of only 8,000,000 and that much of this vast continent remains undeveloped. I am concerned particularly about the development of our northern areas of the Commonwealth. A serious aspect of this problem is the drift of population to the capital cities. Dealing with this subject recently, the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> stated - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>There is no security in six ever-growing capital cities. Within the next 30 years Australia must double its population for security. \Vu must occupy and we must do it quicker and better if we are to secure our title to the land. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Apparently, the Minister has awakened to the fact that Australia is underpopulated. He was Treasurer in the Lyons Government and for twenty years prior to the Curtin Government assuming office non-Labour governments had been in charge of this country. What did they do during that period to develop our national resources ? After World War I. the .government of the day inaugurated an immigration scheme, but, later, the Bruce-Page Government abandoned it. However, although the Curtin Government assumed office when this country was as war, it immediately set about making plans for a gigantic immigration scheme. The result is that, to-day, tens of thousands of migrants are being brought to this country annually. I believe that members of all parties will give credit to the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> for the excellent work he performed when he was Minister for Immigration in the Chifley Government. In 1947, the first year of the present scheme, over 37,000 migrants arrived in this country. He did excellent work in overcoming great difficulties including the shortage of shipping for the transport of migrants. The point I make is that if non-Labour governments that were in power for so long prior to 1939 had encouraged immigra-  tion even on a very limited scale this country would not have been faced with the shortage of man-power that it felt so seriously when the recent war broke out. </para>
        <para>What is the reason for the present drift to the cities? I have had some experience of farming. Indeed, since World War I. my brothers have engaged in farming in a fairly big way. I know the conditions under which farm workers were employed prior to the recent war. At the end of World War I. hundreds of thousands of unemployed, including a great proportion of ex-servicemen, were obliged to tramp from one end of the country to the other in search of work which they were prepared to accept at a wage of 5s. a week with keep. To-day, farmers are prepared to pay from &#163;5, to &#163;6, a week to a man to drive a tractor; and drovers in the north-west are paid &#163;10 a week to drove cattle from places like Meekatharra to central depots whereas after World War I. they received only 30s. a week with keep. </para>
        <para>Another aspect of this problem is that during the war a great proportion of our man-Dower was directed to essential industries in the cites in order to assist in the war effort. Although Labour objects to the direction of man-power in normal times, the Curtin Government had to apply that principle because of our imminent danger at that time. That was the only way in which we could effectively . mobilize our man-power. With that object in view, thousands of men were trained under schemes for the dilution of labour as .fitters, machinists, welders, boilermakers and moulders. Those men and their families found conditions in the cities to be far more favorable than those under which they had worked and lived in rural areas. We cannot expect those people to return to rural areas to live in bough sheds and to work on farms for a wage of 50s. a week and keep. Those days are gone. Therefore, the farmers must now do something to attract the man-power that, they are seeking. The Government&#39;s decentralization plans should be fostered. The Chifley Government did as much as it possibly could to decentralize industry. It leased war-time munitions factories to private enterprise, and the extent of the employment that is now given at those factories would amaze many people. Labour wholeheartedly agrees that decentralization is essential to this country. Recently, speaking in Sydney, the New South Wales  President  of the Liberal party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> H. Moore, complained that during Labour&#39;s term of office there had been a drift of rural population to the cities. That was not the fault of the Labour Government. No government can direct private enterprise. If an industrialist wants to establish a factory in the outskirts of a capital city, he is entitled to do so. The solution of the problem is to make our country areas more attractive to industries. For instance, the Commonwealth Government could subsidize country developmental schemes undertaken by the State governments. I should like to see a continuation of the development of the Kimberley district in Western Australia. That is a vast area. To-day, the Wyndham meat works operate only at half capacity during the killing season. Private abattoirs and freezing works have, been established at Glenroy station, 300 miles from Wyndham. The slaughtermen are transported to Glenroy by air, and the slaughtered cattle are carried by air to Wyndham, a journey occupying only one or one and a half hours. Air transport saves many hundreds of miles of droving. I understand that the scheme is subsidized by the Government of Western Australia. The Chifley Government realized the value of the resources of north-western Australia, the Northern Territory and north Queensland. I listened sympathetically to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher&#39;s</inline> appeal on behalf of north Queensland. That portion of his State is to him what the Kimberley district is to me. Unless we populate those northern areas, I am quite sure that, in our time, we may expect 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 people from the islands to our north to occupy  northern Australia forcibly. With the co-operation of the State governments concerned, the Chifley Government endeavoured to promote the development of our northern areas. I was interested to read some articles that were published in thi Perth <inline font-style="italic">Dna,v News</inline> last year. One article, which appeared on the 2nd August, stated - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>This year the Western Australian Government submitted proposals to Canberra for re-organization of the industry. These included the construction of a formed gravel road from Wyndham into Nicholson station, 300 miles away, on the Ord River, and the building of feeder roads to serve the Victoria River country in the Northern Territory. At present cattle have to walk an average of ISO miles to the works. </para>
          <para>Canberra has now agreed to spend &#163;1,500,000 on the capital cost of this and related schemes. </para>
          <para>But something is being attempted by private enterprise as well. Abattoirs and freezing works are being built at Glenroy station, 200 miles south-west of Wyndham, as part of a scheme for the aerial transport of carcass beef to the port. </para>

        <para class="block">Any honorable senator who is interested in those experiments should read the annual report of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, which was made available last week. On page 23, the report deals with the work of the research station on the Ord River, and outlines what the Commonwealth is doing. I understand that the station has now been in operation for approximately eighteen months or two years. The newspaper article continues - </para>

        <para class="block">That shows that the Chifley Government was well aware of the situation. It did not merely make promises; it got on with the job. In the same newspaper on the 30th July, 1949, an article headed, &#34;What about Australia&#39;s vast, empty spaces?&#34;, stated - </para>

        <para class="block">Clearly the Labour Government had already started on the development of the Kimberley district. The latest figures show that the population of Western Australia, north of the 26th parallel - that is from Carnarvon upwards - has been whittled down to 7,000. Carnarvon is now the centre of a rapidly expanding tropical fruit-growing area. Large quantities of pineapples and bananas are being grown in the vicinity of the Gascoyne River. An endeavour is being made to secure Government assistance for this enterprise. Banana-growing is a comparatively new industry in Western Australia, and its future appears very bright indeed. Unfortunately, all fruit grown in the Carnarvon area has to be carried by road train to Geraldton, a distance of 300 miles. In 1947, 21,296 cases of bananas, worth &#163;85,000, were produced. In the following year, production increased to 44,962 cases, valued at &#163;157,300, an increase of approximately 100 per cent. The Government of Western Australia has an agricultural research station at Carnarvon. It is supervised by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maher,</inline> a Queensland expert on tropical fruits. I understand that he was employed previously .by the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock. He is an efficient officer, and is doing a splendid job. He was astounded to see the production results in that area. If the Gascoyne River were dammed, with the assistance of Commonwealth money, and a firstclass road built from Carnarvon  to Geraldton, the growing of tropical fruits could be greatly expanded. If this Government is anxious to decentralize our population and industries, it could well give attention to this proposal. </para>

          <para>My Government is concerned about the manpower position of the services, particularly in the military forces.

I consider that the defence programme that was prepared by the Chifley Government will, if it is implemented, provide sufficiently for the defence of this country.

        <para>The total strength of the three services before the war was 12,664, and in June, 1948, it was 38,976. Having regard to our small population, I believe that we should mark-time in relation to recruiting for the armed forces, because almost every man who has entered one of the services was previously engaged in production of one form or another. It is all very well for scaremongers to say that war is inevitable, but I do not believe that it will occur for many years, and I hope that it never will occur. I do not believe that we should compel our young men to undergo military training for some months when there are hundreds of thousands of migrants coming into the country, because if compulsory military training were introduced, those migrants would be employed in civilian jobs while our young men were in the services </para>
        <para>A number of honorable senators have referred to the housing shortage in this country. There is a housing shortage in every country. Tor five years during the war we had to divert men from the building and allied industries to war work. Many brickworks, tile works, cement works and timber mills were closed, and the men that they had employed were drafted to other industries that were more essential to the war effort. The Labour Government that was in office during the war realized, that the transition from a war economy to a peacetime economy after the war would give rise to many difficult problems. Nearly 1,000,000 men and- women were serving in the armed forces, and when they were demobilized it was necessary to ensure that they obtained productive employment. That was a difficult task. The Labour Government made its plans for the transition before the war ended, and we can now see the results of its work. Full production has been achieved in many industries. Working conditions in industries such as brick and cement making, and the manufacture of tiles are unpleasant and, consequently, it is difficult for them to attract sufficient labour. Many timber mills have to rely upon the Government to direct new Australians to work them. In Western Australia, over 500 migrants have been sent to work in the timber industry, because the Australians who were working in it before the war have secured employment in other industries in the cities. They left the industry because the working conditions, the living conditions for their wives and families and the educational facilities for their children were bad. They will not return to the industry until it can provide amenities comparable with those that they enjoy in the cities and towns. </para>

In the first quarter of this year, in New South Wales, construction of 4,318 houses began - 418 more than in the first quarter of last year. The number of people employed in the home-building trade in Australia on September 30, 1945, was 34,6 (;S, compared with 101,718 on March 31 fast - an increase of nearly 200 per cent. </para>

        <para class="block">One honorable senator who is a returned serviceman has said that the trade unions are not allowing some exservicemen to be trained for the building industry. I do not deny that that is so. We must avoid a repetition of what occurred after the last war. Hundreds of men were trained to work in various industries, particularly the building industry. They were given instruction in a shop for three months. Employers applied for the services of trainees. They agreed to pay the trainees 40 per cent, of the prevailing tradesman&#39;s wage and the Commonwealth agreed to pay 60 per cent. When the trainees reached the stage at which they were 75 or 80 per cent, efficient and their wages had to be increased to &#163;5 a week if the prevailing tradesman&#39;s rate was &#163;6, the employers then dumped them and applied for- the services of other trainees. The employers were using trainees as cheap labour. The Labour party knew that that had occurred and was not prepared to allow the present reconstruction training scheme to be used for the benefit of employers.

            <para>- Prior to the suspension of the sitting I had pointed out that the trade union movement in Western Australia decided against having an army of trainees with no employment as tradesmen available for them on completion of their courses. That that was a correct approach to the  subject  has been amply borne out. As the building trades developed the required number of trainees were enrolled. In the meantime, a number of prospective trainees were absorbed in other industries. During the war period there was considerable expansion of Australian secondary industry, as is evidence by the following report in the Canberra <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of the 16th March : - </para>

      <para class="block">Canberra.. Thursday. - Australia in 1948-4?) had 13,069 more factories than in 1938-39, the Common weal til Statistician <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Roland Wilson)</inline> said to-day.  His  figures showed that in 1948-49 Australia hail 40,010 factories, employing 890,454 people, compared with 20,941 factories with 564,100 employees in 193S-39. The figures represent an increase of 4S.51 per cent, in the number of factories and 57.57 per cent, in the number of employees. The value of production increased 180 per cent., from &#163;203.417,000 in 1938-39 to &#163;509,660,000 in 1948-49. </para>
      <para class="block">That proves that the Labour Government did a remarkably good job by encouraging many overseas &#39;manufacturers to establish factories in this country. It also dispels the bogy of socialism, about which wa have heard much recently. Production in the building industry generally, but particularly in Western Australia, now exceeds the pre-war level. The quantities of bricks, tiles and timber now being produced for building purposes are far in excess of the quantities that were produced prior to the war. Unfortunately, however, because of the shortage of labour, the production of sawn timber is still lagging behind requirements. </para>

      <para class="block">That is identical with Labour&#39;s views. The Government is watering down its policy about what it intends to do in connexion with communism. La3t night the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport, who administers matters associated with the coal-miners and waterside workers, appealed to the Opposition to assist him. But what did honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber do about these matters when they where sitting in Opposition during Labour&#39;s regime? I noticed, particularly that the Minister did not mention anything about Communists within the British Medical Association. Nor did he offer any comment in relation to Communists who are solicitors in this country, and others that are connected with the universities in Australia.  His  criticism was directed only against Communists in the trade union movement. In my opinion the Government has gone cold on this issue, and that will be the end of it. The Communists will be treated just as they were treated twenty years ago. I remind the Senate that anti-Labour governments were in office for twenty years prior to 1939, and it is my firm conviction that the starvation policy of those governments, which resulted in farmers being driven off their properties, and men walking the streets in search of employment, depending on hand-outs from soup kitchens for sustenance, bred communism in this country. lt is axiomatic that starvation breeds communism. That is evident  from what is happening in other countries of the world to-day. </para>

            <para>- I referred to the Prime Minister and how unpopular he was <inline font-style="italic">with</inline> the members of his Government. Now I refer to the election of officers of trade unions. This anti-Labour Government proposes to interfere with the domestic affairs of <inline font-style="italic">the trade</inline> unions. I assure the Government that if it attempts to do that it will be playing with fire. The trade unions have done magnificent work in building up this country. More credit is due to them in that connexion than to the Government. I advise the Government to keep its hands off the trade unions. It will have a revolt if it does not. </para>

            <para>. - I speak to this motion more as a matter of courtesy to the GovernorGeneral who came in person to the Senate to open the proceedings of the Nineteenth Parliament and to read the Speech prepared for him by his advisors, than for any other reason. First I take this opportunity to tender to the senators who were elected or re-elected on the 10th December, my personal congratulations. They have earned for themselves a great privilege and carry a very great responsibility. I also tender to the Ministers who have had the honour to be appointed to Ministerial office my personal congratulations. In particular I tender them to the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan).</inline> They, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Annabelle</inline> Rankin, fought strongly, and I  must confess successfully, during the past three years against major odds. -My only hope and expectation is that if we fight as hard on this side of the chamber during the life of this Parliament we shall be as successful as they were on the 10th December. </para>

              <para>- That, of course, is unpredictable and is in the lap of the gods. It rests to some degree also on the courage of the Government itself. I tender congratulations to the AttorneyGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> who has just interjected and to the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> who are not new to the Parliament and who bring their own particular gifts to the deliberations of this chamber. Finally, I include the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner).</inline> He is one of those fortunate -persons who, immediately on his entry into the parliamentary sphere, has had the honour and distinction of being lifted immediately to ministerial rank. With regard to the election on the 10th December, I merely wish to say that the people have spoken. They have decided by their vote on the return of the two conservative parties. With that decision I, personally, have no quarrel. One must accept it. However, I do draw the attention of the Government to the large number of informal votes recorded in the course of the Senate poll, and I ask the Government to make a thorough investigation of the informal votes to ascertain if means can be devised to correct that blot on the intelligence of the people. I think it will be found that probably at least one-half of the informal votes were deliberately informal. </para>

              <para>- It is a Tasmanian idea, but I do not subscribe entirely to it. I think that on occasions where five are to be elected and in other cases, such as a double dissolution, when there are ten senators to be elected, the number should be higher than three. In short what I am advocating for Senate elections for the consideration of the Government is the system of optional preferential voting. If the Labour- party considered any system of voting to be an improvement on the existing system it would take its courage in its hands as. it did when it had the honesty, the decency and the courage to introduce a system of proportional .representation in this chamber. </para>

              <para>- I have indicated that what the Labour party did in that connexion was the honest, fair and decent and courageous thing to do. Moreover I remind the honorable senator of something that he overlooks and that is that the decision was made before the election was embarked upon. I put it to the Senate that the Government was given a mandate to govern at the election. That does not mean that the Labour party acknowledges that every measure that the Government puts before the Parliament has been approved by the .people. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber will criticize and oppose the measures that come before them from time to time. I trust that they will achieve their aim of making that criticism truly objective. Any failure in that respect will be due to human frailty and my colleagues and I will endeavour to get back on the rails as soon as possible. In a contest, whether it be in sport or anything else, there are three elements for which the people look. They look not only for victory but for victory with honour. They look for magnanimity from the victors and for dignity and good sportsmanship from the defeated. </para>

          <para>I do not propose to review the election results under those three particular headings, but I will say something on the subject of victory with honour. I invite the members of the Government parties to accept individually their responsibility for the matters that were put before the people by way of propaganda in the press, by the radio and even in the backyards of the people in some cases. Whether honorable members sponsored them or not, or even if they were not aware of them, each member of the Government must accept his share of responsibility for the propaganda that was used. I am not prepared to say whether that propaganda had a great effect or a little effect or any effect at all upon the minds of the electors because the people do not furnish reasons for their decision. One can only speculate upon that subject, and I do not propose to indulge in any speculation. But I do invite the members of the Government parties who are listening to me now to examine their consciences in the light of certain statements that have been made either by them or on their behalf. For example, I invite them to have regard to what the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> said in this chamber last night regarding the picture of the Bunnerong depot without any coal. That photograph, presented as a fact, was a picture that had been taken two years before, when the configuration of the building was entirely different. I invite members of the Government to consider the propriety of that usage. Knowing that they art aware of the fact, I ask them to examine their consciences on the statement that, if Labour was returned, there would be industrial conscription in Australia - something that is a constitutional impossibility. I invite the members of the Government to examine their consciences on the statement that, if Labour was returned, the homes, farms and savings of the people would be taken from them. </para>
          <para>I draw attention to the type of advertisement used by and on behalf of the Government during the elections. In particular, I am referring to an advertisement covering almost a whole page that appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> on the 2nd December, 1949. It is headed, &#34; This is the Liberals&#39; policy &#34;. There is enough room on that paper for quite a number of items to have been enunciated. &#39;But there are three significant omissions from it. It is not the Liberals&#39; policy. There is not one word on three major issues, which I have no doubt the Government thought would not be popular with the people. In all the great expanse of paper the advertisement does not contain one word about the Liberal party&#39;s programme for military conscription. Why was that omitted? There is not oneword about the Government&#39;s restoration of the Commonwealth Bank Board. Nor is there one word about the proposal to be submitted to the people in 1952, according to the Government, for a contributory insurance scheme. I suggest that if that, scheme is to be put on a flat rate basis it will cost everybody in this country at least ls. 4d. in the &#163;1. I invite the members of the Government to examine their consciences on that question. If this advertisement gives Liberal policy, why were matters of such moment suppressed ? I do not propose to pass judgment on the Government. I leave that to the people. I merely ask the members of the Government to examine their consciences and ask themselves if they are satisfied that, in addition to victory, they have victory with honour. </para>
          <para>I pass now to consideration of what, the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport had to say yesterday afternoon on the subject of communism and socialism. He claimed that the Labour party was an appeaser of the Communists. He claimed that the Labour party was white-anted by the Communists. I challenge him now to point to one member of the Labour party anywhere in Australia who is a Communist. No political party in Australia has stood so firmly against communism as the Labour party has. As far as appeasing the Communists is concerned, I repeat that  the Chifley Government was the only government that has so far really launched an effective attack upon communism. Let. lis review the events of the last year. It will not be a strain on honorable senators to recall that it was while the Chifley Government was in office that Communists like Sharkey and Burns were prosecuted and convicted. They were found guilty by the courts of the country - not by the Executive, or by other governments, or by individuals. They were charged under the aegis of the Chifley Government, tried by the courts of the country according to law, found guilty, convicted, and imprisoned. Another man named Healy, in &#34;Western Australia, was charged but was not convicted. I invite honorable senators to recall- the Kemira Tunnel dispute when, because of the division of industrial authority between the Australian Government and the Government of New South Wales, both governments had to combine to settle that most intricate industrial situation, which was Communist-inspired and Communist-led. The action that was taken settled that dispute. </para>
          <para>I come now to the general coal strike that occurred last year. The Chifley Labour Government recognized the incidence of that coal strike as a Communist conspiracy: We so branded it, we fought it as such, and as a government we smashed it as such. Never was such damage done to the prestige of the Communist party in the whole history of Australia as was done during the course of these events. We branded the action <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the Communists in the coal strikers a brutal assault upon other workers in New South Wales and Queensland, as an attack upon governments, and as antidemocratic. Men and women of the Labour party went on to the coal-fields, they went to the very pit tops, and spoke to the miners. They convinced the miners that they were being misled by the Communists. Many of us went to the Sydney Domain and addressed tens of thousands of workers. We convinced them that the coal strike was a Communist conspiracy. The miners eventually went back to work. But I do not recall one member of the Liberal party &#171;r the Australian Country party going into the danger area on the coal-fields, or having the temerity to go to the Sydney </para>
          <para class="block">Domain. Where were these gentlemen when Australia was in jeopardy as a result of the coal strike ? Who was doing the appeasing then? Who lacked the courage? I say to the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport that it was not the Labour party. Further effective fiction against communism was taken by the Chifley Government. I point to the regulation under the Commonwealth Arbitration Act, which provides relief for trade union members who are victimized by the Communist-dominated unions. Provision was made for payment of their legal costs in legitimate cases. I refer also to the legislation, passed by the Parliament last July, to clean up irregularities in trade union ballots and malpractices in connexion with the election of union officials. That is Act No.  28  of  1949,  which prohibits malpractices in connexion with union elections and indeed goes further and provides for the imposition of very severe penalties on people who indulge in such malpractices. It provides for a penalty upon conviction, of  &#163;100,  or imprisonment for twelve months, or both. What has been the effect of that legislation? From one end of Australia to the other the Communists have been thrown out of union offices by the trade unionists themselves. The Communists to-day, with these penalties staring them in the face, are afraid to fake union ballots. Those who have been afflicted by their operations are coming before the courts almost every day, and the courts are giving them relief by appointing officers of the court to work in conjunction with legitimate trade union officers to ensure that elections are properly held. In an appropriate case one member of a union - not necessarily a number of members - may approach the court and obtain relief in respect of irregularities or malpractices connected with the election of union officials. That is the way to get rid of the Communists - by doing something about them, as Labour has done, and not by talking as the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport has talked. </para>
          <para>I should have been very interested in the honorable senator&#39;s speech last night, if I had not already heard it at least a dozen times in this Senate when he was previously a member of it. I have  often heard that self-same appeal for co-operation and good-will, that same bashing about communism and about the Labour party&#39;s alleged appeasement of communism, and I hope that out of sheer pity, he will not inflict it on us again. </para>

              <para>- I turn now to the subject of socialization to which the Minister referred, and to his decrying of the activities of the Labour Government in connexion with it. Let us examine what the Government has done about the Chifley Government&#39;s socialization since it came into office. For instance there is the Government&#39;s airline. Did the conservative parties say that if they were elected to office they would denationalize the Government&#39;s airline? Far from it! Have they abolished the Government&#39;s airline ? No !  Lt  has their blessing. Then there is the government shipping line presided over by the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> went no further than to use high sounding words about it. He said that he would call upon the government shipping line&#39; to justify itself economically and nationally. &#34;Well, it is still under the presidency of the Minister. Let us consider another socialized enterprise - shipbuilding and ship repairs. That too, has received the unmitigated blessing of the Government parties. They have even advocated the stabilization of rural industries with guaranteed prices - another piece of socialism that they have adopted entirely. They have agreed to advocate the payment of a subsidy on shipping freights to distant States. Another piece of socialism! They have adopted the greatest socialistic venture that has ever been undertaken in Australia. They have adopted with pride and pleasure the great Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme. And to clinch their conversion to socialism they even announced, quite unnecessarily, in their policy speeches, that they would not disturb the national broadcasting system. The new socialists! &#34;We are proud of their conversion. Not one venture in the socialization field that was undertaken by the Labour Government has been disturbed by the present anti-Labour Go vernment. Nor, if one judges by the policy speeches made by the leaders of the Government parties during the election campaign, will any one of those ventures be interfered with. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <para>The Labour party attitude to socialization is perfectly clear. It is exactly the same as that enunciated in Adelaide during the election campaign by the present Prime Minister. That attitude is that if any industry or class of industry is exploiting the people, or if in the public interest it is undesirable that a matter should remain in private hands, then, and then only, will it be nationalized. That represents the complete conversion of the conservative parties to our policy, or, at least, lip service paid by them to that policy. </para>

              <para>- I shall tell the Senate a little story that I consider states the position regarding socialism perfectly. A good old man lived in a little village He was of good repute and was looked up to by everybody in the locality. There were three bad men in. that village, and he stood in the way of their designs. One morning, when the good old man came out of his front gate, he found a dog tied to it. It was a very disreputable dog, with only one eye and one ear, with bits out of it everywhere, its coat all dirty and full of fleas, and with a very nasty disposition. &#34;When the old chap in his kindness tried to pat the dog, it bit him. &#34;When he tried to feed it, it snarled at him. &#34;When he could tend it no longer he cut it loose. But next morning he found the dog again tied up to his fence. The old man and the dog went over the same procedure again, morning after morning. Finally the townspeople began to say that he must be a very cruel old man to keep his dog in such a condition.  His  protestations that the dog was not his went unheeded, and the old man, worried by what was being said about him, went into a decline and died. I do not require to tell the Senate the name of that dog. Its name is &#34; ism &#34; - communism and socialism. Tying that disreputable dog to the coat tails of a political opponent is the oldest and meanest trick in the game of political propaganda. It is a mean and well-known practice. It is the kind of trick that the Communists play, and is very akin to their tactics of character assassination for which they are famous. In case there is any doubt about the stand taken by the Labour party in relation to communism, let me repeat which I said to tens of thousands of people in the Sydney Domain during the coal strike last year. I said then that communism and its leaders were evil, that they were antiChristian, anti-religious and antiworking class; that they were anti-democratic and anti-government and, in some instances, revolutionary. Whilst I believe all that I am not prepared to undertake to prove it in a court of law. So long as we of the Labour party were in office no man was going to be convicted by reason of our mere beliefs. We were prepared to leave the conviction of individuals to the processes of the law of this country. But if I understood the Governor-General&#39;s Speech and the policy speeches of the leaders of the conservative parties aright, men who are branded by the Executive of this country as Communists are to he removed from official positions in trade unions. That reminds me of one of the minor tragedies - I use the word minor because of the major tragedies that take place there - that are now occurring in the Balkan countries, where a man who is <inline font-style="italic">persona non grata</inline> with the Communist regime finds one morning that his employment has gone, and, as he has no work, he cannot eat. To make sure that he cannot eat the authorities deprive him of his food ration card on the ground that he is not a worker, and presently he fades away and dies. That is murder, of course. But it is done in such a gradual way that it is scarcely perceptible. I warn the Government to keep that thought in mind when it is drafting the industrial legislation that is foreshadowed in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. </para>

          <para>I come to the third, point; that is, an announcement that was made by the Minister recently regarding increased allowances in respect of sufferers from tuberculosis. The Minister in making the announcement slated the Labour Govern- ment for having fixed those rates  as low  as it did. He had not the frankness  to  say that new rates had been drawn  up  and settled and were lying in the departmental office waiting to be announced when that Government went to  the  country at the recent general election. The only reason why we did not announce them was because of Labour&#39;s belief  that  we should not be offering bribes to,  the  people on the eve of a general election. The Minister had not the frankness, when he announced the new rates, to say  that  those rates were ready and waiting  to  be announced when we went to the election.

On the very day that he was appointed Minister  for  Health he intimated that he was calling conferences of the various bodies  in  the field. Then, when things began  to  leak out about these hush hush  and  secret conferences, he denied that any proposals had been made, or that the </para>

          <para>Why does the Minister say that he was merely having exploratory talks if, in fact, he was putting proposals of that nature, whether or not they had been considered by the Government? </para>
          <para>With regard to pharmaceutical benefits, I merely want to say that after the wedding of the two conservative parties - the Liberal party of Australia and the Australian Country party - had taken place, and very soon after the honeymoon ended prematurely, there was produced a medical monstrosity in the shape of a new pharmaceutical benefits scheme, providing for a limited list of life-saving and disease-preventing drugs. It provided for 40-odd drugs in all. It introduces into the structure of social services a new horror - the disease test. If the people of this country want pharmaceutical benefits under the Page scheme, they must select their disease. What a horror in any scheme of social services! I have not the faintest doubt one will find that the Page list contains many proprietary lines. If one refers to to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> one will see a report of the United Kingdom Government&#39;s view of proprietary medicines. That report reads - </para>

        <para>London, Wed. - The Health Ministry is likely to ban proprietary medicines from its free-issue list. This may be the first move to cut the cost of the National Health Scheme. The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bevan)</inline> said in the House last week : &#34; The high cost of proprietary medicines is one of the rackets of civilized society &#34;. A small specialist committee of the B.M.A. is now compiling a list of non-proprietary drugs which doctors will be allowed to prescribe free. If people in future want proprietary medicines they will have to pay for them. Health Ministry officials admit that some of the newer non-proprietary drugs are expensive. They claim, however, that these drugs will be more economic eventually because they will shorten a sick worker&#39;s absence from work. The Health Ministry is considering an advertising campaign to educate the public in the efficiency of cheaper non-proprietary medicines. </para>
        <para>I hope that some  responsibile  Minister will direct the particular attention of the Minister for Health to that quotation. I do not rely upon my own assessment of the position to indicate that this is a mean and wretched approach to pharmaceutical benefits with the introduction of this new horror - the disease test. I shall read to honorable senators the opinion of the chemists as set out in a report of an interview with their chief representative in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> of the 1st February. That report reads - </para>

        <para>Only about five to eight per cent, of the people in Australia would benefit from the Federal Government&#39;s proposed new &#34; free medicine&#34; scheme, the  President  of the Pharmaceutical Guild of Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eric Scott)</inline> said yesterday. &#34;I think it will be a hard scheme to sell to the public,&#34; he added. </para>
        <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott&#39;s</inline> statement. I warn the Government that if it is misguided enough to embark upon the Page scheme, which, incidentally, is the British Medical Association scheme and is part of the Government&#39;s abject and complete surrender to the association, and part of the price, I suppose, to be paid by the Government for the political arid financial support it received from the British Medical Association at the last general election, unending pressure will be brought to bear upon the Government to add to the list. The Government must yield sooner or later to that pressure, and it will thus find itself in the whole field of unlimited and unscientific prescribing. It is time that some supporters of the Government took a look at what is going on. Labour&#39;s legislation on these matters is scientifically based. It involves no compulsion of doctor, or patient, no breach of the doctor-patient relationship, and no breach of secrecy concerning relations between doctor and patient. I hope that my colleagues will ensure that that legislation will not be disturbed. I believe that we owe a duty to those doctors who have co-operated with the Labour Government to give that great spread of pharmaceutical benefits to the people; and I believe that an obligation rests upon me, at least, to advise the members of my party to stand behind doctors and their patients who, in their hundreds of thousands, have been enjoying these benefits. </para>
        <para>I shall now say a word about another horror, the medical benefits scheme that is being introduced, if I may accept the report published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> from which I have quoted relating to plans submitted to the Victorian Council of the British Medical Association. If those proposals are the Page proposals we are to have a means test, the very thing that I understood every party in the Parliament was endeavouring to abolish. A new means test! This is delightful ! The parties that urged the people at the last election to vote Liberal and for freedom are now about to compel persons to join friendly societies and medical benefit schemes if they wish to obtain any benefits. When I was Minister for Health, I was in difficulties with the British Medical Association. I venture to say that any government will be in difficulties with that body. But, at least, I had only one opponent, whereas my successor is in difficulties not only with the British Medical Association, but also with the Pharmaceutical Guild of Australia. If he keeps going much longer he will pull down the whole house of cards upon himself. The medical benefits scheme and pharmaceutical &#39;benefits scheme that were sponsored by Labour presented to the medical profession the existing form, of medical practice literally on a gold plate, and literally as the British Medical Association itself asked for it. I am afraid that, in having to deal now with my successor, the medical profession has jumped out of the frying pan into the fire. I challenge any honorable senator opposite to say now, or at- any time in the future, that in both of those schemes, there was not complete freedom of choice of doctors on the part of patients. There was no disruption of or interference with the doctor-patient relationship, and there was a complete preservation of secrecy. Members of the medical profession were free to enter the schemes or to stay out of them at will. I am afraid that they will not find themselves in such a happy position under the proposals of my successor. On the 19th January, the Minister for Health announced that he would ask the Prime Minister to arrange conferences as soon as possible between himself and the Health Ministers of the States. I noticed in the press on the 15th March - two months later - that he was still saying the same thing. I was reminded of an act I once saw in a little vaudeville show at a beach. There was a large crowd of people on the stage. One by one they retired through a door at the rear of the stage, leaving only two people facing the audience, a young man and a very old doddering man, who, up to this time, had not uttered a single word. The young man looked at the old fellow and said, &#34; Well, go on &#34;. The old man asked in quavering tones, &#34; Will you do me a favour ? &#34; The young man said that he would, and his companion said, &#34;Will you turn me round?&#34; The young man turned the old fellow around, pointed him at the door, and proceeded to walk off the stage, but the old gentleman said, &#34; Will you do me another favour ? &#34; The young man replied in the affirmative, and then the old fellow said, &#34; Give me a start &#34;. I think that it is up to the Government to take its Minister for Health in hand, turn him from his present course, and point him in the direction of national health. It should ask him to do something about the Labour Government&#39;s plan for dental care for children. It should ask him also to do something about the Child Health Division of the Department of Health, the industrial hygiene section that was set up at the Sydney University by Labour, and the anti-tuberculosis scheme which is of vast importance to this country. Labour members were twitted at one stage with being concerned only with &#34; hand-outs &#34; such as the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the medical benefits scheme. We were told that we should be getting on with great national work. We were in fact doing such work, but I remind  honorable senators that, in the past three months, we have not heard one word about the national health activities that I have mentioned. The only Government statements that have been published in the press have -related to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the medical benefits scheme. Reference has been made, it is true, to a liberalization of allowances for tubercular patients and their families. That again is in the &#34;hand-out&#34; class, but such payments are very necessary, and I throw back at the Government the unjustifiable criticism that honorable senators opposite and their colleagues in the House of Representatives offered when Labour occupied the bench. </para>

              <para>- I have already intimated to the Senate that, so far, the Commonwealth Minister for Health has not even consulted the State Health Ministers, although he has been saying for three months that he proposes to do so. I advert to this matter because I hope that honorable senators opposite who take an interest in national health, and are much closer to the Minister for Health than I am, will urge the right honorable gentleman on. In short, they should turn him around and give him a start. In conclusion, I ask the Government why secret discussions were held in Melbourne? Why was no record taken of those proceedings? What was there to hide? Why fool the British Medical Association and waste its time with proposals that had not been considered by the Government? Why pretend that there were no such proposals when, in fact, the British Medical Association itself is rejecting firmly, plans that it has dealt with on a completely firm basis. It is time that the Government took a hand and ascertained just what its Minister for Health is doing or is not doing. The Government should get on with the job of attending to the health of the Australian people. I should be happy to discuss this matter much further, but I have a car waiting to take me elsewhere. I make this contribution to the debate in the hope that some responsible member of the Government will frankly answer the questions that I have posed. </para>

            <para>. At the outset, I should like humbly to associate myself with the expressions of cordiality and affection that have been extended by other honorable senators to Their Majesties the King and Queen. I, too, look forward to offering to them a warm welcome to this country in  1952.  I should like also to express my appreciation of the unfailing courtesy that hae been shown to me by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> since I have been Leader of the Government in this chamber. However, I have no illusions about the honorable senator. I realize that he is a hard and unrelenting fighter. Knowing his devotion to his cause and to his party, I do not expect from him any departure from the party line. However, I do appreciate the extreme courtesy that I have received from him. </para>

          <para>I do not propose to deal at length with the Government&#39;s legislative programme outlined in the &#39; Governor-General&#39;s Speech. When the various bills come before this chamber, honorable senators will have an opportunity, of which I am sure they will avail themselves, to express their views upon the Government&#39;s proposals. In the course of this debate we have been privileged to listen to some excellent speeches from honorable senators on both sides of the chamber, and particularly from some honorable senators who have spoken here for the first time. We have heard excellent discourses on matters of great importance. Such speeches merit the fullest consideration of members of the Senate. Unfortunately, the very high tone of the debate has been somewhat marred by certain more experienced senators who should have known better. It is not my intention to indulge in a post-mortem as some honorable senators opposite have done. We on this side of the chamber are completely satisfied with the verdict that was given by the people of Australia on the 10th of December last. We believe that their decision was enlightened and sound. In the few months that have elapsed since the general election, the people have shown at by-elections at Concord and Wollongong, that they have not regretted their choice. Anyway, what is the use of holding a post-mortem ? The Labour party is dead. It was not poisoned or destroyed by the parties that now form the Government. It was slain by socialism. Honorable senators opposite should accept that verdict, and forsake their socialist leanings while there is still time. If they are still interested in politics, there may be room for them in the broad, wide, Australian platform of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. Honorable senators opposite may laugh at that suggestion, but I assure them that the charity and justice of the Liberal party are such that it would be prepared to accept some of them at least. It is rather extraordinary that, from seasoned and experienced senators, we have heard the same old hymn of hate sounding throughout the length and breadth of Australia, a note of discord and class bitterness. I do not know why they believe that they must continue to sing that hymn in order to commend themselves to those to whom they arc answerable for their preselection, but I can assure the Senate that nothing could be more un-Australian than the preaching of the doctrine of class warfare. Honorable senators opposite should realize tha.t in singing that hymn, they are harping on the precise theme of militant atheistic communism as propounded by Earl Marx - relentless class warfare and internecine bitterness. That has been the key-note of far too many speeches in this chamber. The assertion has been made, with an arrogance equal only to its falsity, that honorable senators opposite are the only ones who have any consideration for the working people. </para>

              <para>- &#34; Quite right &#34; says an honorable senator whose years should have taught him better.  I  repeat that the assertion to which I have referred is as arrogant as it is false. Have honorable senators opposite any real desire to propagate that arrant, hurtful nonsense? I do not believe that any one of them believes in his heart for one moment that there is an element of truth in that suggestion. In this country &#34; mateship &#34; has been given a spiritual meaning which is the pride of <inline font-style="italic">our</inline> peopleand the envy of people less happy than we are. When an Australian talks  of  mateship he means something that can never be completely understood by people of other lands. We have had that meaning impressed upon us by the hand  of  friendship which is freely extended in times of flood, drought, fire, and all the other vicissitudes through which our country passes from time to time.  Dohonorable  senators opposite suggest that, in time of distress, neighbourly help would be withheld until the religion and politics of the unfortunate victim had been ascertained? If any honorable senator opposite dared to make such a suggestion, he would be guilty of the grossest calumny on the people of Australia. That is not the Australian conception of mateship. In two wars men from banks, offices, professions, and farms, have fought shoulder to shoulder. </para>

This- is their country as much as it is ours, and it is ours as much as it is theirs. There are no classes in this country, as the enemies of Australia would have us believe.  Is  it suggested that when our boys were facing common dangers, sharing privations and fighting a common foe there  was any difference between them of race, religion or politics? Did the trade unionist who came from a coal mine or a shearing shed love our country any more or any less than the man who came from a professional office? Honorable senators opposite do a great disservice to this country when they try to peddle the nonsense that there is an inevitable class war between us, as one people. In the name of Christian decency, when we are living in a world that is bleeding, battered and broken, cannot we here, who have been sheltered and protected from the scourges that afflict less happy lands, at least get together and work out for the country that we all love something that will be worthy of the wonderful natural resources with which God has endowed it and the wonderful people that inhabits it? </para>

          <para>It has been suggested that this Government will not be happy until it has destroyed the great trade union movement. What utter nonsense that is! Every sane person in Australia realizes, not only that it is desirable to have a strong, sanely run and democratically controlled trade union movement, but also that the only alternative to it is industrial chaos. We on this side of the  chamber  are pledged to the protection of trade unionists and the trade union movement. It is true that since the industrial revolution there have been very sad chapters in the history of relationships between employers and employees. Prior to the industrial revolution, which occurred a little over 100 years ago, working conditions were shocking and abominable. Man&#39;s inhumanity to man indeed made countless thousands mourn. There was sweating and exploitation. But the awakened and indignant conscience of the people of England demanded, and gradually enforced, reforms. If my recollection be correct, the firstreform was the enactment of the Master and Servant Act in the 184.0&#39;s. From that time onwards there has been a continuous improvement of the lot of the worker &#171;nd a  restriction of exploitation and sweating. Since those days we have gone a long way, but there is still a long way to go. The way to better conditions does not lie along the arid, thorny and stony road of the bitterness and class warfare; it lies along the path of co-operation. </para>

              <para>- I am glad of that reservation. I am sorry if I misunderstood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice.</inline> However, it has been suggested by others who are perhaps not so wise or well-informed as he is that the only legislation designed to ameliorate the conditions of employees that appears on the statute-book was introduced by Labour governments. I do not wish to detract from the splendid legislation for which the Labour party has been responsible. It is something of which, not only the members of the Labour party but also honorable senators on this side of the chamber, as Australians, are proud. I point out, however, that legislation in connexion with employers&#39; liabilities, the recognition and protection of trade unions and their members and the control of factories and workshops was enacted long before there was u political Labour party. Honorable senators opposite, in fairness to the people that they represent, should study the industrial legislation that was enacted during the last century and this century. If they have any difficulty in understanding it, we shall be only too pleased to explain it to them. If they do that, when they make these wild statements we shall at least have the consolation of knowing that they are making them deliberately and in bad faith and not from sheer ignorance. If we are to have better conditions - and I am sure that with good will and co-operation we can secure them - they must come from greater production. One example will be sufficient  to emphasize the point that I am trying to make. If we have only a gallon of milk and each of 50 or 60 persons wants a pint of milk, there are only two ways by which those who wish to partake of milk may be enabled to do so. </para>

          <para class="block">This may be a laughing matter for honorable senators opposite, but we on this side of the chamber view with grave concern and alarm the present spiralling of costs. We know that money is not purchasing anything like what it should purchase. Every increase of wages is really a fraud on the unfortunate recipient of the increase, because it will not buy for him anything like what it should buy. The reason is that the milk has been adulterated. No more milk has been produced, and no more cows are being milked. Money has been adulterated, because it does not purchase for our people the things that they need so urgently. </para>
          <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay</inline> was referring to the Government&#39;s projected legislation, he said, perhaps with, some truth, that it has been the militant trade union leader who, through the years, has been responsible for obtaining so much for the people and the trade union movement. It has been said here and in another place, but for the sake of good nature I shall repeat it, that we on this side of the chamber believe as firmly as does anybody else that a strong trade union movement is not only desirable but necessary. Where wrong, injustice or indecency prevails, I trust that I shall always be a militant rebel against it, and I hope that we shall always have militant rebels against injustice and indecency. But that remark does not apply to the persons who are pledged to wreck the Australian trade union movement and also Australia itself. There is a wide difference between an honest militant trade union leader, who is trying to improve the conditions of his fellows, and a man who is pledged to destroy, not only the Australian trade union movement but also the very way of life that we cherish. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay</inline> knows as well as I do that there are some men prominent in many trade unions who have no more interest in the trade unionists of our country than has the man in the moon. They are saboteurs for a foreign country. They are enemies of this country, and they shall be treated as such. Honorable senators opposite and the members of the Labour party in the House of Representatives will soon be given an opportunity to declare precisely where they stand in relation to the wreckers, saboteurs and paid agents of a foreign power, who hold nothing sacred and are prepared to destroy everything that we, as Australians, hold dear. Those persons will be dealt with. The trade union movement will be guilty of hypocrisy and of doing a great disservice to this country if it allows itself to be used by those persons as a shield. The trade union movement is quite safe in the hands of this Government, and we shall not interfere with its domestic affairs. </para>

Less than 5 per cent, of the Australian people are employers, and we- received - I do not wish to rub it in - a very handsome and comforting majority of votes. Therefore, it goes without saying that a. tremendous number of earnest trade unionists, who did not want their unions to be destroyed, thought that the welfare and safety of the unions would be in better and more capable hands while this Government was in power than it would be if honorable senators opposite were in power. </para>

              <para>- I was a  deputy  leader of the Opposition, but I like being on this side of the chamber much better. I have much pleasure in wishing the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> a long term of office. If honorable senators opposite have reason to believe that we are exceeding the terms of the mandate that we have received from the people or bringing Forward legislation that they feel runs counter to the principles to which they are pledged quite openly, I expect opposition from them. I have &#39; said before, and now I repeat it, that a fair and strong Opposition is a great corrective and directive of the policy of a government. The Opposition in this chamber is strong. It remains to be seen whether it will be fair. I think that it will be. It has been suggested from time to time that the last Government  was, while it was in office, the repository of all the wisdom, sanity and patriotism in the country. We do not claim, now that we are in office, a monopoly of those virtues, but we think that we possess them in good measure. If from time to time the Opposition, which represents a very substantial body of Australians, sees fit to help us by way of a corrective or a directive, its contribution could be a tremendous one. We hope that honorable senators opposite, from their generosity and sense of service, will give us of the best that is in them, and that they will not oppose us merely for the sake of opposing us. We a.re facing together very difficult, very troubled times. Our common country is entitled to the best that each of us can give to the solving of its problems. </para>

            <para>. - Last week I drew the attention of the Senate to the appalling number of motor cycle accidents that are occurring throughout Australia, resulting in the death or permanent disablement of many persons. Usually, when one picks up a newspaper, the first item to catch his eye is an account of a motor cycle accident in which either the rider, the pillion passenger, or some other person has been killed or injured. As this matter is one of national importance, I recently asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> to request the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to consider introducing legislation to minimize the terrific loss of life of citizens of both sexes in this country. Many young persons have been killed in this manner. As a result, the country has been deprived of the contributions that those citizens could have made to the nation&#39;s welfare. The Minister agreed that this matter was of great national importance, and stated that there was already in existence in this country, on an Australia- wide basis, a Road Safety Council, which included representatives of the Government, who conferred with State bodies. The Minister undertook to place my suggestion before the Prime Minister, and said that he would supply me, in due course, with any information available on this subject. I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for his reply, arising out of which I considered that I should endeavour to place further information on this matter before the Senate. As a result of my inquiries I am of the opinion that the Constitution of the Commonwealth pre.cludes the Parliament from legislating on the lines indicated.  I  believe that this is a matter for State jurisdiction, and that it is competent for the State parliaments to enact appropriate legislation. I consider that they should introduce uniform legislation to deal with this problem. It is for that reason, that I suggested that this subject should be placed on the agenda for the next conference between Commonwealth and State Ministers. </para>

          <para>In the final analysis I consider that unless remedial measures are introduced, the Iws of life, particularly of our young people, as a result of accidents in which motor cycles are involved, will soon exceed the loss of Australian lives in the recent war. &#34;Whilst that statement is somewhat strong, my contention is borne out by the frequency with which reports of fatal motor cycle accidents are published in the press. The Commonwealth is already assisting the Road Safety Council financially, and various bodies associated with it which are doing a good job. Recently I wrote to the National Safety Council of Western Australia, Incorporated, drawing attention to the loss of life and disablement of our young people in the manner that I have outlined. I pointed out that the modern motor cycle may be too powerful for our youngsters to handle. I do not know whether that is so or not. However, I have frequently seen young men of small physique, riding powerful motor cycles. I consider that persons who purchase these machines should be required to undergo a period of training in the handling of them before being permitted to take them into normal traffic. Even then it may be advisable to prescribe that the speed of those motor cycles shall be&#39; governed for a period of about three months. I point out that persons who purchase new motor cars drive them at a nominal speed until the vehicles are run-in. Yet, as matters stand, young people frequently drive new motor cycles at fast rates of speed immediately after taking delivery of them. I stress that I do not desire to interfere with the liberty of the subject. However, in view of its national importance, I consider that this matter should receive attention as soon as possible. It is the duty of the elected representatives of the people to take whatever action is possible to protect the lives of persons who use motor cycles, particularly the younger members of the community. </para>

            <para>In 104.8, in conjunction with representative* from the Western Australian Motor Cyclists Association and others, we formed a special committee to consider this problem, and some eighteen months ago this council formed a Motor Cycle Safe Riding School, classes  being  held each Saturday afternoon in the Metropolitan Markets, West Perth. </para>
            <para>This school is conducted with the cooperation of the Motor Cycle Traders (who- make available cycles on which students may loam), and members of the various Motor Cycle- Clubs give their time gratis as voluntary instructors on a roster system. Tuition is free, and each student undergoes a course of at least four to five afternoons&#39; instruction, including both theory and practice as well as a lecture on Traffic Regulations given by a member of the Police Examining Stan&#34; who attends each week for this purpose and also to examine students on the Highway Regulations on completion of the course of instruction. At the conclusion of the course students are given a practical riding test and a  Traffic  Regulation test, and, on passing, are handed &#38; certificate that they are capable and proficient to ride <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> motor cycle. On presentation of this certificate at the Police Traffic Office, a Rider&#39;s Licence is given without farther examination, and so faT 138 students have earned these certificates. Of these, according to our records, none has been involved in an accident for which he was held blameworthy. </para>

          <para class="block">Similar bodies are carrying out good work in the interests of road safety throughout Australia. I emphasize that in a period of approximately eighteen months 138 students earned certificates; but what is 138 compared with the number of motor cycles purchased during that time? The law does not compel any of these people to have a period of tuition. As long as they can satisfy the traffic department of the police force that they can ride a motor cycle and know the regulations in respect to traffic, they can receive a licence. I will close by quoting one incident that took place not long ago in Western Australia. A young man went into a motor cycle agency. He bought a motor cycle, rode to a point about two streets away and was killed. That is an indication of the necessity for the State governments to give consideration to this matter. In the interests of the people of this country, of the young fellows who purchase motor cycles and ride them, and of the citizens who are likely to be run down, I ask the Government to give this matter earnest attention. I hope the information that I have supplied will -he of value to the Minister when he places the matter before the Prime Minister. </para>

              <para>-  I signed the pledge. I left the party in 1927 because I was opposed to the new rules which, is my opinion, made the then leader of the parliamentary party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> a dictator within the party. I remained outside the party until 1931. I shall relate the circumstances in which I rejoined the party. The party had been divided in the House of Representatives by two sections leaving it. The party disintegrated and in those circumstances, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Soullin</inline> was fighting for his political life, I rejoined the . political Labour party and took an active part in the campaign to save the party from destruction. I remained a member of the Australian Labour party in New South Wales, which was wrongly described in the journals and by press publicity as the Federal Labour party, until it rejoined the Lang party, which had broken away. I was never a member of the Lang party with the pledge and the type of platform it had after 1927. I was a member of two federal conferences and I took part in decisions which affected the platform of the party. On all those decisions my voice and my vote were quite consistent with the attitude I am taking now. I opposed the alteration of that platform about banking and I stood for a banking policy which is similar to what the Government is bringing forward now. I failed to renew my membership when it was certain that the party would rejoin the Lang party, because I objected to the policy that it had pursued ever since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> and his group obtained ascendancy in New South Wales. </para>

          <para>I will state very briefly my reasons for refusing to rejoin the re-united party under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin.</inline> I tad the greatest admiration and respect for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> and for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley.</inline> For the rest, I thought the party was quite incapable of governing the country. When I was a member of the federal conference a motion was submitted - and there are two honorable senators sitting opposite who supported it - to the effect that Australia would take part in no war until an enemy had actually landed in the country. I was instrumental in defeating that most stupid proposal, and I made up my mind then that never would I trust a body that could even talk in such a foolish way on foreign affairs. On the matter of the pledge, I left because I had no longer a &#39;belief in socialism. I was a convert to socialism at an early age, as many are, when without experience of the world, and purely on academic grounds. Later I came to the conclusion that the federal platform meant what it said, and not as various people say, that it means merely taking over this industry or that industry. I believed that it meant complete collectivism! Being opposed to that, I got out. That is all I have to say. If there are honorable senators who think that &#62;a person who changes his opinion, and makes his change public, is a &#34;rat&#34; or a traitor, they are welcome to that opinion. I believe that if a man changes his opinion, it is his duty to register that change, and to make it public If the term applied by the honorable senator is applicable to me, it is applicable to many men in politics. I could mention some prominent examples here, but I know the kind of outcry that follows a recital of their names in almost any Labour atmosphere. Honorable senators will know them without any mention of them by me. Among the men who can be called by the foul word used toy the honorable senator opposite are the younger Pitt, Palmerston, who was one of the greatest secretaries for foreign affairs that Great Britain ever had, Gladstone, Disraeli, Joseph Chamberlain, Churchill, and Abraham Lincoln. </para>
