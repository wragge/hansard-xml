          <para>. - The statement made by the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> is very important to the people of Australia. Its importance is emphasized by the fact that the Parliament has been called together specially to hear it. I regret that the Leader of the Government was unable to furnish me with a copy of the statement earlier than the time at which it was handed to me. However, I appreciate the position in which he is placed. I point out that the statement is practically a plain historical record. With the exception of the motion, it contains nothing that we have not already read in the press. The limitation of the information is rather surprising to me. The Opposition is prepared to assist in any way possible, but if the Government wants the Opposition to accept responsibility in this matter, then it should furnish the Opposition with the fullest information on this matter. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>On behalf of the Opposition, I agree that there is a need for a united Korea. That aim has the full support of the Australian Labour party. Fifty-nine nations are honorably bound to give support to the views of the United Nations. The basic policy of the Australian Labour party is to support the United Nations and the Security Council of that organization. The Opposition has prepared a reply to the statement made by the Leader of the Government. </para>
        <para>The Federal Parliamentary Labour party- has given consideration to the armed attack made upon the Republic of </para>
        <para class="block">Korea by the forces of North Korea. The Security Council of the United Nations determined that such armed attack constituted a breach of international peace within the meaning of the United Nations Charter. It called upon North Korea to withdraw forthwith its armed forces to the existing boundary between North Korea and South Korea at the 38th parallel of latitude. That direction of the Security Council was disobeyed. Accordingly, the Security Council decided that urgent military measures were required to re-establish peace and security, and recommended to members of the United Nations that assistance should be furnished to the Republic of Korea in order to repel the armed attack made upon it by North Korea. It is part of the basic policy of the Australian Labour movement to give "steady and unwavering support for the United Nations, and for the purposes and principles declared in the United Nations Charter " and also to achieve " co-operation within the British Commonwealth of Nations in support of the United Nations organization for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security". These objectives have consistently been applied by federal Labour governments since the foundation of the United Nations in 1945. </para>
        <para>The United Nations Charter aims ai the preservation of international peace by providing that force shall be employed by the organization in preventing and repelling breaches of the peace and armed aggression.. . The territorial integrity of the Republic of Korea has been infringed by the armed forces of North Korea. The Security Council was clearly warranted in deciding that armed force should be employed by the United. Nations for the purpose of restoring international peace in the area. Consequently, the actions of those members of the United Nations in complying with the request of the Security Council by placing at its disposal certain armed forces were entirely justified, and the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand acted in strict conformity with their obligations under the United Nations Charter. </para>
        <para>In 1947, the United Nations intervened in the problem of establishing </para>
        <para class="block">Korean independence by the appointment of a General Assembly Commission the primary function of which was to take preliminary steps to establish a unified and independent Korea, in accordance with the promises made to the Korean people by the Allied leaders during "World War II. and endorsed subsequently by the General Assembly itself. The commission was continued in existence by the General Assembly in 1948 and 1949. The present objective of the  Unied  Nations is not only the restoration of international peace but alao the early establishment of a united, democratic, and independent Korea which will itself, in due course, become a member of the United Nations. In the view of the Labour party it is essential that this twofold objective shall be kept constantly in view. </para>
        <para>The Labour party has also considered the military contribution to the United Nations that Australia should be prepared to make in the present Korean situation. The United Nations Charter contemplates that the contingents to be provided by a member should be fair and reasonable, having regard to the total membership of the United Nations and to the capacity of the contributing nations. Accordingly, while approving of commitments already announced by the Australian Government in relation to Korea, the Labour party is strongly of the opinion that any additional commitments should be undertaken only with the approval of the Parliament. It is also strongly of the opinion that, parallel with the military action now being taken, the United Nations should also take action by way of meditation and conciliation to bring about the voluntary withdrawal of the forces of North Korea to their own territory and the establishment of a United Nations authority for the purpose of bringing into being an independent, democratic, and united Korea, in accordance  with  the Declaration of Cairo of 1.943 and the subsequent Declaration of Potsdam. </para>
        <para>Whilst it is not always opportune to call the Parliament together, and it is realized that certain matters must be dealt with urgently, I stress that any future Australian commitments should have the approval of the Parliament. The Opposition desires to be furnished with as much information as possible about this matter, although it is realized that much of the information received by the Government in relation to international disputation is of a secret character, which should not be disseminated either amongst members of the Parliament or the community generally. The action taken by the Government was not an action of war but was in keeping with the decision of the Security Council. In effect, a police force is to be provided. It is the sincere wish of the Opposition that the police force that is about to take part in the present disputation will be able to restore peace on both sides of the 3Sth parallel and bring about a united Korea, because nothing is of such benefit to the members of a community or country as self-government and self-control. </para>

            <para>.- On the 10th May, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty</inline> asked me a question relating to the production of flour in South Australia. In previous replies to similar questions the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> has stated that the Australian "Wheat Board is doing everything possible in an endeavour to sell flour overseas instead of wheat. The hoard, in this endeavour, has sold flour at a reduced price to ensure sales. A general reluctance to buy flour has been evident on the part of buying countries, which want to buy the wheat and mill it themselves in order to obtain the offals for feeding purposes. The volume of flour sales which the board has made recently is such as to enable South Australian flour mills to increase production above the volume being produced in recent months. </para>
