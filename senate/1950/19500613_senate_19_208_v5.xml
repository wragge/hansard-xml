                        <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the  Treasurer. Is it a fact that the Government has gwen consideration to the appreciation of the &#163;1? If adopted, will this action have an adverse effect on Australian manufacturers? Is it expected that unemployment will result in consequence of the Australian manufacturers being unable to compete on overseas markets ? Is it expected . that primary producers and manufacturers will carry the total impact if the Australian &#163;1 is appreciated ? </para>

                        <para>- Will the Minister representing the Prime Minister say whether the Government considers that one method that should be employed in re-establishing the value of the Australian &#163;1 is to appreciate it? Is the Government now considering the problem, and is it a fact that a mass of information has been placed before it by experts indicating the effect which appreciation of the &#163;1 would have on the Australian economy and the international repercussions that such action would cause ? Will the Minister also say whether it is not a fact that during the last election campaign both the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> stated that all that was necessary to restore the value of the &#163;1 was to defeat the Chifley Labour Government ? Is it also a fact that at the moment Cabinet is divided into three warring factions due largely to the representation in the Cabinet of the Australian Country party, which is opposed to currency appreciation? If the Minister considers that the foregoing questions relate to a matter of Government policy, and for that reason lie does not desire to answer them at the moment, will he at least give the Senate an assurance that a full statement will be made on the matter, which is of considerable importance? </para>

                        <para>- It is rather amazing that the honorable senator should have mentioned three warring factions. I do not listen to gossip as a rule, but I understand that there are three factions in the Labour party at present. There are those who want to play with the Communists ; those who are afraid to fight the Communists; and those who want to fight the Communists. I assure the honorable senator that the Government takes a very serious view of spiralling costs. It is very worried about the lack of co-operation from the Labour party. It is very worried because certain individuals who have a vast influence with the producers of the things that we need, are not using that influence to help the people of this country, because, after all, regardless of our political affiliations, the people of Australia are our people and our responsibility. I suggest that the honorable senator should give me details of caucus discussions that took place when  Mr. Chifley  was Prime Minister. Then, if there is any merit in the decisions that were reached, I shall be quite prepared to recommend them to my leader.</para>

                        <para>- I direct the following questions to the Minister representing the Minister for Health: - 1. In view of the fact that the Liberal-Country parties refused to separate social service payments from taxation when in opposition, will the Minister tell this chamber how he intends to convince the Australian taxpayer that payments made on behalf of the national health scheme to an approved friendly society or other insurance is not added taxation? 2. Can it be assumed that because  members  of the privileged class are able to pay for, higher medical benefits and thus obtain specialized treatment, they are considered by the Liberal-Australian Country party Government to be of greater value to the nation than to the wage-earners? 3. Will, any adjustment be made to the basic wage to enable the wage-earner to insure his family on an equal basis with that obtainable under the national health scheme by the more privileged class of the community? </para>

New Guinea lias been sanctified by the blood and bones of our gallant boys who died there. This is one matter in respect of which we can speak with a united voice. That area is sacred to Australia. </para>

Has the new duty been imposed for the sole purpose of protecting the Australian weaving industry? Is it true that there are at (present large stocks of British rayon goods in Australia? If so, will the Government do everything possible to prevent the tariff increase from being passed on to the Australian consumers in respect of stocks of rayon cloth already in Australia? </para>

                        <para>- This is a matter in regard to which I am sure that we can all take an Australian view. We must protect our Australian industries if they are able to compete on an economic basis. Fortunately there are matters which we can elevate above politics, and one of them is our attitude towards our own industries. The honorable senator was misinformed about the duty, which is to be ls. 6d. a square yard, not 2s. 6d. The original duty was l&#163;d. a square yard. Honorable senators may have seen statements in the press that the increased duty will be calamitous. The same sort of thing was said when it was first proposed to place a protective duty on woollen goods, but we are now in the happy position of being able to compete with overseas woollen manufacturers, and even to undercut them. During the war, the rayon industry became an essential one, and certain undertakings were given by the Labour Government. I entirely approve of those undertakings, and the present Government is now honoring them. This is not a small insignificant industry. Over &#163;3,000,000 is invested in it, and more than 3,000 persons are employed on conditions and at rates of pay which are the envy of people in other parts of the world. We wish to preserve those conditions, and we must protect our industries. I was expecting some one to ask me how this increase of duty would affect our undertaking to restore value to the &#163;1. It will not affect the position at all. In this matter, the Government has adopted a recommendation made by the Tariff Board, which is a non-party tribunal that acts in a judicial capacity. Every interested party is given an opportunity, not only to give evidence before the board but also to be represented by advocates. This industry was established during a war and rendered very valuable assistance to this country in that war. Australia has never engaged in an aggressive war, but we may have to fight again to protect our way of life. If we have to do so, this industry will be of great assistance to us. All honorable senators will doubtless agree that we must preserve anything that we consider to be essential to the preservation of our way of life. </para>

                        <para>- I have had tentative discussions about the possibility of providing trained nurses to attend to the care of aged people needing attention. The consensus of opinion in my department was that it would not be practicable to institute such a scheme, unless hospital facilities were increased in order to provide appropriate accommodation. It is not considered that a sufficient number of qualified nurses would be available to visit homes of the aged for this purpose. </para>

                        <para>- At present, the subsidy of 8s. a day a bed is payable only to registered hospitals. The adoption of the suggestion would involve a departure from the existing practice and I should have to give a lot of thought to the desirability of payment of the subsidy in respect of private homes where nursing sisters care for the aged. There must be a better method of approaching this problem. </para>

I think that we must all feel very distressed for those unfortunate members of the half-caste population who miss the best of both and get the worst of both races. This is a matter in respect of which the Commonwealth has no power to legislate except in regard to its territories. In Queensland a very human approach is made to the problem. Any suggestion that any honorable senator might make to improve the lot of these people and make life happier and more  livaBle  for them would receive the sympathetic consideration of whatever government was in power. If the honorable senator has in mind an idea to assist them, and communicates it to me at <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> convenient time, I shall be only too pleased to pass it on not only to my colleagues in the Cabinet, but also to the various State governments. </para>

                        <para>- That is the voice of the majority. Under the Liberal Australian Country party Government democracy rules, and the voice of the majority prevails. However, since the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> relates to a very worthy objective, I should very much like him to place his representations in writing, so that I may bring them before Cabinet. I think that we should make some effort to make the lives of the aborigines a little happier than they are at present. </para>

                    <para>. - When this clause was under consideration on Thursday the committee was considering an amendment to sub-clause (3.) that I had moved on behalf of the Opposition. The clause deals with unlawful organization; other than the Australian Communist party and, of course, other than industrial organizations. In his last comments upon what had taken place in committee, the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> dealt at some considerable length with the subject of onus of proof, but that matter is not germane to the point that the committee is considering. In the course of his remarks on the amendment that I had moved, the Attorney-General made the point that the declaration of an organization by the Governor-General in Council was not analogous to an offence because there was no fine or imprisonment. The Opposition is appalled at the very light regard that the Attorney-General has shown for the consequences of the declaration of an organization by the Governor-General in Council. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Under this clause, it is proposed to declare an organization upon two counts. </para>
                <para class="block">The first is that it is Communist affected or infected, and that covers the four classes of cases set out in sub-clause 1. Of those four, the first is that the organization is affiliated with the Australian Communist party. The second is that a majority of its members are members of the Communist party or that its executive committee is dominated by Communists. The third class comprises organizations which support the principles or practices of communism asexpounded by Marx and Lenin. The fourth covers a very wide range of organizations. It includes an organization that is influenced in its deliberations by Communists, possibly only two Communists, who use their positions to advocate communism.For the sake of brevity I refer to all those four classes as those that are Communist affected or infected. That is the first point of declaration by the Governor-General. </para>
                <para>The second is the more serious of the two points of allegation against an organization. It provides for a pronouncement by the Governor-General that the continued existence of an organization would be prejudicial to the security of the country. I cannot imagine any more grave charge. Very plainly implicit in that allegation is an allegation of treason, or sedition. The consequences of such a declaration are very serious. The organization will be dissolved and will cease to exist and the whole of its property will be taken by the Commonwealth. Such a declaration by the Governor-General would amount to a sentence of death on the organization, but that would not be the end of the matter, because the mere declaration of an organization would leave on its members all the opprobrium that would flow from their membership of a body which had been declared to be prejudicial to the security of the country. The Opposition does not view the consequence of a declaration lightly, but we view even more seriously the allegation that a body is prejudicial to the security of the country than we do the allegation that it is Communist infected or affected. A body may be declared on the ground that it is Communist infected, and that it is prejudicial to the security of the country. </para>
                <para class="block">The declared body may appeal to the court on one allegation only, namely, that it is Communist infected. It is to be expressly prevented from appealing to the court on the ground that it is prejudicial to the security of the country. The court may not even examine that allegation. It may consider only whether the declared body falls within one of the four classes of organizations mentioned in this legislation. Thus, in regard to the very serious allegation that a body is prejudicial to the safety of the country, a declaration that means a sentence of death to the organization and grievously affects all its members, the Executive is to be the accuser, the judge, the jury and the dispenser of punishment. The declaration by the Executive cannot be reviewed at any stage whatsoever. </para>
                <para>Another objection-able feature is that the organization against which the allegation is made will never be supplied with particulars of what is alleged against it. It will never have an opportunity to learn from the Executive, or in a court, or at any time whatsoever, the grounds upon which it was declared by the Executive to constitute a risk to the security of the country. That is bad enough, but I ask the committee to consider the really absurd position into which the Government will get itself if it persists in its present attitude. As I have said, a body may be declared on two grounds, first, that it is Communist infected, and, secondly, that it is prejudicial to the security of the country. The organization can appeal in respect of the first allegation only, and if the court finds that the allegation has been wrongly made the court will set aside the whole of the declaration, involving the two counts. Thus, although in the opinion of the Government, the body is Communist infected or affected, and constitutes a danger to the security of the country, and although the Government has expressed that opinion in the most public way by a &#39; notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazelle,</inline> the body will continue in existence if it can prove that it is not Communist infected. Could there be a more absurd position than that? Therefore, in order to remedy that absurd position, as well as in common fairness to the bodies concerned, the fullest recourse should be allowed to the court. In his second-reading speech, the Attorney-General said in unequivocal terms that a declaration would be made by the full Cabinet only, upon the soundest evidence, and I take it that he was referring to the declaration of a body as well as that of an individual. Notwithstanding that statement, a declared body will be able to continue in existence if it can satisfy the court that it is not Communist infected even though, in the opinion of the Government, the body is prejudicial to the safety of the country. </para>
                <para>Why is the Government unwilling to allow the court to deal with the second count in the indictment against a declared body? Is it afraid to allow the court to examine the arbitrary declaration by the Government? I remind Ministers that, during the election campaign, their slogan was &#34;Vote Liberal for freedom &#34;. Surely the Government does not argue that what it is now proposing is freedom, that the mere say-so of the Executive should determine for ever the matter between the organization and itself? Is that just? Is there any  element  of freedom in that proposal? It is against that kind of arbitrary executive action that the democracies fought in the last war. They fought to stop that sort of thing from sweeping over Europe. The Opposition objects most strongly to the Government&#39;s proposal, and I am astonished that I should have to urge my point of view with so much vehemence. In his policy speech before the last election, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> declared that, if he were returned to power, he would introduce legislation to outlaw the Communist party,  and expropriate its property, and he added - </para>
                <para>Subject to appeal, the Attorney-General will be empowered to declare other bodies substantially Communist; to follow the party into any new form, and attach illegality to that new association. </para>
                <para>I emphasize the words &#34; subject to appeal &#34;. </para>

                    <para>. -  On Thursday night, I stated the Government&#39;s view of this amendment and advanced  a  number of reasons why it is not acceptable to us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has failed to face up to the real issue raised by the amendment. Last Thursday I reminded the Opposition that it had accepted the position that the Communist party is a menace to the security and defence of the Commonwealth. Consequently, as I understand it. the Opposition has accepted the view that the Communist party should be dissolved without any trial at all. This clause is concerned with organizations that are affiliated with the Communist party and with organizations that present members of the party m.ay form in the future. It would be nonsense to abolish the Communist party without also making provision to meet the circumstances that would arise after its abolition, or attempting to prevent it from establishing another organization, under a different name, to do the work that the party had been doing in the past. This clause is directed against organizations of that kind. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>We could have presented to the Parliament a clause that stated that an organization of the kind to which 1 have referred should be abolished, but that it should have a right of appeal upon the question of whether it was an organization covered by the definition contained in the clause. The Government has not gone as far as that. It has imposed a limitation upon the circumstances in which such a body may be declared to be an. unlawful organization. The mere fact that it is affiliated with the Communist party or, if you like, that is a future manifestation of the party, will not be a sufficient ground for declaring it to be an unlawful organization. It is proposed that the Governor-General shall be required to go a step further than that. He must be satisfied that the continued existence of the body of persons in question would be prejudicial to the security and defence of the Commonwealth. In other words he must be satisfied, not merely that the organization is a Communist organization, but also, to put it shortly, that it is a subversive organization. I say deliberately that we cannot permit an appeal upon the second question. </para>

I shall read again the passage from the judgment that I read on that occasion, because it expresses very clearly the reasons why this matter cannot become the subject of an appeal.

                <para class="block">That was a plain statement. It is clearly applicable to the set of circumstances that we are discussing now. In the final analysis, the Executive must accept responsibility for the determination of all questions affecting the maintenance of national security. How would it be possible, under any circumstances, to put into the possession of a court or a jury all the information that a government necessarily possesses regarding what is desirable and undesirable from the viewpoint of national security? How could such matters be discussed adequately in a court? How would it be possible to put a judge or, as the Opposition suggests, a jury, in possession of all the material relevant to such an issue? Some of it might be confidential information supplied by the governments of other countries. Even if some of the information were made available to the court or the jury, how would it be possible for the tribunal to be placed in possession of all the material that goes to make up the background of the information upon which a government determines questions of this kind? </para>

                <para>I suggest that this is a very serious matter from the point of view of carrying on the government of this country. In the course of the debate upon this bill, some honorable senators opposite have emphasized the point that I am attempting to make. I have said on several occasions, and I repeat it now, that the Parliament must accept responsibility for what appears in the preamble to the bill, but members of the Labour .party have sought to escape that responsibility by saying, in effect, &#34; The information is in the possession of the Government, which knows more about it than we do, because it has been in office for the last six months &#34;. Apparently the Labour party says that it is prepared to accept the word of the Government that the Australian Communist party is a subversive organization. </para>

                        <para>- On the contrary, lie did. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morrow</inline> had been in his place the other day, instead of running away when a vote was being taken, he &#34;would have heard some extracts from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe&#39;s report which completely supported what I have stated. In the final analysis, the dealing with the organizations becomes a matter of government responsibility. The government of the day has to say in its declaration - and it will do so if the occasion arises - that the continued existence of a specified organization is detrimental to the defence of Australia. I suggest that if the government of the day were prepared to make such a serious and solemn declaration it would ,be impossible to find any tribunal in this country that could really perform the function of a court of appeal from that decision. I do not intend my remarks as a reflection on any tribunal. No tribunal could be put in possession of all the information that the Government possessed, upon which a sound judgment had been formed. </para>

First, I referred with emphasis to the fact that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> stated in his policy speech in November last that, subject to appeal, these various auxiliary bodies would be dealt with. &#34;We have not heard one word from the Minister upon that subject. I invite him to tell the Senate his version of those words in the right honorable gentleman&#39;s policy speech. The Attorney-General will be empowered to declare other bodies substantially &#34; Communist &#34;. to follow them into any new form, and attach illegality to that new association. I invite him to reply to the suggestion that, in the minds of the electors, &#34; subject to appeal &#34;, means subject to a full appeal, not a part appeal. I also challenge him to deny that every elector who heard those words, or has read them, understood them to mean &#34; subject to appeal to a court of law&#34;, and that there is imported into those words &#34; appeal according to the due processes of the law in the ordinary courts of the land &#34;. </para>

                        <para>- They have an application, not an appeal. I shall be quite specific in the matter of terms. There is the declaration, and an application to a court limited, to one ground only. That is not an appeal, but an application. The appeal is a matter not provided for in this bill. It will be dealt with in Opposition amendments. So that we may understand each other, we are speaking about the declaration, application on one ground only, and - at a later stage in our discussions - appeals. That may save some confusion. The Attorney-General has not dealt with the position that I put to the Senate. Despite all that he says about the grave danger that these bodies constitute, and his contention that the Executive of the day should not be called upon to say one word about how very dangerous they are, he does not deal with the absurd position I put to the Senate that so long as they are not Communistinfected they can be as dangerous as they like and apply themselves to the destruction of the community. The Minister should furnish the committee with a direct answer on that phase of the matter. Although an appeal is permitted on only &#39;one  point;  is it not true, that if the organization wins that point, despite the story the Government tells the court of the great danger that this  organiaztion  is to the country, the bill, as drafted, will allow it to continue unfettered on its way? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister should not seek to evade the issue. Let us deal with one point at a time. Is it, or is it not, true that as long as the court, on this application, finds that the body is not Communist infected or affected, no matter how treacherous, traitorous, or dangerous to the security of this country the Executive may regard it, that body may nevertheless run free under this measure? That is the mo.-t absurd position that could be created by any law. The Attorney-General did not even mention that m&#62;atter and I invite him to face up to it frankly when he p.peaks. I also invite him to say something on another matter, namely, whether he considers that the allegation that an organization is Communist-infected is more serious than an allegation that the existence of that organization is prejudicial to national security. To judge from his remarks, he regards security as paramount. I therefore invite him to say whether he agrees with the case that I put on behalf of the Opposition to the effect that an allegation that the existence of an organization is prejudicial to national security is by far the most serious charge that could be made against it. I have mentioned at least three matters which the Attorney-General has not confronted. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>Now, I propose to confront the specific matters with which he asked me and the Opposition generally to deal. In the first place, he sought to make some point of the fact that the Opposition&#39;s case for a fuller right of appeal on behalf of bodies other than the Australian Communist party did not include any denunciation of that party. Let me say at once that the Australian Communist party stands on an altogether separate footing from other organizations, inasmuch as its operations and functions are known. As a matter of fact, the Opposition has denounced the Australian Communist party and in doing so has uttered almost every word contained in the recitals in the preamble to the bill. We believe those recitals to be substantially true. Although the Attorney-General said that he would not accept the suggestion that I made, on behalf of the Opposition, in my second-reading speech that the formulation of the preamble was the sole responsibility of the Government because it is armed with knowledge that no other political body possesses, I draw his attention to the fact that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has supported my view of the matter. If the Attorney-General will refer to the remarks made by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives on the 18th May he will find that the right honorable gentleman said - </para>
                <para>I repeat, that in relation to such matters any democratic Parliament confronted by a state of affairs such as exists to-day, will properly repose a great deal of responsibility in the government, which should have, and must have, more knowledge of the security affairs of Australia than anybody else outside the Security Service itself oan have. </para>
                <para>Those words of the Prime Minister support the case I made in my second-reading speech on behalf of the Opposition. Putting on one side altogether the Australian Communist party, whose views are known to all, let us examine the position of other bodies with which the bill deals. Every conceivable kind of association, from organi zations closely related to the Communist party to bodies such as school committees, will be embraced by the clause. In response to the pressing remarks that I made in an earlier speech the Attorney-General admitted that the provisions of the bill are very wide. I claim that they are exceedingly wide; in fact, they are wide enough to embrace any organization and to pick up any individual. The Attorney-General asks us to accept the position that although an organization may be subversive, because it may include only a few Communists among its members, it may continue to function quite freely. At the same time he wants to spread &#39;the net so wide that once the Government has made the grand declaration that a body is Communist-controlled and is a danger to the country any member of it may be declared, and no one may question the Executive&#39;s action. In other words, the Executive is to be the accuser, the judge and the executioner. That conception is so completely opposed to justice, to law and to all the ordinary ideas of freedom that it amazes me that the Government should resist our proposal to alter it. After all, what is the Government resisting? All we ask is that an opportunity should be given for the courts to examine the very serious allegation that will be made by the Government when it declares an organization. I think that the position adopted by the Government in this matter is dreadful. After all, we are at peace with the world at present. Let me add here that, frankly, I deplore the comments made by the Prime Minister in the course of his second-reading speech, when he went as near to making a declaration of war on Russia as any government could have done. If there is a &#34; cold &#34; war - and I deplore the use of such cliches and terms in relation to other nations because the only purpose they serve is to accentuate differences - the speech made by the right honorable gentleman would have made the warlike situation worse. </para>
                <para>In the course of his speech the Attorney-General referred to a case decided by the Privy Council in 1916. I remind the Minister that from 1914 to 191S a world war was being waged, and that 1916 coincided with the height of that war. At that time England and the democracies were fighting for their lives. </para>

                        <para>- It depends on the degree of emergency with which a nation is confronted. Take the position in war-time. Because of the peril confronting the nation everything except measures for defence may have to go overboard. The ordinary way of life of members of the community, including their freedom to choose their employment, to travel and to do a thousand and one other things, disappears. Their normal liberties are temporarily withheld, and they may even be drafted into service and sent overseas. If the emergency is sufficiently grave, every ordinary civil right goes overboard. But does the Attorney-General, or any other member of the Government suggest that Australia is <inline font-style="italic">in extremis</inline> to-day, that the foe is at our gates, and that everything is falling around us? One could not imagine any more absurd suggestion than that. In reply to the case cited by the Attorney-General, I remind him of the decision of the Privy Council in the litigation that arose out of the loss of <inline font-style="italic">Thetis,</inline> a submarine that went down with all hands off the coast of England. The court took up the most extraordinary position, reserving to a Minister of the Crown the right to withhold all information from it merely because he claimed that information relating to the loss of the vessel would be prejudicial to national security. Undoubtedly courts are affected by the fact that the country may be engaged in a state of war at the time they deliver their judgments. If the Minister will study, with the undoubted ability which he possesses, the report of the <inline font-style="italic">Thetis</inline> case, I have no doubt that he will come to the same conclusion on the judgment delivered in that case as I did. I shall not call it an hysterical judgment, but it was undoubtedly very greatly influenced by the emergency of war. However, I notice that even in that judgment their Lordships carefully left a way of escape so that the normal processes of law would operate in peacetime. When a nation is at war, is in extreme peril of being invaded, and is, in fact, fighting for its life, it is necessary to withhold the ordinary democratic safeguards. However, to suggest that we should be justified in adopting a similar attitude at the present time is so extravagant a description of the situation as to amount to an untrue representation. I have a great deal of knowledge of the operations of the security service of this country, and I can see no reason why evidence, which the Attorney-General has stated is complete, in relation to a certain organization should not be placed before the court for examination. The Minister is not asking the Senate to accept the position that all the relevant evidence is in the possession of the security service that was established within the last twelve months, because he has to concede that the evidence that will be tendered will be supplied very largely by persons outside the security service. There is not the slightest reason in the world why that evidence should not be put before the court. I say that seriously, and as the result of my experience. &#34;Let us follow the attitude of the Government to its logical conclusion. The word of the Executive in this matter is to be the first and the last word, and its declaration that an organization is prejudicial to national security cannot be gainsaid. </para>

                <para class="block">Had we given effect to every word of that statement, no limitation would have appeared in the clause now before the committee. The clause would simply have provided that if the Governor-General was satisfied that a body of persons was a body of persons to which the clause applied, that organization would be declared to be illegal. In other words, the mere fact that it was a Communist organization would be sufficient to warrant a &#34; declaration &#34; and, in these circumstances of course, the only possible appeal would be on the ground of the character of the organization. That is precisely what we have in this clause. There is a provision specifying certain bodies that may be declared by the Governor-General and insofar as the Governor-General&#39;s declaration relates to the  charactor  of the organization, the appeal is full and complete. What has happened, of course, is that, in the preparation of this measure, we have not gone as far as the policy-speech envisaged. We have not provided that every organization of the kind described in clause 5 shall be declared an illegal organization. An organization can only be declared illegal if, in addition to being of the kind described in this clause, the Governor-General finds that the continued existence of that organization would be prejudicial to security. I suggest, therefore, that there is no departure whatever from the terms of the policy-speech in relation to this matter. </para>

                    made great play on the fact that should a declared organization appeal successfully to a court on the question of its Communist association, a situation would then arise in which an organization, the continued existence of which had been declared by the Governor-General to be prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth would continue to remain in existence. Theoretically, that situation could arise. If it did, we should deal with it. Such an organization would be dealt with either tinder existing laws, other than this legislation, or perhaps under legislation especially passed for that purpose. That difficulty arises almost inevitably from the fact that this bill is directed only against Communists and Communist organizations. It is not intended to go any further. Would
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                    support a proposition that clause 5 should be altered to provide that any organization, the continued existence of which, in the opinion of the Governor-General would be prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth, could be declared? I suggest that the honorable senator would not be prepared to go so far as that.

                        <para>- No. The government of the day must take full responsibility for the security of the country. Matters of security exist just as much in peace-time as in war-time. The distinction that is drawn between peacetime and war-time in connexion with these matters is quite unreal. The arguments that are put forward in wartime are just as forceful in peace-time. I shall read to the committee a passage from the well-known judgment in <inline font-style="italic">Liversidge</inline> v. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline><inline font-style="italic">Anderson.</inline> Lord Macmillan had this to say, and his remarks are just as apt to a clause of this kind as they were to the problem with which the learned lords were then concerned - </para>

                    <para>I turn now to the nature of the topics as to which the Secretary of State is under the regulation to have reasonable cause of belief. They fall into two categories. The Secretary of State has to decide (1.) whether the person proposed to be detained is a person of hostile origin or associations or has been recently concerned in certain activities, but he has also to make up his mind (2.) whether by reason thereof it is necessary to exercise control over him. The first of these requirements relates to matters of fact, and it may be that a court of law, if it could have before it all the Secretary of State&#39;s information - an important &#34; if &#34; - might be able to say whether such information would to an ordinary reasonable man constitute a reasonable cause of belief. But how could a court of law deal with the question whether there was reasonable cause to believe that it was necessary to exercise control over the person proposed to be detained, which is a matter of opinion and policy, not of fact? A decision on this question can manifestly be taken only by one who has both knowledge and responsibility which no court can share. As Lord Parker said in <inline font-style="italic">The Zamora</inline> ( 1 ) : &#34; Those who &#39; are responsible for the national security must be the sole judges of what the national security requires. It would be obviously undesirable that such matters should bc made the subject of evidence in a court of law or otherwise discussed in public &#39; &#34;. I may also quote the words of Lord Finlay L.C. in <inline font-style="italic">Ram</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Halliday</inline> (2) : &#34;It seems obvious that no tribunal for investigating the question whether circumstances of suspicion exist warranting some restraint can be imagined less appropriate than a court of law &#34;. The question is one of preventive detentions justified by reasonable probability, not of criminal conviction which can only be justified by legal evidence. </para>
                    <para>As I have indicated, a court of law manifestly could not pronounce on the reasonableness of the Secretary of State&#39;s cause of belief unless it were able to place itself in the position of the Secretary of State and were put in possession of all the  knowldege  both of factsand of policy which he had. But the public- interest must, by the nature of things, frequently preclude the Secretary of State from* disclosing to a court or to any one else thefacts and reasons which have actuated him. What is to happen then? The appellant says that the court is entitled and has a duty toexamine the grounds of the Secretary of State&#39;s belief. But the court is also bound to accept a statement by the Secretary df State that he cannot consistently with the public- interest divulge these grounds. Here is indeed an impasse. </para>

                        <para>- It is not the pointThe position is exactly the same. If, in circumstances such as those existing to-day, it becomes necessary for the government of the day to exercise this type of restraint on a limited number of organizations, and that restraint is to be exercised byreference to  questions  of national security, the only body which can determine the question of national security, is that body which consists of the King&#39;s Ministers&#39; who are charged with the responsibility of protecting the country from attack. In those circumstances I suggest that&#34; to relegate such decisions from those who are charged with that national responsibility to a body which obviously cannot have the knowledge that is possessed by the Ministry is unthinkable.. Such an argument provides a complete reason why the appeal should not extend to this particular question. </para>

                    <para>. - I deny at once the suggestion by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> that the real motive of the Opposition in moving this amendment is to oppose the clause altogether. I throw that back at him with emphasis. The Opposition has agreed to the banning of the Communist party, and the taking of its assets. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber have not sought in any way to delimit the very wide description of the organizations and auxiliary organizations with which the Government may deal in this bill. The simple request of the Opposition is that the courts of this land should let a little bit of light into the dark places  in the  recesses  of the mind of the Government. The Attorney-General suggests that the whole case would be brought down by that very modest request that the courts of the land be given some access to the facts behind the most serious allegation that could be made against an organization. That statement is unjustified and &#34;wholly irrational. The Attorneygeneral has claimed that the Government is to be the sole determinant of security matters. He said the other day that any doubt is to be resolved in favour of the country&#39;s security. </para>

                <para>What is the logical conclusion to be drawn from those two statements? I shall carry the proposal to its extreme length to show how dangerous it is. The anonymous letter-writer is, unfortunately, only too well known in every country. He is the lowest creature in any community. He prepares the barb, but the person who injects the poison is he who reads the letter. From that point on, he cannot free his mind from doubt. The only way to treat an anonymous letter is to refrain from reading it once its character is discovered. Once this bill becomes la.w, letters will be written against organizations and individuals. Doubts will be planted in the minds of the security officers and the committee of five and finally will be passed on to the Cabinet. A. doubt so created by an anonymous letter could determine that an organization should no longer be allowed to exist on the ground that it endangered security. That is the logical conclusion to be drawn from the Attorney-General&#39;s own  arguments. </para>

                        <para>- That is not a very profound observation. If that is the position that the committee has reached, I regret that il; is so. I hare carried the example to the extreme r.o show how dangerous it is. The further case cited by the Attorney-General is related to a time of war and all the hysteria, dangers and perils of war. I thought that T demonstrated just how far a court will go in upholding the &#39;Executive Council when war is actually upon the country by reference to the <inline font-style="italic">Thetis</inline> case. Who is to say that war is alongside Australia to-day? The Attorney-General has acknowledged that my proposition of the absurd position to which the law could carry this country is theoretically correct. He has admitted that that possibility could arise. A body which was completely subversive in the view of the Executive, could operate freely if it could show that it was not Communist in character, or Communist infected. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General carried it through to the point where he said that an organization could be dealt with by an existing law or a new law. If the Attorney-General deals with it under an existing law, he will follow the due processes of law. He will go into the ordinary courts of the land, which have a jury  system.  He will indict the people concerned, and will be compelled by the Constitution to have a jury. On behalf of the Opposition I insist that that is what he ought to do in the first instance, and not in the last. It is a grave matter to abrogate all the processes of law and to by-pass the courts of the land in favour of an Executive decision. That leaves the way open for all the evils of the totalitarian state, and I repeat that this bill may well create an evil far greater than the one it seeks to eliminate. </para>

                        <para>- I say nothing against that. I object only to the Attorney-General&#39;s ideas, and have nothing to say against his personal virtues. I say that the Attorney-General, with all the importance that his office gives him, must feel unhappy to be sitting in this Parliament arguing for the abrogation of the rule of law and to set aside the ordinary processes of the courts. He cannot feel happy. The Attorney-General has referred to the fact that this bill is directed against communism. I have made it clear time and again that the Opposition is in complete accord with the broad purposes of the bill to wipe out communism, and to take its accredited representatives out of key positions in the Public .Service and trade unions associated with vital industries. The Opposition is arguing only about the methods to be employed. This bill is directed against communism and the Attorney-General claims that it goes no farther. I have demonstrated that it is directed also against the rule of law, the processes of law, and the invocation of the law courts. It rejects the element of a jury in serious matters. In short,- the Attorney-General asks for provision to allow the Governor-General in Council to declare any organization as being guilty of the worst crime in the calendar, that is, of being a danger to national security and treacherous to the country, without supplying any details of the allegations. The mere pronouncement of a declaration would damn an organization, pass sentence of death upon it, dissolve it and take all its assets, simply on the say-so of the Executive Council of the day. </para>

                <para class="block">That is an atrocious position to defend. The Attorney-General sought refuge in the suggestion that all security matters are very &#34; hush hush &#34;, and that no court should be supplied with the evidence upon which the security service acted. I am not familiar with the case cited by the Attorney-General, but it seems to me that it related to the detention of enemy aliens suspected of spying, something altogether different .from what is contemplated in this bill. He also referred to the refusal of the Secretary of State to make certain information available on the ground that it would be prejudicial to security. That happened in time of war, and we know that in time of war the publication of any information on such matters as food supplies, water reticulation, the movement of troops, &#38;c, might be dangerous. In peace-time information on such matters can safely be published. That is why we are asking that proceedings under this legislation should be in accordance with due process of law, and that persons or organizations that are declared by the Government should have access to the court. Nothing that the Attorney-General has said has convinced us to the contrary, or can make us move from our position. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that this legislation might bring great evil. Once repressive legislation is passed, there can be no turning back. In order that the legislation may be enforced, fresh repressive legislation must be introduced, and so a government goes on and on until it ends up by establishing the police state that goes with it, with concentration camps and all. We have heard a great deal about the &#34; cold &#34; war, but no evidence has been placed before us to show that any person in this country is taking part in, or encouraging, a &#34; cold &#34; war, whatever that is. I notice that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> smiled, but he has supplied no evidence about a &#34; cold &#34; war. I know this, however, that the present Government is participating in a &#34;hot&#34; war. </para>

We are sitting on a powder keg that may explode at any time. but the Government does not care so long as certain interests in Australia continue to win profits in Malaya.- When the Attorney-General said that the hill was based on certain established facts, I interjected to point out that the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe did not justify the Government&#39;s attitude. The Attorney-General said that if I had listened to him, instead of running away, I might have heard something that would convince me. I did not run away, and I am quite able to read for myself what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe wrote in his report. I do not think that there is any ambiguity about what I have said on this issue. I have left no doubt in any one&#39;s mind where I stand. </para>

He is typical of those lawyers who. put words into the mouths of unfortunate witnesses, and then cry, &#34;Ha, I have got you ! &#34; In the United States of America, employment is being kept up by the making and selling of arms to other nations. If there were no &#34; cold &#34; war, there would be an economic depression in the United States of America, and capitalism would collapse.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morrow</inline>

                <para class="block">Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> introduced it as such, and it is on that basis that we support it. I am not going to pretend for a moment that, if this were peacetime, I should be in favour of the methods here proposed. I should not be in favour of declaring people, and preventing them from being employed in the Public Service. However, this measure is necessary in the interests of national defence. It is tragic that responsible public men will not realize the situation that faces us to-day. Australia is not now pursuing the normal, peaceful development that was followed in the nineteenth century, and between the two wars, in this century. Its very existence is menaced by an aggressive power, and by the confidants, supporters and dupes of that power in this country. It is on that ground, and on that ground alone, that we propose to ban the Communist party, and such organizations as the Communist party may transform itself into in its attempts to escape destruction. If we accept the abolition of the Communist party, we must also approve of what is necessary to make this legislation effective. I have read the bill line for line, and word for word, as well as all the amendments that have been proposed. If it could be shown to me that any amendment were of value, I would do my best to have it agreed to, but I cannot see that any of the amendments would make it less likely that an innocent person would be declared. The safeguards are ample. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> spoke as if this bill contemplated criminal proceedings. It does not. It contemplates proceedings that would lead to the dismissal of persons from, public employment. I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> said about anonymous letterwriters. In normal times, it is the practice of persons in authority to throw anonymous letters into the waste-paper basket. </para>

                    <para>- When I held a senior position in the service, that is what I did, and I think that is what other officers do, also. However, in time of war, it is necessary to follow up information from all kinds of sources. The real safeguard is that information will have to be sifted and examined by a committee of five responsible persons, one of  whom  will be a lawyer of the highest standing, such a man as could be appointed to  the  High Court Bench. He would not allow himself to be influenced by an anonymous letter-writer, but would act only on solid and substantial evidence. Then, before action can be taken, Cabinet has to agree, and, finally, there is the Governor-General himself. Before people can  bedeclared  under this bill, there must  besolid  evidence, not only that they belong: to the Communist party but also  that,  they are actively engaged in subversiveactivities. That remark applies also  to the  organizations of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> spoke. The safeguards  areample.  It is good that this matter should: be ventilated and that the principles  o&#163;  the law should be stated again and again,, but it is not good that the public  bedeceived  by phrases like &#34; onus of  proof &#34;  used out of their context. I believe  that  the impression is being created amongmany people in this country that  the Government  intends to abolish trial  byjury  in criminal cases and to force persons against whom prosecutions  are  launched to prove their innocence.. Honorable senators opposite know  that  the Government does not intend  to do  that. I do not suggest that they  havesaid  that it does, but phrases have been used that may create that impression <inline font-style="italic">hh</inline> the mind of the ordinary person. </para>

                    demanded proof  that  some people in this country are doing anything to further the interests  of  Russia in the &#34; cold &#34; war. Surely  we  can regard the activities on the waterfront which have delayed the loading and unloading of ships and culminated in the rolling strike as evidence of activities on behalf of Moscow. I believe  that  the deliberate slowing down of the housebuilding programme is an attempt  tocreate  discontent in this country  and  destroy our economy. The Communists1 say that capitalism must inevitably fail, but they do not trust entirely to inevitability; they are prepared to give it a little help. The activities of Communists: in all the key trade unions are evidencethat the Communist party in this countryis furthering the interests of Russia,  in  the &#34; cold &#34; war. I say deliberately  that  the &#34; phoney &#34; peace agitation, emanating-
                    <inline font-style="italic">-from</inline>
                    Moscow, is a definite attempt to make us impotent in the face of a potential enemy. The policy of the Communist party throughout the world is to create a false feeling of security and to make people believe that never again will it be necessary for them to defend their countries. It is the policy of the Communist party to instil in the minds of our young people the belief that there would be world peace if it were not for the activities of the wicked capitalists. Every intelligent person knows that that is not so and that since the cessation of hostilities the main war-like activity has emanated from behind the Iron Curtain. I regard the most ungrateful references to the United States of America and its citizens by certain people in this country :as a definite move in the &#34; cold &#34; war. Some people in this country are sowing the seeds of distrust of America. They &#34;want us to forget the glorious way in which its history has been linked with ours. They want us to forget that the reign of law, of which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                    has spoken so eloquently, has prevailed in the United States of America, and that it is one of the countries in which the British system of law has taken deep root. They want us to forget that the American people came to our aid in our hour of adversity. There is positive evidence that some people in this country are assisting Russia in the &#34; cold &#34; war. The plan to allow Malaya to he overrun  by  guerrilla bands, whose activities are assisting Moscow, is a definite move in the &#34; cold &#34; war.

                    HENDRICKSON  (Victoria) f5.4&#93;. - I have listened attentively to the legal argument between
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                    and the Attorney-General
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer).</inline>
                    If I am any judge,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                    is leading by 75 or 100 points. The Attorney-General asked whether
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                    would agree to a right of appeal to a judge and jury being given to all organizations affected by this measure. I interjected and said, &#34; Yes &#34;. The Attorney-General asked &#34; Trade unions ? and I said &#34; Yes &#34;. I wish to clarify my statement. The trade unions with which I have been associated can stand any investigation of their activities ; but I venture to say that some organizations to which Government supporters belong, and which are not covered by this bill, could not stand an investigation of the effect of their activities upon the security of this country.
                </para>
                <para>I agree that in the time of war it is permissible to use what may be described as unorthodox methods to maintain the security of this country, but the position is different in a time of peace. I believe that if the present Government parties had, prior to the outbreak of war in 1939, assisted the Labour party in its efforts to rid this country of Communists and subversive organizations, the present position would not have arisen. Under this clause, an organization may bo declared by the Government to be an unlawful organization without an atom of evidence being produced to a court. The Government may act upon information supplied by men such as Sharpley, who figured prominently in the Victorian royal commission on communism. W&#187; knew Sharpley to be a &#34; rat &#34; and a disloyal man. During the early part of the last war, we know that he belonged to a subversive organization. &#34;What did the Menzies-Fadden Government do to him in 1939 and 1940? It allowed him to remain at liberty. Sharpley was not the only one engaged in subversive activities at that time. When my son enlisted into the Royal Australian Air Force, Thornton told me that he hoped on the first occasion the boy got into his aeroplane he would be shot down and killed by a German. The present Government parties allowed people of that kind to remain at liberty. Now, the Government is using the Thorntons, the Healys, the &#34; Jackey &#34; Browns and others in its effort to push this bill through the Parliament. They are the kind of people that the United Australia party, with the support of the Australian Country party, made in the Commonwealth. Would any honorable senator like to be charged as the result of information supplied by a man like Sharpley, who was known by the Australian trade union movement years ago to be an underground worker for the Communist party? It is people like Sharpley who will be the informers in cases arising from the operations of this bill. </para>
                <para>If an organization is declared to be a subversive organization, all those who are connected with it will bc affected. Many persons belong to subversive organizations but they do not know that the organizations are in fact subversive. If they discover the truth, they resign from them. The Government must be very careful in this matter. If an organization is declared to be subversive, the people that belong to it will be condemned and branded by their neighbours as traitors to Australia, although the declaration may be made as the result of information given to the security service by a man like Sharpley. Organizations and members of organizations must be given an opportunity to clear themselves in the eyes of the people. I venture to say that many Government supporters in this chamber and in the House of Representatives belong to organizations that we believe, and have always believed, to be detrimental to the security of this country and of the British Commonwealth of Nations, but we should not introduce legislation of this kind to deal with those organizations. </para>
                <para>If the Government wishes to ban the Communist party, then, as far as I am concerned, it may do so. If I were to wake up one morning and find the Communists gone, I should be very happy, but this bill will not achieve that. The Attorney-General has quoted from law reports, but it has been pointed out that the cases that he cited related to times of war. I agree that in a time of war extraordinary action may be taken to protect the interests of the country, but in peace-time different considerations apply. We are all agreed that we want to rid this country of people who would help an aggressor nation or one upon which we declared war. There has been talk of &#34; cold &#34; wars and &#34; hot &#34; wars. What difference there is between the two, I do not know. I have been in only one war. It was certainly not a &#34; cold &#34; war. England is closer to the potential danger - Russia - than is any other country of the British Commonwealth, but it has not seen fit to introduce, legislation of this kind. The British Parliament is apparently quite content to legislate on democratic lines. Consider South Africa, which has discarded a bill- </para>

                    <para>- The South African Parliament will not pass the bill. The South African Government will have to do what I hope this Government will do - withdraw the bill, redraft it, and present it to the Parliament again in a more suitable form. If the Attorney-General can persuade Cabinet to withdraw this bill and then present it in a form that will achieve the results that we all desire, he will receive the wholehearted support of honorable senators on this side of the chamber. We are not prepared to give this or any other government the right to go ahead with legislation similar to that which was introduced into the German Parliament in 1933 and 1934 and which almost caused the destruction of democracy throughout the world. We are not prepared to give the Government the right to act upon the evidence of people like Sharpley and other traitors whom we have found in the trade union movement. I believe that if the Attorney-General had the power to do so - I know that he has not - he would accept this amendment. He may be able to persuade Cabinet to agree to it, because he has a very persuasive manner. If he succeeds in doing that, I suggest that he should also attempt to persuade Cabinet to withdraw the bill and present it to the Parliament in the form in which we thought it would be presented, having regard to what the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said in his policy speech.

In effect, the Minister also has stated, &#34; I am  the State &#34;. Amongst a number of extraordinary statements the Minister said that there was no line of demarcation between war and peace. Although I do not want to be offensive I should like to point out that the Defence of the Realm Act overrides all other considerations in war-time. This legislation was introduced with a great fanfare of trumpets. It is based on the Prime Minister&#39;s assertion that we are only technically at peace. That statement was untrue. It has since been contradicted by such outstanding people as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Truman, Mr. Marshall, Mr. Johnson,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trygve</inline> Lie. Only the other day, General Mac Arthur, also, is reported to have stated that we are further away from war than we have been for some time. Most people would agree with the Attorney-General that the Government has an obligation to ensure the security of the nation in war-time. However, it is extraordinary that the Government should seek to ensure the safety of the realm in peace-time in the manner provided in this bill. </para>

                        <para>- To contend that we should do so in peacetime by any means, irrespective of the processes of law, is an absurdity that no Britisher would agree to. During the week-end I read a newspaper report from Johannesburg of almost unanimous opposition to a clause in the recently introduced antiCommunist legislation in South Africa which placed the onus of proof on an accused person. Although I am not a lawyer I have a good general knowledge of economics. I have read Adam Smith on Jurisprudence, and although laws may be based on economics, the last arbiter of all is war. As Clausewitz stated on one occasion, war is only politics translated into another sphere. Does the Minister seriously claim that, in a democratic British country, the Government has the right, in times of peace, to wipe out the process of law, because a certain element of danger exists? When we speak of freedom we refer to the fact, amongst other things, that our people are tried for alleged offences according to the processes of law. A person is presumed to be innocent until found guilty.In Russia, however, we read of men being declared guilty of crimes without the processes of law being invoked. Although the newspapers hasten to publicize such events,by this bill the Government is attempting to introduce a similar state of affairs into this country. I was very disappointed in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum&#39;s</inline> contribution to the debate. I had expected to hearsomething worthwhile from him. He claimed that there would be no criminal proceedings under this bill. Presumably he meant that the Government would merely declare a person a traitor and that no harm would be done. It reminds one of the following words in <inline font-style="italic">Othello,</inline> written by William Shakespeare: - </para>

                <para class="block">What does democratic government mean if our citizens are to lose their right of trial in accordance with the processes of law? I am not aware that this country is engaged in a war at present. Apparently the only person who knows about it is the Prime Minister. I say in all sincerity that this country has slipped tremendously in the eyes of the democratic world. Until a few months ago it was regarded as one of the most democratic countries in the world. The action of the Government in introducing this measure is contrary to established Liberal thought - Liberal in the John Morley sense of the word. It is contrary to the principles on which our great trade union movement was developed, and to the method of trial by jury. Does the Attorney-General seriously assert that we are in such a state of war that a grave national emergency exists? If so, does it exist to such a degree that the processes of law in relation to certain persons should be abandoned altogether? The great bulwark of the British Empire is freedom. Yet, with one stroke of the pen, the Government is seeking to enact legislation similar to that recently before the South African Parliament. An Anglican archbishop in South Africa stated recently that even if those persons who were  responsible for the introduction of the anti-Communist measure in the South African Parliament would not listen, it was the duty of him and his colleagues to warn them that while for a time such legislation may appear to be successful, in the long run the effects would be very different from what they expected. </para>

                <para class="block">That provision seeks to deal with any body of persons considered inimical to the safety of the Commonwealth. The effect of the clause as printed is that the Governor-General may declare a body of persons an unlawful association and that that body&#39;s only redress shall be to ask the appropriate court to set aside the declaration, on the ground that it is not a body to which the section applies. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> has failed to advance a convincing argument on this aspect of the matter. A state of war does not exist, and there would appear to be no possibility of such a state of affairs materializing in the near future. However, it is quite evident that hysteria intended to lead people to believe that an aggressor nation intends to attack us, is being deliberately provoked in Australia. I agree that we should be prepared to meet such a situation in a defensive capacity, and that entire responsibility should rest on the government in office. However, as it stands, this measure provides for the declaration of persons or bodies of persons without their having the right of defence. The stigma that would attach to their names as a result of being declared, irrespective of the fact that the declaration might subsequently be set aside, would remain with them for life. I can recall many instances ofstigma remaining with persons although allegations against them had been subsequently disproved. I am as much concerned about the security and the safety of Australia and of the British Commonwealth as any member of the Senate is, but I will not be a party to abrogate the democratic rights of the people of this country. I cannot understand why the common processes of law provided by the Constitution should be abrogated. The moment we depart from the observance of the due processes of law we hand over the control of our destinies to dictators. Although the anti-Labour parties alleged during the last election campaign that the Chifley Government had acted as a dictator in certain matters, I say deliberately now that any arbitrary action taken by that Administration was taken in the interests of all the people and not of any particular section. </para>

Members of an organization that has been &#34; declared &#34; will have to show that their organization is not a body to which this clause applies.

                    <para>. - I have asked members of the Government for some information concerning the existence of the alleged &#34; cold &#34; war, but not one tittle of evidence has been adduced in support of that allegation. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> has pointed out, a state of hysteria has been induced by the newspapers, and the Government has taken advantage of that state to introduce the bill. The only honorable senator opposite who made any concrete attempt to justify the assertion that a &#34; cold &#34; war exists was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum,</inline> who contended that the state of affairs on the waterfront and the acute housing shortage were evidence of the existence of a &#34; cold &#34; war. In making that allegation he unconsciously exposed the real purpose of the Government in introducing this legislation. It is not the Communists but the trade unions of this country that the Government is after. Supporters of the Government have repeatedly blamed the waterside workers for the slow turn-round of ships. However, I have pointed out several times that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Vertigan,  a government representative on the shipping board stated that about 70 per cent, of the responsibility for the slow turn-round  of ships was due to the congestion on the wharfs and to the actions of certain businessmen. It has also been alleged by spokesmen for the Government that the building workers of this country are responsible for the acute housing shortage. Last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> referred to a report that appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> to the effect that building workers had capriciously refused to complete a building in Melbourne, and she made mention of a photograph which accompanied the report which showed a workman named Miller standing alone on the job. The explanation of the refusal of the building workers to complete the job was that the structure was a luxury building that was being completed for the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> and the workers engaged on the job felt that they would be better employed building homes for ordinary members of the community. Members of the union concerned asked the newspaper to publish their reply, but it refused to do so, just as it always declines to report the workers&#39; case. </para>

Its purpose in introducing this legislation is to &#34; get at &#34; the wharf labourers, the building trades unions, the coal-miners, and the transport and metal workers. As I pointed out a few nights ago, the Government is concerned because of the widening gap between prices and the purchasing power of the community, and it foresees considerable economic and industrial trouble in the near future. With that in mind, it introduced this bill in order to draw the teeth of the industrial organizations that fight for better conditions for their members. It hopes that by adopting that course even greater profits may be amassed by the people who sent it here and financed its recent election campaign. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been most interested in the arguments that have been advanced on this clause, but, so far, I have been very little impressed by the case argued on behalf of the Government. Honorable senators opposite have based their arguments on mere belief and assumption. I have yet to learn from the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> or the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> why this departure is being made from the fundamental principle of British law that a person is presumed innocent until he has been proved guilty. No such departure has been made in the United Kingdom, Canada or the United States of America, all of which have had some experience of Communist activities. I have a very high regard for what we call the British rule of law, and no argument yet adduced by honorable senators opposite has convinced me that there is any ground for a departure from that law, particularly, as I have said, as legal authorities of .the leading democratic nations of the world have not seen fit even to suggest that there should be such a departure. Here in Australia, for reasons best known to honorable senators opposite, the Prime Minister and his supporters are endeavouring to persuade us that they have good and sufficient reasons for this legislation. I could, of course, suggest some reasons. </para>

                        <para>- But the Attorney-General and other honorable senators opposite used them, obviously in an appeal to the prejudices of the people rather than to their powers of reasoning. If honorable senators opposite have a good case to offer, they should state it in plain language instead of resorting to meaningless terms which only confuse and mystify the people. In the absence of a precise definition, I should define &#34; cold &#34; war as economic warfare, out of which military warfare develops. In Australia to-day there is a. &#34; cold &#34; war that may lead to widespread strikes. So far, the Government has not shown any inclination to do anything to prevent a continuance of that &#34; cold &#34; war. This legislation, and particularly the clause now before the committee, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> convincingly showed, is needed to suppress those who would resist the continuance of the &#34; cold &#34; war. I refer to members of the trade unions, who, under the wide definitions contained in this measure, could be classed as Communists or &#34; fellow travellers &#34;. The Government has not attempted to give us a clear definition of &#34; communism &#34;. The bill refers loosely and in general terms to the teachings of Marx and Lenin. </para>

                        <para>- In the absence of an explanation, one is justified in judging what is said in the light of one&#39;s knowledge and experience. When I hear these terms used as they have been used repeatedly in the course of this debate I ask myself what they really mean. I have listened patiently for a clear definition but none has been given; yet we are expected to accept the assumptions of the Attorney-General and his colleagues. There must be some reason for this proposed departure from the accepted processes of the law, and from what is stated to be the foundation of British justice: the principle that a person - and here I include an organization - is assumed to be innocent until the accuser has succeeded in proving him guilty. As one who has seen many injustices perpetrated in the name of the law, I am naturally very sceptical, and I should consider myself remiss in my duty if I were not to join issue with the Government, and request a more adequate explanation than we have been given so far. I do not accept the Prime Minister&#39;s statement that, technically, we are still at war. I do not agree that the Government is justified in departing from the rule of law, simply because, in the judgment of the Prime Minister, or of the Attorney-General, we are technically still at war. That view is not taken in other countries. It has certainly not been taken in the United Kingdom. Are we to understand that the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister of this country are better authorities on law than there are in the United Kingdom? Honorable senators opposite may believe that to be so, and they are entitled, to .their opinion, but I am not prepared to accept arguments based on mere assumptions. As I have said, I have seen injustices done under the law, and I am sceptical. All the powers that the Government requires can be found in existing legislation. The Public Service Act has been sufficient to deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. James,</inline> and others. There is also the Crimes Act and the Defence Act. If we are technically at war, then there is no reason why the Government should not use the Defence Act, provided, of course, the people of this country will accept the Government&#39;s arguments <inline font-style="italic">ex cathedra.</inline> I see no reason that would justify the Opposition in supporting the Attorney-General&#39;s contentions and, unless he is prepared to give better reasons than he has given so far, we shall vote solidly for the amendment that has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline></para>

                    <para>. -  The Opposition does not propose to continue this discussion more than a few moments. It presses for the inclusion of the amendment in the measure that is before the committee. I believe that the Opposition has made out a strong case. It has pointed out that a declaration could be made&#39; against an organization, first, to the effect that it is Communistinfected; and, secondly, that its activities are prejudicial to security. The bill proposes an application to the court on the first allegation in that declaration, but denies it completely on the second one. The Opposition has demonstrated beyond the possibility of contradiction by the Government, that in that case all processes of law and all recourse to the courts would be completely swept aside. The most damning indictment that could be levelled against any organization, which is that it is treacherous and dangerous to security, would stand without any particulars of that allegation being supplied and without the organization concerned having an opportunity to approach any court. The one answer from the Government is, in effect, &#34; We, the Executive Council responsible for the security of this country, have spoken. We have passed sentence of death &#34;. </para>

The Government  bases its whole case for sweeping aside the processes of law and of the courts of the land on that bare statement that security is involved and that it dare not put its security officers in the witness-box. I venture to say that within five minutes of the Senate adjudicating on this amendment, the Attorney-General will stand up in this committee and undertake that if a declared organization sacrifices one more right which is held by every accused, the right to stay out of the witness-box, the Government security officers will go into the box and give evidence. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that I know of no worse charge. The indictment of the Government by the Opposition is that no recourse to law will be permitted on a serious charge which involves a crime of the highest or lowest degree according to one&#39;s point of view. Everything is to stand or fall on the mere say-so of the government of the day, whether it be Liberal and Australian Country party, Labour party or any other conglomeration. The mere dictum of a government is to determine that matter, and the Attorney-General&#39;s reason is that security is involved and that the Government dare not put its evidence before the court. Yet, in five minutes&#39; time, the Attorney-General will undertake in certain circumstances to do so. If the Government were consistent, it would refuse to submit evidence in all circumstances. If there is virtue in its argument that matters involving security cannot he mentioned and are so dangerous that they cannot be put before a court, the rule should apply throughout. But the Attorney-General is prepared to waive thatrequirement if an organization sacrifices one of its normal legal rights to sit back, hear the case against it, and not enter the witness-box. </para>

                <para>SenatorMcKENNA. - It is relevant to this issue in that while the Attorney-General claims on this particular point that security prevents him from putting anybody into the box, he is prepared to put security officers in the box and disclose evidence in other circumstances. The Attorney-General admits that there will be no declaration without full Cabinet approval, but that Cabinet will have, in his own words the soundest possible evidence. </para>

                        <para>- No, but the Attorney-General acknowledges that it will have that evidence. If evidence is available concerning an organization or an individual to show that it or he is subversive in the slightest degree, the Government and the Attorney-General as its chief legal officer have a plain duty to prosecute those people in the name of the country and the people of Australia. There is no virtue in the argument that security prevents the process of law and of the courts from operating, because as the committee will find, the Attorney-General will throw the argument away on the onus of proof clause. The Opposition has developed its case so thoroughly that I do not &#39;propose to pursue the matter further. </para>

                <para>The bill in its original form provided that a body which had been declared to be an illegal organization could apply to the court for an order that it was not an organization within the meaning of the section. It was contemplated in the bill as originally drawn that the onus of proof rested on the a.pplicant organization to establish that it was not the kind of organization referred to. There has been a good deal of discussion about the onus of proof. The provision <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> cast in its original form because the matters to be inquired into by the court would be peculiarly within the knowledge of those in charge of the organization that made the application. In those circumstances, we suggest, there would be no hardship whatsoever in requiring those persons to go into the witness box, and submit themselves to cross-examination in relation to matters about which they would know much more than any one else. It was with a view to insuring that responsible officers of a declared organization would go into the witness box for cross-examination that the clause was cast in its original form, which placed the onus of proof on the organization. The Government is prepared to amend the proposal so as to make its original intention perfectly clear. There has been a lot of very loose talk about the onus of proof. It is possible to refer to many statutes, some of them passed while a Labour Government was in office, in which the onus of proof is placed upon the defendant. Other statutes which contain the same provision were allowed to remain in force by a Labour Government during the last eight years. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour Government was in power for eight years, but it did little to alter the law in that respect. One of the clearest examples of wha t I am discussing is what is known in law as the doctrine of recent possession. For instance, if a man is found in possession of goods suspected of being stolen, he can be called upon to explain how they came to be in his possession. That is in the realm of criminal law, but this legislation is not dealing with criminal matters. </para>

We may assume for our present purposes that the organization concerned is one which, if it continues to exist, may commit treason. The government of the day, which is responsible for the security of the nation, may have come solemnly to the conclusion that the organization, if it continued to exist, might commit acts which would constitute treason or sabotage; yet the Opposition now says that such an organization must be allowed to continue to exist until it actually commits treason. </para>

                        <para>- No matter who acted as informer, the Government would art in a reasonable way. The Opposition must face the fact that it is prepared to allow the continued existence of an organization which is likely to commit treason. The Opposition wants that organization to continue in existence until it actually commits treason. </para>

                        <para>- That is the plain English of the matter. Let us discuss an example. I hesitate to mention the Australian Peace Council, .but let us consider an organization calling itself the Australian Patriots &#39;Council, because the Communists are quite capable of forming an organization, and giving it that name. Let us assume that the organization consists wholly of persons who have been members of the Communist party, and that it is carrying on activities precisely the same as those that the Communist party is carrying on to-day. The Opposition says that such an organization shall not be banned, even though the Opposition has already agreed to the banning of the Australian Communist party itself. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, a trial in which the Government is to be called upon to satisfy a jury beyond all reasonable doubt that the organization is subversive. If the jury is uncertain about the matter, if it really feels that the organization may be subversive, although it is not convinced beyond all reasonable doubt, then the subversive organization is to be allowed to remain in existence, and to continue its subversive activities, presumably until this country is sold right down the drain. The Government&#39;s proposal is perfectly reasonable, and it should not be forgotten that this legislation may be administered by a Labour government at some time in the future. </para>

                        <para>- They still seem to be effective, and the fact does not astonish me when I consider the performance that members of the Opposition are putting up to-night. It is being claimed by members of the Opposition that a subversive organization shall continue in existence unless the government of the day can satisfy a jury that it is subversive, and the Government must do that without being able to put the officers of the organization, such as the  president,  secretary and members of its executive, into the witness box where they might be convicted out of their own mouths. If that is how the situation would be dealt with if a Labour government were still in office, it is just as well that the Labour Government was removed from the treasury bench at the recent general election. The authorities in the United States of America have had to deal with this problem. I happen to have in my hand a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States of America, delivered on the 8th May last, and it is interesting to note that in the United States of America it has been found necessary to take the same kind of action as we are proposing to take now. </para>

                <para class="block">I point out that neither is our law a covenant of non-resistance towards organized efforts at disruption, and the betrayal of the community. This attempt to use the principle of onus of proof, which has its proper place in our legal system, so as virtually to insulate traitorous organizations against proper attack by the community is not to be encouraged. I believe that all persons who seriously desire to get rid of the Communist cancer in our community will support this legislation. Those who desire to protect disruptionists will vote for the proposals which, I have no doubt, the Opposition will put forward. </para>

                        <para>- The measure, in the form in which it was introduced -into. the House of Representatives, plainly placed the onus of proof upon an accused organization. The hill comes to us in its present form, as the result of an amendment moved by the Government and accepted by the House of Representatives, which preserves the principle of placing the onus of proof upon an organization accused, cited or declared, whichever term be appropriate, in the fullest possible way. Now, under pressure by the Opposition, large sections of the Australian press and very many people holding liberal views - the word &#34;liberal&#34; in that context is spelt with a small &#34; 1 &#34; - the Government has introduced the third version in which it has made some concessions to us. The proposal to leave out sub-clauses (4.), (5.) and (6.) will not be opposed by honorable senators on this side of the chamber. We shall vote for the deletion of those sub-clauses in their present form. But we shall vote against the proposal to insert the new sub-clauses contained in the amendment. At a later stage, we shall move that other sub-clauses be inserted, which will place the onus of proof where it fairly belongs, that is, entirely upon the Crown. </para>

                <para>Let me point out to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> a difficulty to which the amendment that he has moved will give rise, if it be the only amendment to this clause that he proposes to move. A few minutes ago, the Committee agreed to an amendment which provides that an application to a court by an accused organization may be made in respect of two allegations, first, that the organization is Communist-affected ; and, secondly, that its activities are prejudicial to the security of the Commonwealth. The amendment moved by the Attorney-General deals only with the allegation that the organization is Communistaffected. It picks up the onus of proof, subject to a condition with which I shall deal later. Having regard to the amendment agreed to by the committee a few minutes ago, the Crown will, if this amendment be accepted, carry the full onus of proof in relation to the serious allegation that the organization is seditious or prejudicial to security. On the allegation that the organization is Communist-affected, the onus of proof will be carried by tb&#171; Crown only, after certain conditions have been fulfilled. If nothing is said about it, in a matter like this a court will place  the onus of proof firmly upon the Crown. It will follow the normal processes of law. I point out to the Attorney-General the difficulty that will arise from the amendment he has moved. I hope that I have said enough for him to appreciate the point that I am making. It may he necessary for him to move another amendment. If the clause is amended as proposed by the Government, the Crown will, in effect, concede that the onus of proof must be upon it in relation to the allegation that an organization is prejudicial to the security of this country. </para>

                        <para>- This is a point that has not been fixed up. We are considering the Government&#39;s amendment. If the amendment were accepted, the onus of proof in relation to the more serious allegation would plainly fall upon the Crown, and in relation to the other allegation it would be carried by the accused for a considerable period. That indicates to the committee how ill considered are the amendments proposed by the Government. This is not a matter of no consequence. It is a very serious matter, to which I direct the attention of the Attorney-General. On the face of it, it represents a complete inconsistency. </para>

I appreciate the reluctance of honorable senators opposite to hear what the Opposition has to say upon this atrocious proposal. The proceedings begin with a declaration by the Governor-General in Council that an organization is, first, Communist-affected, and secondly, prejudicial to security. After that, an application may be made to the court by the organization. In normal circumstances, if the Crown alleged against an organization, first, that it was Communist-affected; and, secondly, that it was a danger to the security of this country, the Crown would begin. It is not proposed that that shall bc done. 1 point out to the Attorney-General, as I have done before, the absurdities that exist in the ease presented by the Government. Let me read the proposed sub-clause (4.) and explain one thing that could happen under it. It reads - </para>

A person who enters the witness box, is sworn and gives his name and address has given evidence to the court. A person in the witness box has the right to refuse to answer questions that may tend to incriminate him. Under the proposed amendment, all of the officers of an organization may enter the witness box and give their names and addresses. They may even say - although they could refuse, very properly, to do so - that they are officers of the organization. At that point, they may refuse to answer any further questions on the ground that their answers might tend to incriminate them. Immediately they have done that, the onus will, if the amendment be accepted, shift from the applicant to the Crown. That is a position that could arise if the amendment were accepted. </para>

                <para>The Attorney-General and other members of the Government have said that we are not dealing with a crime. I say that no more serious allegation could be made against an organization in any country than that it is a danger to the security of the country. I challenge honorable senators opposite to tell me of any more serious allegation that could be made against any organization. I agree entirely with those who say that it is, in effect, a charge of treason. It is quasi-treason. It is sedition. It has implicit in it espionage, sabotage, and other crimes referred to in the bilk </para>
                <para>A learned Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, dealing with the question of the onus of proof, said, with complete and warm approval, that the principle underlying the concept that the. onus of proof must rest upon the Crown and that an accused must receive the benefit of any reasonable doubt is that it is far better in society that 99 guilty men should go free than that one innocent person should be wrongly convicted. That is the proposition that he put forward firmly and strongly. On this occasion the Government wants to reverse that position entirely. It adopts the attitude that it would be better for 99 innocent people to be wrongly convicted than for one guilty man to escape. That is, in effect, the stand that the Government is taking in relation to this bill. It is idle for the Attorney-General to cite exceptions to the rule of law. They exist, but many of them are not justified. He referred to a charge against a person of being in possession of goods reasonably supposed to have been stolen. In a case of that kind, the accused has the task of satisfying the court beyond reasonable doubt how he came into possession of the goods and that his possession of them is lawful. That is an a trocious position in which to put people. When I have been consulted by clients charged with that offence, I have gone to the police department concerned and pointed out to the officers of the department the enormity of what they were doing. I say, to their credit, that when I have pressed the matter they have altered the charge from one of receiving stolen property - under which an accused has no chance, and the ordinary processes of proof are thrown aside - to one of theft. I have never defended a client charged with that offence without indulging in the most severe criticism of the fact that such a charge has been made. I invite honorable senators to think for a moment of the difficulties that they would be in if any one of them were asked to account for his possession of his toothbrush or his hairbrush. How would he begin to show  where he had got it from, or what he had paid for it? There would be many thousands in Australia. The Attorney-General has pointed to that charge as one in which the onus of proof is placed upon the accused. It is to the credit of the police departments of Australia that they use it very rarely. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> to explain his earlier attitude on this measure, when he stated that there could not be a trial unless there was a charge. This is not a traffic offence. We are not dealing with a matter concerning a motor car, but. something which hits at the security of our country. The honorable senator had the opportunity of disagreeing with the recitals in the bill and did not do so. Honorable senators supporting the Government believe that communism is a really live menace that threatens our way of life. </para>

                        <para>- The second-reading debate on the measure has been completed. It is a remarkable thing that there are two types of people in thU country that want to see this bill deferred. I refer to the Communists and to the members of the Australian Labour party. The Communists are attempting to stage strikes to prevent this bill from coming into operation. Honorable senators opposite, also, are attempting to delay the passage of the measure. Quite frankly, I am very friendly with many members of the Labour party. I have played football with them and have been on service with them. I know that not only some honorable senators opposite, but also their children have fought to preserve our way of life. </para>

                    (Tasmania) &#91;S.49J. - I should like to complete the remarks that I was making before my time expired a few minutes ago. I had dealt with the instance of a man charged with being in possession of goods reasonably suspected of being stolen. I had made the point that the police of Australia rarely have recourse to that charge, &#34;but when they do, if n lawyer who knows his business approaches them in the interests of his client, they frequently do the right and decent thing and substitute a charge of theft, where they, and not the accused, carry the onus. That is how that law operates in practice. The Attorney-General
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline>
                    admitted plainly and frankly that no organization and no individual would be declared unless on the soundest possible evidence. There would be no declaration on. mere suspicion. He stated further that the Attorney-General would have all the evidence required to justify his signature. In the case we are considering the Attorney-General would not be in difficulties about previous character. He would never have made the declaration otherwise. In his own words, he would have  all the evidence but he would want to keep it to himself. He would prevent a person from exercising his normal right under the rule of law, that is, to give no evidence on oath or otherwise if he chose not to do so. The other right he would enjoy would be that the Crown would carry the onus of proving his guilt affirmatively and beyond reasonable doubt. In effect, the Government is saying to such men, &#34; We will take away one of your rights, that is, to stay out of the box until you have heard what is alleged against you. If you surrender that right we will allow you to retain the other right that you have already, and we will carry the onus of proof &#34;. That is the outrageous proposal of the Government under the amendment before us. In short, the Government asks the organization, or, as we shall see the individual, to abandon -one right for the sake of keeping another that he already enjoys.

                        <para>- I hope to convince the Government. We are endeavouring to do so. I think that the Government is gravely disturbed by the reaction of a lot of people in this country as well as of the Opposition. I am not so sure that all supporters of the Government in this chamber are happy about the measure. I completely refuse to believe that the lawyers sitting opposite are happy about this type of provision, having regard to their training. The Government has very grudgingly conceded some of the due processes of law, and it will accept the onus of proof if the organization surrenders one of its great rights. What is it going to achieve then? The Crown will put its witnesses into the box and disclose its evidence and prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. </para>

                <para>I venture to say that the courts have a very much nicer appreciation of criminal or quasi-criminal matters than the Government has, and the courts apply the strictest forms of proof and procedure. Although criticisms are levelled at the judiciary from time to time I have yet to learn of a judge in this country - whether he favoured me personally or not - who was not most scrupulous in applying that attitude in every case before him of a criminal or quasi-criminal nature. I am sure that the Attorney-General would not deny this assertion. </para>

                        <para>- I make it perfectly clear to the Minister that the Opposition is not seeking to stop this bill. We have already passed the clause that will allow the Government to ban the Communist party and take its property. We have also conceded and allowed the clause that will enable the Government to follow the Communist party into any form of organization. It is futile for the Minister to say that we want to stop this bill when we have conceded the banning of the Communist party and the pursuit of its auxiliaries down to the remotest form. The one thing that we ask the Government to do is to have due regard to the processes and canons of the law, and to give access to the courts of the land to persons concerned. That is not stopping the bill; it is helping the bill. It will confer on organizations and individuals the right against arbitrary action by the Executive. The Government sets itself up as an authority to determine organizations that are prejudicial to the security of the country, and it will not allow anybody to gainsay its word. The Minister asked me to refer to a statement that I made in the course of my second-reading speech. I was referring at that time to the Stevedoring Industry Commission, on which was represented the Waterside Workers Federation and the shipowners of Australia. Those representatives were selected by the respective bodies that they represented. The Attorney-General inquired by interjection whether I would remove them without trial. I replied by asking him how there could be a trial without an offence. The Government claims that the members of the Waterside Workers Federation sabotaged the work of the commission. I have already pointed out to the Minister that what he is alleging is treason or quasi-treason, subversion, espionage, or sabotage. Yet he avers that that is not an offence. I make it perfectly clear that I still adhere to my original opinion that there is not a trial without an offence. What would be alleged against an organization under this bill is the worst crime of which&#39; it could be accused. &#39; </para>

                        <para>- All the procedures for appeals against transfer and so on remained in force. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> said, in what I feel must .have been an unguarded moment, that only two classes of people were opposed to the bill - the Communists and members of the Australian Labour party. That is part of the wicked propaganda that has been disseminated against this party during the last three years, and I regret to say that it was repeated recently by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> and other members of the Government. That allegation is an outrageous untruth. It is confounded by all the facts of the action taken by Labour against communism, and I remind the Government that recently I recited ten of those acts. I expressed the hope then that people who had been accusing Labour of favouring the Communists would, in the light of those facts, and of the positive averments of the Australian Labour party, hang their heads in shame for their action, if not for their ignorance. </para>

                    <para>. -  I have listened carefully to the . legal argument that has taken place, and it appears to me that there is  no analogy between the onus of proof in a criminal trial and the onus of proof in a procedure under this clause. The procedure that will be followed under this clause appears to me to be more in the nature of a quasi-judicial determination made in the Public Service. It is a fact that in the United Kingdom the Attlee Government dismissed a number of public servants on the ground that they were Communists. That is not denied, and, as far as I know, no right of appeal was given to the dismissed public servants. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has admitted that certain public servants were dismissed by the previous Labour Government. Apparently they were temporary public servants. However, the contention now put forward by the Opposition is that the retention of his position by a trade union  official is much more important than the security of the country. The only other observation that I desire to make is that whilst there may be some virtue from the legal, technical point of view in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna&#39;s</inline> amendment, he has not convinced me that under this clause any real injustice will be done to members of the community. In fact, while listening to him I became convinced that no injustice would .be done by the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - The Government has adopted a peculiar attitude in its attempts to justify the clause. It has stated, in effect, that because of the severity of the penalty it will be guided in &#34; declaring &#34; individuals and organizations by the comparative seriousness of their activities. Members of the Government have vacillated in their attitude on this clause. Although the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> has admitted that the bill provides a serious penalty, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> has contended that the offence for which the penalty is provided is not punishable. I remind members of the Government that the bill deals not only with public servants, who are entitled to protection, but also with persons outside government employment. Ordinarily, any member of the public service is entitled at law to redress for any scandalous assertion or defamatory statement made about him, or for wrong ul dismissal from &#39;his employment. </para>

                <para>Reference has been made to the consequences of this legislation to industrial organizations that may be deregistered under the laws of the Commonwealth or of a State. The Labour party is not in sympathy with Communists who promote industrial disorder. It has withheld funds from, and refused affiliation to, members of bodies that are dominated by Communists. However, the Labour party does permit such bodies and their members to appeal to its executive against a decision adverse to them. I am concerned with the implications of the clause insofar as they may affect the members of a trade union which has been deregistered. Most  deregistrations  have followed strikes in which unions have participated, but it cannot be contended that all strikes are unjustified. The fact is that under this- clause the moment a union is deregistered the Government could declare any or all of its officials under the bill, and remove them from office. That would introduce a state of affairs similar , to that which obtained in Germany under the Nazis. The trade union officials removed from office will have no right of appeal except the limited right provided in the clause, under which they will be called upon, not to answer a specific charge, but to make and substantiate a negative assertion. The declaration may not even be based on the strike, but on some other obscure ground. The net result will be that members of that organization will be denied recourse to the rule of law. We have no guarantee that the power to declare organizations will be used temperately. It may be that some extremist government of the future may abuse this extraordinary power. </para>
                <para>The right of appeal which the clause provides is inadequate and contrary to the whole spirit of British law. An individual who has been declared will suffer considerable damage not only to his reputation but also to his prospects of obtaining further employment. Nevertheless, he will not be entitled on appeal to be confronted with a specific charge which he can go into the witness box and disprove. The only right that he will have will be to attempt to prove a negative, that is, that he is not a Communist. We all pride ourselves that this is a </para>
                <para class="block">British democracy, and we cannot permit such an unjust provision to remain part of the bill. A man is entitled to know specifically the charge that he has to answer, and the public is entitled to know why an individual has been declared, and, possibly, removed from office. The exercise of- such an extraordinary power as the right to declare individuals and organizations will pave the way to political nomination &#34;, which characterized nazi Germany and occurs in Russia to-day. If the Government is sincere in its attempts to deal with subversive elements, it already has all the powers to do so. Why does it not use them? I do not believe that any honorable senator opposite, including the Attorney-General himself, really believes that an individual&#39;s rights should be placed in jeopardy and that he should be denied redress at law. If members of the Communist party are engaged in a conspiracy to overthrow the Government by violence, and the Government has evidance of that fact, it could take action more effectively and more quickly under the existing law than it could under this legislation. However, since the Government desires to introduce this legislation it is our duty to oppose those provisions in it which would abrogate all the civil liberties for which we have fought. </para>

                    <para>.- A. great deal of legal argument has taken place on the clause under discussion, and I am not qualified to enter into the intricacies of that argument. However, the position appears to me as a layman to be that when an organization is declared under the bill, and its representatives desire to appeal against the declaration, they will go to the court, and the Government will then have to show that it is a Communist organization, or, to use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna&#39;s</inline> words, it will have to be shown beyond all shadow of doubt to be a Communist organization. One would imagine that in view of that provision honorable senators who have already agreed to the Communist party being dissolved without trial would say : &#34; Since this organization has been shown beyond a shadow of doubt to be a Communist organization, then it should be declared &#34;. That, however, is not the attitude adopted by members of the Labour party. Notwithstanding that they agree that the existence of the Communist party is a menace to the country, they are not satisfied that even when an organization has been shown to be a Communist organization that organization shall be declared ; they would also require that the organization shall be shown to be guilty of some overt act of treason. Only in those circumstances will they agree to the organization being dissolved. However, they go even farther than that, and demand that, even after the Government has proved that an organization is a Communist organization, and has shown that it has been guilty of some overt act of treason, the Government&#39;s investigating officers should enter the witness-box and reveal their identity and their sources of knowledge. The Opposition&#39;s demands will have the effect of making it almost impossible to show that any organization should be dissolved. It will be necessary to prove that it has committed some overt act of treason, and, in order to prove the act of treason, the Opposition desires that the Government&#39;s investigators should come into the light of day with their agents and disclose the nature of their activities. </para>

                        <para>- The bill does mention subversive activities and &#34; activities prejudicial to the security and defence of the Commonwealth &#34;. I am not a lawyer, but it appears to me that such activities very closely resemble treasonable activities. The Opposition desires that the Government shall be required to prove not only that the purpose of an organization that has Been declared is treasonable, but, in addition, that it has been guilty of overt acts. When a Communist organization has been dissolved for good and sufficient cause, its members may very well infiltrate other satellite bodies, such as the Australian Peace Council, or some body which calls itself, say, &#34; the League for the Preservation of Political Democracy &#34;, and it will be necessary for the Government once again to go through the whole process of proving that the purpose and activities of that organization are prejudicial to the security of the nation. It will also be necessary for the Government to show that .. the membership of the body in question is substantially the same as that of the Australian Communist party, and that the organization has committed some overt act of a subversive nature. If we amend the bill as the Opposition suggests the bill would be worse than useless for the purpose for which it is designed. Some members of the Opposition have said all along that the bill will not work and that they hope it will not work, and it is evident that they are determined, by inserting the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> that it will not work. Therefore, I do not believe that the Senate should, in any circumstances, accept the amendments to this clause that have been foreshadowed by the Opposition. If an officer of an organization is innocent, why should he not go into the witness box and say so? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot see how an inquiry could be conducted without first stating what the inquiry was about. There seems to be some difference of opinion among legal men about when court action actually starts. Apparently, it does not start immediately a declaration has been made. It does not start until an application has been made to a court by the declared person. The whole point is that if the Opposition&#39;s amendment be accepted, the course that I have explained will be followed. Organization after organization will be established. It will not be possible to follow the Communist party into all its new forms. Although the Opposition apparently is prepared to have the parent body declared, it is not prepared to have the declaration extended to the new forms in which the Communist party will manifest itself, even if their Communist character is proved beyond a shadow of doubt. Because of the illogicality of the Opposition&#39;s proposed amendments, and because they will defeat the whole purpose of the bill and make a farce, of it, I hope that the committee will not accept them. </para>

                    <para>. -  I rise mainly to express my disgust&#39;,at this clause in the form in which it was originally introduced into this chamber. I realize the difficulties involved in framing a measure such as this. I have listened intently to the legal arguments that have been advanced from both sides of this chamber. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton,</inline> I do not claim to be able to adjudicate on those arguments, but I arn&#93; convinced that this clause represents a disastrous departure from the British tradition and the British way&#34; of life. In its present form it is repugnant to every Australian citizen. Much has been said about nations that have crumbled in Europe during the last 20 or 30 years. Whether their downfall was at the hands of the Communists or the fascists, I defy honorable senators opposite to point to one that gave a trial of any kind to those who constantly fought for the retention of human freedom. Can honorable senators opposite mention one leader of Christian thought, or political action, one trade unionist, or any other member of the community, who has had a trial that would be different from what he would get in this country if this clause were allowed to remain as at present worded?

                    <para>Your Committee strongly recommends that the practice of creating, by legislation of any kind, a presumption of guilt against an accused in criminal and penal matters should be abandoned.

For a long time, it has been a sacred rule of the common law.,, also embodied in our criminal code, that the.&#39; prosecutor, even though he be the King, has the burden of proving the guilt of the person at bar. </para>

                <para class="block">I am sure that not one member of our community would look forward with any enthusiasm to a departure from that system. I realize the Government&#39;s difficulties in framing this measure. Throughout the length and breadth of this continent, and in other parts of the world where critics have felt themselves compelled to pen articles on this measure, mere is doubt about the outcome of this legislation if it is to retain the Government&#39;s proposals in their entirety. For that reason, I suggest, in all sincerity, that the Opposition&#39;s amendments dealing with the onus of proof, should be accepted. A few weeks ago, the trials of the last Japanese war criminals commenced at Los Negros. I am somewhat diffident about citing the happenings of the last war to illustrate my point, but every member of the community, particularly every ex-service man, remembers only too vividly the inhuman cruelty that was indulged in day by day by the Japanese. Those stories are not merely hearsay. Our servicemen suffered the tortures of the damned. In spite pf that, before the commencement of the trials, the leading Japanese counsel said - </para>

                    <para>. - My approach to this amendment is slightly different from that of other honorable senators. I do not propose to attempt to discuss legal niceties beyond saying that, unable as I am, at times, to follow the law in all its refinements, in my experience the law, as it finally emerges, i9 always horse-sense. Therefore, when beset by legal difficulties, I work in a manner which, to a lawyer, would bc a reversal of the normal method. I endeavour first to determine what: is sound common sense. Then I usually discover that the law, when interpreted, yields that very answer. I suggest that the Government&#39;s amendment is a common sense and reasonable approach to the problem. What it proposes, in effect, is that after an inquiry conducted by senior officers, of the Public Service, and a decision by Cabinet, an organization can be declared to be a Communist association. The extravagant statement that, by means of procedure involving an inquiry by senior public servants, a Cabinet recommendation &#39;&#39;to the Governor-General, and a promulgation by the Governor-General, the Labour party or a trade union will be declared betrays the weakness of the Opposition&#39;s arguments. Nobody in this year of grace 1950 would seriously maintain that there is the remotest possibility of events such as that happening. The proposal is that, following the procedure laid .down, certain organizations will be : declared on the basis that if they accept their guilt and make no appeal, that is the,, end of it, but if the people concerned protest their innocence,&#39; the Government is to be put to the test to prove their guilt. At the risk of being wearisome I shall cite the circumstances in which that procedure is to be adopted. The circumstances are&#34; set out in the preamble of the bill - </para>

I believe in saying what I think. That is not always pleasant. I believe that the Opposition is concerned with only on thing, and that is to take the teeth out of this bill. They give it lip loyalty and lip service, but they aim to take out its teeth so that it will not operate efficiently. </para>

I take the argument a step further and say that whatever risk there may be in that .direction is justified when one considers the seriousness of the position that is contained in the preamble to the bill.

                        <para>- I stand corrected. The honorable senator said that Russia was the only threat to world peace and that the Communist party in Australia was out to assist Russia. That is very true and I point out for the benefit of the Minister that the Opposition has agreed to that clause of the bill which will ban the Australian Communist party. When he and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> said that honorable senators on this side of the chamber desire to take the teeth out of the bill, they were speaking either in malice or in ignorance because the Opposition has already agreed to the provision for the Governor-General to declare a Communist under the very wide definition of a Communist as a person who is influenced by the teachings of Marx and Lenin. I refer honorable senators also to clause 24 and ask honorable senators opposite to consider whether the Opposition is attempting to take the teeth out of the bill. The clause provides - (2.) Without prejudice to the operation ot the next succeeding sub-section, proof in any proceedings under this Act that the name, initials or other means of identification of a person appear - </para>

The Attorney-General has told honorable senators that they have to wait for an overt act. If honorable senators will read the bill again they will find that it says nothing of the kind. </para>

The Government has the records and to prove the case should be simple. After the raid on Marx House the State police carried out subsidiary raids to pick up the loose ends of the story and the Government has that information.

                    <para>. - To hear, some of the speeches delivered by some members of the Opposition, one would think that the bill set out to have men shot at dawn. As a matter of fact the bill is far too moderate for dealing with men of the type that are connected with the Communist party. What does it seek to do? It seeks only to remove from office in the Commonwealth Public Service and its instrumentalities men who belong to the Communist party, and to loosen the grip which members of the Communist party have on the great industrial unions of this country. Men are sacked every day of the week throughout the big industrial undertakings of this country. There is no hue and cry or song and dance in protest against that action.

What is wrong with the provision that a man or an organization may, if declared, appeal to the appropriate court? The open and self-confessed Communist will not bother to appeal. He will accept the declaration.

                        <para>- He will not appeal to the court so that he may be shot at in cross-examination. The Communist is prepared to die for the cause when the day of revolution dawns, as Communists have declared in their literature, and from the platform. The appeal tribunals will be approached in my opinion only by those organizations and individuals who may consider they are innocent or by those who might be able to testify that they were not Communists although they had moved in Communist circles. Members of the security service will have to present convincing evidence before the committee that is to be appointed will recommend to Cabinet that persons or organizations be declared. Cabinet will not take a chance, and will not declare any one unless the evidence appears to be conclusive. The amendment provides that if the officers of a declared organization are prepared to face the music by going into the witness box, and testifying on oath that they are not subversive, the Crown will accept the onus of proof. However, if they are not prepared to give evidence in their own behalf, then the onus of proof will rest on them. What is wrong with that? For the last 30 years and more, Commonwealth and State legislation has. contained provisions placing the onus of proof on the accused person. In my second-reading speech, I referred to the Gold Buyers&#39; Act of Western Australia, 1921, which provides that if a policeman or a gold assayer or a gold buyer has reason to believe that some one is in unlawful possession of gold he may require that person to explain how he came into, possession of it. If the explanation is unsatisfactory, the person may be charged, not with the theft of the gold, but with being in unlawful possession of it, and the onus is on him to prove that he came by it lawfully. If he is unable to do so, he can be convicted and sentenced to as much as two years imprisonment. In that case, the penalty is much greater than the penalty prescribed for the person who is declared under this legislation. All the Government proposes to do in the case of a declared person is to put him out of the way of temptation. Under this generous legislation, however, he is to be given a chance to &#34; come clean &#34; by giving evidence in his own behalf. What honest, God-fearing man would have any reason to fear going into the witness-box, and declaring that he was not a member of the Communist party, or of a subversive organization? The Opposition is concerned, not so much to protect the innocent man, as to help the declared person who is not prepared to go into the witness-box to give evidence. The Opposition has done everything possible to prevent the passage of this bill. Members of the Labour party come into close contact with Communists on the wharfs, on the coal-fields and in various industrial organizations. They know what damage the Communists have inflicted on the economy of the country and their attitude to this bill is difficult to understand. In March, 1947, the un-American Committee of the House of Representatives in the United States of America reported that the Communist party in that country was dominated by Moscow, and recommended that Communists should be treated as agents of a foreign power. The report cited 92 directives from Moscow to the Communist party of the United States of America which had come into the possession of the intelligence service. There is now in force in the United States of America a law which requires all Communists to register; not as members of an innocent, domestic political party, but as foreign agents. Thus, in the United States of America to-day every Communist is branded, and the Communist party is obliged to publish from, time to time the names of its members,, and particulars of the party&#39;s finances. In a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Leninism,</inline> at page  68,  an account is given of an interview given by Stalin to an American Labour delegation in  1927.  When asked whether any money was being sent to America Stalin said - </para>

The preamble to the bill should be sufficient to convince honorable senators how they should act towards a measure of such outstanding importance to the country. I maintain that this bill is far too moderate, having regard to the grave danger that threatens the security of the country, the unsettled state of the world, and the attitude of Russia to the Western nations. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morrow</inline> says, we are sitting on a powder keg, although he and I have different ideas as to who might touch off the powder. No one can say when a country like Russia, which is armed to the teeth, may march against us. We do not want war. We want peace, but if war is forced on us, what then? We should do what is necessary, by legislation of this kind, to minimize the danger that threatens us. It has been demonstrated that in the Western democracies there are men whose loyalty is to Russia rather than to the land of their birth. That is the unique feature of our time, that there are men who are prepared to betray their own country in the interests of a foreign power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Critchley</inline> said that this legislation represented a departure from the British way of life, but that statement is not true. It is in accordance with the best British traditions. </para>

                    <para>. - I repudiate the accusation that members of the Opposition are deliberately delaying the passage of this bill. As many honorable senators have spoken from the Government side of the chamber as from the Opposition side, and honorable senators opposite are :doing their best to provoke the Opposition by &#39; con tinuing to discuss that part of the bill which deals with the banning of the Communist party. The Opposition has given the Government every assistance in the passage of that part of the bill. I quote the following from the preamble to this measure : - </para>

                        <para>- I believe them to he true, as much as does the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer).</inline> Having accepted those statements, we have said to the &#34;Government, &#34;Deal with the Communists &#34;. If they are guilty of everything of which they are accused in the preamble, the bill is too mild. I think that the Attorney-General will agree with me upon that. What does the Government propose to do? It proposes to take no action against the Communists other than to brand them as traitors to this country. It will leave them free to infiltrate any organizations that they may select.&#39; The members of those organizations will not know individual Communists by sight or by name, but when they have infiltrated the organizations and captured key positions in them, peace officers will inform the Government of that fact. The organizations will then be declared, and every member of them will be branded as a traitor to his country. </para>

Doubtless he belongs to  some organizations  that could be declared under this bill if peace officers were to investigate their activities. I do not suggest that the undesirable activities of the organization would be known to the Attorney-General. It could happen to anybody. </para>

                    said that it was the intention of the Government to remove from office only persons who were Communists. It cannot be said that the bill, in its present - form, is applicable only to Communists. It has been estimated that there are 14,000 Communists in Australia. The Government must have a list of the names of those persons. If it acts properly, it will brand each one of them. If they have been guilty of the acts of which they are accused in the preamble to the bill, does the Government propose to allow them to remain at large? The Attorney-General said that, despite the terms of the preamble, the bill does not deal with criminal offences. Is it argued by the Government that sabotage, treason, and subversive activities are not criminal offences?

We have always fought for the principles of British justice, as honorable senators opposite claim that they have done. We have shed just as much blood in the fight as they have done.

If he does understand it, and, despite that, supports it in its present form, he does not believe in British justice.

In a murder case, the accused is not required to go into the witness box and give some evidence before the onus of proof shifts to the Crown. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw those remarks. However, I still have the thought. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has well said, the moment that a person steps into the box and says, &#34; I am not guilty &#34;, the Crown has to prove its case. Is there anything wrong with that? Is not that British justice? </para>

There would be nothing left for the decent law-abiding citizen, because the courts would have gone. Yet the Opposition says these people are being denied justice .when given the opportunity to go into the witness-box and say, &#34; I am not a Communist &#34;.

                    <para>. - The two objections to the bill are its all-embracing character and the reversal of British law, particularly in the original draft. In the light of discussion that has taken place both within and without the Parliament, the Government has seen fit to modify some of its provisions. That in itself proves that what the Leader of the Government in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> said was incorrect. He stated that the only two organizations opposed to the measure were the Communist party and the Labour party. I point out, however, that since the provisions of the measure have been made known throughout this country, large sections of both the universities of Sydney and Melbourne have declared emphatically and without reservation or qualification that they oppose the bill in its entirety. Obviously, therefore, the Minister&#39;s statement was a gross exaggeration. In the current month&#39;s issue -of <inline font-style="italic">Legionnaire,</inline> which is the official organ of the Queensland Branch of the Australian Legion of Ex-service Men and Women, this resolution appears- </para>

                    <para>Having examined the legislation, my Association considers that the terms of the legislation are so sweeping as to make it possible for any Government to utilize the various provisions to suppress all opposition groups and all criticism of Government policy. As an association whose members fought to defeat the tyrannical regimes of Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo, we are gravely concerned at legislation which could be utilized to establish similar methods in Australia. We are aware that the Nazi regime in Germany suppressed opposition by attacking Communists, then the unions, the German Labour Party and even the churches. For some time this Association has  pursued  an active policy of promoting the ideals of world peace and international understanding. We stand for the banning of atomic weapons and the progressive reduction of armaments by all nations under international agreement, as essential and positive steps to the preservation of world peace. We are apposed to conscription in Australia in peace time, and to the military  embroilment  of Australia in Malaya. </para>
                    <para>We recognize that these views conflict with the policy of the Government and that under the provisions of the Bill, activities in support of this Association&#39;s policy could be branded by the Government as prejudicial to the defence of Australia and the organizations and members penalized accordingly. Wc consider such a state of affairs a monstrous violation of democratic liberties, and one which warrants our utmost opposition to this measure. </para>
                    <para>As you are aware, this Association recently made representations to have a 50 per cent, loading added to war gratuity to compensate for the tremendous decrease in the real value of gratuity. We contend that a reduction of current unnecessary military expenditure should be effected to permit ex-servicemen of the last war to get justice in this regard. Even this demand could be claimed by the Government to be prejudicial to the defence of Australia and the organization penalized. This Association considers the legislation is repugnant to every democratic Australian tradition, in that it is directed to suppressing legitimate criticism of and opposition- to thipolicies of the Government of the day: and we -urge its complete and immediate withdrawal. </para>
