                        <para>- I do not know when the court will give its decision - that is a matter for the court itself. The hearing of the case concluded some little while ago, but the court is always busily engaged in the preparation of judgments, many of which present considerable difficulty. I have no doubt that the court will give its decision as soon as it is able. </para>

                        <para>- I have discussed this matter with the Premier of Tasmania, and with representatives of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board, and of the Waterside "Workers Federation. Every effort is being made to get labour to load the apples. I understand that the shippers at Hobart have already asked the Government of the United Kingdom for an extension of time, and that the extension has been granted. However, in view of the seriousness of the position, I shall again communicate with the Premier of Tasmania in order to learn whether any advantage may be gained by making a further request to the Government of the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health whether it is true that Government members of this Parliament are worried at the serious delay in bringing the Government's health scheme into operation? Is the Minister aware that members of the Labour party, and the general public, are worried also at the Government's failure so far to introduce an efficient and equitable national health scheme? As medical authorities claim that worry kills more people than cancer does, will the Minister take action to eliminate all this worry and so safeguard the national health ? </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether the press announcement about the duration and value of tea and butter rationing coupons means that the ration of those commodities to householders is to be increased? If not, can the Minister say whether the people of this country can look forward to an early increase of their tea and butter ration, or the abolition of the rationing of those commodities altogether ? </para>

                        <para>- I understood that questions based on newspaper reports were not to be encouraged. However, the answer to the honorable senator's question is that although the current tea and butter rationing tickets have been doubled in value, the period that they are to cover has also been doubled. In other words, they will expire on the 9th July instead of on about the 11th June. The whole question of tea and butter rationing is still receiving consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Is it a fact that Liberal party candidates, prior to the 10th December, promised electors that a Liberal government would put value back into the £1, and prevent further increases in the prices of consumable goods? Is it also a fact that the Minister for Trade and Customs, in reply to a question in this Senate on the 8th March, stated that the Government was taking action to prevent increases in the cost of living? Did he also state, in reply to a question, that the Government had a formula by which it intended to put value back in the £1 ? Since the prices of consumable goods increased after the 10th December, and have increased still more since the 8th March, the date when the Minister assured the Senate that the Government was taking action to prevent further increases, will the Minister advise the Senate of the nature of the formula that the Government has prepared, and will his Government immediately put the formula into operation? Can he assure members of the Senate that no further increase in prices of consumable goods will take place? </para>

                            <para>The delay in the issue of campaign stars and medals by the service departments has been occasioned primarily by the decision to inscribe these awards with the regimental number, initials and surname of the recipients. This decision was taken by the former Government in June, 1949, as a result of representations made by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. Prior to this, stars and medals were issued without any inscription, and distribution was made by the three services to some 140,000 personnel. Those who had already received issues were invited to return them to the Navy, Army or Air Force issuing authority for inscription if so desired. It will be appreciated that the inscription on campaign stars and medals of individual personal particulars is a formidable task and, as was pointed out by the former Government in their consultations with the  Returned  Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, some delay in dealing with applications is unavoidable, the main factors being what it is physically possible for the government contractors to produce and for the available service staffs to handle. Every effort is being made to ensure that the delay in the inscription and issue of stars and medals is reduced to a minimum. </para>

                            <para>The award of campaign stars and war medals is governed by the conditions approved by His  Majesty  the King in 1946 and applicable throughout the British Commonwealth. The eligibility for the 1939-45 Star of members of the ground staff of the Royal Australian Air Force who served in the United Kingdom di,ring the war was the sub:ect of representations on a number of occasions by the previous Government to the United Kingdom Government, but the latter were unable to agree to the proposal. A statement of the reasons was given in the reply furnished on 20th October, 1948, to a similar question by the honorable senator and appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of that date (pages 1818-19). The former Government re-opened the matter in  December,  1948, but the United Kingdom Government adhered to the conclusion previously expressed by it. Further consideration is being given to this question by the present Government. </para>

Unless some good purpose can be served, it is not desirable to require the department to undertake the work which would be necessary to compile figures from the inception of the act in 1918 particularly as the general demand in South  Australia  in the past has been for brick homes. The total number of applications for timber homes approved in the period was 329, and of these 295 have actually been provided. The balance is being processed. </para>

It is not known whether these houses met all the requirements of technical officers of the South Australian Housing Trust, but the certificates of the two senior technical officers of the Department of Works and Housing referred to above, and the valuing officer who made the original inspection, were so definite that, in the interests of the ex-servicemen whose money was involved, the Director was bound under the act to refuse the applications. Other applications in respect of homes built by the Housing Trust have been approved. </para>

                            <para>No. The survey was originally intended to cover an independent 4-ft.  8½-in  gauge line between Kalgoorlie and Perth. However, this plan was early modified to provide for an independent line only between Northam and Perth with conversion of the existing 3-ft. 6-in. gauge line between Northam and Kalgoorlie. The centre line survey has been completed between Midland Junction and Northam except for final pegging of curves. The survey work, before it was closed down in December 1947, had proceeded to a stage where the feasibility and desirability of the line from an engineering standpoint was established and no further field work was required until the decision to build the line was taken. </para>

As a first step I have arranged with the Director of Shipping for a special officer to be sent to Tasmania for two or three months to carry out a detailed examination of the problems to be faced, and to take whatever steps are possible to improve the position. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The shipment of pyrites from Tasmania to Melbourne is a matter of utmost Commonwealth importance due to the fact that pyrites is used in conjunction with sulphuric acid and sulphur rock to manufacture superphosphates. If this commodity is not available in sufficient quantities in Australia to meet the demand, it necessitates its importation from the United States of America, thus forcing the Commonwealth to expend dollars. There are restricting factors in this trade which only small vessels are able to overcome. Therefore, to ensure that the greatest possible quantity of pyrites is lifted from Tasmania, it is necessary on occasions to return vessels to the pyrites loading point in ballast. When circumstances permit, the vessels operating in this trade are used to load cargoes from Melbourne for Tasmania, and the position which at the moment exists is quoted as an example <inline font-style="italic">- Edenhope</inline> is now loading in Melbourne for Burnie, <inline font-style="italic">Elmore</inline> for Launceston and <inline font-style="italic">Enfield</inline> also for Burnie. - </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth Government has decided to import a quantity of coal from overseas by arrangement with the Victorian and South Australian Governments. A similar quantity of coal which would normally be received by  those  States as their share* of New South Wales production will be diverted to certain essential heavy industries in New South Wales, principally the steel industry. The cost to the Commonwealth Government in respect of imported coal will be the difference between the landed  cost  of imported coal and the cost which would have bren incurred by the Victorian and South Australian Governments had a similar quantity of coal been imported by those governments from New South Wales. The quantities of coal involved are still the subject of negotiations, but they would amount to approximately 85."&gt;,000 tons. The charge to he  finally  borne by the Commonwealth cannot be determined until the final overseas shipment ha&gt;? arrived, but the estimated cost of the subsidy on the quantities ordered is approximately £1,700,000. </para>

There is no  female  basic wage for the Australian Capita!

Several well known international conferences such as the C.I.G.R.E. (International Conference on  Large  Electric Systems) held in Paris every two years, and ibc World Power Conference usually held e\ery four years, provide an opportunity for a discussion of technical  problems  of the kind mentioned. Further consideration will be given to the development of Ions distance, high tension  transmission  lines  when  the?e conferences meet in June-July of this year. Austraia will be represented by leading electrical engineers. </para>

In speaking to this motion, there should be no need for me to emphasize that there is no suggestion of unfairness or partiality on your part, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> This is a matter that affects all honorable senators, and on which a considered opinion is most desirable.

                        <para>The purpose of a question is to obtain information or press for action, and it should not be in effect a short speech, or limited to giving information, or framed so as to suggest its own answer or convey a particular point of view. The facts on which a question is based may he set out briefly, provided the Member asking it makes himself responsible for their accuracy, but extracts from newspapers or books, quotations from speeches, etc.. are not admissible. Where the facts are of sufficient moment the  Speaker  has required prima facie proof of their authenticity. A question which publishes the names of persons or statements not strictly necessary to render the question intelligible will be refused a place on the notice-paper. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not know what was in the minds of the previous Presidents who made those rulings, but it is significant that the last two rulings that I have read, which provide that a senator must vouch for the accuracy of any report that he quotes, mention only newspapers and not periodicals. That is why it is important to obtain a considered ruling now, because the document on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> attempted to base his question on the previous day of sitting is a publication, the accuracy and authenticity of which speaks for itself. It is the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth,</inline> which is issued under the authority of the General Council of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, so that its accuracy and authenticity naturally carry much greater weight than would an extract from an article in a newspaper, and it would be quite unnecessary, I should think, for an honorable senator who quoted from it to vouch for the accuracy of any statement contained therein. Concerning the length of the quotation, the position appears to be that a senator may refer to newspaper reports and statements, but the references must not be too lengthy or tedious. However, that was obviously not the basis upon which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> disallowed the question, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> had not got any distance with it. In fact, the matter which he proposed to quote occupies only ten lines of print, so that it would not be disallowed on the ground of length or tediousness. </para>

                        The matter affects Government supporters particularly, because in the past most questions have been based upon newspaper reports and comments, and I should like to know whether the decision given by you, sir, on Thursday means that in no circumstances can a question that is based on printed matter or statements be asked. In the course of your ruling you used the following words :  -  it is not permissible to quote from newspapers or statements when asking questions.

It may be, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that in the past you have been overtolerant, but it is necessary now that the position should be laid down clearly and at length. </para>

                        <para>. -I note that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> has not charged the  President  with partiality in this matter, and I think that that is very important. The business of the Senate should be conducted and controlled, as it hasbeen in the past, in accordance with a tradition that members of this chamber are proud to live up to. For that reason I was somewhat surprised at the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who is a new member, in making the motion now under discussion. Rulings are not always, I presume, based upon standing orders, because it would be impossible to draft standing orders to meet every contingency that may arise in debate, and I think that the Minister will agree that rulings are based, at least to some degree, upon the judgment of the  President,  who plays a very important part in the conduct of the business of the chamber, and must always do so. If the rulings of the  President  are to be challenged merely because a question that was directed at a Minister for propagandist purposes- </para>

                            <para>- Then the honorable senator said that newspapers have been ruled out on the ground that the matter contained in them may not be authentic. He went on to argue that if a question were based on a quotation from a newspaper it would depend on the nature of the question whether authority was required to confirm its authenticity. However, I think that that is just the point at which the  President  must exercise his judgment. If the  President  thought that a question was asked, not to elicit information or for the benefit of the Senate or the people, but simply for propagandist purposes, he would undoubtedly be justified in ruling it out of order. The motion under discussion was made because a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who is a Government supporter, was ruled out of order. Questions asked in this chamber can be placed in three categories; first, questions asked for the purpose of eliciting information; secondly, propaganda questions asked for the purpose of gaining some political advantage - I say quite frankly that honorable senators opposite do not have a monopoly of questions of that kind - and, thirdly, questions asked, not only for propaganda purposes but also in an attempt to discredit an honorable senator. Questions of that kind have, until recently, not been common in this chamber. I cannot remember one being asked or ruled out of order in my experience of the Parliament, which extends over some years, except in the present Parliament. A question of tha? kind was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum.</inline></para>

I have never said in this chamber anything against another person that I would not have been prepared to say on the public platform. I think it is wrong when members of the Senate like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum,</inline> the "poison cart" distributors here, try to defame honorable senators on this side of the chamber. </para><interjection>

He has pointed out that during question time propaganda is indulged in. In support of his argument, he has referred to what happened on a previous occasion. I consider it to be advisable to canvass the whole matter now, so that we may arrive at a clear conception of the rights of honorable senators in regard to questions. The clearer the conception, the less possibility there will be of motions of dissent from my rulings. I realize that during this debate words may be uttered that may hurt some  honorable  senators, but I ask the Senate to be patient so that the matter may be dealt with as fully as possible. </para>

                            <para>- Now "new Johnnies-come-lately ", with all their wisdom, try to besmirch the character of honorable senators on this side of the chamber. As a result of this discussion I hope that honorable senators occupying the Government benches will restrict the propaganda that they try to "put across". Members of the Opposition do not object to fair propaganda by Government senators so long as the object is not to discredit them. But the Opposition will strenuously protect its members against propaganda by honorable senators opposite intended merely to defame them. That was solely the reason for my objection. I should be glad if the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> or the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> would assure the Senate that, in future, questions asked solely for propaganda purposes will be discouraged. When I was in office in the former Government I always assisted the  President  to ensure that every honorable senator received fair treatment. </para>

                    <para class="block">When all other honorable senators who wish to speak have spoken, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> will be called upon to reply. </para>
                    <para>This is the first time that a ruling of mine has been made the subject of a motion of dissent. That, of course, does not make me a modern Solomon. I realize that I am human, and can make mistakes. I do not profess to know the Standing Orders so thoroughly that it is impossible for me to fall from grace. I do not for one moment resent the action of an honorable senator in questioning my ruling. It is my desire that the debates in the Senate shall be conducted on the highest plane, and that every one shall receive justice. I may sometimes make a mistake and hurt the feelings of an honorable senator, but I have never done so wittingly. It would be impossible for a  President  to conduct the proceedings of the Senate, or for a  Speaker  to conduct the proceedings of the House of Representatives, unless he had the goodwill and confidence of those over whom he presided. I believe that I enjoy the goodwill and confidence of honorable senators generally, and I have always done my best to conduct the debates with decorum. We should not forget that, upon occasion, proceedings in this chamber are broadcast. As the representatives of a democracy we are, in a sense, fighting for the retention of the parliamentary system. It behoves those who preside over the deliberations of the Parliament so to conduct proceedings that the public will realize that it would be foolish on their part to allow parliamentary institutions to be destroyed. Those who, in the heat of debate, forget that truth, do a disservice to democracy. We should always strive to maintain the dignity of the Parliament, and to uphold its prestige. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> said that I, in giving my ruling, had only one point in mind. </para>
                    <para class="block">I assure him that I had several points in mind, the chief of which was that we are now living under a new dispensation, and cannot allow ourselves to he ruled by the dead hand of the past. Only a few days ago, I gave a ruling that was contrary to one that had been given by  President  Baker. I believe that I was right, and that I had the support of a majority of honorable senators. In these days, it is impossible to conform to all the rulings that have been given in the past. I have here a publication setting forth rulings given by past Presidents. They are many and varied, and can be used to support almost any contention. Even the devil can quote Scripture to suit his purpose. I have gone through these publications when debates have become trying, and I find that the rulings sometimes contradict one another. I must bring to bear common sense and reason when giving rulings. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> and to honorable senators generally, that the proceedings of the Senate are broadcast from time to time and that questions without notice are sometimes re-broadcast. Therefore, the  President  is in duty bound to require honorable senators to make their questions brief so that as many as possible may be asked within the time allotted for re-broadcasting. For that reason, I state emphatically that I am opposed to Ministers reading long statements during question time. I have mentioned this before, and, in future, hope to take action against Ministers who do not conform to what will be my ruling that long statements shall not be read in question time. They may be read later. </para>
                    <para>As for my ruling in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> I am not a thought reader, and I did not know how long was the extract that he proposed to read in the course of asking his question. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> has now told us that it was an extract of only ten lines. However, whether it was short or long, it is now desirable that we should decide that no extracts whatsoever :-hall be read by honorable senators in question time. That is only right and proper. If it is decided that no honorable senator may read from a newspaper when asking a question, then it follows logically that he must not read from a book or a periodical. I have not laid it down that questions must not be based on newspaper reports, although some Presidents have done that in the past. I have said that honorable senators should not quote at length from newspapers, or indeed, quote from them at all. It is better that they should frame their questions in this way: Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to an article in such and such a newspaper or book or periodical, and then state as briefly as possible what the article covers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Walter</inline> Kingsmill, when  President,  ruled that if an honorable senator based a question on a newspaper report he must be prepared to give an undertaking in writing to accept responsibility for its accuracy. I do not go so far as that, although I may change my mind. At the moment, it is competent for an honorable senator to ask a question based upon a newspaper article, but not to read an extract from the newspaper. The Standing Orders lay down certain rules governing the asking of questions, and honorable senators may read the Standing Orders themselves. However, they do not cover the whole of the ground, and it devolves upon the  President  to give rulings from time to time so that, over the years, precedents have been established. It does not follow, however, that a  President  is bound to follow slavishly the precedents created by his predecessors. Times have changed; radio broadcasting has been developed  and microphones have been installed so that the speeches of honorable senators and members of the House of Representatives may be heard by the public. There is no standing order forbidding the reading of extracts from periodicals. However, presiding officers in this and in the State Parliaments have always taken May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> as their guide. Both the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(.Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> quoted  from <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> and I quote once more the following passage : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Extracts from newspapers or books, quotations from speeches, &amp;c, are not admissible. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That is the rule of the House of Commons, the Mother of Parliaments. Surely that ought to be enough for any honorable senator. We should remember that there is an important difference between questions asked on notice, and those asked without notice. A question on notice is written out and handed to the  Clerk,  who may alter it so as to put it in order. If he is in doubt, he will ask the  President  whether he should delete this or that. However, a question asked without notice, may be recorded for broadcasting between 7.25 p.m. and 8 p.m. The questions may be disorderly, but if it eludes the vigilance of the  President,  it will be broadcast. I did take action last week in annexion with a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum,</inline> and the broadcasting authorities wisely and decently did not broadcast that question. If a disorderly question is asked, another honorable senator can, if he is quick, take objection te it. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> was very speedy, and, before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Wright</inline> was able to read the quotation - which I am now informed was one of ten lines only - directed my attention to the fact that the honorable senator was reading an extract from a book. I think I said at the time that I was about to call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> to order. However, if the Leader of thu Opposition had not directed attention to the extract, it would have been broadcast that evening. A disorderly question would go out to the public. Honorable senators will see the difficulty. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the point. I was not criticizing the matter at all. I did not know what it was and, as a matter of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> had said only a few words. But after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> had been told by me for the second time not to read extracts, he continued to do so. I think I have covered the ground fairly. I ask that honorable senators should consider these matters and do all in their power to help the  President  to carry out the standing orders. I am not a martinet or a dictator and I think that it would be wrong for any  President  or  Speaker  to adopt a dictatorial attitude. I am placed in the Chair by the indulgence and goodwill of the Senate to carry out the Standing Orders to the best of my ability. I try to do so as liberally as possible so that there shall be orderly discussion, and so that the Senate shall not be a rabble. I think it would be wrong for a  President  to adopt the attitude of a school teacher, but at the same time honorable senators should do their best to help the  President  to carry out his duties. I believe my ruling to be just and proper because we are living in the era of radio broadcasting. It is essential that the  President  should act firmly with those who would take up the broadcasting time by reading extracts, whether long or short, and also with Ministers who make long statements  in answer to questions. </para>

There is no question in my mind that the honorable senator, notwithstanding that he was quoting from a book, was framing a question to convey his point of view or, alternatively, to convey a particular point of view so that the Minister would answer easily. In the circumstances, I believe that the ruling of the  President  was sound. As the question has not been raised previously in connexion with quotation!'  from  a book, the only course consult  the  practice of the Mother of Parliaments as given in May's publication. </para>
                    <para>I suggest that the Senate might consider another point which  ha9  no direct relation to the question at issue, but may arise in future in relation to debates and questions. There is justification for the statement by the  President  that honorable senators should frame their questions in accordance with the form indicated in May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> and, at the same time, should comply with the Standing Orders. I know that it is not always possible for an honorable senator to contain himself when he sees an opportunity to score a point in asking a question. That is only human nature. But honorable senators should consider whether they cannot make question time in the Senate purely a period for questions. I suggest also that the Ministers should answer questions and not dodge the issue too often and pass it on to some one else. Honorable senators should endeavour to avoid wasting time and spreading propaganda. When asking questions, honorable senators should make sure that they are seeking information. I think the ruling of the  President  was sound and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was very hasty in the first place in challenging the ruling. I hope that, on reflection, the honorable senator will see that he was, in fact, putting the question in such a way that he was giving the answer to the Minister or supplying the information so that the question could be answered quickly. I think that he was entirely out of order, and I ,:hall vote to uphold your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline></para>

There is nothing in <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> to support such an interpretation. The point that <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> makes is not that an honorable senator is quoting from a newspaper or a book, but that he is quoting somebody else's words, and using them as a foundation for his question. I raise this .matter because it is well that we should have it straight in our minds. Thi? afternoon we had an illustration of the difficulty that can arise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> purported to quote from a speech delivered by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in the course of the last election campaign. </para>

                            <para>- No. That is exactly the point I am making, and it is exactly what <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> say3. Let us get this clear, otherwise an impossible situation may arise. Let us suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> when asking the question to which objection was taken, had said, "Has the Minister seen the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Attlee</inline> delivered at such and such a place, in which he said- ", and then proceeded to quote what he claimed to be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Attlee's</inline> exact words. That would come within the evil with which <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> deals in the passage to which I have referred. Surely the rules of the Parliament are not so ridiculous that although an honorable senator may not quote from an authentic record such as the official report of the House of Commons or <inline font-style="italic">The Times</inline> newspaper, he may quote from his own note of what has appeared in those publications. </para>

                            <para>- I am not concerned with that at the moment. I am endeavouring to look at this matter impartially, and in the light of the opinion given by the  President  himself to the Senate this afternoon. Surely it is false reasoning to argue that what is objectionable is the reading of newspaper reports, an extract from the official report of the House of Commons, or a passage from a book. The thing that is objectionable is quoting some one else's words, whether they have been written or spoken. Therefore, I suggest in all seriousness that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was wrong last Thursday in the method that he adopted in putting his question, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> was equally wrong to-day. </para>

                    <para>So far, this debate has roamed over a somewhat larger field than that embraced by the motion. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have referred to the conditions under which we work. Our proceedings are broadcast, and it is necessary to avoid undue propaganda in the asking and answering of questions. There are one or two comments that I should like to make on that subject. While the proceedings of this chamber are being broadcast honorable senators frequently ask questions  of Ministers in another place who are merely represented in this chamber. In nine cases out of ten, the honorable senator who asks such a question knows that it cannot be answered by the Minister in this chamber. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of questions that are directed to Ministers who are only represented in the Senate. If honorable senators sincerely desire to make the best use of broadcasting time, it would be most desirable if they agreed that all questions directed to Ministers who are in the House of Representatives should be automatically placed on the notice-paper of this chamber. In nine cases out of ten honorable senators who ask such questions know that the Ministers in this chamber cannot possibly answer them. The only excuse for asking them instead of putting them on the  notice-paper  is that the proceedings are being broadcast. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that the rules are sometimes broken by them, too, but most of the questions asked come from the Opposition. I suggest that in the final analysis the object of questions is stated perfectly clearly in the Standing Orders. That object is to elicit information and to ascertain facts; and I suggest that it is distinctly out of order for honorable senators to ask their questions for propagandist purposes in such a way as to include a lot ot innuendo and arguments. I believe that the difficulties that have been raised recently concerning the permissibility of certain questions would be  avoided  if those who as*.ed questions realized that by that means they can quite rightly elicit information from Ministers on matters of public importance. I suggest that many of the questions asked are not bona fade attempts by honorable senators to seek information on public questions. This debate may serve some useful purpose if it clears the air in relation to this matter. I emphasize again that the difficulty is not merely one of the  President  having to decide whether honorable senators are quoting from documents, but concerns the correctness of the ruling that no quotations shall be made from documents. If it means that there must bf no quotations, then that ruling must apply not merely to the reading of portions of documents themselves, but must also  apply to attempts to read from copies made of a document or from notes which include a quotation or a paraphrase of a document. However, if the rule is not to extend that far, I suggest that no objection should be taken at all to quotations, and if no 'objection should be taken to quotations, then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was perfectly in order. </para>

Frankly, I think that the Minister took a great liberty in placing that construction upon the passage, which states quite clearly that a member may not make a quotation from a book the basis of a question. A quotation need not necessarily deal with a statement made by some one else, but might, for instance, be a passage describing some scenery. </para>

                            <para>- It might even be a quotation from another author's work. The matter that appears in a book is the thing that makes it worth reading and the Minister's contention that it is permissible to read an extract from a book, provided that it is not a direct quotation of someone, is completely unsubstantiated. Although I am not always an admirer of the law in its application to every-day life, I say that the law is the accumulation of common sense over the centuries. By the method of trial and error rules and customs become reduced to certain limits, many of which are embodied in legislation passed by the Parliament, so that our laws are made with the consent of those whom they shall govern. In this chamber, we are governed by a set of standing orders; but no one could reasonably suggest that our standing orders could cover every conceivable contingency that may arise. Like our laws, the Standing Orders of the Senate are silent on many aspects of procedure. For instance, the Standing Orders are silent on the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> There is nothing in them to say that an honorable senator may not quote from a book; but parliamentary tradition, which has developed over hundreds of years and has been expressed by many speakers of the House of Commons and Presidents of this chamber, support the principle enunciated in May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice,</inline> which is very definite. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> merely says that members may not quote from a book; and that is neither more nor less than what the  President  said on Thursday last. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> came to the Parliament with wide political experience in Tasmania, and my information is that he was actually  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Is that true or false?  His  reputation has gone before him, but whether it is a reputation for fame or infamy time will tell. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator scares us with strong words! I am merely saying that from all the information we have about him he should be right sometimes when he examines the Standing Orders. I am not concerned with whether or not his legal practice in Tasmania was devoted mainly to criminal law. Whether that was a good background to enable him to inform the  President  of the correctness or otherwise of his rulings I do not know. The fact remains, however, that the honorable senator did the right thing to come to the Senate, because had he remained in the Tasmania Parliament he would have been  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition for many years to come. During the years that I have been a member of this chamber I do not know any honorable senator who has made so many challenges to the  President  and has been right so rarely. The honorable senator must be careful, or the phrase, " Wright is never right " will be applied to him. Concerning the incident that has given rise to the debate, it is obvious that the honorable senator could have couched his question in the simplest possible form, and without breaking the Standing Orders, which he should know because of his background. Other honorable senators who have not had the benefit of his legal experience might be excused for having made a mistake, but he should not be forgiven. Would it not have been simple for him to have couched his question in, say, the following terms : - " Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a statement  by the Prime Minister that government action cannot save us unless we all play our part?" However, apparently the honorable senator wanted to squeeze the last ounce out of the lemon, despite the Standing Orders and the information contained in <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> by which the  President  of this chamber has been guided for many years. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>Having said that, I express my appreciation that in the course of the debate no personal reflection has been cast on the  President,  who occupies relatively the same position as a judge in a court of law. </para>
                    <para class="block">When an act of Parliament is silent on a matter in a case that is being tried before a court, counsel and the jury naturally turn to the judge for guidance. How many acts of Parliament are completely silent on aspects on which they might be expected to throw some light! In such instances it becomes the duty of the judge to determine what the legislature should have expressed in black and white. In the matter that we have been discussing, the Standing Orders are silent on the point whether or not a quotation may be made from a book, and it therefore devolved upon the  President  to give a ruling on the matter. In the ruling that the  President  gave he is supported by the accumulated experience of hundreds of years of parliamentary procedure, and, in particular, by 50 years' experience of the Senate. Furthermore, having regard to May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice,</inline> I cannot understand how the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> can be argued, but can only conclude that the honorable senator has been moved by reasons of pique to seek to justify his attempt to use propagandist matter for political purposes. Both in this chamber and in the House of Representatives too many questions, the object of which has been character assassination, have been asked. Bad as the practice has become in this chamber, it has been a thousand times worse there. That is a new departure in the Parliament, and the sooner it ceases the better. A duty devolves upon the Leader of the Government in each chamber to prevent such questions from being asked. That duty is accepted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> in this chamber, who has decided that he will be responsible for the type of questions asked by his supporters. We are not here to destroy the characters of persons outside the Parliament. We can go outside the Parliament and say all we want from a political platform about individuals, and take the risk of the. consequences that may follow. Honorable senators, when they ask questions in the shelter of the Senate, must be very careful. They must not be unworthy of the trust that has been reposed in them. For the reasons I have given, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I support your ruling. </para>
                    <para>I refer only in passing to the fact that questions are directed to Ministers in-  this chamber who represent Ministers who are members of the House of Representatives. That has been a common practice in the Senate, and I fail to see why objection should be taken to it. When I was a Minister, questions were often directed to me in connexion with matters that were the responsibility of other Ministers whom  1  represented in this chamber. In many instances, I was able- to supply a reasonable answer to the question immediately - I admit that it was not always a complete one - and to promise that the rest of the information sought would be supplied by the responsible Minister later. Why is it wrong for an honorable senator to address a question to a Minister in this chamber who represents another Minister, even when, he knows that it will not be answered immediately? </para>

In those circumstances, we should put as few questions as possible upon the notice-paper. Why should honorable senators be ashamed of asking such questions while the proceedings of the Senate are being broadcast, even though they know that an answer will not be supplied immediately? I accept the challenge of the Attorney-General. I submit that questions of that kind are in order. When the Labour party was in power it did not complain about them, and now that it is in Opposition it does not expect the present Government to complain about them. </para>

While the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> was speaking I said to myself that it was fortunate that he was not charging a fee for the opinion that he was then expressing, because, although the greater portion of his remarks was absolutely correct, in his concluding words he contradicted almost entirely what he had. said earlier regarding the alleged incorrectness of the ruling. I refer in passing to the statement of the Attorney-General that questions have been asked merely for propaganda purposes by honorable senators on this side of the chamber, while the proceedings of the Senate were being broadcast. I point out that on one occasion when, owing to an official function, the Senate did not meet until 8 p.m., questions without notice were concluded by approximately 8.30 p.m. Our proceedings were being broadcast. Three-quarters of an hour was then devoted to supplying answers to questions upon notice asked by honorable senators opposite. Some of the answers covered three pages. The Government took advantage of that opportunity to indulge in propaganda about the work that it had done. </para>

It will doubtless be agreed that during the last Parliament, when 33 members of the Senate were supporters of the Labour party and only three were members of the non-Labour parties, the  President  extended every courtesy to the members of the Opposition and granted them equal rights with members of the Government party. </para>

I believe that the  President,  in ruling in the way in which he did, acted in conformity with established practice, In  one year, the Labour party may be in office and in the following year nonLabour parties may occupy the treasury bench. Therefore, we should do everything possible to protect the rights and privileges of members of the Senate.

Through the years that I have been associated with the  President  in this chamber he has used common sense to the ultimate in the administration of his office.

                            <para>- If it is incorrect for an honorable senator to read to the Senate something from a document, it must also be wrong for an honorable senator to submit, in his own handwriting, an extract from that document previously made. If that is what the Minister intended to convey, I agree with him. I do not think that we should, on the one hand, say that an honorable senator must not do a certain thing, but that he may do it by adopting a different procedure. I submit that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> proposed to cite could have been an opinion or argument. It could also have contained an inference or imputation. Whether it contained facts to explain the question I do not know. However, the desire to use the extract would still be dubious. Of necessity it would be contrary to the meaning and function of Standing Order 99. Had I been  President  I should have ruled similarly. </para>

                            <para>- Recently, a tendency has developed both in the Senate and the House of Representatives to depart from the Standing Orders when asking questions. For instance, it has  become  common to preface questions with lengthy observations. Sometimes, a short preface may be justified or even necessary, but in general, the making of lengthy prefaces represents a departure from thistrict observance of the Standing Orders. Sometimes, the Ministers ask that questions be placed on the notice-paper. Then, when the time comes to answer the question, they deliver a long-winded reply tu the Senate. That practice, also, is not in accordance with the Standing Orders, and when questions are broadcast it provides Ministers with an opportunity to indulge in propaganda rather than tv supply information. All honorable senators are indebted to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> for the way you have administered the Standing Orders. It seems to me that an attempt has been made to introduce propaganda even into this debate. Honorable senators who support the Government have said that questions should not be asked without notice in the Senate of a Minister who represents another Minister in the House of Representatives. Such questions, they say, should be placed on the notice-paper. The practice has always been to ask questions without notice of Ministers who represent other Ministers. If the Minister to whom the question is addressed can answer it he does so. If he is not able to do so, he asks that it be placed on the notice-paper. I object to any proposal to depart from that practice. </para>

                    <para>I express my appreciation of your tolerance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> during your long term of office. You have alway? tried to be impartial in your rulings, and I cannot remember any previous occasion in the last seven years when a ruling of yours has been the subject of a motion of dissent. Sometimes, honorable senators have expressed dissatisfaction with a ruling, but never before has a motion of dissent been moved. I support the ruling that is the subject of this motion. It iin conformity with Standing Order 90. and if it is not upheld the way will be opened to the introduction of undesirable practices. I was astonished that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline></para>

                        <para>. - I propose to deal only with the question at issue. It is necessary that we should do so as realists, and I am pleased that all honorable senators who so far have addressed themselves to the question have been realistic in their approach. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> quoted from May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice,</inline> and raised the point whether the rule governing the quoting of matter from a newspaper could be applied to the quoting of matter from a book. However, if the rule does not apply to a book as well as to a newspaper, an honorable senator would be in order in quoting the entire contents of a book. If the President's ruling be dissented from, it would be possible for honorable senators, by makin lengthy quotations, to keep the Senate in session indefinitely. Standing Order 99 gives the  President  wide power. Honorable senators have quoted from May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> in support of their arguments, but we should also turn for guidance to the established customs and practices of the Senate. I have been a member of the Senate for the last twelve years, during which time many rulings have been .given, some by  President  Cunningham, some by  President  J. B. Hayes, and others by yourself. The very point we are now discussing has been the subject of many rulings during the last twelve years. Now, a new honorable senator has tried to read into Standing Order 99 something which no  President  of the Senate was ever previously able to find in it, and he is asking us to depart from the established practice of the Senate. If we do so, where are we to stop? If every conceivable point has to he covered by a specific provision, the Standing Orders would fill a large volume. As the Attorney-General knows, usage and custom often constitute a deciding factor in actions at law. We also know that Arbitration Courts, in framing their awards, frequently declare that established usages and customs shall not be interfered with. In giving your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> you relied on the custom and practice of the Senate over a long, period of years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who is a new arrival in the Senate, has questioned your ruling. He is, of course, quite entitled to do so, and I merely remark that he seems to be prepared to take more punishment than any otherman I have ever known. He has not taken a trick yet.  His  own leader spoke in support of your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> as also did the Attorney-General, and most other honorable senators who have so far addressed themselves to the motion. </para>

                    <para>If we are to get the best results in this Senate, all honorable -senators should cooperate with the  President.  Are we now ' to refuse that co-operation? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> asks us to refuse it, but I suggest that it would be a grave mistake to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has had experience in another parliament. For some lime he was  deputy  leader of his party in a State parliament, and I understand that he raised many points of order when he was there. Surely he has learned something from experience. The honorable senator reminds me very much of a story J heard about a little boy who went to school for the first time. He was a spoilt little boy at home and when the teacher was trying to teach him his A. B.C., the little boy said that the teacher was wrong and it should start from Z.B.W.M.P.B.F. " It is all right ", said the teacher, " He will learn in time ". </para>

                        <para>. -  I speak in opposition to the motion and in support of the ruling of the  President.  I regret that through my late arrival in Canberra to-day I did not have the advantage of hearing honorable senators on the opposite s:de of the chamber speaking in opposition to the President's ruling. I propose first to review the facts so that the foundation can be laid for consideration of the Standing Orders in application to those farts. Last week in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> rose, addressed a question to the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> and proceeded to direct his attention to the remarks of a distinguished statesman whom hp did not name at that time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> proceeded to say " the statement is . . ."  and presumably be purported to quote the exact words of the statesman. At that point, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> objected to a quotation being made and claimed that such a quotation in a question without notice was objectionable from the viewpoint of the Standing Orders. The  President  made it perfectly clear that, in his view, it was wrong to quote from newspapers or to read quotations from statements in asking questions without notice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Wright</inline> said immediately, " Accepting that indication, I shall endeavour to frame my question in accordance with it". ' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> again endeavoured to frame the question. A further objection was taken by the Leader of the Opposition and again <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who was holding a book, proceeded to frame the question. The  President  then said, " If you are reading in fact from the book you are holding, then you are not in order ". By the clearest implication, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> admitted that he was reading from the book because he said instantly, " Then in that case, I move to dissent from your ruling ". </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I think that is a clear statement of the facts and it shows quite clearly that once <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> indicated by his words that he accepted the President's ruling, he showed by his act that he was acting in clear defiance of the President's ruling. 1 believe that it was in that spirit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> perhaps rather hastily, submitted this motion. It may be a very good thing that he did so. With the light shed on it in this debate, an important point could be clarified. If the Senate decides to uphold the President's ruling, everybody will be in better shape at question time in the future. </para>
                    <para>I shall now pass to consideration of the Standing Orders. The Senate Standing Orders are silent on questions without notice and, in fact, they are brief and sketchy in dealing with questions at all. The first reference is in Standing Order 66 which deals with the routine of business of the chamber and points out the order of the business. The second item of Standing Order 66 relates to giving notices and questions without notice. I pass to a consideration of Standing Order 93 which states - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>After Notices hare been given, Questions may be put to Ministers of the Crown relating to public affairs: and to other Senators, relating to any Bill, Motion, or other public matter connected with the business on the Notice Paper of which such Senators may have charge. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That is interpreted to refer to questions with or without notice. The important point that I draw from that Standing Order is that questions may be put to Ministers of the Crown and they may be questions with or without notice. Standing Order 99 states - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In putting any such Question, no argument or opinion shall be offered, no inference nor imputation made, nor any facts stated, except so far as may be necessary to explain such Question : and the  President  may direct the  Clerk  to niter any Question so as to conform with t !i i =- Order. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I admit that there is ambiguity in that standing order. The question that arises immediately is whether the words " except so far as may be necessary to explain such question " apply to all the matters that are particularized. I prefer the other view. I read Standing Order 99 in this fashion: In putting any such question, with or without notice, no argument or opinion should be offered. I pause there and take that as a substantive provision in the rules. That stands without any exception, in my view, and there is a very clear rule of common sense for that provision. If a senator could address argument to the Senate in framing a question to a Minister on a matter of public interest in accordance with the Standing Order 98, what would be the length of the argument? Would it be limited to five minutes or might it run to one hour? Would that refer to a particular type of question with or without notice? </para>
                    <para>Again, there is complete prohibition on the offering of opinions when an honorable senator is seeking information on public affairs. The words "no opinion shall be offered " are perfectly wide and general in their terms. They do not mean only that the opinion of the senator shall not be offered. They mean that no opinion of any senator or, in fact, anybody at all shall be offered in the course of a question in this chamber. The next section of Standing Order 99 which I quote is the phrase - </para>
                    <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
                        <item label=".">
                            <para>. nor inference nor imputation made. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para class="block">It means that if an honorable senator purports to seek information about public affairs, he should not make inferences or imputations against the government, the Minister or any body outside the Parliament. That is a clear rule of common sense and justice and I am forced to conclude that one must read the words "so far as may be necessary to explain such question " as applying to the words to which they are contiguous. In other words, in putting such question, " no argument or opinion shall be offered nor inference nor imputation made, except so far as may be necessary to explain such question ". </para>
                    <para>The standing order goes on to say - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The  President  may direct the  Clerk  to alter any question so as to conform to this order. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That sentence refers obviously only to a question upon notice which is written and delivered to the clerk at the table, placed on the notice-paper and dealt with on some subsequent occasion. It would not be practicable for the  President  to direct the  Clerk  to amend a question that is flowing from the mouth of a senator and which is not committed to writing other than through the record taken by <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> So the latter part of Standing Order 99 obviously relates solely to a question upon notice. </para>
                    <para>I think I have covered the Standing Orders that bear particular reference to the motion before the Senate and I believe from that analysis that it is perfectly clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was endeavouring to put before the Senate the viewpoint of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. It may have been a very good viewpoint but if the honorable senator was entitled to do that, two consequences would flow. That opinion may have been very lengthy. If the honorable senator was entitled to embark on it, he was entitled to conclude it, even though the opinion took half an hour or an hour. The second conclusion is that if the honorable senator was entitled to quote what the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom said, he would be entitled to quote any statement made by any Domain orator. I number myself among them. I am not speaking in disparaging terms about Domain orators, because I have spoken in the Domain in more than one State. 1 say that the honorable senator would be entitled to mouth in this Senate the opinion of people of high and low degree, of worth and lack of worth, and this Senate could be made the sounding-board at question time for the expressions of all kinds of people who were not immediately connected with the Senate, but would use it when questions were re-broadcast on occasions when the proceedings generally were not being broadcast. I suggest that the rule is strictly in accordance with the quotation of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> when he referred to May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> on page 336. I interpolate here that I understand there are no questions without notice in the House of Commons, but I do not think that that matters particularly because I take it that the ruling made by the  President,  which I am supporting, is directed to questions upon notice and without notice. May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> states - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The purpose of a question is to obtain information or press for action and it should not be, in effect, a short speech or limited to giving information or framed so as to suggest its own answer or convey a particular point of view. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The point that I would underline  is  that it is not framed to convey a particular point of view - and I add, whether it is the viewpoint of the questioning senator or somebody else which he is putting forward-- </para>

                            <para>- In endeavouring to frame his question in accordance with the Standing Orders, the honorable senator indicated that he had in mind the devaluation of the £1. Now that he has interjected, let me say that I was rather astonished that an honorable senator  from  the Government side should raise that matter. I recall that although the Government has undertaken very  speedily  to put more value back into the £1, during the five months that have elapsed since the election, the value of the £1 has depreciated more and more. Therefore, I begin by congratulating the honorable senator on his temerity to embark on such a subject, particularly as thu  Government  has not  given  any indication of what it proposes to do about the matter. Having paid the honorable senator that courtesy and tendered my congratulations to him, 1 assume that he was going to ask whether the Government agreed with the viewpoint of the British Prime Minister on means of putting more value back into the currency. The honorable senator would have been quite in order, I suggest, subject to your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> had he asked the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he had seen a statement by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, about putting value back into the currency, and if so, whether he agreed with the views expressed by the Prime Minister. In that form the question does not put the viewpoint of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom or of Bill Jones, both of whom are perrons outside the Senate, outside the control of the Senate, and who, therefore, should not be able to use this place as a platform for expressing their views. In that way an honorable senator may pose a question which directs attention to a statement with sufficient relevancy to enable the person questioned to identify the matter and, if he is aware of the statement, to give a completely intelligible answer if he has an intelligent mind and a knowledge of the subject matter. Therefore, in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> interjection, I say that that may well have been the way in which he could have handled his question completely in conformity with the President's ruling. I realize that one is occasionally embarrassed when endeavouring to ask questions. In this chamber, there are two opposing political groups and, in the clash of rival thoughts, each side is entitled to, and does, make an effort to stress and press its viewpoint. There is an eternal striving against the Standing </para>

                    <para class="block">I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> was  President  of this chamber for at least thirteen years, so we may regard him as at least having had the opportunity to steep himself in the Standing Orders and the rules and traditions of the Senate. The quotations that I propose to make from the rulings of  President  Givens will indicate how much in line you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have been with his thoughts in this instance. On the occasion to which I have referred, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> ruled further that a question was permissible only to elicit information. It wa« obvious, be said, that -if honorable senators were deprived of the privilege of making a staement in putting a question, no statement by a newspaper should be included in a question, as that would give to newspapers a privilege denied to members of the Senate. There, very clearly, is the principle that underlie-! your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> On the 4th May, 192.1,  President  Givens ruled that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan</inline> was not entitled to make a statement in asking a question, much less to quote a statement that had been made by some one else. On the 12th May, 1921, he ruled, on a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> that a senator was not in order in quoting any statements from the press or from individuals outside the Senate. He was not entitled, in asking a question, to make a statement himself, much less to quote a statement that had been made by any person outside. A few minutes later,  President  Givens gave a similar ruling in relation to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> In August, 1921, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> directed a question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister,  President  Givens said - </para>

Furthermore, the Standing Orders are explicit and emphatic in declaring that no honorable senator may make a statement while asking a question. </para>

The final ruling that I shall quote was given by  President  Givens, on the 19th November, 1918. On that occasion, he ruled that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> was not entitled in asking a ques tion to read a statement from the London correspondent of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> The  President  said - </para>

                        <para>I point out again, as I have frequently done before, that it is contrary to the Standing Orders for an honorable senator to make a statement in asking a question. No one outside Parliament can have a greater right than a member of the Senate in this regard and to give permission to the honorable senator to read the statement he has referred to would give the newspaper correspondent that greater right. </para>

                    <para>A few minutes later, the  President  brought <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> to order and ruled that he was entitled to ask any question seeking information on public business, but not to make a statement or to quote a statement. I suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that in the light of these extracts from the rulings of one of your illustrious predecessors - apart from those of Presidents of this Senate during the intervening period - you have placed yourself in excellent company by ruling as you did last week, and in view of the arguments that have been advanced from this side of the chamber - quite objectively, I hope - on what should be a non-party question, I shall be delighted if the Senate unanimously, or nearly unanimously, upholds your  ruling. There is a very important principle involved. As President Givens said on many occasions, we must not allow this Senate to become a platform for people who are not members of this chamber,, and are not responsible to it. </para>
                    <para>I come now to quotations from newspapers. All of us who have had experience in public life know only too well how often newspapers err and that quoting from newspapers is a dangerous procedure. I do not suggest that newspapers deliberately mislead the people or that they deliberately misquote statements. Mistakes arise from the very way in which their news is gathered. Even in this Senate, what is reported in the newspapers depends on the degree of interest that the " individual reporter is taking in the proceedings. It depends too on his conception of what is of interest, and what is not. The reporter, having done his best in the light of his limited interest or perhaps on some occasion his full interest, sends his report to his newspaper. That report filters through many hands. It goes to the news editor, to the sub-editor and to the editor. Each of them looks at the item from the viewpoint of the space that he has left to fill. The first man blue-pencils the report tfr reduce its size. The second, not knowing what the first has done, again bluepencils the item and it is further bluepencilled by the third man. </para>

                            <para>- That does happen sometimes, but usually some portion of the original report finds its way into the pages of the newspaper which is read at the breakfast tables or the dinner tables of the people of Australia. Under such conditions it is very easy, without any malice at all, for the final report to be a complete distortion of what actually happened. Had we wanted to be harsh we could have imposed very severe restrictions on honorable senators opposite "when they were on this side of the chamber, but having regard to their numbers and to chivalry, we did not object to many things that they did, and it may be as I have said, that owing to the indulgence of the  President  and of the then Government, Opposition senators were permitted to quote freely from newspapers. If this debate clears the air and the viewpoint that I am expressing is accepted by the Senate, I think that we shall have a much clearer perception of the position in the future. I do not put books in a different category from newspapers. After all, books are written to express a viewpoint. It may be the viewpoint of the writer, or of a particular clique, but quoting from books amounts to bringing somebody into this chamber and giving him an elevated platform. Not only may his viewpoint appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but if it is repeated on an occasion when the proceedings of this chamber are being broadcast it will also be heard all over Australia. Peculiar difficulties present themselves concerning the appearance of such matter in official records. According to Standing Order 99 an honorable senator may state facts only so far as it may be necessary to explain a question. That is often a matter for nice judgment on the part of the  President.  If the statement of facts preliminary to the interrogative portion of the question takes longer than the inter rogative portion, or the questioner is too long in reaching the point, the  President  is quite entitled to disallow the question. I draw the attention of the Senate to thi' fact that again and again the  President  has asked an honorable senator to cut short his preliminary recital of facts and to put his question. No fixed line can be drawn in the matter, which is one for the clarity of mind and the good sense of honorable senators themselves and, ultimately, for the discretion of the  President.  Once quotations are permitted at question time it is difficult to know where to draw the line, particularly when the proceedings of the chamber are being broadcast. On days when the proceedings of this; chamber are not broadcast the proceedings at question time are recorded an&lt;i re-broadcast in the evening, and it i? only fair that questions should be kept as short and as concise as possible. It is also desirable that the replies should bc concise and to the point. At this stage I cannot help referring to the unsatisfactory manner in which members of the Government reply to questions. Honorable senators are requested far too frequently to place questions o-n the notice-paper. Of course, I realize from my own recent experience as a Minister that the present Ministers, who have only held their portfolios for a short period, cannot be expected to be thoroughly familiar with the departments that they administer. </para>

                        <para>. - I rise to support your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> I was particularly pleased to hear you say this afternoon that you are prepared to make a decision on any point in the light of common sense and logic and taking into account changing circumstances, rather than to permit the chamber to be ruled by the dead hand of the past. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has proved that not only was your ruling last week in accordance with common sense and logic, but also that it is in line with the established precedents set out in the textbooks. I have read the Standing Orders many times, and no doubt they are open to different interpretations, according to the background, experience and qualification of those who read them. However, the final test of a ruling is whether it is in accordance with common sense and logic. The motion of dissent from your ruling arose, I think, purely from the ignorance of the honorable senator concerned, who had not given himself time to settle down in this chamber and to appreciate the procedure that is followed in it. We have noticed the speed with which the honorable senator has taken points of objection. I was surprised that one who was newly elected to the Parliament did not allow himself sufficient time to become accustomed to the atmosphere of this chamber, which is different from the Parliament to which he formerly belonged in Tasmania. It  seem9  to me that whatever new job one undertakes he must realize that he will inevitably come in contact with people who have greater experience of the pro cedure in that job. One must serve an apprenticeship in a new job. One cannot walk in and take charge without settling down and finding out what it is about. When 1 first entered this chamber three years ago I realized that since I was new to the Parliament 1 had to go carefully, and I sat in my place for some time before I even asked a question of a Minister. Either by good luck or by canny instinct, I escaped many of the pitfalls into which other honorable senators have fallen, and, without any disrespect to them, I have profited by their mistake'. I say that without any malice, but merely as an idea that might well be adopted by honorable senators opposite. </para>

                    <para>It appears to me that whatever interpretation is placed on a ruling of the Chair, it must be accepted in a spirit of sportsmanship. I look upon you, sir, as an umpire, and having had some experience as an umpire in that thrilling game, Australian Rules football, I realize that an umpire has only his quick wits and his whistle on which to rely - and, at times, his fleetness of foot to get him out of trouble when the game is ended. However, after the heat of the game has departed it is usually realized that not only has he done his best, hut also that he has ruled in accordance with the rules of the game; and that is what you have done in this instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> Your rulings, on this as in other matters, have been given in the light of common sense and logic. In other words, you have decided matters, not so much according to the written rules, but in accordance with what you believe to be right and proper, having regard to the need at all times to uphold the dignity of the Senate. I realize that the Government is eager to conclude a lot of parliamentary business, but it appears to me that by bringing forward this matter it is defeating its own object To-day has been appointed an additional sitting day for the Senate to enable th" debate or. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> motion to proceed, but that is not assisting the Government to complete its legislative programme. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> appears almost as a secret, delaying weapon inserted by the Opposition in the Government's ranks. Certainly, almost the entire day's sitting has been occupied in debating whether  or not your ruling last week was correct, and most of the debate has arisen from the remarks made by Ministers who have taken part in the debate. The real point in all these matters, it seems to me, is not so much what was said, but the manner in which it was said. A nasty thing can be said with a smile, and it is accepted by the' other party; but in other circumstances, the strongest objection may be taken to the remark. A similar observation may be made with regard to the replies furnished by Ministers to questions without notice. </para>
                    <para>I am glad that the field of debate has been widened by your remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and that you have given an explanation which affords us an opportunity to express our opinions upon it. I recall that quite recently I asked a question concerning the establishment of the aluminium industry in Tasmania which required only a short reply. However, no oral reply was given to the question, but in due course a written reply was furnished which gave a multitude of extraneous details, almost to the last nut and bolt in the works, and occupied three pages of print. I know all about the area and the progress that has been made in the construction of the works. When I asked the question all I wanted to know was what stage the Government had reached in its construction programme. A great deal of time was wasted in furnishing a lot of extraneous information, based upon the alleged efficiency of the Minister in charge of the project, and the obvious reason for furnishing such a lengthy reply was an endeavour on the part of the Government to make political capital out of the matter. In conclusion, if I might diagnose in medical terms the cause of the present complaint from which honorable senators opposite are suffering I would say that it was not unexpected because certain symptoms were present; the patients are suffering from "political poliomyelitis " and " Liberal lumbago ". They are showing signs of considerable distress at recent political happenings in Tasmania and Victoria, but when the debate is over and they have settled down and realized that they have lost sight of their objective, and that your ruling was right and proper, I shall be disappointed if they do not almost unanimously support your ruling. </para>

                        <para>. - I rise to support your ruling and to oppose this ill-advised motion. It has been shown this afternoon that in giving your ruling you have followed many illustrious occupants of your high office. If incidents such as that which gave rise to this motion had occurred in earlier times, when the proceedings were not broadcast, they would have been dealt with more summarily, and, indeed, the manner in which you disposed of the original incident says a lot for your tact and common sense. It cannot be denied that honorable senators on both sides of the chamber, and particularly those in Opposition, put questions without notice to Ministers which cannot be answered immediately because the Ministers directly concerned are not members of this chamber, and the questions have, therefore, to be placed on the noticepaper. However, I support the protest made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> at the nature of the replies given by Ministers to questions on matters concerning the department that they themselves administer. Concerning the use of quotations in asking questions of Ministers, including quotations from press statements, such as the one sought to be used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> I think that you have been extremely tolerant and have allowed honorable senators every opportunity to ask their questions. I have suffered on some occasions when I have not been allowed to put into a question all that I have desired to put into it but, upon reflection, I have come to the conclusion that the  President  was right. </para>

                    <para>I am convinced that no good purpose would be served by agreeing to this motion. I am at a loss to understand the reasons that prompted its submission. This afternoon and this evening I have watched the legal caucus on the other side of the chamber. I refer to the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan),</inline> the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> and the Government Whip, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> That legal trio is trying to find a way out of the difficulty to which this debate has given rise, because they realize the consequences that 'would ensue if the motion were carried. All members of the Senate who seek ministerial replies to questions on a variety of subjects would be at a disadvantage if the motion were agreed to. To be facetious, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> this debate has led me to the conclusion that if on judgment day our Lord were indisposed, you need not be afraid that you would be appointed to take his place. If he were asked, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> would do so, and, if he did so, we should be reminded of the warning that was uttered by a now famous Australian when he was appointed to high office in the House of Representatives - " May the Good Lord have mercy on you all ". I am sure that some of us would require some assistance. </para>

Throughout the years, Presidents of the Senate have dealt with questions without notice and questions upon notice in a way that was in the best interest of the people of Australia. They have exercised tolerance and good judgment. They have given honorable senators a reasonable opportunity to explain their points of view when asking questions, even to the point of permitting them to indulge in a little political propaganda. It would be bad for all parties if that opportunity were taken from us. </para>

I can understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> a newcomer to the Senate who believed that his legal knowledge would stand him in good stead, submitted this motion, but I fail to understand why the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> seconded it. The Minister has been a member of the Senate for over three years. During the lifetime of the last Parliament, he and his colleagues were called to order by the  President  when they attempted to quote from newspapers when asking questions. I should have thought that the Minister's knowledge of the Standing Orders, of which he has made a study during the last few years, would have prevented him from falling into the trap of seconding a motion of disagreement with a ruling that was in conformity with many other rulings given in this chamber. When I have attempted to quote from  newspapers, I  have been called to order by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and by your predecessor and by his predecessor. I cannot understand what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> quibbled about, nor can I understand the action of the Minister for Trade and Customs in supporting him. </para>

There is no need for me to refer to the Standing Orders ; that has been done already. I urge the Government to put a stop to the frivolity of young legal giants who walk into this chamber believing that they have the right to command it and to tell honorable senators where they "get off". <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is fortunate in that the  President is  very kindly. On at least three occasions another  President  would have named him for the remarks that he made. To-day, having read a standing order, he said, "You cannot get away from that ", but the  President  was very kind to him. I suggest to the Minister for Trade and Customs that he should take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> to his room and there explain to him the courtesies of debate in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>. - As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> has said, honorable senators opposite are not pleased that this debate is still in progress, but the discussion will clarify many points regarding conduct and procedure in this chamber on which some Government supporters appear to be in doubt. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> asked the question from which this debate has arisen, he made several attempts to evade the ruling of the  President,  who exhibited great tolerance towards him. The actions of the honorable senator on that occasion showed clearly that not only was he aware that, having regard to established practice in this chamber, he was acting discourteously, but also that he wished, during question time, when the Government was being sorely pressed upon matters of vital importance to the public, to introduce a subject that would delay the business of the Senate and prevent the real purpose of question time from being achieved. In the course of the debate various authorities and precedents in support of the ruling have been cited. I hesitate to assess the intelligence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Wright</inline> as being so low that he did not know that by submitting the motion he had left the Government with something that it regrets, that is, a very weak case against the ruling. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> said that no discourtesy to the  President  was intended by the submission of the motion. He pointed out that the opinions of legal men are often challenged. That is true. "When lawyers are engaged to prosecute and defend cases, at least 50 per cent, of them must be wrong, because the lawyer who loses his case is always wrong; but sometimes the percentage of lawyers who are wrong is greater than 50 per cent., because in some cases judges disagree with the lawyers on both sides. The analogy of the legal men that has been drawn by the Attorney-General does not support the case that honorable senators opposite have endeavoured to make. It is true that a legal man does not take umbrage when his opinion is challenged, but he is accustomed to giving opinions and, if he can establish them, so much the better for him. I hope that the  President  of the Senate will continue to be just and tolerant. </para>
                    <para>I believe that questions directed to Ministers should be designed to elicit information and that Ministers should extend to honorable senators the courtesy of supplying answers to such questions. If an honorable senator asks a question that is really designed to elicit information from the Government, it does not matter what subject-matter he incor porates in it as long as the objective is a proper one, but when an honorable senator attempts to quote from a book that has been in print for a considerable time, that has been available for the Minister »r anybody else to read and that could be discussed with the Minister outside the chamber, the  President  is acting properly and in conformity with the rulings of his predecessors by not permitting him to do so. It has been said that the passage that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Wright</inline> desired to read was a short one, but it could have been of interminable length. </para>
                    <para>The Opposition has ensured that this matter shall be discussed thoroughly. The debate will not delay legislation that is before the Senate because the other House is not ready to receive it. It appears that the motion was submitted for the purpose of initiating a debate that was entirely unnecessary. I compliment you on your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and I trust that the Senate will uphold it. </para>

                        <para>, - I divide questions into several categories - questions that may be considered to be proper, questions that may be considered to be improper, questions that may be considered to be relevant and questions that may be considered to be irrelevant. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> as the presiding officer of the Senate, must judge a question in the light of the Standing Orders and in the light of what May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> has to say about it, if that publication is accepted by you as an authority. I suggest that in deciding what questions should be allowed and what questions should not be allowed, you are influenced by established procedure. The question that was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was, to my mind, a leading question that suggested its answer. If questions of that kind are to be permitted, there is no limit to the number of them that could be asked. It would be easy to ask many questions of the kind that was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> We could ask, for instance, whether the attention of a Minister had been drawn to a statement made by some one in the House of Commons, in the House of Representatives or at a public meeting. Questions of that kind, particularly when reference is made to written or  reported statements, although very interesting in their way, do not help the conduct of the business of the Senate. In those circumstances the  President  should rule that the question is either relevant or irrelevant, proper or improper. I agree that a tendency has developed recently to a9k questions imputing ulterior motives. Personality should be respected. A question that reflects on the integrity, education or religion of an honorable senator should not he asked. Each question should be dealt with impartially on its merits. Recently there has been a departure from that procedure which, if allowed to continue to the degree that has been evident in another place, will deservedly lower the prestige of the Senate in the eyes of the people. We are not here for the purpose of scoring from one another on matters that do not affect the affairs of the nation, but reflect merely on an individual. I can remember many occasions in this chamber when answers to questions have been very abrupt, whilst on other occasions answers to perfectly earnest questions have been refused. I am very interested in the matter of the purchasing power of the £1, and have followed developments in that connexion closely since World War I. On a number of occasions I have been refused answers to relevant questions, and I have also received impudent answers. Reference has been made to the procedure in the courts. In many instances questions asked by legal practitioners have been disallowed by judges because they were considered improper or irrelevant. The  President  of the Senate is in a position somewhat similar to that of a judge in this respect. I support his ruling because the question asked was leading, and suggested its own answer. I am not adverse to questions being asked for propaganda purposes. I think that they are quite in order. I disagree with the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> in that connexion. If an honorable senator is sufficiently interested to frame an intelligent question for propaganda purposes he should be entitled to ask it. Even though the Minister to whom a question is directed may not be able to answer it immediately, the asking of such a question helps to arouse the interest of persons listening to the broadcast of the proceedings. During my term of office in the former Government I always answered immediately questions that I was in a position to answer. On occasions an honorable senator has informed me, prior to the sitting, of the text of a question that he intended to ask me. That enabled me to make inquiries in order to be able to answer the question when asked in this chamber. Invariably I prefixed my answer by stating that the honorable senator asking the question had been good enough to bring it to my notice previously. That is a proper and satisfactory procedure. I have not the same objection to propaganda as have other members of this chamber. An unwritten law in the Parliament is that, in the asking of questions, or during debates, a member should not reflect unnecessarily or provocatively on other members with whom he disagrees. That makes for a better feeling between members. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has many times previously made provocative, impudent and insulting remarks. If I were to refer to some of his infamous political past, I am 9ure that many people would be astounded. However, I have respect for human personality. Although, since assuming office, the Minister has not treated my colleagues or me respectfully, we have always extended to him the courtesy and respect due to his office. I remind the Senate that Ministers in the former Government always answered questions courteously, and to the best of their ability. It is to be hoped that the Minister will improve in this respect with the passage of time. I do not wish to reflect on the Minister or any one else, but if we are to uphold the prestige of this chamber we shall have to deal with questions on their merits. Political considerations should not develop into personal issues. </para>

                    <para>I was very interested in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> question, and should like to have heard recited the ten lines to which the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> has referred. However, in conformity with  th6  Standing Orders and the accepted procedure in this chamber, quite rightly the  President  disallowed the question. For a considerable time the  President  has been very lenient. Had I been in his place I should have disallowed many frivolous questions, which have tended to make a burlesque of the proceedings in this chamber. Although those questions may have been amusing or entertaining to some people, they added nothing to the knowledge of honorable senators. They did not assist in any way an understanding of the problems with which we have to deal. I offer this comment in all seriousness: If any honorable senator wishes to qualify as a clown or a comedian he should rehearse in places other than this chamber. Although such efforts may be appreciated on the concert platform or at the opera, they are not appreciated in this chamber. We are passing through unprecedented conditions, and in out approach to questions with which we have to deal we should be quite serious. Unless questions that are obviously improper or irrelevant are disallowed the Senate will not be accepted by the people at our valuation. The people who listen to the broadcasts of the proceedings of the Senate will judge the issue. One of the reasons why people speak so disparagingly of the Parliament in general, and politicians in particular, is that they do not consider that many questions have been dealt with by their elected representatives seriously and sincerely. I hope that the President'9 ruling will be upheld, and ti) at, as a result of this debate, honorable senators who have been inclined to make a burlesque of the proceedings in this chamber will exercise greater discretion and discrimination in the future. </para>

                        <para>. - I rise to speak in support of the President's ruling. He has been most tolerant with honorable senators, particularly at question time. Even when the quiet of this chamber has been disturbed during debates on contentious legislation, he has remained calm and has given just decisions. Unfortunately, honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber have fallen into the habit of hurling personal epithets at honorable senators on this side of the chamber. However, I intend to refer only to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> motion that the President's ruling be dissented from. A report of the incident reads - </para>

                        <para>. - To-day, we have been given a demonstration of the degree of unity that may be expected among supporters of the present Government. A similar demonstration was given the other day in Victoria. The people are learning not to expect effective legislation from governments that  rely  for support upon parties which enter into a political marriage one day, and desert one another the next. Never before in my long political experience have I seen a man so openly deserted by his colleagues as the brilliant young legal boy from Tasmania has been deserted to-day. I have often listened to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> speaking in support of legislation, and even though I am politically opposed to him it has been a pleasure to hear him. To-night, however, I felt sorry for him when I realized what a thankless task had been thrust upon him by this inexperienced senator from Tasmania. The Attorney-General, in effect, chided him for having moved the motion of dissent from the President's ruling. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> took no more than five minutes to say why the Senate should support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> motion. </para>

They expect us to have something to say even on this motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> and so miserably supported by two members of the Government. I heartily support your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> as must most other honorable senators, including the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay),</inline> who has had much experience in this chamber. This political giant from Tasmania, who has come here flying his colours like another Napoleon, became vexed when the  President  would not allow him to read an extract in the course of asking a question, and decided to move a motion of dissent from the ruling, although whether he consulted with his colleagues on the matter I do not know. If he did, they have proved traitors to him ; if he did not, I should not like to be <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> when the big boys of his party, including the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> chastise him for wasting a day of the Senate's time. </para>

This motion provides us with an opportunity to comment on the proceedings in the Senate since the present Government ha= been in office. I have asked questions of Ministers in response to requests by constituents for information. On almost every occasion the questions have been most abruptly answered. I make an exception in the case of the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner),</inline> who has always done his best to supply information. However, the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport has never once  given a reasonable answer to a question. It seems to me that we are getting very close to fascism, and it is fortunate for the people that the Labour party is in » majority in this Senate. I remind honorable senators opposite that, when the Labour party was in power with 33 supporters out of a Senate of 36 members, we were never discourteous to the Opposition. All questions asked by Opposition senators were dealt with on their merits, and reasonable replies given to them. </para>

The Labour party has shown recently in Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria that the writing is on the wall for the anti-Labour parties. If the Prime Minister persists with some of the legislation that he has introduced it will not be long befor the Labour party is back on the treasury bench. If the elector« could hear the impudent way in which Ministers of the Crown answer questions put to them in the Parliament, the Labour party would be back in power in a very short time, indeed. I have great pleasure in supporting your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline></para>

                        SANDFORD  (Victoria) [9.44J. - I have been impressed by the lack of support which has been forthcoming for the motion of dissent moved by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline>
                        who came here with a self -inflated ego, obviously under the impression that he was going to reform the Senate. The motion we are now discussing was illconceived, and has not been supported even by the honorable senator's own colleagues. I notice that the Minister for Trade and Customs
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline>
                        and the Attorney-General
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline>
                        were very half-hearted while speaking in support of this motion. The Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline>
                        interjected, but he has not had one word to say in support of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline>
                        Yet honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber had the colossal effrontery to interject while
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline>
                        was speaking that honorable senators on this side of the chamber wore wasting time. It is a Government motion, but not one honorable senator on that side of the chamber, except the two Ministers that I have mentioned, have had the courage to defend
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline>
                        I have no doubt that the honorable senator will be taken to task. Some time ago the Liberal party expelled some recalcitrant members in Victoria. I suggest to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>
                        that he should curb his ego a little. He should endeavour to ascertain the lie of the land before he ventures into these wild schemes. I uphold the ruling of the  President  and join with other senators in saying that we have had the utmost courtesy and tolerance from him. This motion is ridiculous and ill-conceived. That has been borne out by the lack of support from the Government side. I hope that the good sense of honorable senators opposite will prevail and that when the vote is taken they will vote in favour of the  President.

                            - This motion has been used by the Opposition in this chamber  to  pursue the persistent time-wasting tactics that they have adopted ever since the present Government came into office. To-day honorable senators have had a de luxe demonstration of the depths  to  which honorable senators on the Opposition side will descend in obstructing the business of the Government. Its business is to put legislation through this Parliament if the Parliament is in agreement  with it after due consideration. The Senate has had before it to-day a motion which could be debated by any intelligent body of men within one hour. It is a simple proposition that the ruling of the  President  to the effect that reading of an extract from the report of the House of Commons proceedings as part of a question without notice is not in order.. In submitting my motion I am not referring to any particular occupant of the chair. When I address you,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline>
                            I am addressing you as the impartial occupant of the chair having the function of arbitrating upon the proceedings of this chamber.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Before I address myself to such of the submissions that have been made from the Opposition side that I can grace by the name of arguments, I want to refer to two matters which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have seen fit to rule are included in the ambit of this debate. The first is as to the attitude of Ministers to questions in this chamber. Honorable senators have heard some presumptuous statements from the dignitaries of the Opposition reflecting upon copious answers, in some cases, and in others to abrupt answers of the Ministers who have never failed to give courteous and conscientious answers to questions in this chamber. Every opportunity has been taken by honorable senators on the Opposition side to exploit the position when they know that they are interrogating Ministers who merely represent, in this chamber, Ministers who are members of another House. It is quite obvious that the situation should be recognized by anybody who wishes to use the institution of this Senate for its legitimate purpose. That purpose is to be informed upon departmental affairs, and honorable senators should either give the courtesy to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> said that he as Minister was accustomed, by indicating beforehand that the question was to be asked, or should put upon the noticepaper a question directed to a department being administered by a Ministerin another chamber. This criticism of the attitude on answers to questions comes grandly, does it not, from those who display from their questions that they are simply out to make cheap jests whenever they can score a political point, and do not use questions for their proper purpose? </para>
                    <para>The second aspect of the debate on which I shall comment is the reference that was made earlier to-day to a question that was asked last week in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morrow</inline> was mentioned. I was very impressed by the significant silence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morrow</inline> when he rose to speak in this debate. He chose not to say a word upon that subject. Some responsible leaders of the Opposition have stooped to-day to make the accusation that honorable senators on this side are using a coward's castle in referring to that subject on the floor of the chamber.

                            <para>- I took the liberty as  President  to give a good deal of latitude to this debate because I felt that if I did so, honorable senators would be able to clear up many matters that otherwise would have to wait until some future time. I thought that it was better to enlarge the scope of the debate so that we could do, once and for all, that which may otherwise take many discussions. Possibly to some extent I am to blame. I have sat here quietly and have heard many things that may have been beyond the ambit of the debate. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> would be well advised not to pursue the course that he has taken because only a few days ago I disallowed a question for the reason that it affected the personal relationship of a senator to his party. I went so far as to request the Australian Broadcasting Commission not to broadcast it, and I also disallowed the question completely so that it would not be recorded inHansard. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> to leave that matter in abeyance because of the action that I took. </para>

                            <para>- Order! I shall not permit the honorable senator to deal with this question, when I have already told him that it affects a senator personally in his relationship to his party. I admit that we are all public men and our associations are open to criticism or their reverse ; but when I, as  President,  call attention to the effect upon a senator of a question being discussed publicly, and when I have asked other people and organizations not to deal with it, I do not think that it is fit and proper that I should allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> to deal with this question in a personal way. In a general way, we are certainly all subject to criticism by one another and by the general public. We are public men and our attitude and actions are subject to open criticism by the public. However, there is a line to be drawn when the personal relationship of a senator and his party are affected or may be affected adversely. So I ask the honorable senator not to pursue that line. </para>

I do not believe that the Chair should continually intervene in proceedings. If I wished I could probably intervene every few minutes, but I believe that honorable senators have good sense and, like myself, a sense of humour. Therefore, I intervene as little as possible. If an honorable senator resents the remarks of any other honorable senator, he is quite in order in asking that those remarksbe withdrawn. </para>

                            <para>- I shall proceed now to the subject-matter of the motion. You have ruled, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that, in asking a question, an honorable senator is not entitled to read an extract from the official report of the proceedings of the House of Commons. I was astonished at the arguments advanced by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley).</inline> He said that there were two kinds of questions. First, there were those that were asked solely for propaganda purposes, and secondly, those that genuinely sought information. The honorable senator is the leader of a party that has been directing feebly phrased propaganda questions at the Government for the last ten weeks; yet he pretends to deprecate questions that have only a propaganda value! Apparently, in this game of politics, when information is true it is described by those whom it hurts as propaganda, and therefore to be deprecated. Thequestion which in this instance has been described as propaganda sought the view of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> on a most important statement by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford</inline> Cripps, one of the leading socialist members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. When we find that archsocialist expressing the view, according to the official report of the House of Commons, that we must quickly produce more to keep costs down, and saying in addition that increased production cannot be the result of any governmental action, but only of a joint effort in which we all collectively and separately play our full part, we see  in a clearer light the efforts of those obstructionists of the Opposition who have tried to muzzle me to prevent me from pointing out how recreant they are to this leader in the socialist field. </para>

                        Cripps is as much a statement of fact as is a statement of any other condition of affairs such as the lighting in this chamber, atmospheric conditions, or the digestion of the honorable senator. Clearly it is not only in order, but common sense demands, that at least some basis of fact should be laid for every question if it is to be answered.

                        He did not emphasize the following passage: -

                    <para>Then the learned senator went on to say that it mattered not whether the person quoted by a questioner was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, or some stump orator, or whether the quotation was brief or lengthy. In making such superficial statements the honorable senator was clearly flying in the face of (he authority upon which he was relying.

                        Has the attention of the right honorable Gentleman been called to a paragraph in the " Sligo  Champion " in which it is stated that the following resolutions were unanimously passed at a meeting of the  Mullinabreena  branch of the United Irish League - " That with reference to the evicted holding of John Quinn on the Gore-Booth estate,  Streamstown,  county  Sligo,  we call on the Estates Commissioners to send an official here to take up possession of the evicted holding and pay the present occupier (Edward  Layng)  the sum of ?190 in cash as already agreed upon ". " That having the correspondence in reference to re-instatement of John Quinn before us, and knowing as we do the unreliability of Edward  Layng's  word, we hereby declare that nothing but the immediate surrender of John Quinn's holding by Edward  Layng  will satisfy this League, and as the Estates Commissioners are quite willing to pay him the ?100 compensation any day he gives up possession we demand that

If I am not mistaken it has been the practice at the Table to refuse to allow Questions to be put on the Paper asking if a Minister's attention has been directed to a statement in a newspaper, and then quoting that statement. Is it not equally out of order to quote newspaper statements in like manner in a supplementary Question?

                    <para>That refers only to the citation of newspaper reports. It is interesting to compare the circumstances in which that ruling was given with those of the ruling now under discussion. The report referred to appeared in a newspaper called the <inline font-style="italic">Sligo</inline><inline font-style="italic">Champion</inline> and concerned th, activities of estate commissioners. The quotation that I sought to make was from the remarks of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer on the all important question of the value of the people's money. When an honorable senator quotes in support of his arguments a passage from May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> without explaining the ruling upon which the passage is based, and when it is subsequently revealed that the ruling refers only to newspaper reports, honorable senators can gauge the value of his case for themselves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> then made several quotations from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of this Parliament, of 1920 or 1921. All the rulings that he quoted related to newspapers. Having answered those arguments I now offer my own submission very briefly. </para>

                    <para class="block">That means that it is permissible to state oral information, or to state from recollection the contents of a document, whether a newspaper or book, although it is not permissible to quote directly from a document as the basis of authority. Surely, upon reflection, the Senate will agree that, as was so ably demonstrated by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> this afternoon and subsequently acquiesced in by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> when he spoke, once that conclusion has been made apparent, its unreasonableness must persuade the Senate that the information on which a question has been based, particularly if it concerns a matter or fact, should be stated accurately. In this instance the authenticity of the statement was not in doubt because it was an official report of an utterance by a very highly placed statesman. In conclusion, the whole incident contained an element of humour when I found, on what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> called " this high level platform ", that the members who adorn the Opposition are not prepared to receive a statement by so eminent a person as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford</inline> Cripps. </para>

                            <para>- Arising from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has said, I think that I should make my position clear. I have stated on several occasions that honorable senators should try as far as possible to make their questions short and to the point and not to quote at length, particularly because the proceedings of the Senate are broadcast. I ruled out of order a question which included a quotation, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has tried to put words in my mouth and to convey the impression that I would condone the use of a quotation if it were memorized and repeated without referring, say, to a book in which it appeared and without saying, "I am quoting from this book". It would be quite wrong for any honorable senator to do so, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> suggestion that I would tolerate such a practice might place me in a false position. If an honorable senator asks a question that contains quotations that he has memorized, irrespective of whether the quotations are short or long, I shall call him to order. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> instead of reading from a book, were to sit down and memorize slabs of it containing statements by, say, the Prime Minister or <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford</inline> Cripps, and sought to incorporate them in a question to a Minister, he would be distinctly out of order, and it would be ridiculous for me to rule otherwise. Under the circumstances that operate, the Chair must insist that senators restrict their questions to concise statements. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> pointed out, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> could easily have put his question in a form such as that suggested by him, namely: " Has the Minister's attention been drawn to ft statement by the Prime Minister of Great Britain who said 'by government action alone we cannot solve our problems ', &amp;c". Instead of doing so <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> - even after I had tried to explain to him the form in which such a question should be asked - deliberately went on to read from a book, whereas, by reason of his mental capacity and his power of expression, he could easily have asked the question in conformity with the Standing Orders. If we are going to be fair to one another and to give an opportunity to each honorable senator to ask questions during broadcasting time, questions must be expressed shortly so that as many senators as possible may have an opportunity to ask them. </para>
