                        <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Supply whether the Director-General of Recruiting, Sir Edmund Herring, has reported that there is a serious shortage of uniforms for the Army? Is great difficulty being encountered in getting manufacturers to make uniforms, owing to the large profits that they are making from the manufacture of civilian suits and luxury wearing apparel? Has this lack of patriotism and co-operation with the Government caused large contracts to be let in Japan for khaki cloth and other materials for Army uniforms? What steps does the Government propose to take to ensure that recruits, when enlisted, shall be properly clothed and equipped? </para>

It is expected that the manufacture of uniforms will be expedited and that there will be sufficient to meet the requirements of the recruits who are being enlisted at the present time. </para>

If this report is correct, has the Government any plans to prevent the exploitation of the Australian people by these foreign investors ? </para>

Will the Minister also inform the Senate whether -payment was made hy the Government to the commercial stations for the complete hook-up for the broadcast of the Prime Minister's two speeches ? If so, what was the cost? Will the Minister also say whether depriving the people of one hour's broadcast entertainment of their own choice is in accordance with the Government's alleged policy of granting more liberty to the individual? Is the Government's action in making the people pay for something that they do not want a part of that policy? </para>

Will the Minister consider the establishment of additional radio beacons at Cape Leeuwin, Cape Borda, Gabo Island, Point Stephens and Cape Moreton ? </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">Binburra</inline> has completed its sea trials, but because of an industrial dispute its sailing has been delayed. We had hoped that the ship would leave to-day to load sugar in Queensland. I have received a report from Mr. Mackay, Assistant Director of Skipping, stating that the secretary of the Seamen's Union at Brisbane has refused to permit members of the union to sign on Binburra unless an additional crew attendant is engaged. At present, the ship carries one crew attendant as required by the orders of the Maritime Industry Commission. The Brisbane secretary is referring the matter to the general secretary of the Seamen's Union, Mr. E. B. Elliott. It is expected that Mr. Elliott will insist on the second crew attendant being employed, and the matter will then be referred to the Conciliation Commissioner, Mr. Hamilton Knight, for a decision. I am sorry to have to inform the people of Queensland that no fewer than 23 ships have been held up during the last month for various reasons. Mr. Elliott, the general secretary of the Seamen's Union, is a well-known Communist, and we are convinced from reports received that the many temporary holdups of shipping have been instigated by Communists. </para>

                            <para>- The Department of Supply has no control over the allocation of steel plates to the shipbuilding industry. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited advises that shipbuilding is regarded as a high priority and the company collaborates with shipbuilders with regard to rolling programmes. There is no fixed quota but, subject to maintenance of steel production at a reasonable level, it is the aim of suppliers to meet the full requirements of the industry including shipyards in Queensland. However, difficulties that arise from time to time militate against prompt despatch of steel produced for shipbuilding purposes. </para>

It will be remembered thatSenator Hendrickson, Senator Sandford, and I tried during last session to obtain from the Government an assurance regarding the payment of superannuation to officers who were recalled to Commonwealth employment. I was given to understand by the Minister that a committee was to be appointed to investigate the claims of those officers. I ask the Min.ister now whether such a committee was in fact appointed and, if so, whether it has yet investigated the claims? If a committee has not yet been appointed, when is one likely to be appointed so that those retired public servants may obtain the remuneration that is due to them ? </para>

What progress has been made in the provision of suitable institutions for the care and treatment of those people? </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable senator is no doubt aware, the Government's building programme not only for repatriation but also for other purposes, is meeting with considerable difficulty, and the requirements of the Repatriation Department are not being met as rapidly as we had hoped. However, I am pleased to be able to advise the honorable senator that the department's psychiatrist, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Alan</inline> Stoller, has gone overseas to study psychiatric treatment in Europe and the United States of America.  His  work was so well thought of by the World Medical Congress that he was invited by the secretary of that body to lecture for three months in the United States of America and in other parts of the world entirely at the expense of the congress. That invitation was a great compliment to both the Repatriation Department and to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Stoller</inline> himself. I am pleased to be able to inform the honorable senator that a new repatriation out-patient clinic- was opened yesterday at St. Kilda-road, Melbourne, for the treatment of psychiatric cases. Men and women who have served in the forces and who to-day suffer from neurosis in any form as the result of their war service are well catered for by the repatriation institutions. The  chairman  of the Repatriation Commission informed me this morning that the new outpatient clinic in Melbourne is as good as anything of its kind in the world. It is recognized by the psychiatrists of the Repatriation Department that war experiences are very often the cause of the failure of an ex-serviceman to settle down and adjust himself to civil life. An important part of the treatment is to render these stored-up  experiences harmless and thus rid the patient's mind of deeply repressed experiences that might in the future causes trouble. Team-work in the treatment of neurosis cases has  reached  a very high level. Similar clinics to that established in Melbourne will be provided in each of the capital cities as soon as materials are available and additional teams of psychiatrists have been recruited. I assure the honorable senator that this branch of the work of the department has been given a great deal of consideration and is receiving very high priority. It is realized that early treatment of neurosis cases is essential if we are to prevent patients from having to enter institutions for in-patient treatment. I shall advise the honorable senator from time to time as further progress is made in the provision of facilities for the treatment of war disabilities of this type. </para>

                            <para>- I preface my question to the Minister for Repatriation with the statement that, as fresh light has been thrown upon the case of Dr. James, I desire to have some facts verified. Can the Minister say whether Dr. James was dismissed from his position at Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital because a defamatory rumour was accepted and acted upon without investigation? Is it a fact that, when the Minister caused the question of Dr. James's dismissal to be investigated after questions had been asked in the Senate, it was discovered, on or about the 1st June, that the information upon which the authori ties had acted was completely inaccurate and that the dismissal of Dr. James could not be justified? In view of the fact that Dr. James was informed by the repatriation authorities that his dismissal had been ordered by the Public Service Board, which refused to accept responsibility for it and blamed the Repatriation Department, will the Minister explain who really ordered the dismissal of Dr. James and state the reasons for the dismissal? Is it a fact that, although Dr. James was dismissed under the authority of section 82 (6) of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, that provision does not apply to employees performing duties of the kind undertaken by Dr. James? If this be so, was Dr. James dismissed wrongfully and improperly? In view of the fact that Dr. James and others have repeatedly asked for a public inquiry into the dismissal and that the Government has refused to accede to those requests, is it not obvious that it is the Government and not Dr. James that has something- to hide ? Will the Minister explain why he is anxious to avoid the inquiry? Is the Minister aware that Dr. James has suffered personal, professional and financial damage because of what is considered to be a departmental blunder? Will the Minister, in the interests of common justice and also in the interests of patients who are being deprived of the services of a competent doctor, order that Dr. James be reinstated and compensated? </para>

                        <para>- The Government is determined to proceed with the passage of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950 in order to prevent occurrences such as those described by the honorable senator. Although the Government has not sufficient power at the moment, it hopes to have it in the near future. The protection of the people rests, of course, in the hands of the police, but the Government feels, nevertheless, that it is vital to enact the Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950. </para>

                                <para>- So far as the Navy is concerned, the national service training centres at present envisaged are at Sydney, Hinders Naval Depot (Victoria) and Fremantle, where the greatest use can be made of existing facilities. The setting up of training centres in other areas such as Albany has been considered but is not possible at present owing to (ft) the necessity for economy of training effort enforced by shortage of officers and instructors; (Z&gt;) the necessity for using, as far as possible, existing establishments rather than erecting new buildings; (c) the naval manning position making it necessary to commission a minimum number of ships for training purposes. However, the interest of the people of Albany in the Navy over the years is fully appreciated, and while it is not possible to set up a training centre there at present, the desirability of doing so will be kept in mind. </para>

Because no rates are paid by the Commonwealth in respect of these premises, the municipalities in which they are located are involved in a substantial loss of revenue and, consequently, on some occasions have been forced to increase the rates levied upon ratepayers. I ask the Minister whether the Government will agree to meet representatives of some of the municipalities concerned in order to discuss with them the payment of rates upon Commonwealth properties? </para>

                        <para>- Apparently the honorable senator misunderstood what the Prime Minister said. The right honorable gentleman indicated some very efficacious means by which increases of prices could be prevented.  His  reference to the effect of the floods in New South Wales and Victoria upon the cost of living was specifically in relation to the price of vegetables. If a shortage of a commodity is caused by floods or drought, that shortage always leads to an increase of price. That is why it is so important to increase production if prices are to be reduced. </para>

                        <para>- Concessions sought by various organizations have not been granted by the South Australian, Western Australian and Commonwealth railways systems for inter-system travel to or from Western Australia, since February, 1942. At that time, all concession fares, with the exception of concessions to blind persons and to students travelling between their homes and schools during vacations, were suspended to meet the wish of the Prime Minister that, 'on account of the defence needs of the nation, rail travel be restricted as far as possible. Conditions since the war have not permitted of the concessions being reintroduced on the railway systems of the Commonwealth and those two States. The concessions were restored between Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania from January, 1947; but by a decision of the Australian Railways Commissioner's Conference early this year, inter system fares concessions generally were abolished as from the 1st March, 1950. An exception was made only in the cases of concessions to students travelling between their schools and their homes during recognized vacations, and blind persons. These concessions still apply. Representations have been made to the Commissioner by a number of university societies, including the National Union of University Students, with a view to having the concessions restored; but, having regard to the fact that under existing conditions it is only with great difficulty that accommodation on trans-Australian trains can be found for all passengers desiring to travel, paying full fare - it is not unusual for intending passengers to be obliged to wait for several trains beyond that for which they wish to book - it has not been practicable to comply with the requests. Arrangements have been made, however, for the whole question to be reconsidered at the next conference of Australian and New Zealand Railways Commissioners in February, 1951. </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">The production of wine, including wine for distillation, has been maintained at a high level, the 1950 output being estimated at 32,000,000 gallons, compared with last year's record of 34,180,000 gallons. The downward trend in postwar wine exports which commenced during 1948-49 has continued throughout the past year, and shipments to all overseas destinations approximated only 1,100,000 gallons. The decrease is almost entirely reflected in sales to the United Kingdom, to which market only 584,000 gallons were shipped during the year under review. It is felt that the prohibitive revenue duties being levied on wine entering the United Kingdom are largely responsible for the diminution in the volume of exports to that country and, as indicated in the board's report, the Government is persisting in its efforts to have the rate of the import duties, particularly on Empire dessert wines, substantially reduced. The increased demand for fortified wine for sale within Australia has been considerable in recent years, and in 1949-50 the quantity withdrawn from bond for local consumption reached the record quantity of approximately 11,386,000 gallons. </para>

                    <para>. - I object most strongly to this vandalistic attempt to take the business of the Senate out of the hands of the Government. Such action is without precedent. Even when a Labour government lacked a majority in this chamber, never at any time did the Opposition behave in the way that the present Opposition is behaving, and never did it take the business of the Senate out of the hands of the Government. I sincerely trust that honorable senators will ponder this motion before they vote on it., What comfort will it be to them to know that, in order to gain a petty, political advantage, they have dragged the traditions of the Senate in the mud? This Senate has a definite part to play in the government of the country. The framers of the Constitution provided that the Senate should be a house of review to impede the passage of hasty and ill-considered legislation. The Opposition is attempting to prevent the free and open discussion of business. The matter that I am trying to get before the chamber was fully and completely debated, to the point of exhaustion of members of the Opposition themselves. On a previous occasion, I referred to a statement made by the Lord Chancellor of England - and a Labour Lord Chancellor at that - Lord Jowett, when discussing the position, powers, responsibility and duties of the House of Lords in relation to the popular chamber. The words he used are well worth repeating. This is what Lord Jowett said - </para>

                <para class="block">The conditions which might goad the people into abolishing the Senate are now being created by honorable senators opposite. To-day the remnants of a party elected with a majority in 1946,  but completely decimated at the elections of 1949 when every State except one returned anti-Labour majorities to this chamber, is frustrating the will of the people expressed in 1949. The Opposition is creating circumstances in which the people of this country will, with every justification, rise in their wrath, and ask Labour to implement its policy and abolish the Senate. But let the thing be done decently. Do not, for mere party political gain, debase and disgrace this chamber before it is abolished. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that I have no intention to reflect upon your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> The facts are that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> submitted a motion providing that theCommunist Party Dissolution Bill should take precedence over the measure sponsored by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> McKenna.  Before you gave your ruling the Opposition had indicated quite plainly that it was not prepared to permit Government business to take precedence over the business that its  deputy  leader had brought before this chamber. That is my first point. My second point is, that the Opposition now proposes to interfere with the order in which Government business shall be considered. That, I suggest, has never been done before. I invite any honorable senator opposite to cite one occasion when such a state of affairs has occurred in this Parliament, in the parliaments of the States, or in the Mother of Parliaments. Certainly in the past 100 years there is no precedent for an Opposition going to the length of insisting that an item of business placed on the notice paper by a government shall be preceded with at the request, and upon the insistence, of the Opposition. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> were to announce to-morrow, let us say, that he did not wish to proceed with his prices control legislation, surely it would be quite wrong for a majority in this chamber to say to him, " You must go on with your bill ". <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is the sponsor of the bill, and if he does not desire to proceed with it, he should not be compelled to do so. There may be a way to deal with such a situation; the attitude of the Senate would probably be, " Very well, in these circumstances, the bill will be struck from the notice-paper ". It would be entirely unprecedented for members of this chamber to continue with the consideration of the bill after its sponsor had indicated that he did not intend to, proceed with it. Such a situation would be somewhat akin to one that might arise in a court of law. When a plaintiff brings action against a defendant, but then comes into court and says to the magistrate, " I do not wish to proceed with this action the matter is struck out. Surely honorable senators opposite do not suggest that, in such a situation, the defendant could somehow take the matter up and deal with it in some way to his own advantage. </para>

Not only is the Opposition taking the business of this Senate out of the hands of the Government, but also it is taking Government 'business out of the hands of the Government. On Wednesday last we were told by the Opposition that the most important and urgent matter of business was its bill to alter the Constitution to enable the Commonwealth to deal with prices. How far has consideration of that bill proceeded in the meantime? </para>

                        <para>- In this instance no vote was taken, so I cannot be accused of having reflected on a vote of the Senate. The truth of the matter is that in spite of the efforts we made during the sitting on Thursday of last week to get on with the business on the notice-paper, it was not until late on Thursday night that the Opposition permitted the Leader of the Government to deliver his second-reading speech on that so-called very urgent measure. Now, in the afternoon of Tuesday of the following week, does the Leader of the Opposition say that the most urgent business to be dealt with is the bill designed to enable the Commonwealth to deal with the subject-matter of prices? Not a bit of it ! To-day that matter seems to have become far less urgent than the Commonwealth Bank Bill, which the Opposition desires to take precedence, over not only its own most urgent measure but also the Communist Party Dissolution Bill, which the Government regards as most urgent. From what has occurred in this chamber since we resumed our sittings last Wednesday, we can only draw the conclusion that the Opposition was not sincere when it described the bill relating to the control of prices as a most urgent measure. We can only conclude .that that measure was introduced by the Opposition for the purpose, not of serving the public interest, but of providing the members of the Labour party with an excuse for not proceeding with the consideration of the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. Now, apparently, with a view to delaying the matter still further, and to provide the Opposition with an excuse for not going on with the business with which it should be dealing, honorable senators opposite propose not merely to take the business of the Senate out of the hands of the Government but also to take over the conduct of the business of the Government and to deal with it in a manner unprecedented in a.ny democratic parliament. </para>

                        <para>- If Opposition senators do not wish to proceed with the consideration of the bill relating to prices, let them indicate their willingness to proceed with the Communist Party Dissolution Bill, which is the more urgent measure and which could be disposed of without difficulty this week. As a matter of fact, if the Opposition is really sincere about both of these measures, they could be disposed of this week. Honorable senators opposite, are not game to consider them, and because of that they now proceed to go to lengths completely unprecedented in any parliamentary institution of which I know. </para>

                    <para>. - The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer),</inline> as a member of the legal profession, has a great regard for precedent. "We can understand that attitude but the honorable senator has sought to draw a wrong assumption from what has happened here in relation to the motion proposed by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley),</inline> which, he said, is without precedent in any Australian parliament. "What does that claim amount to as a matter of argument? No point is to be derived from the fact that something has been done that has never been done before. The very fact that something has not been done before may be complete justification for its being clone now. I point out to the Senate that the bill which the Leader of the Opposition proposes shall be given momentary priority is listed on the notice-paper by reason of a Government motion which was carried on the 23rd June last - that the measure be taken into consideration by a committee of the Senate forthwith. After a delay of three and a half months the Government got itself into such an unenviable position last Thursday night that in spite of the fact that earlier in the day a Minister had proposed that the Senate should sit on Friday in order to complete urgent business, it preferred to adjourn the business of the Senate at ten minutes past 8 p.m. rather than consider the bill at that stage. What troubles the Government in relation to the Commonwealth Bank Bill? Before I approach that point, let me remind the Attorney-General that the Senate is the master of its own business. The business of the Senate is controlled by the Senate and not by the parties that sit on either one side or the other. Provision is made in the Standing Orders for the submission of a motion of the kind proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, who acted strictly in accordance with parliamentary practice in submitting it. Whether or not such a motion has previously been proposed in any parliament of Australia makes not the slightest difference. On Thursday night of last week we gave to the Government an unqualified assurance that if it wanted to deal with the Commonwealth Bank Bill, which it decided should be dealt with forthwith on the 23rd June last, the measure would be disposed of in a matter of a few minutes. Our attempt to bring on that business and dispose of it in accordance with our assurance and in consonance with the motion directing that it be dealt with forthwith on the 23rd June last has provoked a debate which, at the instance of the Government, has now lasted for about half an hour. I leave it for the Senate to judge who is temporising in this matter, and who is responsible for the delay. The Leader of the Opposition proposed his motion in one sentence. I seconded it without comment. To date, two long speeches have been delivered on the motion, one by the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan and the other by the Attorney-General. Both honorable senators sought to raise various matters, doubtless with the desire to open a full debate and thus fool away the time of this Senate. I repeat the assurance that I gave on Thursday, that if the Commonwealth Bank Bill is called on it will be disposed of by the Opposition in a few moments. If the consideration of the measure takes longer than that, the delay will be attributable to tactics adopted by the Government. What is the objection of the Government to dealing with a measure that it considers urgent when the Opposition has given an assurance that it does not intend to debate it? The answer is perfectly clear. The Leader of the Government in this chamber to-day does not know as a fact whether the Opposition intends to insist upon its amendments or veer in the other direction.</inline></para>

                        <para>- The Government is in an awkward position in another place because of the introduction of an exactly similar measure. That is one of the predicaments that face it. The other is that it wants to put the Senate in the position of having refused for a long period, to deal with this measure, when the reason for any delay is wholly applicable to itself and not in any way to the Opposition. But for the debate that has been provoked by the members of the Government, this bill would have been behind us; a decision would have been reached and we should have been dealing with the extremely urgent matter of prices. From the point of view of the best interests of Australia, no better proof of the high priority of this question could have been furnished than by the Prime Minister's own conduct. The measure to control prices was introduced into the Senate on Wednesday last and the Prime Minister rushed to the people of Australia on Thursday night. Moreover, on Friday night he rushed to the people of Australia with the solution to the problem. I ask the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> in particular, since he is a lover of precedent, had he previously heard of a Prime Minister, one week before the delivery of the budget, broadcasting its contents to the people of Australia and not disclosing them to the Parliament of the Commonwealth? If the Attorney-General is such a stickler for precedent perhaps he will point out to the Prime Minister how utterly unprecedented that action was. I invite anybody to point out a previous occasion in Australian history when a Prime Minister, on a Friday night in the week proceeding the delivery of the budget, told the whole story to the people of Australia. </para>

                <para>The Opposition makes no apology for its contention that control of prices is the Al problem confronting Australia to-day. The Prime Minister said so in his policy speech. The Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> also expressed that view quite recently, on the very day that the Prime Minister discussed defence, and the Prime Minister again indicated it most plainly in his broadcast to the nation only last week. I have no desire to debate the subject further. I should not have spoken at al] but for the points raised by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">('Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> and by the Attorney-General. The Opposition is perfectly happy to allow the matter to go to a vote, dispose of the Commonwealth Bank Bill very rapidly - in a few minutes as far as the Opposition is concerned - and then proceed with the real business of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - I repeat the assurance given by- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that if there is no obstruction from Government senators the measure now under discussion will take only, a few moments to disposeof. I should like to clarify statements made by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> and the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan).</inline> The Minister for Trade and Customs stated that nowhere else in the world has the business of government been taken out of the hands of the Government. I draw his attention to the fact that during the term of the Scullin Government, on the 23rd November, 1929, the Leader of the Government , in this chamber moved the adoption of a sessional order to provide for sittings on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and' Fridays of each week. The Leader of the Opposition at that time objected to sittings on Tuesdays and the Leader of the Government stated that if an amendment were moved to that effect it would have to be accepted. On the 10th July, 1930, the Central Reserve Bank Bill was referred to a select committee. On the 5th August, 1930, the Sewing Machine Bounty  Bill was negatived on the second reading. On. the 13th November, 1930, a further extension of time was granted to deal with the report of the select committee on the Central Reserve Bank Bill. That was insisted, upon by the Opposition. On the- 28th May, 1931, an address to the Governor-General, regarding the re-enactment of regulations previously disallowed by the Senate, was moved by the Opposition and passed. On the 13th July, 1931, during discussion of the Appropriation Bill 1931-1932, suspension of Standing and Session Orders, to enable the bill to pass all stages without delay, was refused by the Opposition. I repeat the assurance given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that the motion to be moved will only occupy the space of a few moments. </para>

                    <para>- Th that you have taken, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> has nothing to do with the motion, which relates only to a suspension of the Standing Orders. My point is that your direction to the  Clerk  to call on an item of government business was not in contravention of a standing order, but in contravention of a tradition of the Senate that has been unchallenged and untouched since federation. You have given a ruling with which I disagree, and I trust that we shall have an opportunity to debate it forthwith, because it is a matter which, under the terms of the Standing Orders, requires immediate determination. The  Clerk  would not call on this item of government business without a direction or ruling by you. It is with that ruling or direction that I disagree. </para>

                    <para>- The Minister for Trade and Customs is apparently asking me, as  President  of this honorable chamber, to act directly contrary to the will of the Senate. There was a division, the result of which was 33 Ayes and 23 Noes. The Senate made its decision. In ordinary practice, I do not call upon the  Clerk  to read Orders of the Day. Under the Standing Orders, the  President  is supposed to call upon him to do so, but it is such a routine matter that we do not worry about it. The  Clerk  knows that, when we have reached a certain stage of our proceedings, he is required to call on the Orders of the Day. In order to be explicit and clear upon this matter, instead of following the practice of remaining silent that has developed, I, as  President,  gave expression to the will of the Senate. It was not my ruling or ray decision. I had nothing to do with it. As  President,  I am here to preside over this chamber and to give effect to its will. 1 cannot enter into the rights or wrongs of decisions of the Senate. The Senate earn-' to a definite decision. If that decision bc against tradition, I cannot help it. </para>

                    <para>- Order ! Does the Minister mean to say that, as  President  of this chamber, because of a certain tradition that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> has shown is not, after all, an absolute tradition, I must act contrary to the will of the Senate? The Senate expressed itself. It had the right to express itself in that way because one of the Standing Orders makes it competent for the Senate, on a motion carried by an absolute majority of the whole number of senators, to take the business of the chamber into its own hands. Whether the decision of the Senate be right or wrong has nothing to do with me, as  President.  The Standing Orders have been carried out. </para>

                    <para>- I rise to order. I' am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> has emphasized the terms in which his motion was couched. He has reminded us that it was that so much of the Standing Orders should be suspended as would have prevented a certain event from occurring, namely, the  Clerk  of the Senate reading and order of the day forthwith. The whole point is that, even before that motion was agreed to, there was nothing in the Standing Orders that would have prevented the  Clerk  from doing that. That which prevented him from doing that before the motion was agreed to was the practice and tradition of this chamber, which is that the  Clerk  will not call on any item of . Government business except at the request of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. There was nothing in the Standing Orders. The motion of the Leader of the Opposition to suspend them for that purpose was completely misconceived, and, like empty thunder, it achieved nothing. However, I am glad to observe outward signs of pleasure on the faces of honorable senators opposite, because they have been very afraid since the last time that I had the honour to address them. They are stone-walling- </para>

                    <para>- In the circumstances, it is somewhat difficult to come to the point briefly. Obviously, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Katz</inline> does not understand the effect of the motion that has been moved by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan),</inline> which I support, disagreeing with the President's ruling. I emphasize that the motion by the Leader of the Opposition had nothing to do with any standing order. The <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of the Senate for the 23rd June last show that when the Commonwealth Bank Bill, which is the subject-matter in relation to which the  President  has given a direction to the  Clerk,  was before the  chamber, it was not left on the basis that the Senate should resolve itself into committee. </para>

                    <para>- I repeat that the Commonwealth Bank Bill was not left in the stage that it had been merely referred to the committee: The last record in the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> in respect of this matter was that the amendments were insisted on accordingly,, and that the resolution was reported to the  President.  It is completely wrong and misleading for honorable senators to say that the last record of the proceedings ' in relation to this shows that it was ordered that the message should be considered by a committee of the whole forthwith. Therefore, Standing Order 261 has nothing to do <inline font-style="italic">with the matter.</inline> I shall recapitulate the three points that- 1 have endeavoured to make. The first was that the motion of the Leader of the Opposition was completely ineffective, because it merely suspended the Standing Orders, and could not govern the practice in the Senate. </para>

A&gt;s the matter stands, the Senate has made a decision, which I cannot go against. To clarify the position, I shall read the record of that decision, which was, that so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would" prevent the  Clerk  of the Senate from calling Government, business, Order of the Day, No. 2, Commonwealth Bank Bill 1950. It was carried by 33 votes to 23, which satisfied the requirement that the Standing Orders shall not be suspended unless by an absolute majority vote. That vote has been- registered. Furthermore, a motion has been' moved and" seconded that the  Clerk"  should: be directed to read the Order of the Day. </para>

Even if all of these things had been complied with, there should have been a motion for postponement to another day for debate, unless the Senate expressly ordered otherwise. For these reasons, I claim that no further discussion should be permitted. I repeat that my first point was that there was no ruling or decision which could be the subject of appeal or dissent, the point being that the Senate had expressed itself in that form. I submit that the  Clerk  of the Senate should forthwith read the order of the day. </para>

                        <para>. - When the Senate adjourned on Thursday, I was pointing out that wages, for all practical purposes, were pegged when they were regulated either by a court or by agreement with the employers. That is beyond question. Wages are fixed, and that means, in effect, that they are pegged. Prices, on the other hand, which may be described as the approximate monetary expression of the exchange value of commodities, are not fixed. They are regulated by leading monopolies and trade agreements. Therefore, the purchasing power of wages can be reduced by private monopolies, by trade agreements and by other expedients, and that is precisely what is happening to-day, with the result that prices are becoming prohibitive. Prices are being charged far in excess of the value of the goods, and in excess of the ability of many ' wage earners, salary earners and pensioners to pay. Therefore, when the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> said that wages were not pegged he was stating something that is contrary to fact, as is well known to every one who has to pay present-day prices. The question is whether prices are to be controlled by private monopolies or the Government should itself assume the function of controlling prices. The assumption of such control by the Commonwealth Government would necessitate an alteration of the Constitution ; hence the need to refer the matter to the people by referendum. A referendum on this question was held in May, 1948, and members of the then Opposition, almost to a man, opposed Commonwealth control of prices. In effect, they said that monopolies should exercise that control, as they are doing to-day. The parties then in opposition now form the Government, and must accept full responsibility for a situation that has been condemned by practically every section of the press. That situation will lead ultimately to chaos if something is not done. Up to the present, Ministers have done their best to prevent anything from being done. Ministers used to say that the Government would restore the value of the £1, and they sought to create an impression, in the minds of the people that immediate action to that end would be taken. However, nothing has been done yet, and I say that the  Government  does not intend to take any action if it can avoid doing so, because the taking of action would amount virtually to repudiating its own policy, and it is not likely to do  that.  Apparently, the policy of the Government is to allow things to drift in the hope that the problem will be solved by standing passively by. A state of chaos results, and hundreds of thousands of workers and their dependants are reduced to the bread-line. The Minister for Trade and Customs said that mere pricefixing, could not of itself achieve anything useful. What are we to understand by that? Speaking on behalf of the Government and its supporters in this chamber and in the House of Representatives, the Minister has clearly admitted that the present Administration does not intend to re-introduce prices control and believes, without any qualification whatever, that control of prices cannot serve any useful purpose. I contend that the Government, quite apart from its lack of knowledge of economics, has not the moral 'Courage to control prices. If honorable .senators opposite persist in that attitude, they will impoverish hundreds -of thousands of people who voted for them at the last election, who h'ad confidence in them, and now look to them for help. Those people will be betrayed. According to the Mel.bourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun News-Pictorial</inline> of !the 7tl! October, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said - </para>

That is 'a factor that must be understood. The Prime Minister would be a party to taxing workers to "the extent of millions of .pounds of 'alleged capital charges that have never been incurred. Consider, for instance, housing. When the initial capital cost of -a house "has 'been recovered, the ' house is re-capitalized. That happens over and over again, and enables owners to recover :capital charges "that .have 'never been incurred. That is one reason wiry there are slums in every city.

The 'Government 'has not Che moral courage 'to take the action necessary either to abolish or "reduce 'to the .minimum these unjust- capital charges. If justice were done, after the capital cost of a house 'had been -recovered, the rent would be reduced to the cost of maintenance and rates. There is no moral justification 'for any other charge. There may be a legal justification under our property laws, but the effect of the process is to rob indirectly the -poorer section of a community which is unable to -protect itself. Most of those people do not understand the process of which they -are victims. Our slums will remain as long as the workers tolerate them and allow themselves to be misled by false ideas and promises that are never intended to be kept. </para>
                    <para class="block"> Another factor in prices, is, of course, inflation. The Government does not /propose to do anything about that either. Tt stands idly by and permits the inflationary .process to -continue. Prices today are almost .prohibitive. It is appalling to read in the press that aged ;pensioners have been reduced to scavenging at markets for the ;green vegetables that they are unable to purchase. Honorable senators opposite are parties to that state of affairs. When a worker renders a service, he is 'paid once only. He is not allowed to re-capitalize that service and claim the same remuneration many times over. That is "the fundamental difference between the owners of the means of production :and those who have only their labour power to sell. It is clear therefore that, taking into consideration .the other factors to which the Prime Minister referred, the task to be performed if our economy is to be restored to normal is great, and requires a great deal -more courage than the Government has shown so "far. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Trade and Customs said that one of the most-effective ways to check .rising prices was -to increase production. That is not true. Workers are -.able to purchase with their wages only a portion of what they produce. The more they .produce in excess of the purchasing power of their wages, the less they receive in payment. Therefore, no matter how much .production is increased in excess of the purchasing .power of wages, salaries and pensions, the worker does not benefit. 'Over-production means surpluses, and what is the use of surpluses .to workers if they cannot purchase them? </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. We can produce practically everything that we need. In the past many commodities that could have been manufactured in this country have been imported. They -were produced 'by cheaper labour in Japan or Germany. That is one reason why, at the beginning of the war, our secondary industries, particularly our engineering industries, were about 60 years behind the times. The exigencies of war -were such that, for all practical purpose we had immediately to reorganize our secondary industries to bring them up to date. We had to undertake the production of many commodities that previously had been imported. However, excess production only reduces production costs and increases profits. On many occasions in the past, the profits of employers have been 80 great that millions of pounds worth of commodities have been destroyed to keep prices up, or production  has been  deliberately curtailed to that end. Had World War LT. not occurred, manufacturers would probably have destroyed the colossal stocks of commodities that were accumulating at that time. Even to-day, with a war in Korea, America is overproducing and markets cannot  be  found for the surpluses, but the war enables big business to -work at full capacity which it otherwise would not be able to do. I contend therefore that this matter of rising prices is much more important than any other subject that has been discussed in this chamber -since the election of -the present Government. Conditions .are  going  from bad to worse, yet not one honorable senator opposite has a constructive suggestion to offer. There has been endless talk about putting value back into the £1. So often has this meaningless phrase been repeated, that the Prime Minister has had to tell his colleagues not to make fools of themselves by continuing to make promises which they know very well cannot be fulfilled. </para>

                            <para>- To the extent that the workers increase production beyond their capacity to purchase they forge a weapon that brings about their impoverishment. When what is known as a working equilibrium is maintained, there is no poverty. In economics, physics and in cosmic affairs generally it is accepted that life in all its phases exists in equilibrium only when the workers are able to purchase all they produce. In such circumstances there would be no poverty, particularly as it is known to-day in Europe and the Eastern countries. When the Minister for Trade and Customs states that increased production would reduce prices he is either unaware of his ignorance or he is deliberately trying to misrepresent the position. When workers increase production beyond their capacity to purchase the resultant surpluses of goods are very often used against them. If working equilibrium were established and maintained, there would be very little to complain about in relation to production. Production in excess of what can be purchased by wages, salaries and pensions results in lower production costs and increased profits. Because that state of affairs, which the economists describe as disequilibrium, exists in Australia, as in every other country there is appalling poverty amidst plenty. Real prices, in terms of gold as a measure of value - and gold is still the measure .of value, although it is not in circulation - or in terms of commodities other than gold, or in labour time were never lower than they are to-day ; but in terms of depreciated, .substitute, fraudulent -or counterfeit currency they were never higher and more prohibitive. Our opponents have never had the courage to make a proper approach to this subject. They are mentally bankrupt. Legal men are abject slaves to precedents that date back to the mediaeval ages.

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. If our financial policy was based on the principle of value for value rather than on something for nothing the Government's approach to this subject would be much more intelligible than it is to-day. I may appear to be unduly critical, but I remind honorable senators that I lived through the depression of 1S93 when the banks collapsed, and that I have suffered the consequences of subsequent depressions, including the worst of all depressions in the 'thirties, and a position is developing now which, unless it is checked, may well make the depression of the 'thirties seem but a comparatively unimportant incident. A similar position has already developed in overseas countries. According to reports, not from Labour sources, but from official circles, one-third of the industrial population of Italy is now unemployed. Conditions in France and Germany are just as bad. In China, Japan and India the employment position is even worse than it is in the European countries. Before the war the United States of America, the richest and the leading credit country in the world, had 6,000,000 unemployed at a time when mountains of consumable and capital goods could not be disposed of. How can such a state of affairs be explained? A similar position existed in </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia in the 'thirties and is again developing at this very moment. What I complain most bitterly of is that members of the Government and their supporters treat this matter as if it were of no consequence. They try to explain it away by stereotyped platitudes that have been repeated <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline> ever since this Government was elected to office. The Government is running true to the form its political antecedents followed in earlier years. In the 'thirties, although we had unlimited resources and faced no problem arising from excess population, Australians were reduced to the borderline of bare necessity. Inflation has the effect of increasing prices. If prices are increased the purchasing power of wages, salaries, pensions and fixed incomes is reduced. In April this year the people were told by the Prime Minister, on the eve of his visit abroad, that price fixation was a responsibility, not of the Government, but of the people. It is a responsibility of the Government and if the Government is not prepared to accept it what do honorable senators opposite propose to do about the matter? The Prime Minister's statement was an admission either of mental bankruptcy or of callous indifference. </para>

                        referred in his second-reading speech to the referendum on rents and prices which the Chifley Government submitted to the people. At that referendum the people were told that unchecked inflation would hit hardest those on fixed incomes - the recipients of pensions and other social service payments, superannuation and insurance benefits, interest on Commonwealth bonds and other invested savings, repatriation benefits, deferred pay and the war gratuity. Almost every ex-serviceman knows that the real value of the amount he will receive in war gratuity will be reduced by, at least, two-thirds.

If I had my way all war expenditure would be met by direct taxation, so that all the gentlemen representing financial institutions who capitalize war and the sacrifices made by the returned men would have to pay the costs of war from income they received. To-day, as the result of their investments in war-time industries and in war loans, they are making millions of pounds in profits out of the suffering and sacrifices made by the soldiers in the fighting lines. They are the men who pose as great patriots and shining examples to other men. They are also the men who are telling us that our young men must fight as conscripts anywhere in the world for their convenience and their profit. Those are the realities of the situation. </para>

When I was Minister for Aircraft Production, from 1941 to 1945, the Treasury officials recovered at least £1,000,000 from contractors who were capitalizing on the war and who had debited the Government with costs that they should have debited to themselves. If we had had. the assistance of two or three additional costing experts we could have recovered a lot more money. Those persons were concerned about building up their own bank balances rather than about winning the war. </para>

I do not wish to take any credit from those honorable senators for the services they rendered during the war. All I am reflecting on is their lack of knowledge and their lack of moral courage in not standing up to their responsibility. I give the honorable senators concerned all due credit for their physical courage, but I say they are lacking very much in moral courage in merely acting as " yes " men to those who are responsible for the state of affairs to which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>I have already referred to inflation. Inflation means, in effect, the issuing of counterfeit notes in the name of the State. Suppose, for example, I issued £1,000,000 worth of £1 notes and the effect of that issue was to increase the price of commodities, as it surely would do. I should be able to purchase commodities and pay for services, but prices would rise all the time. I should be able, ultimately, to recover all the notes I had issued, plus a big profit in terms of intrinsic wealth, without it costing me one penny. That is exactly how inflation is operating at the present time. It amounts to the State issuing counterfeit notes. Because it is done by the State it is a legal transaction, but if it were done by a private individual it would be illegal and the individual responsible for it would be gaoled. When it is done in the name of the State those responsible are regarded as great statesmen and as <inline font-style="italic">men</inline> who are saving the country- </para>

                            <para>- I did not let any loose at all, because, being of Scottish ancestry and having Hebrew convictions, I would not do anything of that nature. My motto in all these matters is " value for value " or <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo.</inline> Two factors are involved in the position that we face to-day with regard to prices. The Prime Minister recently referred to them,but he did not specify them. The first factor in increased prices is the enormous capital charges which have been levied, although the expenditure has never been incurred. Those responsible are actually in the same category as counterfeiters obtaining something for nothing. I referred earlier to the capitalizing of slum houses and obsolete workshops, and the re-capitalizing of obsolete machinery. Although such expenditure has never been incurred, revenue is collected because- of the .constant increasing of prices. That sort of thing is- absolutely fraudulent. Provided it is done inside the law it is allowed, but if it is done outside the law, those responsible for it are gaoled, and rightly so. I can remember back to 1893,. when practically all the banks in Australia closed their doors. For years it had been the practice of the private banks to issue credit nine or ten times greater than their deposits. When the collapse came they closed! their doors and1 repudiated their liabilities. Some of the bankers concerned are regarded as very reputable citizens^, even in our day;. The banks- caused inflation, to. that extent then, and. they are causing inflation, to-day. One has only to examine their balance-sheets to establish: this, circumstance. In fact, the banks boast  about  the enormous profits they make by the process.. As- I have stated in. this: chamber before,, there are only two ways in which, profits can be made. One is by underpaying; the workers on- the job and the other- is: by overcharging them, across the counter off- the job.  if  honorable senators opposite can inform mc of any other way to; make -profits I shall be pleased to: hear- of it. The private banks have* been responsible' for inflation in- the past, and they are responsible for the- inflation that is talcing place at this very moment. The- policy of the Government, isi not to&gt; check inflation, but actually tr? facilitate it and to give back to. the private banks the power they had- previously. The  Government  proposes to appoint: a. bank, board to give, the banks the power they held, previously and to eii.able.them to do precisely the things that they did in the 'thirties* </para>

                    <para>The first evil of inflation is that it destroys confidence in the currency. The fact that  people  to-day are paying enormous and exorbitant prices for houses, motor cars, and other commodities indicates; if it indicates' anything at all, that they have lost confidence in the currency: That inflation increases prices is beyond contradiction. Inflation also' increases the velocity of money; causes unfavorablerates of exchange- in overseas countries, and stimulates unnecessary enterprises and fraudulent trading. Although we find those- things' in existence to-day, the Government has not attempted to do any- thing to remove them. Inflation is also the most corrupt form of indirect taxation. In time of war,, when, labour power becomes- more or less indispensable and the demand for goods exceeds the- supply, the workers are in a position to demand better terms and more consideration than they would receive otherwise-. Increases, in terms of money, are given, to them,, but are immediately cancelled out by increases of prices.. That is what I mean when I refer to indirect taxation. There are two forms of taxation. The first is taxation- levied by the Government in the ordinary way, both direct and indirect, and the second is taxation imposed by those who control or regulate prices and by private monopolies' which operate through the medium of financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies. When I say that inflation is the most corrupt form of taxation, I mean that- it is taxation imposed on people behind their backs. The workers are deceived by it. The press tells them lies, and the- whole position is misrepresented to them. Because they do not understand the position, they accept it under duress. If our  educational  system were as it should be and1 the workers were taught to base their reasoning upon inductive as well as  deductive  processes, that  could  not happen. When we have a snore intelligent working community, educated as it should-,, could, and must be ultimately, that kind of vicious, lying corruption- will be impossible. It is indulged' in by men who pose as champions of the working class and say that they are democrats. In- my judgment, I do not exaggerate in the slightest when I say that inflation of the currency is the most corrupt form of taxation. </para>
                    <para>Inflation has another effect. At. the present time there is approximately £730,000,000 deposited in Commonwealth and State savings banks. Most of that money is the savings of workers. To the degree- that the currency is!  inflated  and its- purchasing- power reduced, these savings are liquidated and the workers are deliberately robbed'. Not knowing what they  should  know about the matter, they are powerless to resist by way of argument. All that is' left to them- to- do is what they are- doing- now, that it, to- resist, as best they can but most ineffectively, by strikes and industrial hold-ups. Those are the effects, and inflation is the cause. When we can establish the relationship 'between cause and effect, we shall be able to make a much more intelligent approach towards legislating in this .country and other .countries in the way in which it should be done. </para>
                    <para>Germany, in 1923, was a notable example of inflation carried to the extreme, as it is likely to be here. Professor Wood, of the University of Melbourne, addressing a convention of primary producers in Warrnambool some  iti  on tit s ago said, and it 'has not been contradicted by other professors, by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> or anybody else, that if the present state of affairs were allowed to continue and inflation were not checked in the "way in which it should be checked, the time would come when we should have to do as' the Germans did in 1923. They had to take a bag of notes with them when they bought their  weekly stores from the grocer or the butcher. That is what Professor Wood said, but no notice has been taken of him. The collapse of the German currency ruined millions  of  small traders and 'Others, and forced the German people to adopt a system of direct barter for a  period  They bartered goods for goods, ©(cause &gt;their .currency was worthless. <inline font-style="italic">| Extension of time granted.]</inline> Money is n means of indirect .barter. Lt is a ru eel hu  1 1  of excha nge. We give money in exchange for the commodities that we need. Direct barter is the system of exchanging goods for goods. The worst feature of the inflation that occurred in Germany was that it enabled the leading German .monopolists, .assisted 'by the leading monopolists in England,  France,  America 'and either countries, to establish in that country the fascist dictatorship that was  primarily  the cause .of .the second world -war. If honorable senators opposite require verification of that, I refer them to a report published in 1938 .or 1939 by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Paul</inline> Einzen,  a leading a uthority on (currency in England. </para>

                    <para>The Government must face the task of deflating the currency. First, it must increase taxes on all big incomes or impose a capital levy. I notice that that is being advocated in Europe. There is no escape from it. Secondly, the Government must substantially reduce taxes 'on all small incomes. I say in passing .that all taxation is paid by the workers who are engaged in essential production and services. The taxes paid by the very wealthy are paid from the profits they receive as a result of the physical exertion of those engaged in essential production and services. Thirdly, the Government must reduce substantially and, where passible, abolish all indirect taxes. An indirect tax is a flat tax. The pensioner in receipt of a small pension or the worker earning a low wage pays the same amount of tax as does the wealthiest man in the community when he buys a packet of cigarettes, a pair of shoes or anything else. Under indirect taxation, the poorest pay a great deal more in proportion to what they receive than do the very rich. Indirect taxes such as sales tax and excise duties must be reduced or abolished. </para>

                            <para>- We were in power in time of war. The Attorney-General '(Senator 'Spicer) asked that question some time ago. I said to him, as I say now to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wedgwood,</inline> that the greatest obstacle that the Labour movement has had to face is the readiness with which the great majority of the workers have acquiesced in their own subjection, owing to their unfortunate ignorance and the way in which they have been deceived and betrayed all their lives. If they had not acquiesced, the present position would be vastly different from what it is. If they had not acquiesced to the degree that they have done, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Wedgwood</inline> would not be here, because they would have made a more intelligent choice. That remark applies to other honorable senators opposite also. When a country is in the throes of war, the major task of the government is to win the war. If the members of the anti-Labour parties had been more capable and conscientious than they were, and if they had been possessed of some knowledge and initiative, the Labour party would never have been able to form the Government of this country in 1941. Because the anti-Labour forces were unable to face the situation that existed then, we assumed the responsibilities of government, although we had a minority in both Houses of the Parliament. Our opponents were unable to agree amongst themselves, because they were divided amongst themselves. The present Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> who was then Minister for the Army, said that at that time one division of enemy troops could have taken possession of Australia. That shows their lack of ability, knowledge and capacity for organization. We reversed that position. We did such a good job that, when experts from America and England visited this country, they were amazed that we had been able to do so much to increase aircraft production and organize our war effort in such a short space of time. The members of the anti-Labour Government that was in power in 1941 were tragic failures. Had it been left to them, Australia would have become a Japanese colony. </para>

                    <para>The fourth step that the Government must take to combat inflation is to institute a system of government control of price-fixing in place of private control. As I have explained previously, we cannot escape controls. All the talk that is indulged in about being free to do this and that is so much eye-wash. In the field of  positive  science there is no such thing as freedom, because everything is conditioned. We refer to the freedom of a country in terms of relativity, that is, that an individual in a certain country is relatively free compared with an individual in another country. Only people who are ignorant of this subject speak of absolute freedom. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that subject in a moment. At present I am endeavouring to show that some honorable senators opposite are inverted Communists, as some so-called democrats are inverted dictators. In the matter of prices, however, the choice that confronts us is to repose control either in the Government or in private monopolies. I recollect that during the period between 1945 and 1949 that I was Postmaster-General, many firms that were supplying goods to and performing services for the Postal Department, increased their charges by as much as 400 per cent. The department had no redress against this unwarranted increase of costs and the deficit had to be made good either by increasing postal charges, or by appropriations from Consolidated Revenue. In a number of instances it was reported to me that the supply of materials had been deliberately withheld pending an increase of prices. </para>

He is now in the invidious position of having to again increase postal charges or incur a substantial loss during this financial year. In effect, people who contend that prices should not be controlled are saying that suppliers of goods should be a law unto themselves and that they should be permitted to continue the corrupt process of dictating to the government of the day. </para>

                    <para>The fifth expedient that I recommend is that subsidies should be paid in relation to essential commodities such as food, clothing and shelter. Particularly in connexion with housing, the Government must be prepared to pay subsidies. It will be remembered that the previous Government paid a number of subsidies in order to keep prices at reasonable levels. The money to provide subsidies should be obtained by taxing profits; that is, by means of a capital levy. I refer to taxing exorbitant profits which are really the proceeds of the robbery of the people. Honorable senators opposite may laugh. However, I remind them that it is no new experience for me to be amongst a flock of clowns, illiterate literates, and ignoramuses. Taxation constitutes the very machinery and basis of government. If I were in office now and were able to exercise full power in relation to taxes, I would not worry about holding referendums or other expedients in relation t,o controls. Big incomes which have been made possible because of inflation and the charging of unwarranted exorbitant prices should be taxed heavily. Reference has been made by some honorable senators opposite to the quantity of " hot " money that is at present in this country. That money is an accumulation of the moneys of which the working people in both the United States of America and this country have been robbed, amounting to the difference between the wages that they have received and the value of their surplus produce. The persons who possess that money are attempting to capitalize their position in Australia,  They  hope to make profits amounting to millions of pounds if the Australian currency is appreciated. However, the Government has assured us that our currency will not be revalued for the time being. Unless the Government considers every aspect of this matter carefully a position much worse than the present state of affairs may develop in this country. </para>

                            <para>- In Russia, between1848 and 1917, the terms communism and socialism were synonymous. After 1917,. when the Bolsheviks seized power in that country, they discovered, as any intelligent person would have discovered, that in an economically backward country, with a population ofabout 160,000,000 people, for the most part illiterate, it was physically impossible to translate the theory of communism into action as it was originally conceived in 1848. They established the system of society which exists to-day, and which we properly describe as State capitalism.. It is not communism at all,and it may be much more ruthless in its effect than any system operating elsewhere. The word " communism " was coined in1848 in order to draw a distinction between the socialism of Robert Owen, known as Utopian socialism, and the scientific socialism of Marx and Engels. A great many people are either slaves to shibboleths or prisoners of phrases. AM too of ten, phrases are used, not to convey the truth to the people, but. to deceive them. Honorable senators opposite are what may be described as socialists in reverse. If they were impoverished Germans or Poles or Hungarians,andcould obtain no redress by approaching the authorities, they would become creatures of violent and bitter prejudices. They are, however, ina f avoured position. They have never known want, and have never been exploited.

It is useless to appeal to their pride,, because they are guilty men and are- on the defensive.

                    <para>I return again to the Prime Minister's recent, statement announcing the reintroduction of certain economic controls', The right' honorable gentleman said that, control? of excess profits would be necessary. In- 1947i the- Liberal party was proclaiming its opposition to government controls of all kinds, but now, in an endeavour to cover up its past sins, it is prepared to concede openly that certain controls are necessary. It is most interesting to note the present manoeuvre to have a certain proportion of the Australian wool clip withdrawn from the open market, but sold at the price obtained subsequently on the open market. Obviously, if some of our best wools are withdrawn from auction leaving only the inferior qualities to be sold on the open market, auction prices will be depressed. That of course is only a back door method of imposing a wool tax. In spite of the proclaimed opposition of honorable senators opposite to prices control in 1947, the Government is seeking to re-introduce prices control by methods of doubtful constitutional validity. On the other hand, no support whatever is forthcoming from honorable senators opposite for this measure. Most economists, and every one who lias the welfare of this country at  heart  will concede that control of prices i-&lt; basic to any plan to check inflation. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> has pointed out, we already have prices control in the form of wages control through the arbitration courts. Every few months wages are varied in accordance with cost of living increases. The result is that wages are continually chasing prices, but never catching up to them. Where this process will stop, no one can say, but this measure i;- the first direct attempt by the Commonwealth Parliament - the Government has shirked its responsibility and left the task to the Opposition - to deal with the problem of inflation. We on this side of the chamber have some sense of responsibility ' to the ordinary people of this country. That is why we have introduced this measure as the basis of an attempt to check  rising prices. Unless prices are controlled, there is no possibility of stopping the inflationary spiral. </para>

                    <para>Thank you for the os. a week child endowment. The butchers and stock-growers have got the lot. </para>
                    <para class="block">The average family gained nothing from the child endowment legislation because, with prices spiralling, it was quickly absorbed in increased charges. This bill merely seeks the inclusion in the Constitution of a latent power to be used in a time of emergency such as the present. There is no reason why such a power should not have been written into the Constitution at the 1947 referendum. It would not necessarily have been as wide as the war-time power and, in certain circumstances, commodities in adequate supply could have been released from prices control. It is not in the best interests of democracy that a referendum on prices control, with all the political squabbling associated with such a proposal, should be held in a time of crisis. As honorable senators opposite have pointed out, some months will have to elapse before a referendum is held even if this bill is agreed to immediately, but that must happen with any referendum. What we have to decide is whether prices control is necessary or desirable as the basis of any plan to check inflation. It is obvious to every one that, unless the Government takes steps to curb rising prices, the situation will very soon be much graver than it is to-day. Day by day we read reports of fantastic inflationary prices. Recently the <inline font-style="italic">Can- berra Times</inline> reported that onions were selling at1s. 3d. each and cauliflowers at 6s. each ; yet honorable senators opposite complacently treat this" problem as if it had no. urgency at all ! They realize, of course, that the Government should have initiated action to control prices, but is too interested in playing politics to do so. It is too interested in introducing legislation to appoint "stooges" to the Commonwealth Bank in spite of the fact that that institution has never worked more efficiently than it has under its present governorship. The Government has raised one of the greatest bogies of all times in an effort to avert public attention from rising prices. I remind the Senate that foremost amongst the election undertakings of the Government parties was the promise to put value back info the £1. The Government has not even attempted to do that, yet its supporters in this chamber are sitting back criticizing the introduction by the Opposition of a measure which would accomplish the very things that the Government has failed to do. </para>

                        referred to the increase of postal, telephone and telegraph charges. Increased charges were made necessary by the increased cost of equipment and salaries and wages incurred by the Postal Department. The employees of the department were granted wage increases to enable them to maintain their standard of living despite rising prices.

                            <para>- I regret that my train of thought has been diverted by the interjections of honorable senators opposite. The inflationary spiral is world wide and the problems that confront all countries as the result of it are interconnected. A great responsibility rests upon us to guard our economy. It is regrettable that our efforts to establish in this country a democracy that is unrivalled by that of any other country in the world should be undermined by a vicious system of inflation. Unless we take positive steps to check this evil, unemployment will stalk this land and production of the basic food and clothing requirements of our people will decline. The decline of our living standards will cause increased discontent and all the talk of the Communists being the cause of unrest in this country will be as nothing compared with the anger of the people when they realize that the standards for which they have fought for more than 100 years have been lost as the result of the refusal of the Government to accept its responsibilities. </para>

                            <para>- I blame the Conservatives for much more than that. Some responsibility for the increased costs of all commodities undoubtedly rests on this Government. Let it see the folly of its ways. I invite honorable senators opposite to support us in this move to give to the people of Australia an opportunity to shape their destiny in a democratic way. The people have learned a bitter lesson from the inaction of this Government. The bad advice that was given to the people by the anti-Labour forces during the earlier referendum on rents and prices is now apparent. If honorable senators are sincere in their claim that they have the welfare of the ordinary wage-earner at heart they will not only support this measure but also take an active part in the referendum campaign that we hope will result from it. The measure itself is a simple one. It provides for the alteration of the Constitution by the addition of only one word. The bogies that were trotted out by the anti-Labour forces during the 1947 referendum campaign about red tape and form filling will not be apt in this instance. On this occasion the people will be asked to decide only whether or not the Commonwealth Parliament should have power to control pricesin periods of inflation. I commend the measure to the Senate. </para>

                        has stated that those people who make mistakes will not be allowed to speak again. He has said, " I am the dictator of this party ". Time and again, Ministers in this chamber have refused to answer questions, stating that matters of policy were involved, and that the facts would probably be made known in the budget. Last week on two occasions the Prime Minister broadcast the contents of the budget. But he has never allowed his little " puppies ", his little " stooges ", his little " poodles ", in this chamber, to whom we should be able to look as responsible Ministers of the Crown, an opportunity to answer one reasonable and sensible question. As mentioned by an honorable senator on this side of the chamber, he has given his friends, who made it possible for him to return to office, a preview of what the budget contains.

                        <para>- There is only one way to put anything to the honorable senator, and that is with a brace and bit. We all have a vivid recollection of what happened to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hugh</inline> Dalton in England, when he committed half -a crime a few hours before the budget was to be presented. He was asked to resign. I wonder if any of the Ministers opposite, who no doubt assisted in compiling the budget, would be prepared to ask the Prime Minister to resign. I stated a long time ago that although the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> was in  a  minority in the Cabinet, when the matter of depreciation of the <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> was to 'be decided, I would put my money on him, and I have won. It was a .great victory for the leader of the minority party in the Cabinet. It may be that the members of the Australian Country party in Canberra -are lining up with their more learned Country party friends in Victoria. They may even <inline font-style="italic">come</inline> round to our way of thinking. We shall look forward to an application to the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> for an import licence. </para>

                            <para>- The Opposition would first like to make the members of the Government realize the importance of this measure, so that it may be given the speedy passage it deserves. If there is anything likely to corrupt and disrupt the economy of this country, it is prices. Communism is the baby of inflation and deflation. If the Government is sincere in its desire to rid this country of the Communist element that exists to-day, it must give some measure of economic security to the people of Australia. Because of the insidious and false propaganda retailed to the people in 1948, the referendum to control prices was defeated. The people were told that remote control from Canberra would be the cause of inflation and that prices control should be left to the State governments, because they, being in closer contact with the people, could do a better joh. That propaganda was supported by all the antiLabour Premiers in the Commonwealth, and by all reactionary upper houses. It was supported by all the Liberal party and Australian Country party members. The people were advised to hand hack control of prices to the States. When the Premiers met in Canberra, three or four weeks ago, they went down almost on their bended knees trying to influence the Australian 'Government once again to take over control of prices. Included in those Premiers and Treasurers were men who misled the people, together with the press and the radio, by stating that the States should control prices. </para>

                    <para>I asked a question to-day in this chamber with reference to a gallup poll, the result of which was published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 5th instant. The article stated, " Federal price control wanted. Six out of ten people think that the Federal Government should again control prices, at least temporarily ". The Australian Government, of course, has not power in peace-time to control prices. That is a very cardinal point in our Constitution. Those interviewed were asked : " Do you think full war-time price control by the Federal Government should or should not be brought in again now ? " In every State a majority stated they wanted full prices control by the Australian Government. The Australia-wide vote was 57 per cent, in favour of Commonwealth control of prices, 35 per cent, opposed to such control, and S per cent, undecided. The article was published after it was decided that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> should introduce the bill now before this chamber. </para>
                    <para>Of all aspects of politics agitating the minds of the people, the most important matter to-day is prices control. The people are realizing now that if the Government is sincere in its desire to rid this country of the Communist element, it should re-introduce prices control, in order to stabilize production and prices. </para>

The Opposition is trying to drill into the wooden heads of those people who have become the puppets of the. prospective dictator of this country that at least they owe something to the people of Australia. They should endeavour, even at this late hour, to impress that obligation on other members of their parties. The Opposition is sure that the bill will pass through this chamber, but Government senators should take some active part in seeing that it is given the same priority as is accorded other measures in the House of Representatives and carried under the " guillotine ". </para>

                    <para>Had I not listened to the Prime Minister I may perhaps have . been a little doubtful as to the attitude of some honorable senators opposite. But the right honorable gentleman, in his broadcast, has told the people of Australia that we must have prices control and subsidies.  His  words have been supported by those of the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> who has also issued' press statements, and made broadcasts to the effect that the most urgent problem confronting the people to-day is inflation. In this instance, the Opposition wholeheartedly agrees with the Prime Minister and the Minister for National Development. We consider that this is a very urgent measure and should be given a swift passage through both Houses. </para>

We do not want a photo or the judge to decide the result; we want the Government to allow the people to decide who shall be the winner of that political  Tace.

                    <para>I realize that the Prime Minister has no fight in him. He proved that in 1914. He was a very energetic and excellent captain in the University Rifles until war broke out and spoiled his military career. 1 realize that he is not here to fight, but I realize also that, despite his poor fighting ability, he is able to silence honorable senators opposite. When I see the crocodile tears that they shed when we submit a reasonable and sensible measure <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> this chamber, I think of the measures that are being discussed in the House of Representatives under the dictatorial " guillotine " applied by the Government. I remind the Senate that the Labour party represents 49 per cent, of the people of this country. </para>

                                does not believe figures. He does not believe anything. In fact, he does not believe himself. The party on whose behalf I am speaking to-night represents 49 per cent, of the people of this country. Therefore, it is competent for us to bring before this chamber a measure which is designed to give the Australian people an opportunity to say whether they think that the Commonwealth should again control prices. Why are honorable senators opposite afraid to give the people that opportunity? The people have asked for it through the capitalist press - the only channel through which they can ask. Why do not honorable senators opposite state the reasons why they are not prepared to give the electors, the only people who should be considered in these matters, an opportunity to express their opinion on this issue?

                    <para>If we are to rid this country of communism, we must give the Australian workers a fair and reasonable share of the goods and services they produce. Despite all the talk of the Prime Minister and Government supporters, who have never known what it is to take their coats off to earn a shilling, the workers are not prepared to allow themselves to be misled again or to permit a return to the conditions that obtained in this country after the last inflationary /period. When I hear honorable senators opposite urging the workers to produce more and saying that the 40-hour week has created chaos and caused the present prices spiral, I recall that during the depression years the majority of the workers of this country worked for only twenty hours a week and that 500,000 Australians did not have a job at all. In those days, according to the people who ran this country then, we had full arid plenty. We must be fair to the sons and daughters of those who endured the privation and starvation that existed then in this wonderful country. Their sons and daughters made a magnificent effort in World War II., one that * was without parallel in any other country. This Government will not be able to fool the workers again. The people will never again permit a state of affairs in which they cannot earn enough money to buy the goods that they produce. If honorable senators opposite are. well advised, they will support the Opposition and vote with us. when the motion for the second reading of this measure is put. </para>
                    <para>The Australian workers are asked to support the arbitration system, in which the Australian Labour party believes wholeheartedly. If honorable senatorsopposite believe that workers wages should be determined by arbitration, they must believe that the prices of the commodities that the workers purchase should also be determined by arbitration. I can- not say this evening whether the pricefixing authority should be. a commission or a prices court, similar to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but I say that, if honorable senators opposite are sincerewhen they urge the workers of this country to support arbitration, they should agree to the establishment of some tribunal or organization to fix prices. </para>
                    <para>The claim by tie trade unions for an increase of the basic wage has been before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court since May, 1949. The judges of the court, according to their own statements, have been overworked in considering the casespresented by the trade unions and the employers. It has taken them eighteen months to make their inquiries, and I believe that theywill announce their decision on Thursday. When the plaint of the trade unions was presented to the court, the cost of living was, according to the index figures, at a certain level. Evidence was given on that basis, but every one will admit that during the last eighteen months the cost of living has increased enormously. The judgment of the court will be delivered eighteen months after the workers presented their plaint. </para>

                            <para>- There have been slight adjustments of the basic wage during that period. I think it has been increased by 7s. a week. The decision of the court will not apply retrospectively. If there is no system of prices control, immediately it is announced those who provide the workers with the necessities of life will say that there has been an increase of the basic wage and, without going before any tribunal, will decide that the cost of bread, butter, meat, eggs, flour, potatoes, onions and other foods of the people should be increased automatically. Let us assume that, as. a result of. tie judgment of the court, the wage of a breadcarter is increased by 10s. a week. Let us assume also that he delivers 300 loaves of bread a day and that the baker increases theprice of a loaf of bread by1/2d. On 300 loaves a day, his takings will be increased by approximately 12s. a day.From one breadcarter working five days a week, he will make an additional £2 10s. a week. The Prime Minister and members of the Government parties are asking the workers of this country for greater production. I do not agree that the workers are not producing to capacity, but, I shall assume for the purposes of argument that they are not If we want greater production,, we must give the workers, swiftly, a better share of the goods that they produce. If we do not and if the workers' wages are not sufficient to provide them with a decent existence, communism will breed. </para>

                            <para>- Of course I concede that the farmers received only very poor prices for their produce at that time. I recollect that many tons of potatoes and onions; were dumped in the ocean off Port Fairy in Victoria, because prices were so low. At that time many people were starving. Because of the extremely low prices that were being received for primary products,, many farmers were forced to mortgage their properties to the banks. That is particularly true- in both the Mallee and western districts of Victoria. Even to-day, despite the high prices that are being obtained for primary produce, many farmers are unwilling to pay award wages in the various industries.

Wool prices have increased by more than 600 per cent, since 1938. Even if we regard 6s. Sd. per lb. as an average price for wool to-day, the increase since 1940 has been over 600 per. cent. </para>

                            <para>- That is entirely irrelevant. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator George</inline> Rankin has asked his question by interjection because he knows that I have an interest in the fruit juice industry. I remind the honorable senator that in these days it is a matter of dog eat dog. It is impossible- for one swallow to make a summer and for one person to maintain prices at a reasonable level. As the honorable senator is aware, he has made another incorrect implication about me, and presumably he will make others from time to time. If the wool producers are so kind they should pay the shearers 600 per cent, more than the 1940 wages. </para>

It was introduced by a non-Labour government in an endeavour to maintain harmony in this country, particularly in view of the fact that the wives, sons and daughters of men who were serving in the Second Australian Imperial Force were working in munitions factories. The framers of the Constitution were farsighted men, who realized that in time of war the Commonwealth should have full control over the Army and all matters associated with defence. We realized fully in 1948 <inline font-style="italic">that,</inline> if prices were to be controlled satisfactorily in this country, it was necessary to maintain unity in Australia- </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> should deliver an address to this chamber rather than continually interrupt other honorable senators. We could scarcely have a worse crisis in this country than inflation, and I contend that the people should not be persuaded to refrain from granting the Commonwealth power to control prices during the transitory period through which we are passing. In fact the Prime Minister has stated that we are supposed to be at war, and has told the people that he lied to them in 1948. He is again seeking to control Australia from Canberra, and that is why he is " softening " the people. Of course, the people have a right to elect their representatives to this democratic Parliament every three years, and it was unfortunatethat prior to the last general election they were misled by the insidious and untrue propaganda that was disseminated by the supporters of the present Government, He is now asking the people to give him and his supporters another chance. I want my view on this subject to be placed on record. Unless prices arecontrolled in this country it will not matter what legislation is placed on the statute-book for, finally, we shall finish up on the rocks of poverty, as has every other dictatorship in the world. I should like to know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> has ever had anything to do with communism - whether he has ever tried toput up a battle with the Communists in this country.I remind him that many farmers in the Kerang district where he lives, were doing very well until thedepression forced them to turn " Commo ". Could that be wondered at ? I know many farmers who had worked hard regularly from daylight to dark, but who lost their farms overnight during the depression. In many instances also, good Australian workmen, who were supporting wives and children, found themselves on the employment scrap-heap. </para>
