Will the Minister investigate the possibility of assisting Western Australia in this matter? </para>

                        <para>- I have received representations upon this matter from the Western Australian Government. For some time, the officers of my department have been investigating the position. I am doing all that I can to speed up shipping services to Western Australia, but, having regard to the attitude of the Seamen's Union and some waterside workers, I have not been able to secure the regular service that is desired. I assure the Senate that my department is doing all that it can do to improve shipping services to Western Australia. </para>

However, on the information so far available, the rate of infantile mortality is reported as being up to 500 per 1,000  births  in some villages, but so far as can be estimated the average figure overall would probably be somewhat in excess of 250 per 1,000.

  <para>Medical services to natives are provided by the Administration of the Territory free of charge except  in  the case of indentured labourers where it is the responsibility of the employer to provide medical attention. Expenditure on these medical services amounted to £4S9,000 for the financial year 1948-1940 and they are being expanded as staff becomes available. Medical patrols carried out during that year inspected 30,000 more natives than in the preceding year. The appointment of 36 additional medical officers who took up duty in the Territory recently will allow a further expansion both in the general medical services and in patrol activities. </para>

Recently, announcements were made regarding the protection that is to be given to our textile industry, in accordance with recommendations of the Tariff Board. The Commonwealth does not, as a rule, go out into the highways and byways in matters such as these. We have a very efficient and reliable Tariff Board. Any Australian industry that considers that it is being adversely affected by the absence of an adequate protective tariff may make an application for a hearing by the board. Applications for hearings made by a responsible organization are invariably granted. </para>

                        <para>- It is evident that the honorable senator has a complete misconception of the functions of government. If any industry is experiencing great hardships through something beyond its control the Government would very sympathetically consider any representations of responsible men engaged in that industry. </para>

In addition, great publicity will undoubtedly be given in the press to the declaration of any organization under the bill. It is obvious, therefore, that once an organization has been " declared " the fact will be made known far and wide. How can the Attorney-General suggest, therefore, that a banker who pays a cheque drawn by an unlawful organization on hie bank will not be guilty of negligence? Why should not similar protection be extended to any individual who may be holding money in trust for an organization or may he the depository of securities for an organization?

                        <para>- It might arise. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that, having regard to the publicity, it is unlikely to arise, tout the honorable senator will realize that this is a common form of expression in provisions of this type. This clause provides protection only if the payment is in fact madewithout negligence. </para>

                <para>On <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> second point, I suggest that such provisions are normally inserted for the protection of bankers because of the peculiar nature of banking business, the responsibilities thatbankers owe to their clients, and the difficulties in which bankers might find themselves in the absence of such protection. There seems to me to be no necessity to cover other people because they do not carry on business in the same way as bankers do. I am not aware of provisions of this kind being given a wider application than they are given in this clause. </para>

                        <para>- No case can be put. This is a somewhat extreme protection for a banker. Everybody else in the community is bound from the minute of the dissolution. It becomes operative at a date which, I agree, it is not easy for everybody in the community to determine, but I can conceive of a situation in which a trustee of property, quite apart from a banker, might, without personal negligence, be in exactly the same position. He might have been out of Australia for a period prior to the operation of this legislation, and he might have been given some kind of post-dated document. I am not opposing the clause. It is reasonable in essence. I am merely seeking information. I am suggesting that the Government could give consideration to extending to other elements in the community the very wide protection that is afforded to bankers under this clause. </para>

                        <para>. - The Opposition does not propose to amend this clause. I rise merely to draw attention to the virtue of a full discussion of a measure of this kind. The clause as originally introduced into the Parliament left to any peace officer, or any person authorized by the Attorney-General, the right, on suspicion - and it was not defined as a reasonable suspicion - to enter any place at any hour if he thought that in that place there were papers, documents or property relating to an unlawful organization. Due to the trenchant criticism levelled against that provision by the Labour party in the House of Representatives, and to the pressure that was applied, the Government abdicated its original stand. There have been allegations of delay in dealing with this hill. Whatever basis there may be for that statement, it is certainly not true of this chamber. The amendment that was made to this clause in the House of Representatives was, with the alteration of only two minor words, that submitted by the right honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt).</inline> That amendment demonstrated the need for the fullest discussion of this legislation. Its acceptance was a tribute, both to the viewpoint of the Labour party, and to the draftsmanship of the right honorable member for Barton. It is desirable, I claim, that a bill of such importance, and having the far-reaching effects of this measure, should be fully and amply discussed. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Opposition does not oppose the amendment, but I wish to add one  thing to what the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> has said. Without this clause many of the matters that are specified throughout clause  24  would not be admissible in evidence in a court. In concurring with clause  24  and the proposed amendments thereto, the Opposition is allowing to be treated as admissible evidence, facts, acts and writings which, in the normal course of procedure, would not be admissible at all. I draw particular attention to that phase to illustrate that the Opposition is co-operating very fully with the Government in facilitating approval of the matters that it will be sought to prove. The mere fact that the Opposition is acting in that way is the clearest indication of its desire to enable this measure to work. Throughout the debate, the Opposition has expressed on this subject a complete community of interest with the Government in the broad objectives of the bill. I have pointed out repeatedly that the differences between the Government and the Opposition relate only to methods. On behalf of the Opposition, I point out that in our acceptance of this clause and amendments and the further amendments that the Attorney-General has foreshadowed is the clearest evidence of the Opposition's willingness to facilitate the Government's purpose. That is in flat contradiction of things that have been said by members on the Government side throughout this debate. </para>

                <para class="block">The relevant discussion in regard to the onus of proof might also be applied to this clause. It has been pointed out that trial by jury is one of the ordinary processes of law that has grown up over the centuries in British countries. It is safeguarded under section SO of the Constitution, where it states that trial by indictment must be byjury. Inthiscasethe Opposition does not say that in every instance there should be a. jury, but it believes that where the declared person elects to be tried by jury, it is not right that the Executive Government of the country should deny it. The allegation against an individual or an organization in the second count that the individual or organization is prejudicial to security is in effect, a charge of treason and that, in itself, is an indictable offence. Therefore the Government might by-pass in spirit the provision that is made in the Constitution under the ordinary processes of law. Treason is a crime as serious as any in the whole calendar of crimes. No person or no organization could be charged with anything more serious. Therefore, any person declared under this measure should have the right of trial by jury. Last night, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> speaking in the Town Hall in Sydney, discussed these matters, and it is strange that he should have used exactly the same language as has been used by honorable senators opposite. For instance, he spoke of " King's Ministers ". </para>

I do not think that they carry out their duties any better than we did when we were in office, and we did not call ourselves King's Ministers. The Prime Minister said that this bill was designed to remove certain persons from certain kinds of employment and was not a bill dealing with crime. Evidently, the Government thinks it a very light thing to brand a man as a traitor to his country, and to take away his livelihood. Particularly in a country town', it would be a very serious matter to declare a person or an organization. A declared person would have to leave the locality, so as to escape the stigma placed upon him. He would have to go somewhere else in an effort to obtain employment. The Prime Minister said that the Labour party had already accepted the Government's proposal to ban the Communist party, and to remove Communists from office in trade unions, and from employment in the Public Service.

                <para class="block">Government supporters. So great has been public criticism of the bill since it was first introduced, that the Government is trying to get out from under. At his meeting in Sydney, the Prime Minister denied those who were opposed to him the right to reply. He accused the Labour party of unduly delaying the passage of this bill through the Parliament. There has been no undue delay, and only sufficient time has been taken to examine properly the 50 amendments to the bill that have been submitted since its introduction. The right honorable gentleman said that it was nonsense to suggest that Communists could be got at in the ordinary way. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> has been saying the same thing. The Prime Minister said that the Government could not get at Communists in the same way " as you would with a man who has committed an offence against the Dog Act or the Motor Traffic Act ". I ask honorable senators to note how lightly he treated the whole matter. He suggests that declaring a person to be a Communist, and a. traitor to his country, is merely something incidental like charging him with having broken a motor traffic regulation. The Prime Minister said that a committee of five persons would be appointed to screen those about to be declared, and he added that such a system appeared to be fair. We know, of course, that the committee would nave before it only the evidence provided by the security service, with whatever slant the members of that service like to put on it. The persons charged would be practically found guilty before the screening took place. Then the Prime Minister added - </para>

                    <para>. - The general attitude of the Opposition towards this measure is disclosed by the amendment now before us. It will be readily admitted that, if the amendment is agreed to, the whole character of the legislation as an instrument of defence in the hands of the Government will be destroyed. Every lawfully constituted authority has naturally the right to make such rules and regulations as it considers necessary for its own safety and preservation. Mention has been made of the Australian Labour party. I am not complaining of what it does, and I merely mention it as an example to show that, when it comes to a question of its own preservation, the Australian Labour party does not always believe that it is desirable to charge persons whom it disciplines. Recently there was the spectacle in New South Wales of four sitting Labour members of the State Parliament -  - </para>

                        <para>- The point J am making is that they were not charged at all. Their means of livelihood was taken away from them, but they were not charged with any offence. The New South Wales executive of the Australian Labour party, sitting in secret, without preferring any charge, and in the absence of the men concerned, who had no right of appeal, declared them to be ineligible to receive the official endorsement of the Australian Labour party. By what authority and tortuous method of reasoning does the Australian Labour party place its own safety ahead of the safety of our country ? We want to put into the hands of the Government a weapon, not of aggression, but of defence. It is clear that the people against whom this measure is directed are the " red " wreckers of this country - our enemies. They are the people that the Labour party had in mind when, at a conference in Melbourne last April, it carried a resolution stating that it should be compulsory for all State and Federal Labour parliamentarians to become members of an industrial group and take an active part in its work - its work against communism. The official attitude of the Labour party has been made perfectly clear. It is out to fight communism. But that is not necessarily the attitude of many members of the party. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morrow</inline> said that this measure stinks in the nostrils of all decent-minded persons.

There will he no charges of that kind made under this bill. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has pointed out, there cannot be a trial unless an offence has been charged. All that we want to do is to deal with people whose activities are as well known to the members of the Labour party as they are to us and the people of Australia generally.

When the Attorney-General asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> whether the Chifley Government gave the members of the Stevedoring Industry Commission a trial, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> said that when it was found that they were sabotaging the work of the commission, flouting its orders and behaving in a manner that the Chifley Government considered to be very undesirable, that Government, having come to the conclusion that they should not be allowed to continue to serve as members of the commission, thereupon removed them from office. Its action was quite proper, and I am not cavilling at it. But why should honorable senators opposite be inconsistent? If that action were taken against some men holding office under the Crown, why, in the name of al) that is sane and reasonable, should the Opposition want to tie the hands of the Government in this matter? Why not allow the Government to deal with the persons against whom the bill is aimed, not by sending them .to gaol, or charging them with offences, but by removing them from their positions and thus preventing them from continuing their nefarious work which is doing incalculable and irreparable harm to the safety and security of this country? If, afterwards, we find that there have been overt acts of treason, the Government can prosecute the persons who have committed those acts. Fu ehs was prosecuted in England and. sentenced to fourteen years' imprisonment, but the damage had been done. We want to prevent that from happening in this country. We shall certainly prosecute people who have been guilty of subversive activities, if the occasion arises, but we want to prevent plans for sabotage and sedition from being put into effect. </para>

The attitude of the Opposition to the measure in general will be judged by its attitude to this amendment. If it presses .the amendment and secures its acceptance, it  will have destroyed the efficacy of the measure. Since the 27th April the Government has shown that it is prepared to take the Opposition and the people fully into its confidence. We have no cards up our sleeves.  We want to prevent " red " communistic sabotage, treason and treachery. We want the assistance of the Opposition to fashion a weapon of defence against communism. We have accepted  ni  any amendments since the 27th ApriL We have been conscious of the reactions of the Opposition and have listened to the suggestions that it has made. We have heeded public opinion. From the country's point of view, it is important, not only that justice shall be done, but a lso that it shall appear to be done. This measure is not aimed at innocent members of the community. It is aimed only at wreckers and those who want to destroy our Constitution and our way of life. The Government lias accepted all reasonable amendments. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> knows, it has incorporated in the bill many matters that in the ordinary course of events would be dealt with administratively. We have done that in order to make assurance doubly sure and to convince the people that our only purpose is to protect our Constitution from those "ho want to destroy it. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> is trying to mislead, not only the committee but also the people of Australia. He raised a political issue to bolster up a legal argument. There is no analogy between the cases of the politicians to whom be referred and the cases of people who will be declared under this hill. Can any reasonable comparison be made between the refusal of a political organization to endorse some of its members as candidates for election to a State Parliament and a charge of treason? The Minister's argument was absurd. With regard to political endorsement, I should like the Minister to tell me why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll,</inline> a returned serviceman, was refused endorsement by the Liberal party in Queensland after twenty years honorable service in the Senate. If the Minister will give me that information I shall roll him why four candidates were denied endorsement bv the Australian Labour party in New South Wales. Reference has been made to what happened in connexion with the Stevedoring Industry Commission. I point out that I warned the members of that body who have been mentioned that if they took certain action the commission would be dissolved and their positions would be declared vacant. Their dismissal is not analogous to the position that is facing us to-day. All we ask is that a declared person should have the right to elect to be tried by a jury. That right is not denied to the greatest criminal or a person charged with the gravest crime in the calendar. Yet the Government contends that a person that it declares should not have the right to elect to be tried by a jury of twelve persons. That is tantamount to setting up a police state. As I remarked a few moments ago, when this matter was discussed by the Prime Minister at a meeting in Sydney Town Hall last night he stated that it would be lunacy for trial by jury to be included in the provisions of the bill. In effect, the right honorable gentleman said ' that by selecting twelve people at random to constitute a jury an accused would be tried by twelve lunatics. I would rather have such a jury try me than the five people proposed by the Government. The Opposition is going to enforce acceptance of the amendment in order to preserve the principles of justice that have been enjoyed for many years in this country. </para>

                    <para>. - The mere fact that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> has stated that the proposed amendment would destroy the bill does not make that a fact. Honorable senators opposite have repeatedly stated that the acceptance of amendments moved by the Opposition would, in effect, kill the bill. However, I remind the Senate that the Government has already accepted about 50 amendments. </para>

                        <para>- I point out., however, that those amendments were only moved by the Government after they had been proposed by Labour through the press of this country. The history of this matter is that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> introduced the bill in the House of Representatives, although the Attorney-General had previously had a lot to say about it. I remember seeing his photograph in a newspaper alongside a report of a statement that he had made about the proposed measure. In that same newspaper article, it was reported that the Prime Minister had stated that the Government would not accept any amendments. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for Trade and Customs now contends that acceptance of the proposed new  clause  would destroy the whole purpose nf the bill. How in the wide world could (hat be so after all the machination? that have occurred during the debate on this measure? The existing practice in this country is that when an accused appears before a court he has the right to elect whether he shall be tried by a judge or a jury. If this very serious charge were preferred against me I should elect to be tried by a judge. At least I would have the law on my side, rather than have to contend with the hysteria and emotions of laymen. In time of war I would always elect to be tried by a judge, in order to secure the cool-headed approach of a lawyer to the charge. The Opposition would like to conclude the debate on this measure in a nice atmosphere. We on this side of the chamber are rather fortunate to have the guidance of only one lawyer, whereas on the Government side of the chamber three lawyers are proffering advice. </para>

                <para>It has been claimed time and again that there is no charge involved in this matter. Surely it is obvious to any reasonable person that a very serious charge will be involved. The fact of calling a person a Communist is in itself a very serious charge in the community to-day. The second count, that a person's continued existence in the community is likely to prejudice the security of the country is the second leg of that very serious charge. It is not sufficient to say that there would he no loss of rights, such as by imprisonment or a sentence of death in certain cases of treason. As the Opposition has pointed out many times, a very serious and continuing penalty will attach to a person declared. The other day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> described the position as similar to a public service trial. I point out that usually a State public servant charged with a misdemeanour is tried by a judge. If found guilty he may be merely fined £5, or forgo a £12 increment. In this instance, however, a person will be removed from his employment in the public service or as a trade union official when declared. He will not again be able to hold such an appointment. A man's reputation would be permanently damaged by his being declared. In the first place the measure bans the Australian Communist party and makes provision for dealing with its property. The Opposition has not opposed that part of the hill. Moreover, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has already pointed out, the Opposition has agreed to the strengthening of clause 24 in the way that the </para>
                <para class="block">Government  desires. In fact, although the Attorney-General moved a number of amendments to the clause to tighten it up, the Opposition did not raise its voice against them. Yet, in effect, the Attorney-General has now implied that the Opposition seeks to protect the Communists :by insisting that they shall hp. entitled to trial by jury. There exists in our community to-day a body of people known as the Australian Communist party, which is deliberately trying to wreck the economy of this country. As far as that body is concerned, the Opposition says to the Government, " Go ahead and deal with that body as you will ". There is evidence that the Government has some doubt about the justice of the whole legislation. It knows perfectly well that innocent people will be drawn into its dragnet. Whilst the Opposition declares unequivocally that people who are found to have been communists or subversive agents must pay the penalty without any chance of escape, we are concerned that other people against whom action may be taken under this legislation shall be convicted only after observance of the -due processes of law. Whilst many honorable senators on both sides of the chamber have indulged in irrelevancies and have wandered away from discussion of the actual provisions of the bill, I must express my regret that the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> should have made such grossly unfair statements as he did. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister accused us of deliberately pandering to the Communists because of what, he alleged, we owe to them. Was ever such an untruthful accusation or such a foul charge made in this chamber? When I heard the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> say in the House of Representatives that he could declare one Labour senator, and that one Labour member of the House of Representatives would only escape declaration by the skin of his teeth, I was shocked. However, I chose to regard the right honorable gentleman's remark as one that was made in the heat of debate. After hearing the allegations made by the Minister for Social Services and other Ministers and honorable senators opposite, I am led to wonder whether the members of the Communist party are, after all, the real targets of this legislation. As I have pointed out previously, the Government does not need to impress upon members of the Opposition that the Communists endanger our institutions. After all, the activities of the Communists are directed, not at the Associated Chambers of Commerce, the banks or the Liberal party, but at the Australian Labour party and the great trade union movement. Labour has been consistent in its attitude towards this legislation. We say: "Do what you like to 'the Communist party; we have no objection to that". We have permitted the Government to strengthen the provisions of this bill that are directly aimed at that party by agreeing to the successive amendments to those provisions that it has introduced. We have been consistent also in opposing the undemocratic and totalitarian provisions of the measure, and it is because we want the ordinary safeguards of freedom to operate that we support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley).</inline> The purpose of that amendment is to ensure that a person accused of subversive activities shall be given the benefit Of the ordinary right of trial by jury. How can the Government justify its assertion that the inclusion of such a democratic provision will destroy the bill? We have agreed to the inclusion in the bill of an extraordinary provision to enable the Government to take effective action against any person whose initials were found on matter seized in the raid on Marx House in July, 1949. The effect of clause 24, as now amended, is that the mere initials of a person shall be prima facie evidence that the person concerned was a member of the Communist party. That is a very far-reaching provision, and one which would not ordinarily be considered in a democracy. However, because of our willingness to assist the Government to destroy the Communist party, we have agreed to it, as we have also agreed to a number of other far-reaching proposals. Yet the Minister for Trade and Customs claims that the Opposition, by insisting that ordinary, decent members of the community shall be given the opportunity to be tried before a jury if they so elect, is drawing the teeth of the bill. That contention is absurd. The suggestion that jurors will not convict people who are charged under this legislation is indefensible. If I were charged I would not elect to be tried by a jury. It is obvious that the real reason why the Government will not permit the trial by jury is a political one. </para>

                    <para>. - A lot of sentimental and maudlin claptrap has been talked about the jury system. I think that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> were charged with an offence and had the right to elect whether he would be tried by a judge sitting alone or by a judge and jury, he would be foolish if he did not elect to be be tried by a jury. The jury system, in my opinion, is a failure because many of those who serve as jurors will not accept the moral responsibility expected of them, and the undoubted tendency of many jurors to-day in criminal trials is to allow their sympathy with an accused person to override their sense of justice. One has only to "think of the scores of cases reported in the press from which it is obvious, on the evidence, that the accused must have been guilty, yet they are acquitted by juries. The bill deals with people who are acknowledged enemies of the community, and, as I said in an earlier speech on this bill,' the Opposition, by insisting upon its amendments, is simply making the way of the Communist much easier when he is detected. Those of us who are acquainted with the procedure in the courts know that when a jury is being empanelled a lot of manoeuvring takes place. A battle of tactics goes on to exclude certain people from the panel- </para>

                        <para>- No, I do not believe in it. I consider that it failed long ago because of the reluctance of jurors to assume .moral responsibility for their verdicts. If the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> were agreed to, the result would be that in practice only one Communist sympathizer would need to be included in a jury and the accused would be discharged. We must be sensible above all things and look at the matter realistically. Despite the protestations of members of the Opposition, who have talked a lot of twaddle about the Government not wanting the bill to be passed, and have made other equally fatuous- statements, it is clear that many of them do not wish this measure to be effective. The present proposal to include in the bill provision for trial by jury is sheer sentimental claptrap, which is calculated to play up to a certain section of the community. </para>

He adopted an attitude similar to that of the Prime Minister. A declaration under this measure will carry with it the worst possible odium.

As I have said, I should be prepared to place myself in the hands of a jury drawn from honorable senators opposite with the exception of the four that I have mentioned. Those men, by their speeches and actions, have given evidence that they possess fascist ideas. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator considers that the term had particular application to him, I withdraw it. I repeat that any person who has been declared under this measure should have the right to a trial by jury if he so wishes. That is the ordinary process of the law in this country, and I am surprised at the manner in which it is ignored in this bill. The Prime Minister has said that it would be lunacy . to provide for the trial of declared persons by jury. Backbenchers of the Government parties apparently hold the same idea. I ask any honorable senator opposite to place himself in the position of an individual who has been declared. "Would he not prefer to be tried by a jury than by a single judge? I am s-ure that he would. Whether the Government opposes the Opposition's' amendment or not, we propose to insert it in this bill. </para>

                    <para>. -  I support the Opposition's amendment. I am surprised at the multitude of reasons that have been advanced by the Government for the abandonment of this long-standing practice in British communities. When one examines the bill which, I hope, is about to leave this chamber - incidentally the Senate will be a very tame old place without it - and compares it with the original measure that was introduced by the Government some weeks ago, one is inclined to excuse honorable senators, who may entertain some doubt as to what it contains. Amendment after amendment has been accepted by the Government. In effect, the bill has been re-born under pressure from , the Opposition,  or  as the result of the public outcry. The Government has changed its front as often as many unemployed people had hot dinners during the depression. </para>

                    remarks about the jury system were most alarming. I admire him for his candour, but human nature being what it is, I have yet. to learn that it is wise to depart from the long-established processes of the law. Most eminent legal authorities are opposed to any change in a system that has given universal satisfaction over such a long period. The jury system has proved adequate to deal with every charge that is incidental to human frailty. 1 sincerely trust that the Opposition's amendment, which seeks, not to make trial by jury compulsory, but to give an accused person the right to such a trial if he so desires, will be agreed to.

                    <para>. -  The discussion on this clause shows some sign of departing from the real point at issue between us, and developing into a general discussion on the merits of the jury system. I am a firm believer in the jury system, particularly in criminal matters, and I am sure that the same may be said of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> The general efficacy of the jury system is not in dispute at the moment. The issue is the suitability and desirability of permitting  a  jury to determine a matter of  national security which already has been determined by those who are responsible for the maintenance of national security. </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> said that the persons with whom we are concerned in this measure are persons who are charged with treason. That is entirely false. A person who has committed treason will be charged with the offence of treason, and this Government will have no hesitation in pursuing that course. The Government will then have upon itself the onus to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that such a person has committed treason, and, if it discharges that onus, the person concerned will serve a suitable term of imprisonment; but charges of treason are outside this picture altogether. Let us assume that the Government finds in its employment a man whom it believes to be a Communist. The Government solemnly comes to the conclusion that that person is likely to engage in activities prejudicial to the security of this land. It does not reach that conclusion until the material has been examined by a committee of five, including three very responsible officers. </para>

I hope .that this Government will not be idle until acts pre judicial to the security of the country have been committed. We want to prevent such acts. The committee comes to the conclusion that the person is likely to engage in those activities. The Government unanimously supports the conclusion of the committee, and the Governor-General makes a declaration accordingly. The Opposition's proposal is, that the declared person should be able to appeal to a jury. In that event, the Government would be charged with the responsibility of proving beyond all reasonable doubt that the person was likely to engage in activities prejudicial to our security. If one man out of the jury of twelve said, '"'No, he is not such a person ", that person would have to be left free to carry on his nefarious activities. That is the proposition that the Opposition is advancing. </para>

                        <para>- I am not. If honorable senators opposite have any sense of responsibility in regard to this matter, they will face up to the problem and tell us what their solution is. Let us assume that the committee of five is unanimously in favour of the view that the person concerned is likely to engage in activities prejudicial to our security. The Government itself is unanimously of the same view, and, in the interests of national safety, it wants to get rid of the man. Honorable senators opposite apparently believe that the safety of Australia should be prejudiced merely because one man on a jury of twelve disagrees with everybody else. </para>

                        <para>- I was examining this proposition having regard to the fact that a man may be released from the consequences of a declaration made by the Government hy the failure of the jury to agree in the proceedings which are contemplated by the new sub-clause. A declaration by the Government that a person was engaged or was likely to be engaged in activities prejudicial to the country could! be overruled by one man in a jury of twelve. Presumably the Government then could only make another declaration and face another trial before a jury which might have exactly the same result. That is a preposterous proposition in relation to circumstances such as these. If the analogy of court proceedings is followed, the person in question might be declared a second time and go through another trial with the same result, perhaps because of one obstinate man on the jury. The Opposition claims that a man must continue to be employed by the Government despite the fact that eleven men on the jury, the Government and the committee may be satisfied about the prejudicial nature of his activities. I am not reflecting on juries. I have the greatest respect for the principle of trial by jury, especially in criminal cases, but that has no association with the claim that is made by the Opposition that this matter is suitable for determination by a jury. In effect, the Opposition claims in this new sub-clause that the Government must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt as if a man were charged with murder. A jury may be left in a state of mind where it may say, " We are not too sure about this fellow. He is the sort of person who might engage in activities likely to be detrimental to the defence of Australia or he may not. We cannot make up our minds ". In those circumstances, according to the Opposition, the man should be left in a position in government employment. That arises from the fact that the Opposition insists that the same onus of proof shall be put upon the Government in these proceedings as in the case of an indictment. </para>

                        <para>- It is necessary to rely on some legislation. The Crimes Act may be sufficient to deal with some things, but it is not sufficient to deal with this. The Opposition is saying, in substance, that no man should be removed from the Government service, or from an important official position in a union, unless it has been proved that he has committed treason. It suggests that unless it can be established beyond reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of all twelve men on a jury that he has committed treason or is likely to commit treason, he must remain in the position that he occupies, able to carry on the activities which the Government has declared to be detrimental to the defence of Australia. </para>

The definition in the South African hill continues - the doctrine of Marxian socialism as expounded by Lenin or Trotsky, the Third Communist Internationale (the Comintern) or Communist Information Bureau (the Cominform) or any related form of that doctrine expounded or advocated in the Union for the promotion of the fundamental principles of that doctrine. </para>

                        <para>- It is dated the8th June and it was received on the 9th June, long after the definition in the Australianbill was formulated. If anybody has any complaints about the width  of the definition, that is a complete answer and it provides some confirmation of the view that the Government is on the right track. I have given three instances of it, all of which were reached independently. They are the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Lowe in his report, the definition in the bill which was formulated quite independently of that report, and that portion of the definition of communism which is to be found in the South African bill which was also framed independently. The definition in the bill before the committee is limited enough, and only people whocome within that definition can be declared. I have advanced sufficient reasons already to indicate how impossible it is to remain responsible for the defence and security of the country if the Government is to he overruled by a jury. </para>

                    <para>.- At least I can say that the Government is completely consistent in opposing this provision. One could not expect anything else from the Government when it has decided that, the allegation that a person is prejudicial to security or is likely to be prejudicial to security is not even to go before a judge. On that ground the Government must be consistent and deny right of access toa judge and jury. So at least it is preserving intact the principle it has enunciated that, having usurped all the judicial functions of a court by being accuser, judge and jury and the final awarder of punishment, it does not want that impregnable totalitarian position assailed.  It  appals me to hear Ministers speak so lightly of the allegation that a person is prejudicial to security. </para>

                        <para>- He was speaking of a declaration and the consequences that would flow from it. The Opposition is appalled at the light-hearted way that the Government regards an allegation against an individual that he is prejudicial to security. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> proceeded to say that that is not a crime and that it is not an offence to be prejudicial to security under this bill. That might be true in some completely technical sense in the way that the bill is drawn. But any thinking person who found that another was labelled prejudicial to security must regard that person as a traitor to his country. The allegation plainly implies the foulest crime that an individual could commit in a community. </para>

                        <para>- I said if there was any evidence of treason. That is the most extraordinary clause in the bill. I invited the Attorney-General last night to tell the committee how any person could be said to be likely to prejudice security. How would the Attorney-General determine that? The Attorney-General made no attempt to reply to that question and other questions that I put last night. He has now introduced the question of definition of a Communist and admitted that it was wide. It is exceptionally wide, but the Opposition is prepared to let it stand to allow the Government full opportunity to do what it can against communism in Australia. The Opposition has not attempted to amend the definition of " Communist " in the bill, although we know that it is very wide. We say, however, that because it is so wide, proper safeguards should he applied through the ordinary processes of law. </para>

                        <para>- Does the Attorney-General seriously suggest that the allegation that a man is a Communist is more serious than the allegation that he is prejudicial to the security of the country? I am sure the Attorney-General would not say that, hut he is proposing that the right of appeal shall be granted in the case of the less serious charge, while being denied in the case of the graver charge. The Attorney-General said that no alternative definition of " Communist " had been suggested. The Opposition deliberately agreed to leave the definition wide so as to give the Government every opportunity to pursue the purpose in which we are all interested. However, if the Attorney-General wants another definition, I invite him to consider the one supplied by a very eminent legal authority, the Dean of the Faculty of Law in the Melbourne University, Professor Friedmann, who, in a letter to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 10th June, suggested that the criteria should be something like this - </para>

                        <para>- As I have explained, we deliberately left the definition wide so that the Government would be free to achieve our common purpose, but we want all proper checks and safeguards to be imposed by the rule of law. One such safeguard is trial by jury, not as a matter of obligation, but as the choice of the person accused. In Australia, trial by jury is not confined to criminal charges. Ordinarycivil and divorce cases can be heard before a jury. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps it is only in some States, but in those States it is a well-estahlished part of the legal system that civil and matrimonial cases may be heard before a jury. For instance, a jury may he empanelled to determine a person's liability to pay, or to assess the amount of damages that the person must pay. If the right of trial by jury is conceded in purely civil actions, why should it not be conceded in the case of a person charged with subversive activities? </para>

                        <para>- A majorityof ten. I do not propose to argue the matter further. The Government, having taken the extraordinary stand that a person charged with subversive behaviour may not have access to a court at all must, in order to be consistent, maintain that he shall not have the right to he heard by a jury. Therefore, I do not propose to take up the time of the committee in arguing a proposition which is clearly unacceptable to the Government. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> gave no sound reasons for the Government's refusal to accept the amendment. He spoke of the four sitting Labour members of Parliament in New South Wales who were refused endorsement by the New South  Wales executive of the Australian Labour party, and he sought to compare their situation with that of a person declared under this legislation. He said that the Labour members had no right of appeal. Only a person who is ignorant of the democratic rules of the Labour party would make that statement. The four men concerned had the right of appeal to the highest authority in the organization. In that, their position was quite different from that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> who was refused endorsement by his party so that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Sullivan</inline> might take his place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> had rendered great service to his party, and to the country, but he was given no right of appeal. The statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs was a stupid one, and is unworthy of further comment. He added that, if the amendment were agreed to, it would destroy the effectiveness of the hill. That also was a stupid statement, and he offered no reason in support of it. The Minister has opposed the Labour party's proposal that persons who are declared under the organization shall have the right to be tried by a jury. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has pointed out that the system of trial by jury applies  in cases involving the most serious offences with which a man can be charged. It also applies in civil cases, in which either the defendant or the plaintiff has the right to demand a hearing before a jury. Only minor charges, such as those brought under traffic regulations, may not be heard before a jury. If the Government believes that the charge against a person declared under this legislation is one of minor importance, what is all the fuss about ? Actually, only premeditated murder is a more serious offence than that with which a declared person would he charged. The Minister for Trade and Customs said that there would be no need for a jury in cases that would be heard under this legislation, because no charge would be preferred, and no offence would have been committed. Well, if no offence is committed, why declare the person or the organization ? Any one who reads the preamble to this bill must reject the suggestion that no charge is made against a declared person or organization. Unless the declaration is removed, the person is branded for life as a traitor. </para>

                    said that he disapproved of the jury system because it was unfair. He said that a Communist might be on the jury that heard a charge under this legislation. I point out that the Government claims to know all the Communists in Australia, and they will be declared under this legislation. The Government would be represented at a trial by counsel, who could challenge any Communist called to serve on the jury.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline>
                    knows that perfectly well, but he may have been playing to the gallery when he made his statement. The Attorney-General said that he believed in trial by jury on criminal charges. He has spoken several times on this issue, but he has not yet made it clear what would be the nature of the charge preferred against a declared person. At one time, he suggested that it would be a criminal charge. At another time, he suggested that there would be either no charge at all, or that it would be a trivial one. The Attorney-General has not explained how peace officers, or the members of the screening committee, will know when a man might commit treason; yet, on the assumption that he might commit treason, a man could be branded as a traitor to his country. Against such a declaration he is to have no right of appeal, whether to a police court, a magistrate's court, the supreme court of a State, or to the High Court of Australia, and he is to be denied the right to be heard by a jury of his fellow Australians.
                </para>
                <para>The Attorney-General said that, if a declared person were tried before a jury, the whole proceedings might be upset by a disagreement on the jury caused by one member. The charge against the declared person might be no more than that he was likely to commit treason at some time in the future. No time would be stated in the charge. It might be next month, or next year or in five years time. The Attorney-General says, however, that the person against whom such a vague charge was made would be a menace to the security of the country if nothing were done about him. Certainly, it would he a  grave affront to justice, and a denial of the democratic rights for which our soldiers fought, if such a person were refused the right to he heard by a court. The Attorney-General made a great fuss over the possibility of a declared person getting off because of the obstinacy of one member of the jury; yet in the same speech, and almost in the same breath, he said he agreed that criminal offences should be tried by juries. In cases such as those, the jury .might disagree. Apparently he believes it to be right that a maniacal, cold-blooded murderer should be tried by a. jury, despite the risk that he might be freed and given an opportunity to commit other murders, but he does not agree that persons declared under this measure should have the right to trial by jury, because one man on the jury might disagree and the defendant might be cleared of the charge. </para>
                <para>The other point made by the Attorney-General was that it would be unwise to allow a declared person about whose loyalty there were grave doubts to resume his position in the Public Service. The Attorney-General and the Minister for Trade and Customs know very well that if the Public Service Board suspects that a public servant is using his position in the Public Service to engage in treasonable or subversive activities, there are ways and means by which it can transfer him to a position in which he can do no harm. I do not doubt for one moment that if this Government considered that a public servant was acting in that way it would transfer him to another position in which he could do no harm. If it did not do so, it would fail in its duty to the people of this country. The argument of the Attorney-General has no solid foundation. The simile that springs to my mind is the use of little wooden props as the foundation for a three-storey concrete building.  His  argument has fallen flat. If the Government agrees that persons accused of major and minor crimes should be tried by jury, why does it disagree with the proposition that persons declared under this measure should also have the right to trial by jury? </para>

In the past, the gross abuse of power by judges and kings aroused the resentment of the people.

His  career in the government service has been ruined.

                        <para>- There has been and always will be such a thing as unjust government. The question that we must ask ourselves is : Who is to judge the judges? I do not regard most of these judges as being ultra-intellectual or even ultra-just. I have found in my experience that the more you delegate power to those who would dominate or rule you, to the degree that you delegate that power the power is abused. The Labour movement came into existence because of the injustices that were perpetrated by people to whom power was delegated. This Government has asked that power similar to the power that was exercised by Mussolini, Hitler and other dictators be delegated to it. In the light of our experience, we should not be worthy to represent the workers of this country if we were prepared to delegate that power and to say, in effect, that we had complete confidence in the Government. I, for one, have not, particularly when I consider the provisions of the bill in its original form and the savage and prejudiced utterances of the Prime Minister. I believe that the right honorable gentleman is actuated more by feelings of revenge and a desire to dominate than a desire to do justice. </para>

I remind the committee that the Prime Minister,' in the House of Representatives, read a list of names of persons and subsequently had to admit that he had made some mistakes. The right honorable gentleman is a King's Counsellor, a King's Minister, and a man with a legal training. In this Parliament - the highest tribunal in the land - he indicated a number of men without having first carefully ascertained the facts. "We were told that the facts would be carefully considered, but, apparently, they were not carefully considered as far as the Prime Minister was concerned. In pressing for trial by jury, we want to give any person who  i9  likely to be indicted or who is actually indicted, every possible facility to prevent a gross miscarriage of justice. </para>

                        <para>- With all due respect to the Chair, I am doing so. Provision is made in this measure for the GovernorGeneral to declare a person who is engaged, or is likely to engage, in activities prejudicial to the security and defence of the Commonwealth, or to the execution or maintenance of the Constitution, or of the laws of the Commonwealth, by instrument published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> Surely to goodness a person so declared should be entitled to trial by his peers, if he so desires. That is a fundamental right that has existed under British law for many years. It has been suggested that if a juryman disagreed with the remainder of the jury, the effect of this measure would be lost. We should consider whether this bill aims merely to stamp out communism in this country, or is intended to go a long way beyond that objective. In view of some of the statements that have been made by honorable senators opposite, I am inclined to think that the pursuit of communism is not the only motive for this legislation, and that the bill is intended to provide a much larger net for people who may be termed victims. The measure specifically provides that any body of persons, corporate or unincorporate, not being an industrial organization registered under the law of the Commonwealth or a State, may be declared unlawful. But what is the position of an organization that is deregistered under the laws of a State or the Commonwealth? Once that situation arises the organization would be covered by this bill. </para>

The position is that the clause intends to bring within its ambit the Communist party and other organizations that may be likely to be considered something other than truly loyal subjects of His Majesty the King. I submit that the moment a union is deregistered, it will come within the scope of the measure.

This drag-net provision brings in practically all organizations in this country, if necessary, but will a member or an organization whom it is intended to declare be called upon for an explanation before being actually declared? I am more inclined to think that the committee of five will declare citizens of this country on information supplied to it. Under sub-clause (2.). of clause 9 a person whom it is considered is doing something prejudicial to the interests of this country, or something to upset the good government of this country, may be declared. The Government contends that after he is declared he should not have the right to elect to he tried by his peers. </para>

                    <para>. -  With the indulgence of the committee, I should like to address a few remarks to the amendment that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley).</inline> I shall first make my own position quite clear in relation to trial by jury. I think that it is one of the finest features in the English system of law. In that connexion, I should like to dissociate myself from certain remarks that were made by an honorable senator on this side of the chamber. I say that purposely, in view of the views that I intend to express. I do not propose to reiterate the various statements that have been made by honorable senators on this side of the chamber in support of doing away with trial by jury in this instance. The Opposition has contended that if trial by jury is not extended to the people in question, there will be created a police state. I submit that a court-martial in one of the services runs completely parallel with such a case. If a civilian were detected endeavouring to seduce a member of the Royal Australian Navy, he would be tried by court-martial without jury, in the same way as we suggest that a person suspected of treason or seditious activities in this country should be tried by people who know all about it, not by a body of men to whom the matter w.as strange, and who could not possibly understand the implications of the statement of the prosecuting attorney. I do not propose to relate' all the details of what happens when a man goes before a court-martial, but I remind the committee that this type of no-jury court has already been in existence for many years. It is still considered one of the fairest courts under British law. A civilian detected trying to seduce a member of the naval forces towards treasonable acts is tried by a court-martial consisting of five senior officers of the naval service. I submit that that is completely analogous to the proposed method of dealing with Communists, which does not involve a departure from British justice. </para>

                    <para>. -  I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> that if a member of the naval forces were  charged, he would be dealt with by a court-martial, comprising members of the service to which he belonged. The position is not analogous to the declaring of Communists. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> is intended to preserve to citizens one of their rights that would be taken away by the bill, and that is the right to be tried by a jury of one's equals. The bill proposes to ban certain persons because they belong to a particular organization and to remove an individual from his job and subject him to certain additional penalties if his activities are considered to be opposed to the national interest. "What the Labour party has attempted to do throughout the protracted debate that has taken place on this measure is to protect individuals and organizations so that they will be able to exercise at least some of their rights under ordinary British law. The proposal that a person or an organization may be proscribed by the Government savours of persecution if, in fact, it is not actual persecution. Because of that suggestion it is necessary to include in the bill some safeguard of the kind proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. Down the ages controversy has raged around attempts lo deny individuals who have been accused of offences the right to place their f-a.se fairly before some independent tribunal. Lord Macaulay, the eminent historian and philosopher, wrote an essay on Hallam's <inline font-style="italic">Constitutional History of England,</inline> in the course of which he stated - </para>

                    <para>To punish a man because he has committed a crime, is not persecution. To punish a man, because we infer from the nature of some doctrine which he holds, or from the conduct of other persons who hold the same doctrines with him, that he will commit a crime, is persecution, and is, in every case, foolish and wicked. </para>

                <para class="block">The application of those observations to the measure we are discussing is obvious. The Government proposes, as some kind of compromise, that the power to " declare " an organization or an individual shall be confided to a committee of five individuals, who will have the right arbitrarily to decide whether a man has done wrong or may do wrong. Such a committee can be, and has been, not unjustly described as a " star chamber ". The insertion in the bill of the safeguard proposed by the Leader of the Opposition will prevent the extraordinary provisions of this measure from being used to persecute individuals. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Wood,</inline>
                    in the course of his remarks, very severely criticized the ageold British system of trial by jury, and over the years many similar criticisms of that system have been uttered. Of course, the real difficulty is that whilst many eminent persons are opposed to trial by jury, they have not the courage to come into the open and say so. The Government has been exceedingly careful to refrain from appearing to condemn trial by jury, and has endeavoured to dodge the issue by asserting that no trial will take place when an individual or an organization is declared because, technically, no offence has been committed. That is a mere subterfuge. I remind honorable senators of the words of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline>
                    Blackstone in his famous
                    <inline font-style="italic">Commentaries,</inline>
                    in the course of which he stated -   . . the founders of the English laws have with excellent forecast contrived . . . that the truth of every accusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours, indifferently chosen, and superior to all suspicion.
                </para>
                <para class="block">That heritage has been handed down to us, and it should not lightly be cast aside. The Attorney-General has consistently contended throughout the debate that no crime will have been committed by a person who will be declared. As I have already pointed out, such a person may not have committed a crime in the strict sense of that word, but he will certainly he subjected to very serious penalties. The consequences to an organization or to an individual declared under the measure will be very grave, but I am now principally concerned with the position of the individual. A man who is declared and loses his job in the Public Service or in an industrial organization will have  no right to full legal redress. It follows, therefore, that we should at least extend to him the benefit of a fair trial before a judge or a judge and jury. Common justice demands that some such latitude should be extended to an accused person. No more terrible accusation could be made against an individual than that he is a traitor, or a potential traitor, to his country. I remind honorable senators that such an accusation may be based on the mere fact that the individual has advocated perhaps just one of the many doctrines advocated by Marx, Engels or Lenin. </para>

I remind honorable senators of the words of the preamble to the bill, to which the Opposition agreed, which set out ample justification for " branding " a Communist. Having agreed to the preamble, the Opposition is now attempting to find fault with the fact that a penalty will be imposed upon an individual who is a member of the Communist party. I repeat that by accepting the preamble without demur they have already agreed that a member of the Communist party is an undesirable person. </para>

                <para>I join with honorable senators on both sides of the chamber in supporting the traditional right of a. British subject who is accused of a criminal offence to be tried by a jury. However, if one lost all sense of realism and forgot the times and conditions in which we are living he might be lulled into the belief that the Government is seeking arbitrarily and capriciously to withdraw from the people some ancient, constitutional right. That is the attitude which members of the Opposition have induced in themselves and which they are seeking to instil into the community. The fact is that we are not living in normal times, and the situation calls for uncommon action. That is the justification for rejecting the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley).</inline> We know that the enactment of that proposal would have the effect of delaying and hindering the carrying out of the objectives of the bill. Whether the amendment has been moved with that intention I do not know. In agreeing to the adoption of the preamble to the bill without alteration, the Opposition has indicated that it agrees that the problem which confronts us is not a normal one and that its solution requires uncommon legislation and complete confidence in the integrity of "the judiciary. Since the duty of the judiciary under this bill is to protect the rights of individual members of the community,  I  submit that the appeal provisions already contained in the bill are all that are desirable or necessary. </para>
                <para>We are told that a declared individual will be branded for life. What brand will he carry? He will be branded only to the degree that he has ex-pressed his belief in something that has been declared to be illegal. He will know that when he expresses his belief. Otherwise, he will have an opportunity to satisfy a reasonable court that he does not hold the views that have been attributed to him. Therefore, he will not have anything to fear.  I  have been connected with industry for the greater part of my life, and  I  realize that there are degrees of communism. There are people who only think that they are Communists; there are people who would like to be Communists, but are not game, and there are others who are genuine Communists, but their number is not great. However, they are sufficiently numerous to influence dupes to do their bidding, which, in turn, is the bidding of a foreign power whose aim is to disrupt industry at a time when progress is most desirable. Honorable senators opposite have expressed abhorrence at the possible fate of individuals who will be declared because they are Communists, but no such protests are made about the gaoling of any other individual for a breach of the law. Declared persons will not necessarily be sent to gaol. While supporting the general principles of this bill, the Opposition has felt obliged to put on a " show " in this chamber with the object of convincing people that it is concerned only with giving every one a "fair go". That is my assesment of the debate that has taken place on this proposed new clause. Whether by accident or design, the only effect of the Opposition's attitude to this measure will be to delay the imple- menting of the essential principles of the bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I  do not know who it was that first said, "Lord protect me from my friends ", but no one ever needed such protection more than did the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> this 'afternoon. Two amazing statements have been made from the Government side of the chamber. Earlier,  I  was inclined to the view that it would have been as well if this debate had concluded last night, but now  I  am glad that it did not, mainly because of the two statements to which  I  have referred. One was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood,</inline> who said that he did not believe in trial by jury. The other came from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall,</inline> who said that offenders against the provisions of this measure should be courtmartialled. Those statements show conclusively the danger of leaving the liberty of any citizen, be he a Communist or not, in the hands of a government such as this.  I  do not think that  I  have misrepresented the honorable senators. However,   I  agree that the court-martialling of declared persons would be preferable to the form, of treatment that they are to receive under this measure.  I  take it that at a court-martial, the accused person is present. He will not be present when the evidence upon which he is to be declared under this measure is considered by the five men. No provision is made for any cross-examination of the informer, and no penalty is provided for an inf ormer who acts maliciously.  I  do not know much about courts-martial, but  I  assume that an offender is formally charged with an offence, and is permitted the aid of counsel. </para>

                        <para>- I  agree it is fairer than the method provided under this bill because the accused person is present; he confronts his accuser, and has a right to question him. As  I  have said, a person who is to be declared will not be present when the evidence against him is given. He will not even know who has informed against him. </para>

                <para>The Attorney-General is very good over 100 yards, but not so good in the marathon. The farther he goes the worse he gets. He reminds me of the Italian marathon runner who collapsed before he had completed the course. He was carried over the line, but was disqualified. The Attorney-General said that innocent people had nothing to fear under this legislation. That is no justification for the measure. The honorable senator might as well argue that every person in the Commonwealth should be finger-printed because no innocent person would have anything to fear, or that every house should be entered to search for documents merely because no innocent person would have anything to fear. I am not very much concerned about the law in this connexion, but, I am concerned with the fate of principles of British justice that have been adhered to for the last 600 years. One of those is the right of trial by jury. The Attorney-General said, "¥e are going to govern ". Of course he is, but it is impudence and audacity to suggest that the governing of this country necessitates the setting aside of fundamental principles of British law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Simmonds</inline> said that we had no right to criticize this measure as we had agreed to the principle of it. That is not quite correct, because under this bill declared persons have to be more than Communists. Clause 9 states - </para>

                <para class="block">He may not be a Communist at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> spoke of the fight against the divine right of kings. We are to have a. divine right of five people, who will listen to informers, or accept documents which indicate that a certain person is a Communist or is acting prejudicially to the security of the nation. In the face of that provision, for the Government to say that it believes in freedom is ridiculous. The Government cannot have it both ways. Either we have fought for something or we have fought for nothing. Let us get out of our heads the idea that we are dealing only with Communists. A British subject, whether he is a Communist or not, has a right to a trial by jury on a serious charge. Honorable senators opposite have shifted their ground continually. Every time the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> speaks he reminds me of the pea-and-thimble man who says, "There it is; there it isn't".  In one breath he admitted that the Labour party was opposed to the Communists, but in the next breath he said that he was satisfied from the way we on this side of the chamber were behaving in regard to this bill, that we were working with the Communists. Which is it to be? I say again that if the Government wanted to assist the Communists it could not have done anything better than to frame a bill of this kind, placing the onus of proof on accused persons, and denying them the right of trial by jury. Tens of thousands of people in this country who would not care if all the Communists were hanged tomorrow are most concerned with their own individual rights. Their view is that if this can happen to the Communists today, it can happen to them to-morrow. History shows that once the principles of law are set aside it is most difficult to restore them. The Communists can be fought only by isolating them. If the Government wants to declare the Communist party illegal, let it do so, but it should stop there. This legislation plays right into their hands. When a Communist approaches a trade union member ho does not say, " We want you to assist the Communist party ". He says, " You are in favour of a shorter working week. That is what we are striving for ". That will be the attitude of the Com.munists under this legislation. The  president  of the Australian Labour party, Mr; Anderson, said that a demonstration against the bill was necessary because it linked the fate of the Communist party with trial by jury and the £10 a week basic wage application. I dislike the bill from beginning to end, but I shall abide by the decision of my party. If honorable senators opposite knew what they were up against they would never have introduced this bill which already has been amended 40 times. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. I do not know how many people there are in Queensland, but probably there would be about 1,000,000. If the honorable senator has no faith in the common man, why is he here? Apparently he believes in dictatorships. He believes that five men are more able than a jury to judge the guilt of a declared person. He does not believe in trial by jury in any circumstances. That is the point I am making. It is a matter of no trial by jury for the Communists to-day, no trial by jury for the trade unionists to-morrow, and no trial by jury for somebody else the next day. The jury system, with all its faults, has proved better than any other system. I ask honorable senators to forget that this is a question of communism or neocommunism. Is British democracy so weak that it has to throw aside all the traditions of Magna Charta to get a few people who are, or may be, Communists? The Government knows Healy and Roach. There is no question of onus of proof or trial by jury about them. They admit that they are Communists. Australian democracy is supposed to be the strongest in the world and I cannot believe that it is necessary to prejudice the liberty of8,000,000 people to get at two or three would-be Communists. It has been suggested that the Government will divulge the secrets of the country if it has to supply evidence. In the next breath, Government supporters say that if a person who is declared swears that he is not a Communist, the Government is prepared to submit evidence. The Government cannot have it both ways. I understand that the Government says the processes of law cannot be utilized because the country is in such a terrific state that it is practically at war. My own opinion is that the proposal is unconstitutional because the Government is assuming that the country is at war and the High Court has ruled on the price-fixing legislation that it is not at war. Suppose the country were at war and a government claimed its security was at stake. If Jones were declared and was prepared to swear that he was not a Communist, the Government would then take out from the archives the reports of its pimps. </para>

What is to he their place in society once they are declared? Will a declaration be recorded in the files of the employment service? Will the Communists be allowed to keep their positions in industrial unions if they are not holding official positions? Will public servants who are declared be entitled to superannuation benefits? Can they collect unemployment benefits when they are deprived of their employment? Has any provision been made for gaols or political prison camps or any other means of handling those people?

                    <para>. -  I confess to some mystification about the question because the bill indicates quite clearly what is going to happen to people who are declared. I imagine that by this time the honorable senator has read the bill. [ realize that the Opposition has now destroyed the bill and, that being  so,  probably the committee is discussing merely hypothetical questions, but I shall recapitulate the results that follow a declaration. They are set out in the bill plainly, and there are three of them. The first is that a person who is declared cannot remain in the Public Service. He can follow any other employment but not that. Secondly, he may not be an officer of certain trade unions that are declared by the Governor-General,  a  substantial number of whose members are engaged in vital industries. Thirdly, the Commonwealth cannot enter into a contract with a person who is a declared person for the supply of goods or services, but he can still enter into contracts with other people if he can get people to carry on business with him. Incapacity from employment in the Commonwealth is not confined strictly to employment in the Commonwealth Public Service, but extends to employment with an authority of the Commonwealth. Those are the consequences which will follow a declaration. There is no need for concentration camps. The Government is not contemplating putting those people into gaols. Declaration does not constitute a crime. It does not call for the imposition of a penalty. </para>

Now that the amendments put forward by the Labour party have removed the objections we had to the bill, we recognize that the amendment now before the committee does something to sustain the validity of the measure. As I said before, the validity of a measure which places so much reliance on the defence power at a time so far removed from the period of hostilities during the last war, needs all the support it can get. If the validity of this legislation is attacked, the High Court will be more disposed to uphold it if the legislation is obviously intended to meet an emergency. Although I say that, I still reserve my doubt that the High Court will uphold the validity of the legislation under the defence power. </para>

The organization could always approach the court in the State where it had its principal office, but if it could establish that the greatest number of its members were in another State, it could approach the Supreme Court in that State. If the words " substantial number " are inserted in the definition, it would be possible for six separate applications to be before six separate State courts at the same time. </para>

                <para class="block">The court would have no greater or less difficulty in deciding what was a " substantial number " than would the Cabinet have in deciding the issue under subsection (3.) of clause 10. It mightbe important for an organization to bring an application in one State rather than in another. As for the suggestion that six separate applications might be brought either simultaneously or one after the other in six separate States, I point out that there can be ultimately only one effective hearing, so that no practical difficulty could arise. The matter between the Commonwealth and the organization having been resolved by one State court, that would he the end of the matter. </para>

I regret that the Government and the Opposition are unable to see eye to eye on a relatively unimportant procedural matter such as this. There is a point of principle involved. There are many loosely knit organizations without any kind of principal office. The amendment is designed to ensure access by those organizations to the appropriate State courts. We press the amendment for that reason, and also because we do not consider it to be fair that the whole of the organization of a body should be laid bare to a court as a condition precedent to a hearing. </para>

                        <para>. - When all the amendments to a bill have been disposed of and the committee comes to the recitals in the preamble, it is considered normally that enough has been said. However, the recitals in the preamble to this bill are most unusual, and I am impelled to make some comments upon them because of statements that have emanated from Government supporters. From time to time in this debate they have stated that the recitals are either true or not true; that if they are true, all of the provisions of the bill are necessary and desirable ; and that, in those circumstances, the Opposition has no reasonable ground for opposing or even seeking to modify them . That statement over-simplifies the position to an extraordinary degree. As it has been made, I propose to examine the recitals. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>The first three recitals merely establish the constitutional base for the measure, and I come at once to the recitals on page 2 of the bill. Paraphrasing them, the first alleges against the Australian Communist party revolutionary activities. That, plainly, is a crime under the existing law of this country. The second alleges against the Australian Communist party that it is concerned with the overthrow of established government by force. </para>
                <para class="block">That, too, is an offence against the Crimes Act. The next recital makes the most serious allegations and, in effect, alleges against the Australian Communist party that it is guilty of espionage, sabotage and treason. Those are three of the gravest crimes that can be alleged against anybody. All of them are offences against the Crimes Act. They carry the heaviest penalties, including, in the case of treason, the death penalty. . That shows how seriously those crimes are regarded under the existing law. </para>
                <para>The next two recitals, bracketed together - again I paraphrase - allege against the Australian Communist party that it is concerned with the disruption of work and production in certain vital industries. Apart from the fact that the Commonwealth may, under the Crimes Act, declare a state of emergency if there is a disruption of interstate trade, the disruption of work and production is not an offence against the Crimes Act. Unquestionably it could be made a crime, but, despite the undertaking given by the present Government parties to the people at the last general election that, if they were returned, the existing laws would be reviewed and strengthened, no action of that kind has been taken. </para>
                <para>The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> and other members of the Government claim that the recitals are true. I want to examine that statement. </para>

Are there facts in the possession of the Government that justify serious allegations of that nature?

                        <para>- There has been no alteration of the Labour party's view of this matter. Some individuals may speak out of consonance with the party's view, but that happens also in the Government parties. It has happened in this chamber to-day. I say for the benefit of honorable senators opposite that it takes a lot of courage for a member of any political party to express a view that diverges from the majority view of the party. However one may deplore it from a party viewpoint, one must acknowledge the courage and strongmindedness of a man who, in pursuing that course, endangers his personal position. </para>

                <para>If the Attorney-General cannot say that these recitals are demonstrably true, then he is asking the Parliament to join with the Government in stating as a fact something that the Government merely believes or surmises to be the case. That is asking a lot of the Parliament. If any one of those allegations is demonstrably true, it is a very craven government that, knowing and being able to prove that there are in this country espionage, treason, sabotage and revolutionary activities, does not take the most desperate action. The Australian Communist party or any other organization is simply a name. It can perform acts only through individuals. Some members of the Australian Communist party must, in the view of the Government, have committed acts of treason, sabotage and espionage. If the Government has in its possession any evidence relating to those acts, it will be false to its duty if it does not prosecute the individuals. The Government suggests that traitors, spies and saboteurs should be allowed to run loose in the community as long as they are not employed in the Public Service or as officials of trade unions. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General is seeking to get away from the case that I am presenting to him. There is a very simple way of testing whether these recitals are demonstrably true. Let the Attorney-General select any one name from the list of Communists that was read by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives. Let him then shed the privilege that he enjoys in the Parliament, walk outside the Parliament and allege that the person whose name he has selected from the list is a spy, a saboteur or a traitor. If he did that, instantly he would be involved in an action for slander, and would be required to prove the truth of what he said. The Opposition believes that the allegations are substantially true. They are in conformity with our observations and suspicions. They are the things that we have said and the grounds and the reasons for our denying access to the Labour party of Communists or " fellow travellers " of Communists. But let the Government say whether those things are true or untrue. If they are true, I say that it is a craven government that will not act. The Government has the whole scope of the Crimes Act available to it. If the </para>

                        <para>- I regret the need for opening up this aspect of the matter at this stage of the debate, but I am impelled to do so by the remarks of honorable senators during the debate. This was the first appropriate place at which I could deal with it. I do not propose, unless provoked, to speak on this measure again, and I express the hope that, unless my colleagues feel strongly urged otherwise, this measure will go through. I am not eager that there should be any wider discussion. The Government has its reply. I do not want the debate to open out at all, but I draw attention to the time that it has taken the Senate to cover this measure. The bill reached the Senate from the House of Representatives on the 24th May. The Minister delivered his second-reading speech on the 25th May, and the debate was adjourned, as usual, until the 30th May. So that the time taken to deal with this bill in the Senate was the 30th and 31st May, and the 1st, 6th, 7th, 8th, 13th, 14th and 15th June. The second-reading debate occupied six days for 60 senators, and less than three full days have been occupied in the committee stage. </para>

First he misread some of the statements. They have been very carefully worded. For instance, he read a recital as necessarily involving a claim that the Communist party was, at this moment, engaging in activities which could themselves be described as revolutionary activities. The fourth recital in the preamble to the bill does not  say  that. We were careful not to say it, for very good reasons. That recital reads - </para>

Let us examine that recital, of which I gave a short paraphrase. I suggest that my paraphrase will be completely justified by an examination of the recital itself, which is as follows: - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">That recital amounts to an allegation of revolutionary activities by members of the Australian Communist party. I state an axiomatic principle of law when I say that there is no difference whatever between the attempt to commit a crime and the actual accomplishment of that crime. If any honorable senator wants proof of that contention he need only refer to the press reports of the trial in New South Wales a few days ago of two notorious criminals, both of whom were convicted and sentenced to death on a charge of shooting with intent to murder. Only one of them actually fired the shot which formed the basis of the charge. The recital in the preamble which I have just read contains an allegation that the Communist party is attempting to engage in revolutionary activities. It is quite obvious that such activities are criminal. Therefore, the pathetic spectacle of the Attorney-General urging that the Communist party was not engaging in unlawful activities- </para>

                        <para>- We are talking about Australia, and the Attorney-General runs for cover to Canada. I remind him that we are discussing the Australian Communist party.

                <para class="block">Let us be clear about that. The Communists are alleged to be engaging in espionage, sabotage and other treasonable activities. If the Attorney-General has any evidence of such activities he knows what his duty is - he must bring the individuals before a court and charge them. However, he does not propose to do that. He is compelled to agree that he is not in any better position than is the Opposition concerning the proof of these allegations. Whilst members of the Opposition believe all these allegations to be true, or suspect them to be true, the plain fact is that we do not know whether they could be clearly established in law. Once honorable senators realize that fact they will know what they are doing when we vote for the recitals. However, if the Attorney-General imagines that the recitals in their present form are the last word in demonstrable truth we join issue with him. </para>

                    <para>. - When this bill was introduced, many people thought that the Government was really sincere. Ostensibly, the purpose of the bill was to ban the Communist party. The Government claimed that the measure was urgent in the interests of the defence of this country. The Opposition asked the Government repeatedly to explain the urgency of the measure, and to show its association with defence matters. The only reply was that the bill was connected with the " cold war ". We were informed originally that the bill would be passed without amendments. I am convinced, after listening to this debate, that honorable senators opposite have put up the greatest sham fight in our history. Why have they done that? They did it because the bill is outrageous and is contrary to the rule of law as we know it. The Government knew that the Australian people would not stand for it. The Government has been forced to amend the hill to such an extent that it is now unrecognizable. The bill was " guillotined " through the House of Representatives. When it reached this chamber we were informed that no amendments would be allowed, but in spite of the objections of honorable senators opposite, the Opposition decided to bring the bill into conformity with the rule of law. Because that has been done, we are now informed that the bill will be ineffective. The bill is a complete sham, be- . cause, if what is stated in its preamble is true, action could have been taken under the infamous Crimes Act.

                <para class="block">The reason no action was taken under the Crimes Act is that proof was required. Why was this measure introduced? It was introduced because of certain promises made by the Government parties during the election campaign. The people of Australia were told that if the Communist party were banned, people would get more goods and that certain other things would be done. The Government, believing that it was impossible to do the things that it promised, introduced a bill that was not acceptable to any decentminded person. Because of the Government's failure to implement its election promises it will blame the Opposition for the failure of the measure and then say the Communists are the cause merely because we have insisted upon the observance of the ordinary rule of law. This bill was only camouflage and the Government is insincere in placing it before members of this Parliament. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> who said, by interjection, that the more the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> spoke the more he revealed the Government's real motive. </para>

                    said that if there were Communists who, here and now, were engaging in sabotage, it was the duty of the Government to prosecute them; yet, when he was a Minister, he permitted Communists to sabotage a government instrumentality, the Stevedoring Industry Commission. On the honorable senator's own admission in this chamber, when the Government of which he was a member found that Communists were engaging in sabotage, the commission was abolished. No prosecution was launched. However, these matters are introduced merely to mislead the people, and to divert attention from the main issue. We believe that the Australian Communist party is an integral part of world-wide communism. Do honorable senators opposite believe that?

                    <para class="block">This is a bill to alter the provisions of the Constitution relating to the Senate. The need for the alteration springs from the introduction into Senate elections of  the system called proportional representation, which came into operation for the first time last year, and the possible effect of which can now be clearly seen. The object of the bill is to avoid a situation in which, after a double dissolution, the Government and the Opposition will be returned in this chamber with equal representation. </para>
                    <para>In the Senate, a deadlock created by equal representation of the Government and the Opposition is likely to be more complete, and to have more serious consequences than in some legislative chambers. The reason for this is to be found in the rule which is laid down by the Constitution itself, and which the Senate therefore cannot alter, that the  President  shall have a deliberative vote but not a casting vote, and that when the votes are equal the question shall pass in the negative. This means that with equal numbers of Government and Opposition senators a situation could arise in which the Senate could do no business at all. It can be readily demonstrated that with the present representation of ten members from each State it is probable that in the event of a double dissolution the Government and Opposition parties would be returned in equal numbers to the Senate. It has been estimated that it would be necessary for one side or the other to obtain substantially 55 per cent, of the formal votes cast in a particular State for it to secure the return of more than five members. At the last election, for example, the Government secured sufficient votes to provide it with a majority of 27 in the House of Representatives. If at that election it had been necessary to have ten senators from each .State, representation of the parties in the Senate after the election would have been equal. The Opposition would have been in a position to obstruct the enactment of the Government's programme of legislation, despite the fact that a double dissolution is intended to overcome that very situation. Thi? result would follow after any double dissolution unless one or other of the parties secured the votes of more than 55 per rent, of those voting in a particular State. This is a situation which calls for remedy. It is ridiculous that constitutional provisions which are designed to solve deadlocks between the Houses should almost inevitably result in the continuance of deadlock. The bill proposes to overcome this difficulty in a very simple way. It provides that upon a double dissolution two elections for the Senate shall be held - one for those who are to fill three-year vacancies and the other for those who are to fill six-year vacancies. In each of these polls five candidates will be returned, and unless one side or the other secures an abnormally large percentage of the votes cast, the winning side will secure three of the vacancies in each case and the losing side, two. The probability of a deadlock will thus be avoided. </para>
                    <para>It is, of course, possible that even under the new system the Government and Opposition parties could be returned after a double dissolution with equal representation. This would occur if one party secured a majority in three States and the other secured the majority in the remaining States. Such a result can arise under any system of voting and this bill is not directed to the solution of that problem. It is a result unlikely to occur, but this measure is concerned to remove the almost inevitable result which will arise in normal circumstances from the fact that an even number of senators is to be returned from each State under the system of proportional representation. </para>
                    <para>Some people may think that the Constitution already provides adequately for resolving deadlocks between the houses. The relevant provisions are in section 57 ; hut a glance at that section shows that it deals only with one part of the problem, and not at all with the possibilities which this bill is aimed at. What section 57 provides is that when there is disagreement between the two houses with respect to a proposed law, such as the Communist Party Dissolution Bill 1950, with which the Senate has just dealt, the disagreement will, in certain circumstances, be solved by the dissolution of both houses, that is, a " double " dissolution. Following upon a deadlock between the houses as to a particular proposed law, those provisions are designed to secure a decision by the vote of the people. In most cases, at least, that is the constitutional solution intended by the framers of that section. It is true that the possibility of a continuance of the deadlock after a double dissolution in relation to the particular measure which occasioned the dissolution is envisaged by the section, and provision is made in those circumstances in certain events for a joint sitting of the members of both bouses of the legislature after the double dissolution. I emphasize that this provision does nothing to solve the problem of a continuing deadlock after a dissolution, except in relation to the particular measure which was the immediate cause of the deadlock. Therefore, if the Opposition and Government parties are returned in equal numbers to the Senate after the dissolution, the probability of the Government being unable to carry other legislation through the legislature will remain, whatever may be the ultimate fate of the measure with respect to which the dissolution of the Senate was granted. </para>
                    <para>In addition to lessening the prospects of a continuing deadlock the bill provides for a solution- for another difficulty which arises under the provisions of section 13 of the Constitution as at present enacted. The only provision in that section for the allocation of three-year or six-year vacancies between the senators chosen after a dissolution of the Senate is that the Senate shall divide the senators chosen for each State into two classes. This means, in the absence of agreement, that a majority of the Senate could allocate six-year vacancies to themselves and three-year vacancies to their opponents. The section does not contemplate the possibility that on this issue the Senate may itself be equally divided, and no provision is made for the allocation of vacancies by any other method than the vote of the Senate itself. Two undesirable consequences follow from this. First, if the House is evenly divided and. agreement is impossible, there is no method provided in the Constitution for solving the problem. In other words, section 13 as at present enacted could be rendered completely unworkable in this respect. That is not fantasy. I recollect, and I think the  President  will recall also, an occasion when a  President  of this Senate was ohosen as a result of there being an equality of votes. </para>

                            <para>- I am merely suggesting that this is not fantasy. I am illustrating how far political warfare can go. At that time, the Liberal party or its predecessor occupied the treasury bench. It had a majority in the Senate of nineteen members to seventeen members of the Labour party. One of the Government supporters was serving overseas with the forces, and, for normal purposes, the Government had a pair. On the day the vote was to take place, another honorable senator on the Government side was sick and could not be present in the chamber when the vote was being taken. As a result, the voting was seventeen on each side in terms of party strength. Honorable senators who were present will remember that the Senate went through the process of having two votes and on each occasion the voting was seventeen all. </para>

                            <para>- The Opposition would give nothing away. One of the Opposition members would not stay out because one of the Government members was sick. No allowance was made for the man who was in the Middle East. The rules of voting were complied with strictly and if there had not been provision in the Standing Orders for the solution of a deadlock of that nature by pulling the names out of a hat or a box, the deadlock would have continued. I am using that incident merely as an illustration to show that it is not fanciful to suggest that there could be a complete deadlock in the absence of provisions such as are contained in the bill now being introduced to the Senate, because no party would be able to carry a motion to solve the problem. It is true that there are precedents for the method to be adopted for the election to fill vacancies after a double dissolution. It had to be done in 1914 and at the very commencement of the Senate itself. On those occasions a motion was proposed that those senators who got the highest number of votes at the election should take six year terms and those who got the smaller number should take three year terms. </para>

                            <para>- 1 agree, but assuming that the Senate was equally divided after a double dissolution and it was proposed on one side and opposed on the other the Senate would be equally divided on that question. The motion would not be carried and therefore there would he no solution of the problem. So I suggest that that in itself provides a strong reason why some solution should be found. The second undesirable consequence which follows from that difficulty is that the Senate allocates the threeyear and six-year seats from the outset- </para>

I offer this illustration against myself: Supposing, after a double dissolution, the present Government parties had 31 members in the Senate, and the Labour party had 29, would honorable senators opposite regard it as a satisfactory allocation if the Government parties were to allocate to themselves all the sixyear vacancies, leaving to the Labour party all the three-year vacancies? Having regard to the readiness which the Labour party has displayed recently to secure its position in this chamber in complete disregard of the will of the electors, one might be pardoned for believing that the Labour party, if it had a majority of two in the Senate might be tempted to allocate to itself all the six-year vacancies, even though its political opponents had a majority in the House of Representatives. </para>

I concede that, under any system of voting, it is possible that the two opposing parties could be returned in equal numbers, but this measure is designed to eliminate the probability of that happening after a double dissolution under the present system of proportional representation. It is proposed that, instead of the Senate itself deciding which Senators shall sit for six years and which shall sit for three years, the public shall decide the matter. </para>

                            <para>- We say that, ultimately, the public will do so. It is provided in the Constitution that the Senate shall make the allocation as between the parties. That means, in effect, that the allocations are made by a vote of the Senate. On the two occasions when such a situation arose, the Senate decided that the six-year terms should go to those who had polled best at the election, the three-year terms going to the others. However, the party in the Senate which had a majority could just as easily have given itself all the six-year terms, leaving its opponents only the three-year terms, and its decision, which would have become the decision of the Senate, would have been quite legal. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that under the system of proportional representation there is a greater possibility of small minorities obtaining representation, hut I do not think the possibility is a great one. The tendency of the electors is to ally themselves with one or other of the two groups representing the Government and the Opposition. As I have said, an undesirable consequence of the present system is that a majority party in the Senate could appropriate to itself all the six-year terms, and leave its opponents with the three-year terms, despite the fact that, although possessing a slender majority in the Senate, it represented a minority party in the House of Representatives. The present proposals are designed to overcome that difficulty. The electors will make the allocation by voting for one set of candidates who seek the three-year term, and another set who seek the six-year term. The hill does not seek to confer any advantage on either the Government or the Opposition, as represented in this chamber at the present time. The problems which would arise if the Opposition and the Government were equally represented in theSenate would present themselves to whatever government was in office, and it is obvious that some solution of the difficulty must be found. The absurdity of the existing situation is such that one can only conclude that, when the system of proportional representation was enacted for the Senate, this particular problem was overlooked. Recently, in this chamber, there has been some criticism of those who drafted a particular measure. Apparently, draftsmen on the other side have overlooked some very important possibilities. </para>

                <para>The endowment of the first child in every family at the rate of 5s. a week is a major part of the policy of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. It is a proposal that the Liberal party advocated during the general election campaigns of 1946 and 1949. I submit that, in those circumstances, the electors have given the Government a mandate to implement it. This measure is of wide national importance. There are 650,000 Australian families already in receipt of child endowment, which is now paid in respect of all children under sixteen years of age except the first child, and if these amendments are accepted it will be paid to another 450,000 families. The Government's proposal to pay child endowment in respect of the first child in every family is in conformity with its policy of endeavouring constantly to improve the standard of living in Australia. The Government believes that families with more than one child should have an income exceeding the amount actually earned by the breadwinners. It is not suggested that a payment of 5s. a week will be sufficient to support a child, but it is considered that it will be an appreciable contribution to that end. I remind the committee that the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> in the policy speech that he delivered on behalf of the present Government parties, said that if, as a result of the operation of this measure, the basic wage was computed upon a new formula - the needs of a man and his wife only - the rate of the endowment would be increased from 5s. to 10s. a week. </para>
                <para>When the bill was previously before the Senate, two amendments moved by the Opposition were made. The first amendment was designed to increase the rate of endowment payable under the bill from 5s. to 10s. a week. The second amendment was in the nature of an instruction to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court not to take that payment into consideration when assessing the basic wage. I do not propose to canvass all the arguments that were advanced when the measure was debated in this chamber on that occasion. It will doubtless be agreed that there is very little that canbe added to what  was  said then. The reply of the Government to the Opposition's proposal that the rate of the endowment should be increased from 5s. to 10s. a week was that it was a strange action by the Opposition, having opposed the payment of the endowment at the rate of 5s. a week, subsequently to seek to double the payment. The view of the Government is that, having submitted to the people a proposal that the endowment should be paid at the rate of 5s. a week, it has a mandate to pay that sum, and no more. Having regard to the rights of beneficiaries under the National Welfare Fund, it believes that, from the viewpoint of financial considerations, it should not at this stage support a proposal that the rate of the endowment should be more than 5s. a week. </para>
                <para>With regard to the direction to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, the reply of the Government, briefly, is that if a payment of 5s. a week would adversely affect the basic wage, the position would be correspondingly worse if the endowment were paid at the rate of 10s. a week. It is the policy of the Government and of the political movements that it represents that, above all, the Commonwealth Arbitration Court should not be fettered or influenced by the government of the day. The legal advice that the Government has received is that the proposed direction to the court would be unconstitutional and might taint the whole measure. </para>
                <para>The Government has given consideration to the amendments that were made to the measure when the bill was before the Senate. Having regard to the policy upon which it fought and won the last general election, and to its financial commitments generally, it has come to the conclusion that it will not accept those amendments. The matter now rests with the Opposition, which has a majority in this chamber. The Government is willing and eager to implement the legislation and to accept the responsibility for having introduced it into the Parliament. It hopes that the Senate will accept the amendments of the House of Representatives. If the Senate does not do so, it must accept the responsibility for denying the Government the right to implement the policy upon which it was elected. </para>

                    <para>. - The two issues lie within a comparatively small compass. The net result of the deliberations of the Senate was that two substantial amendments of the bill were made. The measure has now been returned by the House of Representatives in the form in which it was introduced into this chamber. The amendments moved by the Senate have made no impact upon the mind of the Government. The Opposition believes, rightly or wrongly, that its viewpoint has not received due consideration. We feel very strongly that the Government has not appreciated the strength of the case that we presented, and has not seen the real dangers that lie ahead of it. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>That being our view, we had intended to propose that there should be a conference between representatives of the House of Representatives and of the Senate at which, in the absence of publicity and of the heat that is often generated in discussions in the publicity of this chamber, the issues could be discussed in a calm, deliberate and objective manner, regard being ha;l to the various viewpoints. Having looked at the Standing Orders of the Senate, I find that it is not possible at this stage to request such a conference. It is possible for the Senate to suspend its Standing Orders and take a short cut to the making of a request for a conference, but it would be useless to adopt that procedure unless the members of the Government in the House of Representatives were prepared to move the suspension of the Standing Orders of that chamber to enable a short cut to be taken. If, UPon consideration, the Government decides this evening that it would be advisable to by-pass the procedure laid down in the Standing Orders of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, the Opposition will be happy to co-operate with it, because it believes firmly that if a really dispassionate discussion takes place some solution may be found. If, in the course of this committee debate, the Government does not express its readiness to accept the Opposition's suggestion, then, in order to reach our objective, we shall he under an obligation to disagree with the motion moved by the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> and to remit the bill again to the House of Representatives with a request that it further consider the viewpoint and the amendments that the Senate has made. </para>
                <para>I shall deal briefly with the two issues involved. The first issue is the amount of the endowment. The Opposition's objection is based upon the inadequacy of the provision. We traversed that aspect of the matter at very considerable length in this chamber when it was discussed previously. I now come to a matter of vast importance. I refer to the contention of the Opposition that a direction should be given to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and certain other arbitral tribunals in Australia that child endowment should not be taken into account when the basic wage was being assessed. In short, the mind of the Opposition is that the Parliament, having provided endowment at certain rates for the first child and other children in every family should be able to ensure that the purpose of such grants is neither defeated nor reduced by the action of some body outside of the Parliament. That is the whole case that the Opposition rests upon. It is perfectly clear in the view of the Opposition that the court will decide whether child endowment is or is not to be taken into account. There are several reasons to support that opinion. When the court adjourned, at the time that this matter was an issue on the hustings at the end of last year, it was very clear that the matter of child endowment impinged directly upon the field that the court itself was considering. In other words the court was concerned with the distribution of the national income. In the expressed view of the court, the allocation of child endowment was part of the same problem. There, alone, is a clear pointer that the court will take child endowment into account. It is a most direct likelihood. That is emphasized by the fact that three State governments have already presented submissions in writing to the court, which will oblige it to determine whether child endowment will be taken into account. Furthermore, employers' organizations are also asking the court to take child endowment into account. If there was any doubt in the matter I refer the Senate to what transpired in the court only yesterday in Melbourne. The following are portions of a very extensive report in to-day's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">A ge :  -</inline></para>

            <para class="block">New Unit fob Wage Proposed. </para>
            <para>A new basic wage family-unit formula was proposed to the Arbitration Court yesterday by employers' interests in view of the incidence of child endowment assistance. The proposal was outlined byMr. A. P. Aird, one of the counsel representing employers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Aird</inline> submitted that the change in the family-unit basis was justified by the fact that Parliament had "cushioned" the burden of the family responsibility of wage earners. . . . But he did ask that the basic wage should not be increased in view of the system of child endowment and figures showing the average number of dependants of the wage earner. </para>
            <para class="block">That should convince the Senate that there are already before the court specific applications by State governments and by the employers of Australia for the court to decide whether child endowment shall be taken into account. In the view of the Opposition, it is certain that the court must resolve its mind upon that point. The Government should take particular notice of this aspect of the matter. The Opposition is anxious to ensure that there shall be no industrial unrest in this country. It is as fully concerned about that matter as is the Government. I point out that if the court decides that the endowment of 5s. a week shall be taken into account, the Government and the Minister, because of the undertaking that was given to the people, and which the Minister reiterated in his second-reading speech, will be under an obligation to raise the amount of endowment for the first child in every family under the age of sixteen years to 10s. a week. It is clear that if the court accepts the principle that child endowment is to be taken into account, and the Government subsequently raises the amount payable to 10s. a week, on the first application by an employers' organization the court must reduce the basic wage by 5s. If the Parliament approved of the payment of 5s. a week in respect of the first child in every family under the age of sixteen years, and the court decided that that payment must be taken into account, the Government would be under obligation immediately to increase the payment to 10s. a week. Then, having decided in principle that child endowment is to he taken into account, at that point the court must reduce the basic wage by 5s. </para>

                        <para>- I base my opinion on the fact that in November last, when endowment of the first child was an election issue, the court adjourned the basic wage hearing. Furthermore, several State governments as well as representatives of the employers have requested the court to take child endowment into account: That is one of the issues that the court has been asked to resolve. I do not put it any higher than that. Although I realize that the  Govenwent  does not want to hear the viewpoint of the Opposition, we consider that there is the strongest likelihood of the court considering those issues, passing judgment upon them, and deciding that child endowment will be taken into account. </para>

                        <para>- As the Minister apparently recollects my comment about that aspect of the matter, I shall pass to another point. In proposing that a direction should be given to the court not to take child endowment into account in deciding the basic wage, the Opposition is not relying in any way upon the Commonwealth's power in relation to conciliation and arbitration. If the Opposition rested its case on that power, I should say instantly that the provision would be utterly unconstitutional. We are not even looking at that. I want to make the point completely clear to the Government that in 1946 there was written into the Constitution an entirely new power over child endowment. That power stands unqualified. I refer to the power of the Parliament to provide child endowment. Backing that is the power that has always been in the Constitution, which is the power to do anything incidental to the execution of another power. I pose the position very simply and briefly by saying that surely the power of the Parliament to grant child endowment includes power to legislate to ensure that the endowment is not taken away, defeated, reduced or atrophied in any way by the action of some other body, no matter how august that body may be. Although I could develop a very excellent legal argument on what has already been said at the court, I do not propose to do so. However, I earnestly ask the Government to look at the constitutional basis upon which the Opposition rests this amendment, and to have regard to the dangers that lie ahead of it immediately in the industrial field. I shall make one further observation about the desirability of including a provision that the- court shall be directed not to take away or cut down the grant of child endowment. On behalf of the Opposition I express the legal opinion that the action we desire to have taken would be constitutional. Although I do not believe that it is free from all doubt, I commit myself very strongly to that view. Assuming the Opposition is wrong, and that it would be unconstitutional, I say without possibility of contradiction that the direction to the Commonwealth Court of Con. ciliation and Arbitration could be lifted out by the High Court, without  imparing  any other provision of the child endowment proposals. </para>

                    <para>. - I suppose that it is presumptuous for me to enter upon the field of legal argument, because I am not a lawyer by profession. However, I shall make two observations. The first is that the legal arguments that have been advanced by the Opposition have in fact been given mature consideration by the Government. I assure the Opposition that the legal arguments that it has advanced have been carefully scrutinized and examined by the Government. That is apparent from the remarks of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> by interjection.  His  comments show that he has a complete grasp and understanding of the points that have been raised. My second observation, based on the fact that I have had a reasonable amount of ordinary business experience, is that I have complete confidence in the advice that has been tendered to the Government by its legal advisers. It is unthinkable that the Government could accept the proposal that has been advanced by the Opposition, because it would undermine the very scheme that the Government desires to implement. In truth, there is a complete deadlock. The Government has brought down its proposal and believes that it was put to the Parliament in the best possible way in the interests of the people that it was intended should benefit. Having considered the alternatives suggested by the Opposition, the Government finds itself unable to accept them. That is why the Government is not prepared to enter upon any informal or .private discussions upon this matter. </para>

                <para class="block">Federation may care to advance to the court is the business of that organization. Apparently, that body has 'placed a proposal before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for a basic wage to be determined on the needs of a man, wife and one child. I- suggest that that application is no more relevant to this debate than is the application made by the employees' organization, which, according to my recollection, urged the court to fix the basic wage on the needs of a man, wife and three children. In other words, the employers' and employees' organizations, which are two competing interests, are each endeavouring to persuade the court to make a determination that will best suit their sectional interest. </para>
                <para>However, I think that it is quite clear from the reported remarks of Judge Foster that he realizes the  position,  and that he will hold the scales of justice fairly between the two competing interests. The report also stated that the employers' representatives urged that social services should be taken into account in determining the basic wage. However, the tone of the next paragraph of the report suggests that those representatives were complaining that the judge had indicated that he would not take social services into consideration. It is clear, therefore, that the newspaper reports of the proceedings amount to little more than communiques issued by opposing armies half way through a protracted battle, with each side putting its best foot forward. </para>
                <para>The last point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> was that in certain contingencies the fate of this legislation might cause industrial trouble. My views on that suggestion are quite clear. I believe that this legislation is so popular with the people of Australia, and is wanted so much by them, that the only possibility of the legislation provoking industrial trouble will arise, not from any action taken by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but from the failure of the Senate to pass the legislation. </para>

                <para class="block">Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner).</inline> It is not novel for the Parliament to issue directions to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The jurisdiction of that court is most limited, and is confined to certain enumerated matters. The four main matters concern terms and conditions of employment in industry. All the other matters are reserved to the jurisdiction of the conciliation commissioners. The Parliament has already issued a most specific direction to the court to concern itself with industrial relationships under four heads, and there is a complete prohibition against the court interesting itself in the myriad matters left to the determination of the conciliation commissioners. That is not a new principle, and if time permitted I could demonstrate that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act contains other examples. The reference which I made to the report which appeared in the Melbourne press was not directed to the merits of the claim put forward by the Employers Federation at all. I was merely attempting to make one point, which is that child endowment will undoubtedly be taken into consideration as an issue by the court. I am not concerned with the reaction of the court when it was suggested that it should be taken into consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Since the Minister used the phrase, although in advertently, I must say something about it. A deadlock between the House of Representatives and this chamber does not arise until all the machinery provided by the Constitution for resolving the differences between the two Houses has been utilized. The Standing Orders provide machinery' under which differences between the two chambers may be reconciled and compromised, and the Opposition contends that the importance of child endowment at least deserves an effort to settle the differences between the two chambers on this matter. However, I did not suggest, and I do not suggest now, that discussions between representatives of the two chambers should be on an informal basis. I was referring to the provision for managers of both Houses to be appointed to discuss a serious difference between them. I referred to the fact that the discussions could take place on a more calm and objective level if they were removed from the heat of publicity. The proposition which I put forward did not envisage that a private conference should take place unless the managers of both Houses so agreed. As I understand the position, when the representatives of the two chambers meet in conference they can decide whether or not a record is to be made of their proceedings and whether or not they are to confer in private. Conferences in private naturally tend to objectivity and to frank expression of opinion, and are therefore calculated to resolve differences. At the same time, I do not forecast that such a conference would resolve the present difference between the two Houses. Members of the Opposition in this chamber feel strongly about the matters which prompted them to move the Senate to amend the bill introduced by the Government. I say no more on this aspect of the matter except to point out that the constitutional machinery to resolve deadlocks has not been invoked. </para>

The message of the House of Representatives has been in the hands of the Government ever since, yet the bill was brought before this chamber only this evening for the consideration of these amendments. No proposal was made to the Opposition that it should interrupt other proceedings to enable this matter to be dealt with. I have a shorthand note of the remarks made by the Prime Minister last night, which were broadcast, and the transcript is confirmed by the newspaper reports of the right honorable gentleman's utterances.

                <para class="block">I emphasize that that statement, which was made by the Prime Minister, is entirely incorrect. The bill provides that entitlement to endowment in respect of the first child shall commence from the 19th June. It was never the intention of the Government to make a payment before the 18th July next. No suggestion has hitherto been made by any responsible Minister that payment should commence before that date. "We are all naturally concerned to know who misinformed the Prime Minister, because it is obvious that he must have been misinformed and that he had not read, or did not understand, the provisions of the bill. We feel that the Government should take steps to ascertain who was responsible for the right honorable gentleman making such a misleading pronouncement on an important matter on the eve of the general election in New South Wales. I suspect that the person who misled him hoped to stir up fierce resentment in the breasts of the electors of New South Wales against the Labour party at the thought that they might not receive the first child endow ment payment next Monday. As honorable members are aware, it was never intended that any payment should be made before the third week of July. It is obvious, therefore, that some one connected with the Government has been guilty of most reprehensible conduct. Some one deliberately engineered that pronouncement, and its falsity calls for some explanation. It should at least put the Prime Minister upon inquiry to ascertain who was responsible for him misleading thepeople of New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>. - This bill was thoroughly debated in this chamber on the motion for the second reading and, at the committee stage, the Opposition inserted an amendment aimed at safeguarding the workers of Australia against a possible reduction of their wages as a result of the endowing of the first child. Since the bill left this chamber, we have learned from newspaper reports and from other sources, that the employers have asked the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, which is now hearing an application for an increase of the basic wage, to determine that wage upon the basis of the needs of a man and wife, plus an allowance of81 per cent, for children. There may be no affinity between the Liberal party and the Employers Federation, but there is rather  a  remarkable coincidence to which I shall draw attention. It is generally understood in union circles that, in fixing the last basic wage, the court included the sum of 25s. as an allowance for children. Eighty-one per cent. - the allowance for children now suggested by the Employers Federation - of 25s. is approximately £1, which, subtracted from the present allowance of 25s., leaves approximately 5s., which is the amount that the Government proposes to offer to the people of this country in the form of child endowment for the first child. If the Government persists in its refusal to insert in this bill a safeguard against a reduction of wages, and the court accepts the submission that has been made by the Employers Federation, families will benefit by an additional 5s. a week, but workers generally including widows, basic wage earners, and apprentices will have their wages reduced, although they have been paying regularly into the National Welfare Fund from which, this measure is to be financed. From what the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">('Senator Spooner)</inline> has said to-night, it is becoming plain that' the Government intends to evade its obligations, and even to ignore its election pledge. It may be fulfilling that pledge m words, but it is not doing so in moral principle. The Minister said to-night that if the basic wage was determined on the basis of the needs of a man and wife only, the Government would give consideration to increasing child endowment for the first child from 5s. to 10s. We all know, of course, that even 10s. is hopelessly inadequate to maintain a child. The Parliament has never assumed that child endowment is sufficient to maintain a child. Child endowment must not be confused with wages. If the court accepts the suggested allowance of S3 per cent, for children, the result will not be what the Government promised during the election campaign. The Government will not alter the child endowment payment. Acceptance of the employers' submission would amount to the abrogation of a principle for which workers have fought over many years. All organizations that are concerned with the stability of family life in this country have recommended that, on no account, should social services be permitted to reduce actual earnings. Regardless of the amount paid in social services, every worker should receive a wage comparable with his responsibilities. That principle will be abrogated if the Government's proposal remains unaltered. A payment of 5s. a week is totally inadequate, and as I have said, even that 5s. will be lost if the court is influenced by- the employers' representations. I trust that, even at this late stage, the Government will agree to the reinsertion of the Labour party's amendment. If it is unconstitutional, it can be declared invalid without affecting the remainder of the measure. At least, the intention of the Government will be clear. The Government agrees that the endowment of the first child should not be used as an excuse to reduce wages. After all, the court operates within the ambit of legislation enacted by this Parliament. The court's powers can be extended or restricted by the Parliament. The Opposition's view is that money expended from the National Welfare Fund should not be used as a means of relieving employers of part of their . financial responsibility to their employees. That fund has been accumulated with revenue contributed by taxpayers. The proposition that has been put to the committee to-night by the Minister for Social Services should not be accepted. We should make it quite clear that social services are paid to raise living standards, regardless of the capacity of industry to pay wages. The Government agrees that endowment of the first child should not influence the court in fixing the basic wage, so why not make that intention clear in the bill? As 5s. a week is totally inadequate, the Government should make the payment for the first child the same as that for the second and subsequent children. </para>

                    <para>. - The position that we have now reached should cause us to pause and think, and the responsibility involved should be accepted only after due consideration. T propose to reply to certain points that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> raised. .The relationship of child endowment to the basic wage presents no new problem. Indeed, this measure has revealed no new facet of that problem. In my second-reading speech, I canvassed fully the possible effects on the basic wage of the endowment of the first child. The Government'3 decision was based on the best possible advice, and the Government is content to rely on that advice. I regret that I used the word " deadlock " in my earlier remarks. That word, of course, has a somewhat technical meaning. What I intended to convey was that the debate, both in this chamber and in the House of Representatives had shown that the views of the Government and of the Opposition were so irreconcilable that, in my frank opinion, no conference between committees would yield any solution of the problem. With reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> disclaimer of any responsibility for delay I do not propose to argue the matter further. The situation has reached a much more serious stage than that. This was the first legislation that the present Government introduced into this chamber. It was presented in the confident belief that it would be passed. We did not expect the delay or the defeat that the measure has met at the hands of the Opposition, particularly in view of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> in his AddressinReply speech, said that the Government's child endowment legislation would not be opposed. Therefore, I consider that we have gone beyond talking about delay. We are faced with the much graver situation that the whole scheme is now apparently defeated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> made some point of the fact that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> speaking at the Town Hall, Sydney, last night, had confused the date of commencement of the bill with the date on which the first child endowment payment would be made. My reply to that is that, although I am the responsible Minister, I did not notice the mistake. Therefore, it is hardly likely that the mistake would have any great influence upon the public. </para>

                        <para>- That is a silly thing to say about the Prime Minister. In any case, the important matter now is not when the measure will begin to operate or when the first payment will be made; the real problem that sobers me is that the scheme has been defeated in this chamber. After looking at the matter calmly and dispassionately, the only construction I can place upon the present situation is that, in Australia, child endowment for the first child will not come into operation while the political parties remain at their present strength in each House of the Parliament. </para>

The disagreement has not been lessened in any way. . There are only two issues. The first is that whereas the Government proposes a payment of 5s. a week, the Opposition believes that it should be 10s. a week. The second issue is the possible effect of this measure upon the basic wage. The Opposition made it clear when the bill was at the committee stage, that it would be content with an assurance that the endowment of the first child would not be allowed to interfere with the basic wage. Did I understand the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> to say to-night that, according to the legal advice he had received, the endowment of the first child would not be taken into consideration in computing the basic wage? </para>

                        <para>- I want to be clear. I have previously pointed out the dangers regarding endowment in relation to basic wage. In 1907 the basic wage was based on a unit of five under the Harvester award, but in 1940 it was reduced to three, including a man, his wife and child. On the 20th April, I said in the Senate - </para>

The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> has suggested that this matter should be discussed cooly. I am glad to see that no heat has been raised in the debate to-night. The Minister for Social Services has said that in the interests of industrial peace some protection should be given to the basic wage. I remind Ministers that they are continually appealing to the Opposition and to the industrial unions tq assist them in their struggles. I appreciate the enormity of the task that confronts them, particularly in putting value back into the fi) and increasing production. The Government will not get continuity of production if it interfers with the basic wage as a result of endowment of 5s. for the first child. I say in all sincerity. "Let us have a conference. Let us get around the table and talk." Surely, between ourselves, the Government and the Opposition can arrive at a formula or some guarantee that the basic wage will not be interfered with. The Government will then have the Opposition committed to helping it in its struggle to increase production. It will have the Opposition compelled to assist it because of the cooperation that it has given to the Opposition. This should not be a one-sided affair. I am not seeking any political advantage whatever. </para>

I believe that the Prime Minister has been misled. I do not say that it was done deliberately but it will certainly be a political advantage to the Liberal party in the New South Wales election on Saturday. If the Government is sincere, let us have a conference. Let us get around the table and see if we cannot arive at a solution suitable to the Opposition and to the Government. </para>

                    <para>.- In the past, the questions of child endowment and the basic wage have been interlocked. In 1919 when an attempt was made to increase the basic wage to £3 17s. a week, child endowment was introduced into New South Wales and when an attempt was made to lower the basic wage to keep it in the vicinity of £3 8s. a week against the proposed determination of £3 17s., the workers of New South Wales set up an agitation with a result that the Holman Government was forced to capitulate on the basic wage. The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> said that the employers had submitted their claims to the court with respect to child endowment and I have a copy of the statements made to the court. I shall quote from a statement which was submitted by the Attorney-General for Western Australia on behalf of the Liberal government of that State. It reads, in part - </para>

                        <para>- It would apply generally, but at present the basic wage is an established fact. Is an attempt being made by the governments and the employers of Australia to take away the endowment which the Australian Government proposes to make available to the people? The Australian Government introduced child endowment a little over twenty years ago in relation to its own employees. It did then exactly what I am afraid will happen now. It made its own employees pay the amount of child endowment. Each employee had deducted from his "wages the sum of £11 a year. That was used to pay for child endowment and it did so while that system operated. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue><para>Therefore I am quite specific ' in my attitude on this point. Child endowment comes out of the National Welfare Fund. All people in the community pay into that fund. The pay-roll tax is used for that purpose. By those means the taxpayers of Australia and the workers in general are paying into the National Welfare Fund taxes to meet cost of our social benefits scheme. If the court takes into consideration any amount that is paid as a result of this measure, and the workers lose that sum from the basic wage, they will also be losing money that they have already paid through social services contribution. J think it only right that we should take some steps to try to safeguard the interests of those people. I am not considering the wealthy people. There is no means test in relation to child endowment. All mothers with one child will get the benefit and I want to see them get it as early as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> said to-night that this proposal was submitted to the people, but I venture to say that hardly 100 electors in Australia knew then that an application was being made by the employers of Australia to to the court to reduce the basic wage by an amount equivalent to any increase that might be provided in child endowment. I refer honorable senators to the 1940 judgment, to the statement of Chief Judge Beeby and the statements by Chief Judge Piper and Judge 0'Mara. All honorable senators will recollect the time when those learned gentleman were trying to come to a decision. They wanted to give everybody in Australia a fair go but they found themselves in an awkward position. They wanted Parliament to do something but in the meantime the Australian Government introduced child endowment of 5s. a week for each child after the first child under sixteen. All that honorable senators on the Opposition side have in mind is to try to assist the workers and the people generally to secure the application of the endowment payment so that it will be a benefit to everybody in the community. </para></speech>

                    <para>. - I regret the attitude that the Government is adopting towards this important matter. The Government desires to remove clause 3 from this bill yet. all that that clause does is to make a declaration that endowment is to be regarded as a general social service and is not to affect wages or salaries. I appreciate that the Government is facing certain difficulties in its financial dispositions. I know that, during the last general election campaign, it promised to pay endowment for the first child, which will cost £15,000,000 a year, and that it promised to reduce taxation and increase pensions. It is experiencing some difficulty in its attempts to honour those promises. Therefore, I can understand that the Senate's amendment to increase endowment for the first child from 5s. a week to 10s. has caused the Government some embarrassment. However, honorable senators opposite must understand that, because of the attitude of the employers representatives during the current hearing of the claim for a higher basic wage, the Opposition is determined to press the amendment that endowment of the first child shall not be taken into consideration by the court in assessing the basic wage. We have reason to fear that, in the absence of a specific direction in this legislation, the endowment of the first child may adversely affect the decision of the court so far as the workers are concerned. We know that, when a basic wage claim was before the court some years ago, the Government of the day introduced a child endowment scheme, the effect of which was to reduce the amount which the court ultimately awarded. Now, when another basic wage claim is before the court, the Government has come forward with its proposal to endow the first child. We are familiar with the arguments presented to the court by representatives of the employers on the subject of social services. The court has to decide how much of the pool of wealth created by the application of labour to materials should go to the employer, and how much to the employee. The workers, through their unions, are asking for a larger share, and are also asking for improved amenities. The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> claimed that clause 3 might be deemed by the High Court to be unconstitutional. Well, let the matter go to the test. I have not had a legal training, and am reluctant to enter into legal argument, but I have had some experience in these matters. It was my duty for a number of years to represent the workers before various industrial tribunals in an attempt to obtain improved conditions, and I have picked up some knowledge of industrial law. I cannot believe that it would be unconstitutional for this Parliament to include in legislation a statement that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court should not take child endowment into consideration when assessing the basic wage. The court is no more entitled to consider child endowment than to be influenced by the fact that workers are  entitled under an award to receive sick pay, holiday pay, and unemployment benefits. In my opinion, child endowment is just another social service, for which the employers and the employees contribute to the National Welfare Fund. Why should the basic wage be reduced because employees receive something from that fund ? It is certain that, when the fees of the company directors are being fixed, no consideration is paid to the fact that a director is entitled to draw child endowment, which is payable to the most affluent as well as to the most humble of our citizens. A declaration by this Parliament that child endowment is to be regarded as a social service should not make this legislation unconstitutional. </para>

                <para>The Minister for Social Services referred to the fact that the Opposition Kas a majority in this chamber. Well, there is nothing novel in that situation. In the early days of federation, that happened more than once. In those days, honorable senators retained some  independence  of thought and action, believing that they were elected for the purpose of reviewing legislation. When I first entered the Senate about twelve years ago, the Lyons Government was in office, and the Labour party, which constituted the Opposition in this Senate, was in a minority. The Government introduced a hill dealing with industrial matters, and the Labour minority in this chamber moved certain amendments to it. We were able to make out such a good case for our proposals, that no fewer than four honorable senators who sat on the Government benches voted with the Opposition. ' The amendments were agreed to, and the bill was returned to the House of Representatives, which refused to accept them. When the bill came back to the Senate, those  four  Government senators still believed that the arguments adduced by the Opposition were sufficiently strong to justify their continued support of the amendments, with the result that the government of the day, while it did not accept all the amendments, finally agreed to accept some of them. The Labour party firmly believes that child endowment should be regarded as a social service, and that endowment for the first child should be 10s. a week. There is no reason why the Government should not accept our amendment, or at least agree to a conference between the two Houses of the Parliament. It seems, however, that the Government is more concerned about scoring political points than about reaching an agreement. </para>
                <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in his speech in Sydney last night, accused the Opposition in the Senate of unduly delaying the passage of legislation. Evidently, he was supplied with wrong information. The Government is not using tactics that will secure the speedy passage of this measure. It claims that the people want this endowment. We are not attempting to deny it to them. We have only exercised our rights as an Opposition. The endowment can be paid on the appointed day if the Government will accept the decision of the Senate or agree to a conference of representatives of the two chambers at which the matter could he discussed and the differences between us ascertained and adjusted. It has been suggested that there is not very much between the Opposition and the Government upon this matter. Surely we can resolve our differences by getting together and exploring the possibilities of reaching an agreement. The Government would not lose face if it agreed to a conference. On the contrary, it would demonstrate that it is prepared to endeavour to ensure that legislation shall be placed upon the statute-book in a form acceptable to all parties* I believe that the Minister for Social Services and some other honorable senators opposite have appreciated the point of view advanced by members of the Opposition in relation to this important matter. It may be that there is an obstacle in the way of a conference, but I hope that, after further discussion, the members of the Government will accept the Opposition's proposal and make it possible for this endowment to be paid soon. </para>
                <para>Clause 3 of -the bill that was presented to the House of Representatives should not be dismissed peremptorily as invalid. Every measure that is passed by the Parliament, whether it be of major or minor importance, runs the risk of being  declared unconstitutional. The Parliament does not possess sovereign powers. All measures that it passes are subject to interpretation by the High Court. If we were to adopt the attitude of honorable senators opposite and, as it were, proceed in fear and trembling that what we were about to do might not meet with the approval of the majority of the Justices of the High Court, the work of the Parliament would be stultified. </para>

                    said, in effect, that the Senate was a House of review and that the Government should not be perturbed if it reviewed legislation. That was not a fair statement of the position. .The Government introduced a. measure that provided for the payment of child endowment to the first child in every family at a cost of £15,000,000 a year. By what stretch of the imagination can it be said that the Senate reviewed that legislation when the effect of the amendments it made would be to increase the annual expenditure under the bill from £15,000,000 to £30,000,000? If that was a review of the measure, I hope that no legislation for which I am responsible will be radically altered.

                    <para>. - The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> said that the inclusion in the measure of a clause stating that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court should not take this endowment payment into consideration in the computation of the basic wage might give rise to legal disputation about the validity of the measure and interfere with or delay the hearing of the basic wage case. That was only supposition, as was the statement that the clause might have the effect of upsetting the basic wage itself. There have been occasions when the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court has been questioned, but those disputes have never delayed the proceedings of the court to any degree. The disputes were concerned mainly with how far the court could go under the Constitution. Our desire is that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court shall not take  thi9  endowment payment - whether it be 5s. or 10s. a week - into consideration when assessing the basic wage. I do not propose to traverse the whole of that ground again. Apparently, my puny efforts have had no effect upon the Government or the Minister. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>So far as the rank and file of the Labour movement is concerned, I have  not yet met one member of the movement who did not want 10s. a week rather than 5s. a week. I have mixed with the men who are appearing in the basic wage case on behalf of the trade unions and workers who are subject to awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, but I have not met one of them who does not support the move of the Labour party to divorce from the basic wage the endowment that will .be paid under this measure. That is all that we are trying to do. The Government and the Opposition agree that child endowment should be paid in respect of the first child in every family. We- differ only about the amount of the payment. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, advanced good reasons why it should be 10s. and not 5s. a week. </para>
                <para>The Opposition is of the opinion that it is possible to incorporate in this measure a clause stating that the endowment shall not .be taken into consideration by any arbitration court, State or Commonwealth, in assessing the basic wage. That is all that it amounts to. That is all that we are trying to do. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> has stated that child endowment has never before been considered by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. I point out that between 1941 and the present time the court has not had an opportunity to do so. During that period, it has considered only an interim basic wage application. I have been led to believe that the present application to the court by several State governments, and on behalf of the employers, that child endowment should be taken into consideration, is attributable to what happened in 1941, when the court adjourned the application then before it because statements had been made by members of the government of the day to the effect that child endowment should be considered in assessing the basic wage, and that the Government would probably introduce child endowment payments. At the time Judge Beeby stated that the court had decided to adjourn until the Government had considered fully the subject of child endowment. When the court resumed the hearing, it stated that it considered that the basic wage then being paid was sufficient to provide only for the basic requirements of a man, his wife ami one child - not two children. The court also stated that a distinct hardship would be imposed on a man with a wife and three children to support. The Government then introduced legislation to provide for the endowment of the second and subsequent children. Because on that occasion the court gave way to the Government, the Opposition now asks that the present Government, having regard to what happened in 1941, should direct the court to disregard child endowment when assessing the basic wage. I contend that even if the payment of 10s. a week is made to endow the first child in every family under the age of sixteen years, in the absence of a specific direction to the court to ignore child endowment, thousands of people in this country working under federal awards, as well as workers in the States whose awards are adjusted in accordance with the " C " series index, will not obtain the full benefit of any increase of the basic wage as a result of the application now before the court, although they are fully entitled to an increase. The Minister has clearly stated that if the court should take child endowment into consideration and reduce the unit basis from three to two, the Government would immediately increase the amount payable from 5s. a week to 10s. a week. I point out that if os. a week is paid in respect of endowment of the first child under the age of sixteen years in every family, and the court retains the three-unit basis any increase of the basic wage would be reduced by that amount. Furthermore, the Government would not be obliged to pay 10s. a week because of the retention of the three-unit basis. I submit that although the amount involved would not be large, the increase to 10s. a week would be tremendously valuable to family men in this country. I stress the necessity to incorporate in this measure a provision directing the court not to take child endowment into account when assessing the basic wage. In my opinion; no weight attaches to the question of constitutionality. If the Government accepts that suggestion, thousands of workers will get the benefit of not only the 5s. a week endowment, but also any increase of the basic wage. </para>
                <para class="block">I plead with the Government to consider this matter once more - even more seriously than formerly - so that agreement can he reached. Evidently, my previous effort in this connexion was considered puny, because the Minister appears to be adamant that the Government is not prepared to accept the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition. </para>

                    (New South Wales) [9.56 J. - I support the request of the Opposition that the Government should further consider the amendment that has been moved. Although this matter was well canvassed when the bill was previously before this chamber, I do not consider that sufficient attention was paid to the point that has been stressed this evening by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline>
                    In view of the power that was granted to the Parliament in 1946, a direction should be given to the court to exclude child endowment payments from its considerations when assessing the basic wage. During recent years the Parliament has developed a social services scheme in this country. When Labour was in office it tried to pick up certain groups in our community that were suffering hardship, and endeavoured to alleviate those hardships. The whole matter hinges on the distribution of the national income. As honorable senators are aware, the court considers that, in addition to prescribed wages, certain groups of people should receive marginal rates for skill. Furthermore, within the last few years, the Parliament has made other provisions to benefit various groups of people in the community. I have in mind particularly the payment of sickness benefits. Because in the past workers have suffered hardship when they became ill, and lost time and money as a result, the Government determined that during the period of a worker's illness, he should receive sickness payments. Time and again it has been argued before the court that awards should include provision for workers during periods of sickness. When making a redistribution of the national income, in the opinion of the Opposition, the court will take child endowment payments into account. I am convinced that when the judges are making up their minds on the basic wage application, they will tak". into account any amounts other than wages that the workers receive.

                    <para>- There is evidence to support the opinions of honorable senators on this side of the chamber. However, I want to go a little further and to impress on the Parliament that as we extend the scope of social services benefits for the community the danger is that every extension that we make will be neutralized by the arbitration tribunals making a corresponding reduction in the basic wage. What is the use of the National Parliament deciding how the national income is to be divided amongst the community if it is unable to say to the authorities that determine the basic wage that when they are fixing that wage they shall not take into account social services concessions made to those who are suffering hardships? This is a most important matter. From the evidence that has been placed before us, we believe that the Parliament has the power to make payments to deserving members of the community, and we believe that those families which have only one child should receive endowment. The benefit of that endowment would be entirely set aside if the court reduced the basic wage accordingly. In the last ten years there has been a tremendous advance in the scope of social services, and we believe that by making social services payments we have given the recipients something to which they are entitled. The whole matter of the power of the Parliament to provide social services was referred to the people some years ago, and the people, by their votes at the referendum, authorized the Parliament to provide social services. I cannot understand, therefore, the reason for the Government objecting to the Parliament indicating to the court its view that a certain payment should not be taken into account in determining the basic wage. The Government proposes to make a payment of 5s. a week in respect of lie-first child of every family, and the Opposition, whilst agreeing with the principle, considers that the payment should be increased to 10s. per week. All we desire to do, apart from increasing the payment, is to direct the court not to take  any such payment into account in determining the basic wage. Notwithstanding the view expressedby the Government that the Parliament has not the power to issue such a direction, I believe that it has that power. I cannot understand why we cannot give a clear direction to the proper authorities in this matter in order to assist them to understand the intention of the legislature. I therefore support the appeal made by the Opposition to the Government to restore the bill to the form in which it passed the Senate. </para>

                <para class="block">Senate that by reason of the passage of this bill no problem would confront the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court when it was determining the basic wage. He made that assertion several times, and also quoted the remarks of certain eminent Australians of an earlier generation in support of that contention. However, the fact is, as pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> this evening, that the employers have already made a fresh claim to the court in the basic wage inquiry. The new application was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Aird</inline> on behalf of the employers, and he submitted that the court should alter the basis on which it determines the basic wage because the Parliament is in the process of enacting legislation to cushion the impact on the family of the increased cost of living. It is clear, therefore, that the employers' organization has already taken advantage of the discussions that have occurred in the Parliament on this matter. </para>

                        <para>- The statement just made by the Minister in charge of the bill amounts to an admission that he is not aware of what is already happening in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I believe that the Government has made up its mind on its attitude in this matter for a very definite reason. Last night, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> exploited the introduction of thisbill in an effort to obtain the last ounce of political credit from it.

                <para class="block">Whether the misstatement was made deliberately or not, we shall never know,  but the fact remains that a gross misstatement was made. The Minister for Social Services says that he, as the responsible Minister, will take the blame for the misstatement. I cannot see what blame can possibly be attributable to the Minister. I am sure that he did not prepare the speech. The Prime Minister said that the first payment would have been made on Monday next - the Monday after the State elections. I repeat that the Prime Minister's statement was grossly inaccurate. We are entitled to expect members of this Parliament to observe a certain standard of ethics. Politics is a rough-and-tumble game, and in it we take and give to the best of our ability. </para>

We have asked that a direction be given  to  the Arbitration Court that the introduction of endowment for the first child shall not be taken into account in fixing the basic wage. That was our case at the election in 1946, and again at the last general election. We were certain, from information that we had in our possession, that the basic wage would be affected, and that while the Government would be making a child endowment payment pf 5s., the wages of thousands of workers would be seriously depleted. That waa denied by our political opponents from every election platform, and in the Parliament itself. However, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Aird's</inline> submission, the Labour party's argument over the years that there is a grave possibility of the basic wage being affected by the endowing of the first child, is substantiated. As I have said, there is a two-column article in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on this subject. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; but I challenge any honorable senator to find a similar article in any  Sydney  newspaper. A moment ago the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> spoke in defence of the press. That was one of the few opportunities he has had to do so. He cannot fail to adopt a rather different attitude on the matter to which I am now referring. With an eye to the forthcoming State elections, the Sydney press has refrained from publishing one word of the story that appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> This is an important matter, affecting every wage-earner in the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister made child endowment a political issue at the New South Wales elections by his speech last night, and, of course, if this Melbourne report had been published in the Sydney press, it would have counteracted the Prime Minister's charges. It is a complete denial of the unfortunate stand that the right honorable gentleman has taken; but can we find one word of it in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> or the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph?</inline> I have searched the Sydney press and have failed to find any reference to the matter. Clearly the story has been suppressed because the newspapers are supporting the Prime Minister in the State election campaign. They know that every vote will count on Saturday next. Whether their methods are honorable or dishonorable does not matter to them. This is an example of the depth to which the newspapers will sink to sway a few votes at election time. Since this Government has been in power, it has played the political game to the " nth " degree. It played the political game with petrol rationing. It abolished petrol rationing immediately before certain by-elections in New South Wales. That action was taken not on any new information that had come to hand, but on information that had been in the Government's possession for six weeks. On that information, the Government could have abolished petrol rationing nearly two months earlier, but it chose to make the announcement four days before the New South Wales by-elections. The announcement was made at that time solely for it's political value. We have also fresh in mind the circumstances in which the legislation with which we dealt earlier to-day was introduced into the Parliament. Is there no limit to the depth to which this Government will sink for political advantage? The  situa-s  tion to-day should worry all honorable 1 senators, but apparently it does not. The political game has been played lower in this Senate in the last six months than I have ever seen it played before. The  Opposition  could advance a prima facie case to show that the court does take into consideration legislation that is passed by this Parliament. The least that the Government could do was to accept the Opposition's proposal to give a direction to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court that wages should be protected when endowment for the first child was introduced. That is not an unreasonable request. All the facts and figures given by the Minister in his second-reading speech to show that the Arbitration Court would not take into account child endowment for the first child in assessing the basic wage has been swept aside by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Aird's</inline> application to the court. A new situation now confronts us. It has arisen from the deliberations of this chamber, and I submit that the Government should make certain that the standard of the basic wage shall be maintained. </para>

                    <para>. - I believe that any organization that claims to be a great political party should have the courage to accept political responsibility for its actions. My accusation against the Opposition is -that on the eve of the New South Wales elections, it has not the courage to vote on this legislation. The bill has now been before the Senate for two and a half hours, and Opposition speakers have repeated <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline> the same old story. What is the Opposition's criticism? It is that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> speaking at the Town Hall, Sydney, last night, said that thi3 scheme was originally intended to come into operation " on " the 19th June, instead of "from" the 19th June. A political party that is prepared to hang its hat on such criticism has reached the lowest possible level. The Opposition's second argument is that a new system has been evolved in Melbourne overnight for computing the basic wage. No more fantastic argument was ever placed before an intelligent body. What actually happened at the basic wage hearing was that one junior counsel advocated a particular method of assessing the basic wage. The newspaper report shows clearly that whether that submission was right or wrong, it was summarily rejected by the judge. I can only say that if we on this side of the chamber ever had the audacity to " stall " for two and a half hours to avoid the necessity to express our political convictions at a vote, we should at least, have advanced a better argument than the committee has heard from honorable senators opposite to-night. The newspaper report to which reference has been made stated - </para>

                        <para>. - I draw the attention of the Government to the serious position that has arisen regarding the price of meat in Adelaide. The. Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> was correct when he said recently in a reply to a question that I put to him that the Commonwealth Government had very little power in this matter. He said that the Government would be prepared to co-operate with the State Government if it were asked to do so. It is easy  to  find the real reason why the Commonwealth Government is devoid of power to take action to protect the consumers. With the press of the country, the Liberal party was responsible' for the defeat of the prices referendum. In Adelaide this week chops were 3s. per lb. Sheep were sold in the Adelaide market for ?9 9s. 6d. a head and the general community and the small butchers are suffering as a result of these high levels. I know that the Federal Government has little power in this matter, but I ask it to take whatever steps it can to assist the State Government to overcome this problem. Many pastoraliats, as wellas householders and businessmen, are wondering just where it will end. In all sincerity I refer the question  to  the Government. </para>
