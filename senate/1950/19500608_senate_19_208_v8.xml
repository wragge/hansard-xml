                        <para>- I do not think that I said yesterday that Russia owes this country over £8,000,000. My recollection is that that sum represents the balance of payments due by Russia in a particular year. I do not know what the present balance is. I think that there must be an adjustment by a running series of transactions. I shall make inquiries about the matter and furnish the honorable senator with the information he seeks in due course. </para>

                        <para>- In the course of the reply to a question that I asked on the 17th May concerning the provision of  more adequate facilities for persons in country districts, and at the General Post Office, Melbourne, who desire to utilize the telephone system to make long-distance trunk calls, the Postmaster-General furnished quite a lot of information concerning the programme of the department, for which I am -grateful. However, I should like some more specific information about the erection of shelters at country post offices and the provision of adequate and more suitable accommodation at the General Post Office, Melbourne, for persons who have to wait while trunk calls are being connected. Can the Minister representing the Postmaster-General say whether there is any possibility of such facilities being provided in the near future ? </para>

                        <para>- I preface a question to the Leader of the Government by pointing out that we have been  given to understand that within the next two or three weeks the Parliament will rise until September. The information that has come to me from various trade unions in Melbourne indicates that there is a great deal of unrest amongst trade unionists because of the steep rise of prices that has occurred in Melbourne and throughout Victoria generally. In the circumstances, will the Minister say whether the Government will consider convening a conference of State Premiers or other authorities for the purpose of taking determined action to check the steep rise of the cost of living and restore the value of the £1, and so bring about some measure of contentment amongst the trade unions? I point out that if such action is not taken during the long parliamentary recess it appears inevitable that serious industrial trouble will occur throughout Australia. </para>

                        <para>- In explanation of a question that I wish to ask the Minister for Social Services, I point out that applicants for workers' compensation whose claims are subsequently rejected sometimes find themselves ineligible for the sickness and unemployment benefit. The position is that an injured worker applies for compensation under Commonwealth or State workers' compensation legislation. Ultimately, due, perhaps, to a finding of contributory negligence, or for some other reason, his claim is disallowed. The injured worker then finds that the time within which he must apply for the sickness and unemployment .benefits has expired. I understand that the Director-general of Social Services has certain statutory powers under which adjustments can be made in such cases. I ask the Minister for Social Services whether he will give consideration to accepting the date of a claim for workers' compensation under State or Commonwealth legislation, as the date of eligibility for sickness and unemployment benefit in the event of the rejection of the claim for workers' compensation? I believe that such a provision would only be fair in view of the fact that an injured person whose claim for compensation is rejected would have received the sickness and unemployment benefit from the first day of his incapacity had he applied for the benefit within the specified period. </para>

                        <para>- I have not heard of the difficulty mentioned by the honorable senator. Quite frequently the department gives the benefit, and subsequently the worker gets compensation and the department has to recover the amount of the benefit from the compensation that had been awarded'. No case in which the benefit has been denied because of confusion on the part of the worker as to whether his rights are for compensation or unemployment or sickness benefit has come to my notice. That fact indicates that there is a discretionary power within the department and that when the difficulty arises it is adjusted in some way or other. Although I have not heard of instances in which a case has been prejudiced, I think there is a lot of merit in the suggestion that the application for compensation should be accepted as an application for sickness benefits. I will ask officers of my department to inquire into the matter and give me a report, so that I can ascertain if an amendment to the act would be justified. </para>

Now that dollars are no longer the predominant factor governing petrol supplies, will the Minister consider abolishing the quota system? </para>

                    <para>In the course of this debate some honorable senators opposite made distorted statements and statements that were not based upon the truth. The Government, in an endeavour to create a state of hysteria, has told the people that we are on the verge of war. Certain persons in this country have been referred to as the agents of Russia. I point out to the Senate that many prominent men in the United States of America have stated that if the cold war were to end soon, the American economy would be in a very bad condition. It is the cold war that is maintaining the buoyancy of the American economy to-day. America is selling armaments to other nations. It occupies the position that was formerly occupied by Germany, which sold armaments to other nations in order to keep its own people employed. I have a table showing the percentages of national revenue expended by various countries upon their armed forces and upon social services and education. It is as follows :  - </para>

The table is printed in the <inline font-style="italic">Peace J ournal.</inline> The figures that I have quoted prove that there is no foundation for the statements made by honorable senators opposite that Russia desires war. The Government realizes that, if it can create a condition of hysteria in this country, it can persuade the people that Russia does want war. History is now repeating itself. The conditions that prevailed in this country  in 1917 are similar to those that prevail to-day. In that year, the newspapers and ignorant and unscrupulous members of Parliament made distorted statements in order to create a condition of hysteria in Australia. In 1917, a railway strike occurred in New South "Wales. It was caused by bad working conditions and the attempt of the tory government then in power in that State to introduce the Taylor card system, which was designed to enable employers to make their employees work much faster. If any honorable senator wishes to inform himself about the system, he should read Upton Sinclair's book, <inline font-style="italic">2'he Jungle.</inline> At that time there was hardly a man in industry over 40 years of age. Men became nervous wrecks and broke down. One man asked, " Where are the old men ? ", and he was told, " We have not got any ; they are in the cemetery ". The tory government that was in power in New South Wales in 1917 wished to introduce that system into this country. As a preliminary, it endeavoured to create among the people a condition of hysteria similar to that which this Government has endeavoured to create. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Fuller, the Acting Premier of New South Wales at that time, published the following statement : - </para>

                    <para class="block">Those are the unions that are supported by members of the Liberal party - company unions, organized by the employers. In 1917, the employers told the workers that if they returned to work they would be allowed to join those unions and would be protected. In order to entice workers into those unions at that time, " scabs " were granted a 44-hour week, whilst genuine trade unionists had to work for 48 hours a week. The genuine trade unionists declared that they could not be broken in that way. They fought on, and eventually they won. To-day, this Government, in an endeavour to discredit certain people, is indulging in propaganda similar to that which was disseminated in 1917. </para>
                    <para>Thi3 bill stinks in the nostrils of all decent-minded people. It is not aimed at the Communist party. The Communist party is being used as a smoke-screen. It is unpopular, and those in power are taking advantage of its unpopularity to create a condition of hysteria and to hide from the trade unions and the people of this country generally the real objective of this bill. The measure is designed to enable the Government to repay to the monopoly capitalists the money that they subscribed to the election campaign funds of the present Government parties. The Government intends, by this bill, to curb the activities of four or five trade unions. The first trade union that it proposes to attack under this measure is the miners' federation. In the past, mine-owners, in their efforts to obtain coal as cheaply as possible, operated their mines in an inefficient manner, and in fact in a dangerous manner. To-day, our coal mines are in a very dangerous condition. The coal-owners have installed mining machines. They have told us that they are going to win by machinery 70,000,000 tons of coal by removing the pillars that are holding up the roofs. On the other hand, the leaders of the miners' federation have stated that the miners will not work the machines in dangerous places. The owners are trying to force the miners to use the machines irrespective of the danger involved. They are more concerned with the earning of profits than with the safety of the lives of the miners. </para>

                            <para>- It is absolutely true. Although Communists are in the minority on the executive of the federal council of the miners' federation, the Government is using the fact that Communists are in those positions at all to discipline the federation. The first Communist that the Government will attack in that organization may be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Idris</inline> Williams, its  president,  who lost a leg and an eye in World War I. He was congratulated by the government of the day during World War II. for assisting it to get coal. That federation will be attacked at an early stage because it is known on very good authority that a return will have to be provided for big business that contributed substantially to the campaign funds of the Liberal party last year. </para>

Whence come those funds? Not, to any appreciable extent, from the small annual subscriptions of members of political leagues. They come from wealthy men whose wealth will be increased if certain policies are adopted, and diminished if certain other policies are pursued. " Business is business." Is it feasible that business men put money into campaign funds at the promptings of unbusinesslike motives? </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I know the " reds " and the " yellows " as well. That organization contains Communists, Liberal party supporters, Country party supporters, socialists, and supporters of the Labour party. It is not concerned with their political opinions, provided that they comply with the rules of the organization. It does not discriminate in any way. I know the Communists in the organization because they have revealed themselves. Although the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has stated that the Communists have been responsible for holding up shipping, I point out that a member of the Australian Shipping Board has stated that 70 per cent, of the delay in the turnround of ships has been due to importers using the wharfs for storage purposes for many years. In Hobart the transport workers work an 8-hour shift. Frequently when the waterside workers, who work two shifts, finish at 11 o'clock at night, the whole of the storage space on the wharfs is full. The waterside workers are blamed for delays, although the real cause of the trouble is that the warehouse men are using the wharf facilities as cheap storage space. We must face the situation that has developed. </para>

                            <para>- Warehousemen are to blame because they have been too mean to provide their own storage facilities, and have been using the wharfs for that purpose. I did not say a word against the transport men, who only work one shift. The next body to be attacked by the Government will be the Seamen's Union, although there are only a couple of Communists in the leading positions in that union. If some honorable senators who support the Government could see how councils of unions conduct their meetings, they would realize that there is far more intelligence displayed there than on the Government side of this chamber. They are realists who handle the bread and butter questions that arise in the unions. Then the Government will attack the railway men. T know something about the railwaymen because I have been connected with their union for many years, and I have also been a member of the federal council of their organization. There are only four Communists on that council, and all the ether members belong to the Australian labour party. I regard the provisions of this bill as an insult because it will enable the Government to control my union, and te dictate to me. I am not prepared to support any proposal of the "Government unless it is reasonable. I also point out that my colleagues on the federal council of the  railwaymen's  organization, many of whom are far more capable than I am, will also be subject to dictation by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- Eighteen. We have been told that any person who preaches the doctrines of Marx or Lenin will be liable to be " declared " under the legislation. I was sitting in the House of Representatives when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> delivered his secondreading speech on this bill, and I took particular notice of his remark that a senator could be declared. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> interjected and warned the right honorable gentleman that he was on dangerous ground. The Prime Minister immediately said that he did not make threats unless he was prepared to carry them out and he then made another very pointed remark. At the time I wondered against what member of the Opposition in this chamber the Prime Minister's remark was directed. I naturally thought of my old friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ward,</inline> who upbraids the Liberal party constantly, and 1 thought that the Prime Minister's wrath must have been directed at him. However, I discovered eventually that the Prime Minister probably had me in mind when he made his very threatening remark. I remind the right honorable gentleman and honorable senators generally that I have never written a book about Marx or Lenin. For their benefit, 1 shall read a passage from an address delivered by an honorable senator opposite, at the third summer school of the Australian Institute of Political Science in 1935, in which the following statement appears : - </para>

                        <para>Statements upon this bill have been made which not unfairly could be well described as maudlin rubbish. In opposing provisions of the bill it has been said that repressive measures have never suppressed an idea and the survival of Irish nationalism has been quoted as an example. I reply that throughout their centuries of struggle the Irish people were sustained by their devotion to their faith and their love of country. The Communist wreckers, against whom this bill is aimed, deny their God and are traitors to their country. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Irish were fighting not for their faith, but for their bread and butter. It was said that the Catholics were fighting the Protestants, which was an absolute lie. The fact is that the Catholics and the Protestants combined to fight the exploiters in England, who were grinding them into the dust. In fact, the Catholics and Protestants raised arms against their exploiters. The following passage from a book, <inline font-style="italic">Ireland's Own,</inline> written by one, Jackson, sets out the position very clearly :  - </para>

                        <para>The first, which made all assemblies of deletes illegal, was designed to prevent the United Irishmen and the progressive Catholics from developing a political party by organizing the newly emancipated Catholic utters. The second, by prohibiting the importation, manufacture and sale of arms and gunpowder, was designed to cripple in advance any attempt at insurrection. The third was designed to provide a counter-revolutionary force with which to suppress any movement by the volunteers or similar bodies. In this way all further advance by the United Irishmen was tobe barred. </para>

                    <para>The Catholics were debarred from organizing resistance to their exploiters. They laid down their arms, but they handed them to the Protestants, and collected money for the Protestants to carry on the struggle. Cole, Emmett and Parnell were all Protestants. The fight was not a religious one at all, but a struggle for bread and butter. We all know the result of the Irish rebellion, which paved the way for the eventual overthrow of England's capitalistic control of Ireland. Movements are occurring throughout the capitalistic world to-day because the members of those movements must resist the rule of minority monopoly capitalists. </para>
                    <para>In order to refresh the memory of honorable senators concerning the history of oppressive legislation, I propose to mention the fate of such legislation in a number of countries in which it has been introduced. Oppressive legislation certainly did not achieve its purpose in Ireland, which finally overthrew the yoke of English landlordism. Oppressive legislation in Russia led to the Mensheviks, under the leadership of Kerensky, seizing power. However, Kerensky found after a few months that he could not carry on the government of Russia, and the Bolsheviks stepped in and assumed control. Incidentally, the word " bolshevik " means majority, and the word "menshevik" means minority; so what happened was that the majority took the control of Russia out of the hands of a minority. What happened to the Czar, who had introduced the oppressive legislation which led to the overthrow of the system which had existed in Russiaforso long? He was shot. In modern times, Greece was the first country to come under fascist control. That occurred when General Metaxas set himself up in Greece as a dictator. The Greeks revolted, but they did not obtain their political freedom until during the recent war, when they were able to demonstrate their loyalty to their country by assisting the Allies. After the war it was decided to hold an election in Greece. As the result of that election a popular, progressive government was elected by the people. Greece had borrowed money  from the money lenders of England, and they were paying interest of 16 per cent on that money. The first action of the new popular government was to reduce the interest rate to 5 per cent. The great Churchill intervened, and put a general in charge of Greece, in place of the popularly elected government, and the country is now being ruled by a dictatorship. England has spent £200,000,000 fighting democracy. The United States of America has now taken up the cudgels for capitalism, because English capitalist? could no longer afford to govern Greece. What has happened in Germany? Hitler, as we all know, introduced legislation that was very similar to this bill. First he attacked the Communists, thenhe turned his attention to the social democrats, and then to the trade unions. He burst asunder the Labour movement in Germany. He put fascist officials into the trade unions. The wording of Hitler's proclamation of the 20th May, 1933, was almost identical with the wording of this bill. It stated - </para>

                            <para>- I am appealing to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President,</inline> to maintain order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is pursuing here the tactics that members of his profession resort to in the courts. They adopt an arrogant attitude, and browbeat some poor defenceless witness into saying something that he does not mean. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is the most arrogant and probably the most ignorant of all the members of his profession that I have met. I repeat that the wording of this bill is almost identical with that of Hitler's proclamations against the Communists and the Social Democrats. I say " it can happen here ", and it will happen here if the workers of  this  country do not awaken to the danger and rise in protest., It happened in Germany in spite of the fact that 6,000,000 Communists voted at the elections in that country. The aim of this Government is to draw the teeth of the strong trade unions and so to prevent them from using their industrial strength. Then the Labour party itself will be attacked. We shall be accused of having preached the doctrines of Marx and Lenin, because whether wo like it or not, our objective is based on the Marxist doctrine. We shall be told that there is no difference between the Labour party and the Communist party. In fact, we have already been told that. The anti-Labour parties are after our scalps. They have made the terms of this bill so wide that the Government will be able to rope in any person that it seeks to suppress. The bill is wide enough to bring even university lecturers within its provisions. A person could bc declared for advocating the use of electricity simply because Marx advocated the use of electricity. Similarly any man who advocated free education, or the nationalization of banking, could be classed as subversive. We are told that the committee that will be constituted to screen suspected Communists will consist of honest men. We do not doubt that, but let us look at the basis upon which the screening will be  carried out. The committee will be asked to determine whether such and such an individual or organization has propagated the philosophy of Marx and Lenin. No matter how honest the members of the committee may be, they may be compelled to admit that the person or organization concerned did in fact propagate that philosophy, and therefore came within the wide provisions of this measure. I repeat that the bill is designed to draw the teeth of the militant industrial organizations of this country. Why is that to be done? It is to be done because the Government knows that another depression is coming. Prices are rising still further and the standard of living is falling. The Government fears that should that happen, the trade union? would rise. The aim of this bill is to prevent such a rising because it would deprive the monopoly capitalists of some of their profits. The Government parties are financed by the monopoly capitalists ;  they  have to be paid back because  business1:  business. </para>

What happened ? The minority was not satisfied. It revolted with the aid of the Germans, the Italians and the Moors, who were traditional haters o.' Roman Catholics. With the aid of wellarmed outsiders the minority was able to defeat the Spanish workers, who wc.v armed mostly with picks and shovels ami a few rifles. Ultimately a fascist dictatorship assumed control and still controls Spain. It is expending 62 per cent, of its national budget income on armaments to keep the people of Spain down. Mussolini, at the behest of a minority, overthrew the Italian Government nml became dictator of Italy. But  what  happened to him ? Mussolini was hanged in an undignified manner alongside Iks mistress and is no more. The same thing happened in Japan, where Tojo was hanged. What happened to Chiang Kaishek who, according to the American people, was head of the most corrupt organization in the world? The peo; le rose and drove him out, and now he is jumping from island to i.«land seeking to escape. I would not like to be in his shoes. I am endeavouring to show honorable senators that minorities rule. Under capitalism the majority does not rule. Australia is claimed to have a democracy, but there is little democracy here. When the previous Government went to the people and got a mandate and put it* legislation into operation, it was challenged in the High Court and the legislation was disallowed by five men. In that case a minority of five could say whether a semi-democracy should work in Australia or not. </para>

                        <para>- I thank honorable senators for the concession that they have granted to me. I was pointing out that majorities were being ruled all the time by minorities. The working people form the majority in the world, but there are always some capitalist constitutions to retard the majority from ruling. Consequently, the working people are revolting throughout the world. It is not seen clearly here because we are living in comparative comfort and conditions are much better than theyare elsewhere, 'but the revolution is coming down through Burma, French Indo-China and Indonesia. Australia is sitting on a keg of powder and does not know it. In French Indo-China, the majority overthrew the dictator government and put a new government in. Now France and other countries are sending troops there to overthrow the majority government that was elected. In Malaya the people are revolting against conditions. </para>

                        <para>- The capitalists of this country and of England made them Communists. Australians have invested £32,000,000 of capital to exploit the people in Malaya. Can they be blamed for revolting? The Atlantic Charter provides that small nations shall have the right to govern themselves, but Malaya is denied that right. For instance, the Legislative Council which sits in Singapore is not elected wholly by the people. Sixteen of its members are appointed by the British Governor, and the remaining six are elected by British citizens only. All political parties in Malaya opposed the constitution. At the last poll for the choosing of the six elected members of the council, only 20,000 voted out of a total of 220,000, who were eligible to vote. In Malaya minority rule is enforced, not by economic pressure alone, but by guns as well. Yet the Australian Government is foolishly sending men and equipment to take part in the disturbances in Malaya, although its action may well involve Australia in war. </para>

                        <para>- I am not making a " Commo " oration. This bill does not propose to touch an organization in Sydney that is one of the most dangerous in Australia. It is known as  Tatler Theatrettes  Proprietary Limited, and is patterned on the New Guard. Its headquarters are at S4 Pitt-street, Sydney. The organization recruits members, and trains them in rifle practice on the property of one of the " big-wigs " outside Sydney. It bought up all the .303 rifles it could get. Why should an organization of that kind be engaged in arming and training men in Australia? There is noi, one word about it in thi; '.ill. Unfortunately, the organisation i? using exservicemen for its purposes. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour Government was never responsible for repressive legislation such as that which is now before the Senate. If any organization should be dealt with under this legislation it is the one to which T have been referring. I have before me the articles of association of the organization, which has been registered as .a company. The nominal capital is £2,000 in £1 shares, of which Frederick B. Hinton holds one share. In order to show the deceit of those responsible for forming the company, I point out that, according to the articles of association, the company was formed -  . . to buy, hire, distribute films - educational, scientific etc. mid newsreels. To acquire and operate a broadcasting and television company. To indent, export and mann  facture  pianos, organs, radio and television sets. Buy original and copyrights of songs. Acquire, sell or develop property. </para>

                    <para class="block">Of course, the company does not operate in accordance with the terms of the article? It has no telephone at its premises, because it does not want business. Those who control the organization are misleading the people by pretending that it is a legitimate trading company, when, in fact, it is a fascist organization, engaged in training men in the use of arms for use in any disturbance. Up to the 10th November, 1944. only 1,200 shares had been taken up of the total issue of 2,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Hinton</inline> also holds one share. </para>

                            <para>- What I have been quoting was taken from the articles of association, which were obtained from the office of the Registrar-General in New South Wales. I do not use quotations that cannot be substantiated. I have no use for filthy newspaper propaganda. As I have said, this company was patterned on the New Guard, and we know that the New Guard was formed to attack the working people, particularly their leaders. Now a similar organization has been formed. What are we going to do about it? The  Minister  for Trade and Customs when introducing this bill, made a sen time .:ral appeal to the feelings of the people by referring to religion. Always, when the people whom he represents find themselves in difficulties, they profess to become sentimental, and talk about religion. They use religion as a cloak to conceal their real purpose. Religion is a private matter, and every person is entitled to his own religious beliefs. I would never discuss religion with any one, because religion is sacred to each individual person. The Minister for Trade and Customs said that communism began where atheism began. That is not true. </para>

                            <para>- There is no communism in the world to-day, except a primitive form of communism among the aborigines in Australia, these poor people whom we have driven into the desert to starve. Among them -there is no right of private property. Everything belongs to the community. If a shirt is given to one  blackfellow  to-day, it may be worn bv any one to-morrow. Honorable senators opposite do not understand history or political economy. They scoff, but they are really scoffing in their ignorance. We have been told that the practice of religion is forbidden in Russia. I have here a publication called <inline font-style="italic">An American Churchman in the Soviet Union,</inline> written by the Reverend Louie D. Newton. The book contains a photograph of the congregation of the Moscow Baptist Church listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Newton</inline> delivering a sermon.  There is as much religion in Russia as there is in other countries. In fact, 17 per cent, of the Russians attend church, whereas only 12 per cent, of our people do so. There is more religion practised in Russia than there is in this country, yet Government supporters have raised the religious bogy because they know that religion touches the people of this country on a soft spot. The Minister for Trade and Customs said that the Irish rebels fought for their faith. They fought for their bread and butter. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately &gt; lie knows nothing of the historical background of communism. The seeds of com1munism were sown 600 years before Christ, when electricity was discovered, and the germ of capitalism was planted 300 years before Christ, when steam power was discovered. Approximately 300 years before Christ, Hero of Alexandria devised a machine, the  aeolipile,  consisting of a little hollow ball. The ball was filled with water and a fire was lit underneath it. Steam then emerged from four jets, and drove the ball round. It was a form of jet propulsion. Those discoveries lay dormant for a considerable time. Then men discovered that they could harness steam. The harnes sing of steam caused the industrial revolution in England because it revolutionized production. Men were taken from the fields to be employed in factories. As in every other age, when the industrial revolution occurred the people of England became victims of their environment. Marx has said that the age of electricity is the age of socialism. Electricity lay dormant until approximately the sixteenth century, when Queen Elizabeth's physician began to investigate its nature. It was not used until approximately the nineteenth century. Electricity is now doing work much more effectively and efficiently than does steam, consequently another revolution is in progress. Electricity is changing the whole outlook of mankind. Marx was right when he said - </para>

                        <para>The irony of world history turns everything upside down. We, the "revolutionists", the " rebels " - we arc thriving far better on legal methods than on illegal methods, and revolt. The parties of order as they call themselves, are perishing under the legal conditions created by themselves. They cry despairingly with  Odilon Barrot  . . . legality is the death of us; whereas we under this legality, got firm muscles and rosy cheeks and look like life eternal. And if we are not  so  crazy as to let ourselves bo driven to street fighting in order to please them, then in the end there is nothing left for them to do but themselves break through this legality so fatal to them. </para>

I say it is a dangerous measure, and that if its administration is in the hands of some members of the present Government parties we shall be the victims of oppression. A Communist is defined as " a person who supports or advocates the objectives, policies, teachings, principles or practices of communism, as expounded by Marx and Lenin ". Any person who has read Marx knows that Marx did not lay down a programme for communism. All that Marx did was to analyse the capitalist system. The bill is based on false premises. The definition of Communist is so wide that the five honest men who will form the committee that the Government proposes to establish could, without any difficulty at all, declare any person to be a Communist if they acted upon that definition. </para>

However, if this legislation becomes law it will be the forerunner of further repressive measures. In order that it shall be obeyed, further repressive legislation will be required and there will be no turning back. It can and will happen here unless we nip this legislation in the bud. If it, goes on and on we will finish up with a police state and concentration camps. Surely we do not want our country blighted in that way. Unfortunately a lot of peopledo not realize that that is so,because they have not studied the political situations in other parts of the world. Consequently they have only a one-sided view in relation to the future. We on the Opposition side of the chamber study the past in order to try to assess what may happen in the future. It has already happened elsewhere because legislation was introduced along the lines of this legislation. In the interests of this country we should not pass this measure. </para>

                        <para>. -  It is not my desire to speak for any length of time on the bill before the Senate. It is an important and very necessary piece of legislation. Therefore it demands urgency. I feel that I should not let this opportunity pass without declaring where I stand.  I  support the bill because I believe that the legislation is needed to return the people of this country to the Australian way of life as we once knew it and would like it again. A definite stand should be taken before the situation becomes any worse. A majority of the people of Australia to-day, including people of various political beliefs, accept the assurances that were given to the electors on the hustings by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the Treasurer (Mr.Fadden), that if the anti-Labour parties were returned to office they would ban the Communist party in Australia. When one has an enemy to contend with I believe that the best form of defence is attack. We know that this menace is to-day world-wide. In Australia we have the foe without as well as the foe within. This legislation will deal with the foe within. As far as the foe within is concerned we havethose practising Communists who are underground working secretly, and those who are well known to us all, and therefore are above ground. I do not consider that when this legislation is passed there will be many more underground than there are to-day. I hope that our security service will be strong enough to bring to light those now working undeground. I believe that it will. "Under this legislation we will be able to control all those who seek to disrupt the smooth working of industry and throw this country into chaos. I hope many of those who to-day are playing with Communistic doctrines will realize that they areplaying with dynamite, and will become honest citizens and follow the Australian way of life. By so doing they will find that life will be happier and healthier for them and their . families. We have been shown plainly that among the objectives of the Communist organization is the overthrow of democratic government. The Communists are attempting to do this by causing chaos, and eventually attempts would be made to undermine our social structure, abolish our present economic system, destroy our democratic form of government, and establish in its place a dictatorship. Believing these things to be facts we realize that we have not now in Australia adequate laws to safeguard ourselves against this menace. I further believe that the action we are taking in bringing in this legislation will be followed by other free countries in the world who also see the dangers that lie ahead. There appears to be a mistaken impression that if we outlaw the Communist organization we will thereby endanger the liberties and civil rights of innocent people. I do not think that that would happen. I point out that he who never makes a mistake is one who never tries to do anything. It is better to make an honest mistake in an attempt to achieve something worth while than to let the Communist party go on dictating its policy - as it has been in Australia - and holding up transport and production whenever its members feel like so doing. In common with honorable senators on both sides of the chamber, I have the utmost regard for the trade union movement and those connected with the trade unions who are not under Communist domination. Honorable senators opposite have stated that this bill has been introduced to cripple the trade union movement. Surely they do not think for a moment that this Government would commit political suicide, which is precisely what it would be doing if much of what some honorable senators opposite have said was true. The final say in relation to all legislation rests with the electors of Australia. If the Government passes legislation with which the majority of the people disagree, within a very short period of time the electors will be able to register their  disagreement by means of the ballot-box. The former Government found that to be true on the 10th December, 1949. In time the people will say whether they approve of this bill and other legislation that has been brought forward by the present Government. They will do it through the ballot-box. I have no doubt about the outcome, just as I have no doubt about what the result would be if there was a double dissolution. Eather than see the present tactics employed again, I would welcome a double dissolution in order to enable the people of Australia again to give their answer, which would then be reflected in the Senate as well as in the House of Representatives. In as many words the Opposition has told the Government to mind its own business, to leave the trade unions alone, and to leave it to the members of the trade unions to do their own job. </para>

                    <para>My experience in life has been that people are fortunate to be offered help in difficult jobs that may prove too much for them. I should have thought that the trade unions would welcome help in any shape or form to rid themselves of these subversive people in their midst. 1. know many individual unionists who feel that way about the matter. I admit that many unionists have got the control of their unions into safe hands after a long time. The job has not been completed because a number of trade unions are still under the control of the Communist party. If left to the unions alone I feel that this would be a lengthy job. I consider that many unions would welcome the help of this legislation. I have been amazed by the remarks of honorable senators opposite in relation to the amendments that have been already incorporated in ' this bill, and those still to be dealt with. Does not this prove that the supporters of the Government are reasonable men? Have not these amendments been brought about by discussions that have taken place in the Senate and in another place? Is not this just how the Parliament should function? Honorable Senators should not merely be rubber stamps. Surely both sides can learn from each other. At least we have demonstrated that Ave can learn from discussion and from appreciating the other fellow's point of view. </para>
                    <para>All honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber share my hope that the legislation enacted will be such that if it is still on the statute-book when Labour is again elected to office in this country, it will require no alteration. This measure will destroy subversive activities in this country and thus develop it into a land in which we shall be proud to live. If possible the banning of the Communist party must be achieved without any industrial disturbance. The passing of this bill will be another step in the crusade for democracy and free enterprise. Although some people think otherwise, I believe it is a crusade for more efficient and happier trade unions. </para>
                    <para>I admit that the Communist movement made great progress during the depression years. As has been pointed out by honorable senators opposite the conditions of those years played into the hands of the Communist party. I hope that the lessons learned then will never be forgotten, that governments will benefit from the sad experiences gained and that they will do everything in their power to see that such conditions shall not be allowed to return. I am convinced that co-operation between employer and employee is at a higher level to-day than ever before.. That is one of the ways to stop the growth of antagonism between employer and employee. We have been told by honorable senators opposite that during the period of eight years of government by the Labour party the numbers and activities of the Communists decreased in this country. Honorable senators opposite have claimed that the reason for such decline was that Labour was in office. I am quite prepared to believe that communistic activities did not thrive during the years that I have referred to. However, I am convinced that Labour is not entitled to all of the credit. The main reason why communism did not thrive to the same extent as in the depression years was the changed circumstances. There was work for all and money for all. That was not merely because the government in power was a Labour government. It was largely because of the high prices being received for our main exports - wool and wheat were at a very high level - thus circulating a large amount of money, the major portion of which found its way to the Treasury, through taxation of the producers. I contend that subversive organizations and people must be treated with determination. As in wartime, the people expect the defence forces to fight determinedly against the foe without, so to-day they expect their National Parliament to take a determined stand against the foe within. Never before, to my knowledge, has the attention of the people of Australia been focused on the Senate as it is today. I know that the people are looking to honorable senators to do their duty by dissolving for all time those organizations which take their orders from a foreign power and are attempting to obtain control of this country in order to wreck our democratic forms of government. When this legislation is implemented and Communist sentiments and activities are things of the past, Australia will be a country where our children can grow up in the freedoms that we desire. Australia will prosper as a nation and its people will be happy and contented. 1 shall conclude my remarks by quoting the words of Shakespeare - </para>

                        impressions of the measure. Members of the Opposition look upon the bill as a measure that may bc necessary in the present circumstances, and we had hoped that  when  it was introduced the Government would adopt a reasonable attitude. T trust that the Government will accept the various amendments that will he moved by the Opposition to improve the bill and to make it acceptable to the people of Australia. The majority of the people want the Communist party to be abolished, but they do not want legislation of the kind represented by the bill in its present form.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">I propose to show, in the course of my remarks, what an ordinary trade unionist considers to be wrong with this bill. In the first place, it is a fascist measure. The Government already has ample powers to deal with any subversive organization or persons. The bill takes from the citizen the right to a trial by jury. It leaves a person open to charges of which he is ignorant, and it may smooth the path for a man's private enemies, or for public pimps, to injure him. It will bring into action paid informers, and make possible surveillance of people's private affairs by supercilious public officials. It cuts across democracy, and is a savage attack on the trade union movement of this country. It takes away the right of trade unionists to elect their own officials. It is a measure which may be used to smash the Australian Labour party, along with the trade unions, as happened in Germany under Hitler. Those are all criticisms that have been directed against the bill by the Opposition and by the people of Australia, and it is for the Government to rebut those criticisms. </para>
                    <para>I propose now to refer to two of the points mentioned by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> in the course of his speech. In order to justify the proposals contained in this measure the Attorney-General described in detail the procedure that he would adopt if he suspected an employee of stealing money from his office. Prom recollection, I think he said that he would first call the man before him and acquaint him of his suspicions, and then, if the employee could not prove that he had not taken the money, the employer would dismiss him. I point out at once that the hypothetical case outlined by the Minister is not parallel to any circumstance envisaged by the bill, inasmuch as this legislation will enable the Government to declare an individual before he is informed of the allegation made against  him. Furthermore, as the bill  stands  at present, a person who has been declared will have to convince a judge that he has not been guilty of some unspecified change. Under the bill, although a person who has been declared will be punished for what is virtually an offence, he will not have the rights ordinarily enjoyed by a person who has been accused of committing some criminal act. In fact, he will not even possess the rights of the hypothetical individual who has been accused of stealing the Attorney-General's money. The bill proposes to invert the normal process of law by assuming that a person who has been declared has actually been guilty of an offence. If we apply that procedure to the hypothetical case mentioned by the Attorney-General, the suspected employee would be regarded as having stolen the money until he offered positive proof that he had not, in fact, done so. Of course, such a procedure assumes, for a start, that the money has in fact been stolen, and it is obviously so unfair and unjust that any court of law would uphold an action for wrongful dismissal by an employee who lost his job in such circumstances. Another aspect of the illustration offered by the Attorney-General is that it indicates the Minister's personal attitude towards such a serious matter as theft. On his own admission, all that he would do when a theft had occurred would be to dismiss the employee concerned. Whilst such conduct on the part of an employer would not amount to compounding a felony, it would be, at least, a condonation of a felony; and I am rather appalled to think that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth would condone a felony. </para>
                    <para>I think that it would be wise to examine the new situation envisaged by the bill because even the Attorney-General does not seem to realize the consequences of the enactment of this measure in its present form. I assume that the Attorney-General will be responsible for the administration of this legislation, and it is significant of his point of view that he has stated that a person who is declared under the bill will not, in fact, be subjected to any penalty, because " he has committed no offence ". Honorable senators opposite have repeatedly stated that no penalty is provided because the fact that a person has been declared does not constitute an offence on his part. The Attorney-General therefore contends that the procedure outlined in the bill for a person to be declared does not amount to a punishment, but is merely a " consequence " of that person's activities. Apparently the fact that the declaration by the Government of an individual would almost certainly deprivehim of his livelihood is not to he regarded; as a penalty, whereas we all know that it is one of the most severe penaltiesthat could be inflicted upon any individual. Examining a little farther theposition of an individual who has been! declared under the bill, it is obvious that he would not be entitled to receiveunemployment benefits, and since hewould most certainly be refused accommodation by any financial institution, it is clear that he could not set himself up in private enterprise. Honorablesenators will realize, therefore, that the declaration of an individual will impose upon him a punishment which is; much more severe even than that meted out to persons convicted in Victoria of capital offences. However,, such severe punishment is, in the view of the Attorney-General, not a penalty at all, but merely a consequence of his having been declared. </para>
                    <para>Prom what I have already said it isevident that we must examine the bill critically in order to make sure that thepeople of Australia get a fair deal. That is the attitude that has been adopted byLabour ever since this bill was introduced. We are determined to ensure that the Government shall not take action that will be detrimental to the welfare of thepeople. Whilst it is true that the antiLabour parties are in office, the fact remains that, as the Opposition, Labour has a duty to guard the people's rights. The fact that the Government has found' it necessary to introduce about 34 amendments to this measure justifies the stand* taken by the Opposition in this matter. We hope that the Government will realizethat our attitude is dictated by our concern for the welfare of all sections of the people, and also that it will accept the amendments which we shall move in committee. Those amendments have been prepared by members of the Parliament who represent and understand tin* working people of the community, and know what their reactions would be to  the  passage of this measure in its present form. </para>
                    <para>I have spoken on communism several times in this chamber, and all honorable senators understand my attitude  towards  it. We know that the Government Iia; »  mandate to introduce legislation to ban 4he Communists, but it is not entitled <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> go beyond that. It is not, for example, -entitled to introduce legislation that will interfere with the rights of every individual in the community, as this bill would do. Fortunately, some bad features of the bill have already been recognized and will be modified because the Government hae agreed to accept amendments proposed by the Opposition. We all know that communism is a hateful doctrine, and that it. is based on a fallacy. That fallacy is the denial of God. Therefore, the Australian labour party does not support communism. However, it does support the trade union movement, and the rights of the people of Australia. We are endeavouring to safeguard those rights. We are determined that oppressive action shall not be taken against the people. I hope that at the committee stage the Government will accept the amendments that will be moved by the Opposition to improve the bill so that it will be a workable measure. Most honorable senators favour the banning of the Communist party, but to me. that is not the best method of dealing with the problem. I said that in my first speech in this chamber. Banning the Communist party will not get us anywhere. However, the Government has a mandate for that action, and has introduced this measure in pursuance of that mandate. I believe that the bill will prove abortive. The Government should oe sure that it is sponsoring a measure that the people really desire, and not one that is designed merely for political advantage. </para>

Time is an important factor in  this proposed legislation, and I should like to see it put on the statutebook as soon as possible. Consequently, I shall not delay it unduly. Only one honorable senator opposite has denied that the Government has a mandate from the people to ban the Communist party and its affiliated organizations whose objective is subversive and revolutionary. Any government would be faithless to its trust if it did not take steps to deal effectively - I use the word advisedly - with subversive organizations. Failure by the Government to deal with the Communist menace would be a betrayal of the security of this country. Is it. not amazing that, notwithstanding the protestations of honorable senators opposite, and all their professed antipathy to communism, they always rush to defend it, whenever action is taken to frustrate its activities? Many thousands of people throughout the world to-day are greatly perturbed by the danger signs. There is ample and plain evidence of a grave and sinister force in our midst. There are movements that aim at the destruction of the true democratic principles of self-government - movements that are foreign to Australia and abhorrent to our British way of life. </para>

There may be an element of truth in that claim but it is not wholly true, and honorable senators opposite who make it repeatedly show a poor appreciation of the zeal of the idealists who propound the Communist doctrine. Many of them hold university degrees and have only a&gt; most abstract knowledge of what privation means. Communism is, and is intended <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be, a system of government opposed to democracy. The Communists are becoming more and more arrogant as the years pass. Communism is flourishing in Australia to-day more than ever. Communist inspired industrial disturbances are increasing, yet the socialists still claim that Australia has never been as prosperous as it is to-day. Honorable senators opposite cannot have it both ways. Their assertion that communism flourishes only in poverty must fall to  tie ground in the face of their declaration that Australia is prosperous to-day. </para>

I say that it can happen here. We could all give instances of how the tolerance of' peoples of other countries has led to their undoing.

That was admitted by the Chifley Government. Now. communism stands before the world stripped of its pretence of being a political philosophy. It stands revealed as a world-wide conspiracy to im pose Russian imperialism, to stamp out. democratic freedoms, and to establish in their place a despotism as terrible and absolute as anything in Asiatic history. </para>
                    <para class="block">Communists are engaged in a deadly plot against our national security. One is shocked to read that Communistinspired strikes have reached an all-time high in Australia. Our record is worse than that of Great Britain or the United States of America. Statistics compiled by research services show that industrial disputes have increased steadily in Australia since the cessation of hostilities, whereas in the United Kingdom and the United States of America they have declined. In 1949, no less than 13 per cent, of the workers of Australia went on strike. In Great Britain the number was only 2-J per cent., and in the United States of America less than 4 per cent. Such strikes mean of course an increase of production costs, and the soaring of prices of commodities to dizzy heights. The resultant high cost of living deals a damaging blow at any proposal to extend our overseas markets, and our national economy suffers. Australia is forced to take a back seat, not because we lack resources, but because we are unable to deliver the goods. The principal sufferer is always the ordinary worker because as the purchasing power of his wages declines, the cost of living rises, and living standards deteriorate. Attempts by the Government to put value back into the £1 are frustrated. Increased production, which the Communistinspired unions are preventing, would be one solution of our present economic problems. To increase production, we must eliminate the " go slow " methods of Communist elements. We must endeavour to secure a quicker turnround of ships. Honorable senators opposite can assist materially by urging their supporters to disregard the decrees of the Communists, to remain at work, and to submit their industrial disputes to arbitration. Unfortunately, to-day the man who produces more or works a little harder than the man alongside him is looked at askance, and regarded as doing something inimical to the best interests of his fellow workers. Not long ago there was a grave danger that the government of this country would pass out of lawful hands and be usurped by the fifth column.

The effects of the Labour Government's weakness can be seen in the loss of our overseas markets and the deterioration of Australia's prestige. The Australian Communist party inspired and assisted the Indonesian Communists in their revolt against the Dutch. In defiance of the then Australian Government the Communists placed a ban on Dutch, shipping. That directly involved the Australian Government in a serious threat to its relations with a friendly nation, indeed one of our former allies. The Australian Communists took similar action to support the Malayan Communists against the constitutional Government of Malaya. I submit that no Communist can be loyal to Australia and Stalin at the same time. He has no. choice. He acknowledges a. loyalty solely to Stalin. We read recently of the betrayal by Communists of vital defence secrets to Russian agents. That can and will happen here if we allow the Communists to continue their activities unchecked. The agents of Russia are at work in Australia to-day. The power to make and unmake governments is one of our most precious inheritances from our forefathers. Communism aims to destroy our system of government. The Communists do not believe in the parliamentary system. They believe in dictatorship. The urgent need to deal effectively with Communist elements in this country cannot be denied. It is generally admitted that the Communists control such organizations as the Eureka Youth Movement, and the Australian Peace Council. It will be admitted readily that they white-anted and infiltrated some trade unions. Some people doubt the association of the Communists with the Labour party. Some claim that the Australian Labour party does not include Communists hut when one considers the links of the past, one may be excused for having some doubts. I quote the words of a very prominent member of the Australian Labour party, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> A. Beasley, when he spoke in this Parliament a few years ago. </para>

Because of our close association with our own political organization, we are satisfied that the Communist party now controls the policy and domestic affairs of the Labour  party  in New South Wales. Circumstances have arisen in New South Wales today which definitely establish that the Communist party is controlling the policy and domestic affairs of the Labour party. The process of asserting that control has been spread over a long period of years, but developments have all been in accordance with a well-defined plan. The activities of the Communist party arc not confined to Australia. It is a world-wide organization and its policy for any country is not determined within that country. Communists all over the world take their direction from a central bureau in Moscow, and adopt whatever procedure that central authority may decide upon. </para>

                        <para>I did not say that there was an unbridgeable gulf between the principles of the Communist party and the principles of the Labour party.

                        <para>The constitution of the Labour party provides that membership shall consist of affiliated unions and those persons who are enrolled as members of the organization and pledge themselves to the party constitution and platform. That is quite right and proper, but all members of the Communist-controlled unions in Victoria which are affiliated with the Australian Labour party are members of the Victorian branch of the Labour party. I cite the Amalgamated Engineers Union, the coal miners' federation, the Tramways and Motor Omnibus Employees Union, The Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, the Waterside Workers Federation, Clothing Trades Union, The Plumbers Union, the Ship Painters and Dockers Union, and many others. They are all affiliated in Victoria with the Labour party. In 1947, the affiliated unions paid £6,220 to the Australian Labour party as affiliation fees, whilst the individual political branches in the same State paid only £787. Provision is made in the constitution of the Labour party for unions affiliated with the Labour party to pay affiliation fees. The Labour party takes cash from the Communist members of affiliated unions and falsely asserts that Communists cannot join the Australian Labour party. All the members of the affiliated unions including Communist members of those unions, then become financial members, and can vote to elect delegates  to attend their annual conference. They can instruct their delegates how to vote, and can vote also for the selection of men to represent them in the State or Federal Parliament. </para>

Labour party branches and Labourparliamentarians to combat the antiAustralian disruptive tactics of theCommunist party. If they were sincerein their declaration, one would havethought that that motion would have been carried, but it was defeated by 132 votes to 106. Honorable senators assert that they support the banning proposals, but immediately they proceed to endeavour toput into the bill a clause which would? make the banning of the Communist party ineffective. I refer to the onus of proof provision. It has been said that somehonorable senators do not believe in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> ban, and are using their opposition tothis clause as a subterfuge to defeat the proposal altogether. I suggest that a realistic view must be taken of this; matter. The position must be studied' fairly and squarely on a commonsensebasis. On the surface, it appears that thisprovision is the only bone of contention; between the Government and honorablesenators on the Opposition side. Practically all honorable senators in the Opposition have claimed that they support the outlawing of communism. If they: are sincere, they will not bring forward! amendments to make the proposed lawunworkable. </para>

                            and others have said that this bill is ani attack on the trade union movementThat is absolute and utter nonsense. I was going to say that it is the quintessence' of madness but I will say merely that it is the quintessence of stupidity. TheCommonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act was introduced by the Liberal party and for the first time in federalhistory the unions had a voice,, because the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is based on the principle of" industrial organization. Every honorablesenator on this side of the chamber believes in and fosters the trade unions,, but will not stand unions that are controlled by Communists.

                        <para>The question of the onus of proof islargely a matter for legal minds, but it as not proposed to condemn anybody without a fair trial. Proposed amendments to the bill are designed to give a declared person the right to go before a proper court and show that he is not what he has been declared to be. Grave misconceptions arise from the debate on the onus of proof clause. British law has not always placed the onus of proof on the accuser. Under the proposed amendments to the bill a declared person has only to swear his innocence and the onus will be changed to 4he Crown, because the Crown must sustain its declaration. It is ridiculous to say that any person can be declared. The bill as proposed to be amended will lay it down clearly that before any one is declared, the Governor-General, which means the Executive Council or the Cabinet, must be satisfied that the person is not only a member of the Communist party or one of ite auxiliaries, but that he is engaged or is likely to be engaged in activities prejudicial to. the -security of Australia. Even then he cannot be declared until the material facts have been considered by a committee. </para>

Subject to the powers constitutionally conferred on this Parliament, the various State governments have full and plenary powers. If they wished, they could decree that every honorable senator opposite should be beheaded. Some might say that that would be a desirable reform; but no government would be so idiotic as to carry out such a suggestion. Every member of this chamber breaks a law occasionally, but he is not prosecuted if it is merely some minor offence. He might walk along the wrong side of the street or alight from the wrong side of the tram, but no administration prosecutes him, although it has the power to do so. The onus in on a person suspected of being illegally in possession of property to prove his innocence. He must prove that he became possessed of the property legally and lawfully. A penalty  is provided for him, but there is no such provision in this bill. The onus of proof is to be placed definitely and squarely on the Crown in certain circumstances. The attitude of honorable senators opposite is alarming. They say that they agree to the proposal to ban the Communist party, but they want the Communists to remain in the trade unions, where they can carry on their nefarious .work, and betray Australia through the agency of the unions. If the onus of proof provision in the bill is abandoned, the teeth of the measure will be drawn, and the whole bill might as well be thrown into the waste-paper basket. As has been pointed out by other speakers, the onus of proof provision as it appears in the present bill is also to be found in other Commonwealth legislation, including the Crimes Act and the Customs Act, as well as in some State legislation. In the emergency legislation introduced by the Labour Government to deal with the coal strike last year, a similar provision was included, although the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> now describes it as obnoxious. If it was good enough for a Labour government to include such a provision in legislation last year, on the <inline font-style="italic">ground</inline> that an <inline font-style="italic">emergency</inline> existed, surely the present Government has the right to include it in this legislation, because no one will deny that a state of emergency exists at the present time. As a matter of fact, the provision is in no way novel, and was freely employed during the war. As I have said, the </para><para class="block">Labour Government itself reversed th onus of proof in its emergency legislation during the coal strike, and placed the onus of proof on the accused. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, who later became GovernorGeneral of Australia and was at one time Attorney-General, stated that the burden of proof rested where justice would best be served. The bill does not provide for the imposition of penalties except in respect of charges that have to be proved by the Crown. All the talk of British justice, liberty of the subject and reversing the rules of law is so much humbug and moonshine. Liberty for what? Liberty to engage in subversive activities ! Liberty to disrupt the economy of Australia ! I will have none o~ it. What is wrong in asking a declared person to go into the witness-box and say that he is innocent-? If he does that, the onus of proof reverts to the Crown. If he is innocent he has nothing to fear. Drastic situations demand drastic remedies. We live in extraordinary times, and this is emergency legislation. </para><para>If we ignore the distortions and the humbug of honorable senators opposite, and concentrate on the bill itself, we find that it is designed to deal with a simple issue. Those honorable senators who are opposed to communism, and wish it to be effectively banned, will support the bill. Those honorable senators who are for communism, and want to protect the Communists, will vote against the bill. Honorable senators opposite have the issue before them, and the people of Australia will look anxiously for the division list. <inline font-style="italic">\Quorum formed.)</inline></para></speech>

                    <para>This bill Would be considered calmly. The Government has claimed that the bill was introduced in accordance with a premise given to the electors before the last election, and to give effect to the mandate which it received from the people to ban the Communist party. The Government was undoubtedly given a mandate to ban the Communist party. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> speaking then as Leader of the Opposition, said that he would ban the Communist party, and strengthen the laws of the country in order to permit the party to be dealt with. The Labour party recognizes that the Government has an obligation to defend the country. It is advised by its security service, and has in its possession knowledge that is not available to members of the Opposition. If the Government, in the light of that knowledge, believes that the Communist party should be banned, then the Labour party will accept this bill up to, and including, clause 4. The wisdom of such a measure may be debated, but the Labour party will not oppose the first part of the bill, recognizing that the Government received a mandate to go as fatas that. We have been told that the purpose of the bill is to ensure the safety of Australia, and to protect our democracy. However, the bill as originally introduced in the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister was so vicious that it would have destroyed the very things which it was supposed to protect. One of the most important distinctions between a totalitarian country and a democracy is that in a democracy the rule of law shall prevail. As I have said, the Opposition has not objected to the banning of the Communist party. The fight has taken place to protect democracy and, as far as the Labour majority in this Senate can ensure it, to see that the rule of law shall prevail. Certain provisions of the bill not directly concerned with the banning of that party are vicious and dangerous, tending to destroy that which distinguishes Australian democracy from oppressive totalitarian rule. One such provision which the Opposition considered could not be tolerated was the right of entry and search by security officers. There are some thousands of these officers, and many  of thom a.re very fine men. Some, of course, were appointed because they are of the type that can get information which is not available to others. The provision in.  the  original bill that security officers could break into a man's home without warrant, and search the premises and. the owner's person, and take possession of documents, was very close to certain legislation in Nazi and Communist countries. The Government, in its anxiety to protect democracy, was about to do something that was the negation of democracy. To that the Labour party has objected and will not compromise on its amendment to correct the danger inherent in such a practice. </para>

The truth of that statement is borne out by what has happened since the present Prime Minister commended the Nazi system in 1938.

                    <para class="block">May, 1983, a. measure was introduced into  the  German Reichstag providing for the dissolution of the Communist party. Strangely enough, the 20th May was the date upon which the bill now before us left the House of Representatives to be sent to the Senate. The German legislation provided that the highest authority in the State, or officers authorized by it, could confiscate, in favour of the State, the property of the Communist party in Germany, and of its auxiliary organizations, as well as the property used, or intended to be used, for furthering Communist activities. That measure was opposed  by the Social Democrat party, although that party was itself opposed to communism. Nevertheless, the law was made. Very shortly afterwards, the Jewish community in Germany was attacked. The property of Jews was confiscated, and many of the intelligentsia, Jewish professors, professional men, and others were persecuted, and thrown into concentration camps. Finally, the Social Democrats themselves were brought within the scope of the legislation. Shortly before the outbreak of the war, the present Prime Minister who was then Attorney - General, travelled abroad. After his return, he addressed the Constitutional Club, in Sydney, on the 24th October, 1938, and in his speech he expressed his admiration for Nazi Germany, and his contempt for Australian democracy. </para>

The measure, as introduced into the House of Representatives, provided for the proscription of individuals and for the giving of great power to the administration. Under it, despite what has been said by honorable senators opposite, two Cabinet Ministers, sitting with the GovernorGeneral in council, could have declared an organization or an individual. lt would be not an interpretation of the law by a court but the opinion of a political party. It has been amended considerably since it was introduced. I believe that the amendments have been made because the Labour party has a majority in this chamber and because it has been able to focus the spotlight of public opinion upon vicious provisions. </para><para>The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives by the Prime Minister in an atmosphere of hysteria reminiscent of Germany. The right honorable gentleman's second-reading speech was excellent in delivery and beautiful in its choice of words. For the moment, he hypnotized the people of Australia. He said that the measure would not be altered or amended. I tried to get a seat in the House of Representatives so that I could listen to his speech, but every available seat was filled. Despite what the Prime Minister said on that occasion, he has, under pressure by the Opposition, retreated to some degree. The bill was amended by the Government in the House of Representatives and doubtless it will be amended in this chamber. It is said now that the Government, by the amendment that it has made and those that it has foreshadowed, has met the main objections raised by the Labour party, but that is not so. We shall eliminate vicious provisions and safeguard the liberty of the people of Australia. The bill has been improved to some degree, but it is still not a democratic measure. </para><para>We believe that the onus of proof should rest firmly upon the Crown. Hon   orable  senators opposite agree that if persons are charged under the penal provisions of the measure, the onus of proof should lie upon the Crown. In other words, they agree that before a man can be fined five or ten pounds for an offence against the measure the Crown must satisfy the court of his guilt. They argue, however, that if a man is declared and dismissed from the position by which he earns his living, the onus of satisfying a court that he should not have been declared should rest upon him. Why the distinction between the two cases? If a man is declared, his character will be taken from him and, in some instances, his means of earning a living also. There is no doubt where the onus of proof should lie. When the bill was introduced into the House of Representatives, the Government argued that if the onus of proof were to be placed upon the Commonwealth, it would be necessary to disclose secret or confidential information to establish such proof. That was rot. It is now proposed that if a man who has been declared goes into the witnessbox and swears on oath that he is not a Communist, the onus of proof shall shift to the Crown. That will mean that, if the Commonwealth is to prove its case, it must disclose to the court the secret or confidential information upon which it acted and do all those things which it contended could not be done. </para><para>I believe that the Government is ashamed of the bad way in which the original bill was drafted, if not of its contents. The Prime Minister said that if an employer charged an employee with a defalcation or neglect of duty, the employer would place the onus upon the employee to prove he did not do or fail to do what was alleged against him. What has happened in relation to this bill can best be described, in terms of employeremployee relations, in the following way : An employee drafts a document for his employer. The following morning, he tells his employer that he has discovered nineteen mistakes in the document, and that he proposes to correct them. The next day, he tells his employer that he has discovered another sixteen mistakes, and that he proposes to correct them. In those circumstances, the employer would tell him to take the document away and re-draft it. I believe that the Government would have been well advised to withdraw this bill and re-draft it, but it has not done so. The measure is now a patchwork piece of legislation. </para><para>If the passage of the bill has been delayed, that is due to the actions of the Government. It foreshadowed a number of important amendments only yesterday. It is playing for time. That was made  clear by the speeches that were delivered by honorable senators opposite yesterday. The bill has been badly handled by the Government, and it would be wise to withdraw it and re-draft it. I believe that some honorable senators opposite, although they think that communism must be combated, agree with us that the manner in which the Government proposes to act is unwise. Why should not the ordinary rule of law be allowed to operate? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> told us of the vicious laws that are in operation in England. They are on a par with this measure. If the honorable senator's argument is sound, why add another vicious law to those to which he so strenuously objects? He objected to the vicious British legislation under which farmers may be dispossessed of their land, and I agree with him that it is wrong. The viciousness of this measure exceeds that of the measure to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> referred. That legislation referred to property resumption, but this act proposes to take away or injure a person's good character and his means of earning a livelihood. It can be stated generally that, under our present laws, the onus of proof is placed upon the accused only in relation to matters that are peculiarly within his own knowledge. The onus of proof provisions in this measure should be amended, because we must not endanger our democracy by following the putrid practices of totalitarian countries. </para><para>Communism has nothing to offer this country, and the people of Australia know that it has not. If this country is governed in a democratic way, communism will be defeated. Honorable senators opposite have talked of Communist infiltration of trade unions. One honorable senator opposite who was at one time a member of the Labour party - he left it when it was under fire, but we have had many traitors - said that Communists were in the Australian Labour party because some trade unions paid to the party affiliation fees in respect of their members. He argued that any Communist member of a trade union in respect of whom affiliation fees were paid to the Labour party could vote at elections of officers of the party. The honorable senator should know that, irre spective of whether a person may have paid affiliation fees to the Labour party through a trade union or any other channel, if he is a Communist, he is automatically barred from voting at any election for officers of the party. The honorable senator should know that some trade unions in Western Australia pay affiliation fees to the Labour party on behalf of all their members except Communists. He should know also that every member of the party signs a pledge that he is not a member of any other political party, including the Communist party. The Government has tried to convince the people that the Labour party is sympathetic to the Communist party, but the fact is that the Communist party is more viciously opposed to the Labour party than it is to the Liberal party. During the general coal strike, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Healy</inline> visited Parliament House. He was ostracized by Labour members; but, at a time when the Chifley Government was engaged in a. life-and-death struggle with communism, he drank in a bar in Parliament House with an honorable senator who was a member of the Australian Country party. It is true that he may only have been telling him a funny story. </para><para class="block">The Communist party, in its manifesto, said - </para><quote>
                        <para>We utilize this campaign in order to win the masses of the workers from the treacherous Labour party. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">Honorable senators opposite have something in common with the Communists in that strategy. The Communists are not friends of ours. We have always fought them, but we have never believed that, in order to beat them, we should depart from democratic principles. We do not want the banging of a revolver butt on a door to constitute a right of entry into the houses of our citizens. If the Government wants to deal with the Communist party, let it do so, but, in doing so, let it take care not to intrude upon the rights of democratic citizens under the pretext of protecting their freedom. This country has fought for many worthwhile things. As the anti-Labour parties came back into power they saw that they got their dividends out of it. In the main the young men who went into battle in two wars believed that they were fighting for the high principle that no  man should be convicted, maligned, or scandalized without trial. But that is what this bill will do. In effect, the Government says that if a man in the Public Service is declared he will merely lose his job, and similarly, if a member of a trade union is declared, he will only lose his job. However, I point out that in addition to losing their jobs those men would be stigmatized. </para><interjection><talk.start>

We do not waste our time trying to scandalize people and doing things likely to destroy this country. This matter is in the Government's hands and I shall leave it to the Government to deal with the Communist party. The Opposition has announced its decision on clauses 1 to 4, and the Government has all the information that it requires from the security service. The Government contends that the danger has become more grave since 1945. It talks of information in the possession of the Minister which cannot foe disclosed to the Parliament. Honorable senators opposite have admitted that it would be quite possible for an innocent man to suffer injustice under this legislation. Australia has always defended democracy. There are two ways of defeating a nation. The first is by infiltration and by force of arms; the other is by an association of ideas taking the shape of legislation which destroys personal liberty and refuses the protection of law as known to democracy, thus changing the national character to one similar to that of totalitarian countries. Whether the pattern follows the methods of Hitler or Stalin - is Nazi or Communist - matters little. I bate both of them. In that connexion, this legislation will establish a milestone, or, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has said, a precedent in democratic practice. It is to be regretted that Government members of this chamber and of the House of Representatives choose to scandalize individuals rather than deal with legislation on its merits thereby using the privilege of Parliament to injure members of the public with inpunity.  I sin cerely regret the speech that I have heard in this chamber to-day by a supporter of the Government, who was previously a member of the Labour party, during which some members of the Opposition left the chamber. I hope that the Government will take into consideration the full implications of this measure. The Opposition is fully in accord with anything that will protect and preserve our democratic institutions. </para>

                            - Two main points have emerged from this debate. The first is that we have let the people of Australia see that at all events this Government respects the deliberative character of the Parliament, which has been dead for over eight years during Labour's regime. We have restored it. Arising out of full, free and open debate we have been amenable to reason and have accepted certain amendments which, however, do not alter the great purpose or intention of the measure. In substance they really put into the enactment itself what would have been done administratively. I shall touch briefly on the principal proposed amendments. There has been expressed a fear that an innocent man, harmlessly at his home gardening or in the bosom of his family, might be arbitrarily dealt with in some gestapo-like fashion. I do not consider that any honorable senators opposite believe that contention for a moment. The Executive does not behave in that way in a democracy. However, just to make the matter perfectly clear, it is provided that before a person is declared, the circumstances of any complaint made in respect of him must be investigated by five responsible people, namely - not necessarily in order of seniority - the head of the security service, the Solicitor-General, who is head of the Crown Law office, the head of the Defence Department and two other men  with  special qualifications and ability. They have first to be convinced that there is some substance in the allegations. Only then will the matter be passed on to Cabinet. As the Prime Minister

                            - by two Ministers who happen to be at Government House at the time. This is a serious matter. After investigation of the complaint by the five responsible men who will constitute the committee, two of whom need not necessarily be members of the Public Service, the matter will go to full Cabinet, which will accept the final responsibility.

                            <para>- We do not expect that many people will be declared. Once the Communists realize that we mean business - and we do - they will run for cover. There has been a lot of loose talk about the onus of proof. I shall deal more fully with that aspect in the committee stage. There is nothing new about it. Similar provisions are contained in the immigration legislation, taxation legislation, the Crimes Act, and many other acts. The Government is not interested in pursuing innocent, lawabiding people. It intends to stop wreckers before they can put into effect their nefarious designs. Any person who happens to be declared will possess information regarding his own movements, character, and activities. To put the onus of proof back onto the Crown all he need do is to go into the witness box and deny the affirmation. Is not that a simple, straight-forward matter? A lot of noise has been made about this being a departure from British law. There is no such thing as a departure in this measure. </para>

This is the substance of the measure that will be before the chamber. The provisions of the Crimes Act are very vital to the security of the country. That legislation has been invoked by both Labour and non-Labour governments alike. Section 30aa of the Crimes Act provides - (1.) The Attorney-General may apply to the High Court or to the Supreme Court of a State for an order calling upon any body of persons, incorporated or unincorporated, to show cause why it should not be declared to be an unlawful association. (7.) If cause to the contrary is not shown to the satisfaction of the Court, it may make an order declaring the respondent body of persons to he an unlawful association. </para>

                            <para>- The onus stays, whether the matter be before a magistrate or a single judge. The point is that the bill merely raises a presumption in favour of the Crown. When a presumption is raised in a criminal prosecution the accused has to rebut that presumption, and he does so by giving, or calling, substantia] evidence. This legislation, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> pointed out, does not provide for a trial because under it no charge will be made against any individual; and we cannot have a trial unless a charge has been preferred. The " declaration" may be set aside by the bare denial of the individual " declared " that he is a Communist and that his activities are prejudicial to the safety and security of the country, unless the' Crown can bring evidence to the contrary. The purpose of the provision is to get the suspected person into the witness box, and if he cannot be convicted out of his own mouth under cross-examination the " declaration " will be set aside. That is a very simple proposition.. The fifth amendment that will be moved will require that any individual who is declared must have been, after the 10th May, 1948, a member or officer of the Australian Communist party. </para>

                            <para>- That is why I am explaining them now. The last amendment that will be proposed by the Government is designed, like the rest of the clause, to deal with a specific menace to our safety and security. As soon as we have dealt with that menace effectively and have crushed it, the GovernorGeneral will be empowered by proclamation to repeal the measure. Both the Prime Minister and I emphasized that fact in the course of the speeches that we have made in the respective Houses of the Parliament, but we now give proof positive of our intention by proposing to incorporate it in the legislation. . </para>

                    <para>The second point that has arisen from the debate is the amazing confusion of thought and expression of members of the Opposition. I cannot even guess at the cause of that confusion. It may be, of course, that some honorable senators opposite want ' to have a " ticket on the tote ", a bet " each way ". When the legislation is enacted, and they are discussing it with those who want to destroy communism, they will be able to say, " You heard my speech ; I was very strongly in favour of the bill ". To those who do not favour the legislation, they will be able to say, " You know the stand that I took on this matter. We did not let the legislation go through without a fight ". I am quite sure that the great majority of the members of the Australian  Labour  party are vehemently anti-Communist. Indeed, that fact is generally admitted ;  but that it not the attitude of every member of that party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morrow's</inline> harangue, to which we listened this morning, was typical international communistic propaganda that we hear from schoolboys and on street corners. I do not think that even the most loyal member of the Australian Labour party will deny that there is an attempt by the Communists to infiltrate their party, and that is why some members of that party are making such a fight on the bill. I shall give a few instances to support my contention. Under the heading, " Communist Front ", the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 8th April, 1950, stated - </para>

If such an opinion, however, exists, the public have a right, where the nature of the case requires it, to call on the suspected person by such procedure as the legislature makes lawful to satisfy a judicial tribunal as to the actual fact. That seems to be only elementary self-protection and to be inseparable from any self-governing constitution. I must confess to some surprise that it is necessary to justify it.

                    <para class="block">Again I ask honorable senators opposite by what authority they place the sanctity of the Australian Labour party above that of their country. I do not agree, nor do I think the people of Australia will agree, that it should be so placed. However, I am not criticizing the right of the Australian Labour party to take the action to which I have referred. Every lawful institution or association has a right to make its own laws and regulations to safeguard itself from attack either from within or without, but as that principle apparently is conceded by the Australian Labour party why should it not be extended to the security of our country? We have been told that this legislation will offer opportunities to the poisoned pen, the pimp and the informer. That, I believe, is far from the truth. As I have indicated in my opening remarks, any allegation, or charge that is regarded as sufficiently serious to warrant consideration of a declaration, will be referred to the committee of five that I have mentioned. No one will suggest that the three members of that committee whom I have named are irresponsible people. </para>

                            <para>- There is no need to repeat the provisions of acts of parliament. The prospect of an innocent person1 being dragged from the bosom of his family and subjected to the stigma and indignity of a declaration under this measure is negligible because of the screening processes that will be carried out. The provisions of the bill will apply only to people who are now, or since the 10th May, 1948, have been Communists, and whose activities are, presently or potentially, a menace to the security of the country. There is no ground for the belief that a person will be liable to be declared merely for thinking. That is a gross distortion of the provisions of the measure and, apart from being puerile, it is something that should not be expected from responsible senators. I repeat that the only people who will be affected by this bill are those who are now Communists or have been Communists since the 10th May, 1948, and whose present or potential activities constitute a danger to the security and defence of the country. If honorable senators opposite want to protect such people, they will have an opportunity to do so by voting against the second reading of this bill. By so doing they will be saying, in effect, " We stand as defenders of Communists who are a menace to the security of the country". </para>

                            <para>- I thank the Senate for its courtesy. I was about to deal with minorities. If my recollection is correct, Al Capone was the head of a minority group. Nefarious as he was, his depredations were not half so menacing to the continuance of constitutional government as are the activities of the Communists. " Squizzy " Taylor, too, was the head of a minority group, but wicked and vicious as his activities were, they did not constitute the menace to the safety and security of our country that exists in the Communist party. </para>

                    <para>It has been wrongly suggested that this measure is a veiled attack on the great Australian trade union movement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay</inline> made a sincere and moving address on that subject. One could readily see his great devotion to the great Australian trade union movement; but this bill constitutes no menace whatever to that movement. On the contrary, when the measure becomes law, the trade union movement will be able to breathe much more freely because the strangling weight of communism will have been lifted from it. Already since this Government has been in power, many trade unions have thrown out their Communist executives because they know that the Government will stand behind them and see that the rule of law is applied. A strong, active, and democratically controlled trade union movement is- not merely useful, but is essential to the development of this country. Without a strong trade union movement there would be industrial anarchy. I have always advised young people in whom I am interested to take an active interest in the affairs of their trade unions, not only that they may enjoy the benefits of unionism, ,hut also that they may appreciate and share the responsibilities of trade unions. Upon our great trade unions rests a tremendous responsibility; and in their hands- lies a tremendous power. Therefore, if any assurance is necessary, I say again without hesitation or qualification that, in my opinion, a strong democratically controlled trade union movement is not merely desirable, but is absolutely essential. The trade unions know that, under this Government, they will be afforded the utmost protection. Indeed, were it not for the support of a large number of trade unionists, we should not be in power to-day. Obviously, an overwhelming number of trade unionists voted for the present Government parties, because the employers of Australia, by themselves, would not be able to win one seat. </para>
                    <para>The Opposition has argued that the Government has ample power to deal with the Communists under the Crimes Act, and that there is no need for this legislation. Here again there is confusion of thought. The Crimes Act is designed not to prevent the commission of crimes but to punish criminals after crimes have been committed. This measure is designed to frustrate wreckers before they are able to wreck our defences, destroy communications, and take the thousand and one other actions that are open to them to tie up our industries and destroy our economy. That danger was emphasized when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fuchs</inline> was arrested and prosecuted in England recently. He was in a position of trust, and was engaged on too secret scientific investiti ons  on atomic energy. It is cold comfort to people of the United Kingdom and to us that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Fuchs</inline> is now serving a ' term of imprisonment of fourteen years. </para>

Again I emphasize the vast difference between declaring a man to be a danger in certain occupations and laying a criminal charge. If a person " declared " under this bill is a public servant, he will be deprived of the protection of Crown employment for his activities, but he will not be sent to gaol. No penal provisions can be invoked against him. He will be merely removed from his present employment.

The people who would come under the bill now before the chamber are not to be charged with an offence. After careful scrutiny and examination, they are to to charged with being in a position where their nefarious activities might prejudice the safety of the country. The only penalty provision in the bill is under clause 7 which provides that if a person has been declared and continues to do the things that are forbidden and implicit in the declaration, he shall be liable on conviction to five years' imprisonment. But before the person can be convicted, he is entitled to be tried by a jury and in that event the usual court proceedings and forms are to be observed. If a man deserves to be declared, I do not think that this country owes him anything. Honorable senators know what communism is.

What honorable senators on this side of the chamber are opposed to is any attack on our system of government. If honorable senators believe in the validity of the recitals in the bill and that communism is a real menace, they will agree that the Government must have in its hands the means of dealing with the danger. It wants to be in a position to anticipate and prevent the commission of the offence, not to punish the offenders afterwards. Unless the Government is armed with this measure as it proposes to have it amended by the Senate, the responsibility for leaving the Government defenceless against -the depredations of communism will be on the Opposition. </para>

It is like saying to a nervous housekeeper, " We will give you a watch-dog, a big fierce-looking  one,  to protect you against any marauders; hut, of course, we are going to take its teeth out first ". If honorable senators opposite persist in the amendments that have been foreshadowed, they will be taking the teeth out of this bill. Instead of putting into the hands of the Government effective means of defending the country against those who wish to wreck and destroy the Australian way of life, they will be giving the Government an empty weapon that will be of no use at all against the menace that threatens the country. I commend the bill. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is correct. Clause 21 deals with the right to search for property belonging to the Communist party or to some organization which has been declared under this bill to be unlawful. I think it will be conceded very readily that the entry of a peace officer or a security officer into the home, office or premises of a person is a very serious matter. The mere entry brings a great deal of social odium on the premises themselves, and on the occupants. A search of that type must be conducted with a great deal of tact and discretion. Underlying such a search is an allegation that the person has committed a crime in helping to conceal property and there are penalties for that offence under this bill. In effect, the person is suspected of being subversive or of helping persons against the best interests of the country. Not one honorable senator on the Opposition side has any objection to any peace officer in this country. There is not the slightest desire on the part of the Opposition to reflect on one of them. As far as honorable senators on this side know, every peace officer in Australia is a thoroughly estimable citizen. I want it to be clearly understood that I am not reflecting on any one of them. </para>

                            <para>- I have already referred to the delicate nature of the task in which they may be called upon to engage and among the peace officers there are men attending to all types of work. There are men at the highest level conducting very important investigations. The Attorney-General will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that there are 2,000 Commonwealth peace officers in Australia. Many of them act as guards, in a more or less formal way, at certain Commonwealth establishments. </para>

                    <para class="block">A great many of them are night watchmen, and they were engaged because they were fitted for service of that kind. It is claimed that many of those so. engaged are qualified to act upon reasonable suspicions entertained by themselves. In the bill as originally drawn, such officers were authorized to act on their own initiative, but an amendment was inserted in clause  21  of the bill, at the instance of the Labour party, providing that officers could enter premises only on a warrant. Entry into private premises, in the circumstances envisaged in the bill, is a most serious matter. Authority to do so ought not to be vested blindly in a whole body of men. In a matter so important to the people concerned, it behoves the Government, and the Attorney-General in particular, who will administer the measure, to select carefully the officers who are to be entrusted with such work. </para>

                            <para>- I assume that he would receive instructions from a higher authority. I assume that the Attorney-General himself will be the final authority in such a matter, and I maintain that it should he clearly stated in the bill that full responsibility for authorizing a search must rest \ipon a Minister who is responsible to the Parliament. What objection can the Government have to the amendment? I gather from the interjection of the Attorney-General that close scrutiny will he maintained over officers entrusted with the task of entering and searching premises. That being so, why not place the position beyond doubt in the legislation itself? We do not want the Attorney-General to say, after sorry; dreadful incident has occurred in a private home, that the Parliament itself agreed to give full authority to the peace officers, and that, therefore, he could not be held responsible for what had happened. We wish to ensure that the person who administers this legislation shall accept full responsibility in the Parliament for what may be done in. the matter of search. The Attorney-General has said that every member of the security service will not be free to seek a warrant to. search premises. Very well, then, let the Attorney-General stand up to that assurance. The Opposition is an integral part of the Parliament, and the Opposition does not agree that the power of entry and search should be vested in all peace officers. Final responsibility must rest with the Government, and in this instance that means the Minister who administers the act; in other words, the Attorney-General. If the Government is not prepared to accept the amendment, we can only conclude that it is hoping, because of the broad terms of the measure, to escape responsibility should anything go wrong; that in such an event, the Attorney-General would protest that he did not know that the officer concerned in the incident was going to act. Then the onus would be thrown back on the Parliament, of which the Opposition is a part. I ask the Attorney-General whether there is any good reason why the amendment should not be accepted? </para>

                        <para>. -  I suggest that this amendment was framed because clause  21,  in its original form, authorized peace officers to enter premises and search for documents. One can understand that, in the opinion of some people, it would be conferring too wide a power on a peace officer to authorize him to enter and search premises without obtaining a warrant from a magistrate. That might be a legitimate objection to the bill in its original form, but clause  21  has now been amended to provide that an officer must first obtain a warrant from a stipendiary magistrate, and take the appropriate oath. I do not think that there is a great deal in the point taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna'.'</inline> A Commonwealth peace officer is a man who has taken an oath to perform his duty according to the law. He is a member of a force with high traditions, and I suggest that such a man would not be an inappropriate officer to make a search, of the kind contemplated in the clause. He is not a person who would undertake such a search on his own initiative. He would undertake a search only when directed to do so by a proper, superior authority. Therefore, I suggest that it is unnecessary that the peace officer should be directly authorized to act by the Attorney-General himself. Of course, a person other than a peace officer would have to be authorized by the Attorney-General, but a peace officer is a part of the administrative machinery of the Commonwealth. He is a member of an organized force, and performs his duties in accordance with orders given to him from time to time. I suggest that the fears which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has expressed are far-fetched, and come near to casting reflections on the force itself that are quite unjustified. Since clause 21 has now been put into a form that is satisfactory to the Opposition, the present clause should be accepted as it stands. </para>

                        (Victoria) [4.55 J.  - The magistrate who would issue a search warrant would not be responsible for the selection of the officers who were to execute it. The magistrate would probably accept on good faith what was told him by the peace officer, feeling that he had no alternative. I agree with what
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                        has said, and I do so because of my own experience of certain peace officers. As I said in my second-reading speech, Commonwealth peace officers are men to whom, in the ordinary way, no exception can be taken. They are reputable men, but they are not qualified, mentally or by experience, to undertake the important work of entry and search. As a Minister, I took the stand that officers should prove, or attempt to prove, their allegations. In one instance, I found that the officers had deliberately misrepresented the whole position in order to have a capable and conscientious government servant put into a concentration camp. I believe that the Attorney-General, because of his knowledge and experience, is the person who should authorize officers to enter and search premises.

I am not making recriminations against the Government in what I am saying at this stage. When the Government's original proposals regarding the right of search were criticized both inside and outside the Parliament, the Government wisely retreated from the position it had taken up. In spite of the fact that the amendment now before us was prepared while clause 21 was in its original form, the validity of the amendment is not affected. The Attorney-General does not suggest that a great burden would be imposed upon him if he undertook the task referred to in the amendment. He has not met my point that peace officers are engaged upon all kinds of. duties. They are selected to perform certain duties, and the nature of some of their duties does not justify confidence being reposed in them to undertake the responsible job of searching under the provision of this bill. </para>

If I were in his position, recognizing the difficulties into which an indiscreet peace officer might plunge me, I should want those who were to be entrusted with this very important work to be subjected to an effective screening. The Opposition, in addition to suggesting that a little extra responsibility or work should be imposed upon the Attorney-General, is suggesting something for which, ultimately, he will be thankful. I believe that the amendment, if accepted, will safeguard him and the Government. "We are not moving it for that reason. That is only incidental to our purpose, which is to prevent inexperienced and indiscreet people from undertaking searches of this nature. If they are to be permitted to do so, we want to make it quite clear that the Government of the day must accept full responsibility for their acts. That is the real purpose of the amendment.

I remind the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> that the Government has not yet accepted an amendment moved by the Opposition in this chamber. I agree that we have not accepted in full all measures introduced by the Government. If the Government were to meet us on this amendment we might initiate a new order. So far as the amendments circulated by the Government are concerned, I can almost promise that, if that were done, we should return the compliment in the near future. I say quite seriously that we want to get this measure on the statute-book with the least possible recrimination between the Government and the Opposition. I have said that I believe we are in complete agreement regarding the broad purposes of the bill. Let us accept that position, and agree that we are arguing only about methods. The Government wants to get the bill through Parliament and put it into operation. We are prepared to help it to do so. There is nothing unreasonable in this amendment, and nothing that the Attorney-General has said would justify the Government in refusing to accept it. The Attorney-General and the Minister for Trade and Customs are both reasonable men. I believe that, upon consideration, they will be prepared to meet the Opposition upon this amendment and start the new order to which I have referred. Having looked at the amendments that the Government has circulated, I think that we might readily accept some of them. If the Attorney-General considers that this amendment involves a vital principle from the Government's viewpoint, he has not stated what it is. We believe that it involves the important principle that there should be parliamentary responsibility in an important matter such as this. Although this is a minor matter, the acceptance of the amendment by the Government might smooth the way for the acceptance of other amendments. The Opposition will move fourteen amendments, but it has been outbid by the Government, which will move sixteen amendments. It will take a considerable time for the committee to consider 30 amendments. If the Government is not prepared to hold out the olive branch to us in relation to this amendment, there may be very close debates upon other amendments of greater consequence than this. If the Ministers will cast their eyes round the Government benches, they will see smiling faces and hopeful looks, and they may be encouraged to meet the Opposition on this amendment. </para>

Does it mean that he must espouse all  of  them? If it does not mean that, does it mean that he must espouse 99 per cent, of them? If not, what percentage? This is a matter upon which I have practical difficulties. I believe that Marx has written much, and Lenin has written a great deal. I confess that I am not very familiar with either of them  a3  writers, but I have learned in the course of this debate that, jointly and separately, they have advocated many things that are embodied in legislation in this country. They have advocated, for instance, free education, central banking, state-owned transport and the redistribution of the population in rural areas. Those are activities of which everybody approves. In order that the Opposition may understand what is meant by the definition I pose a question to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer).</inline> Does the definition mean that, if anybody in this community advocates any one of the teachings or practices of Marx and Lenin, or. more than one, he comes within the definition? If one of them is not sufficient, how many must it be? Section 23 </para>

It can be said in its favour that in the course of the debate in this chamber and in the House of Representatives no one has suggested a better one. The Labour party itself is from time to time faced with this problem in the application of its own constitution, because it will not have Communists in its ranks.

                            <para>- It would be absolute nonsense to say that the only Communists were persons- who were members of the Communist party. If they ceased to be members of the party, they would cease to be Communists. If the party were dissolved, there would be no Communists. We must define the persons that the Government wants to get at and who, as I understand it, the Opposition also wants to get at. The definition of a Communist must have reference to the beliefs or practices that he espouses. I suggest that there is firm support for the definition in the bill. It is the way in which Communists in Australia define themselves. I refer the committee to the report of the Victorian royal commission on communism.

                        <para>The 1048 Constitution of the Communist Party of Australia, however, speaks of " Marxism-Leninism, the basic theory of our party ", and it is necessary that I should explain the relationship of this theory to that expounded in the Manifesto and elsewhere by Marx and Engels. What I have already cited shows unmistakably that they contemplated violence and force as an accompaniment of the revolutionary change, but there is much to show that both Marx and Engels in their later years thought that violence might not always be necessary, and that in countries like England and U.S.A., other methods might alleviate and change the  position  of the working masses. </para>

                        <para>Lenin would have none of this, and later I shall point out his attitude to those Who thought that capitalism could be reformed so as to be tolerable to the proletariat. Wherever he deals with these matters he is uncompromising in his opposition. He regarded Marxism as a living force which called for development to keep pace with life, and therefore with the phenomenon of monopoly capitalism or imperialism. He considered, too, that the Second Internationale, in accepting the doctrine _ of national defence, had abandoned the Marxian view that "the workers have no country". He insisted on a return to Marxism. Moreover, he emphasized again and again the revolutionary aspect of the Manifesto. "Leninism ", said Stalin, " is Marxism of the era of imperialism and of the proletarian revolution. To ,be more exact, Leninism is the theory and tactics of the proletarian revolution in general, the theory and tactics of the dictatorship of the proletariat in particular ". And Stalin himself, in the preface to the work quoted from, is said to bo the foremost living MarxistLeninist scholar of to-day. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is a good deal to support the proposition that is contained in this definition that a Communist is a  person  who supports or advocates the objectives, policies, teachings or practices of communism as expounded by Marx and Lenin. I emphasize those words. Tt is not just some particular part, but the policies of communism - the conception of communism as expounded by Marx and Lenin. Let me illustrate what I mean by reference to an entirely different subject, and one which I hesitate to associate with the subject of communism. Supposing we were considering a definition which had relation to, shall we say, Christianity, as expounded by the Roman Catholic Church. We would be immediately concerned with the totality of the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. It would not be said, for example, that the people who believed in the doctrine of the Trinity were necessarily persons who came within that definition, because although the doctrine of the Trinity may form part of the total concept of Christianity as expounded by the Roman Catholic Church, surely there are people who could believe in that doctrine without believing in the totality of Christianity as expounded by that church. I think that is true of this definition. It does not create the difficulty that because Marx happened to expound some particular doctrine on taxation, therefore everybody who believes in that doctrine would be caught by this proposition, any more than the person in my illustration who believed in the doctrine of the Trinity would come within the definition I have used as an illustration. </para>

                        for the very interesting and informative discussion that he has just embarked upon. I think his picture of the difficulty that arose in connexion with one particular religion poses exactly the difficulty that arises in relation to the definition. The Minister was good enough to embark upon a rather lengthy discourse. I appreciate  very fully the difficulty of denning a " Communist ". I am glad that it was his responsibility and not mine, because it is a matter of the greatest difficulty. I was interested to hear from the Minister how he and the Government interpreted the very wide scope of this definition. If he, as a lawyer, and I, as a lawyer, and others, had such difficulty, what is to be the position of the. ordinary man or woman in the street? There may be many people in the community who have never heard of Marx and have never read a line of his writings. They would not know what the totality of the concept of communism was. let alone what constitutes a quarter, a third, or a half of it. There would be many honest people in the community who, in the ordinary course of their lives, could advocate the very concepts of Marx and Lenin. The Minister supplied a very good answer with his illustration. I sympathize with his point of view and I ask him to appreciate the great difficulty of the  ordinary man in the community. . That is what I am most concerned about. Would he go so far as to say, in the .light of the discussion and debate on the second reading of the measure, that an essential element in the Government's concept of a Communist, under this definition, would be that that person should have a revolutionary tendency, or, in other words, an intention or desire to achieve his objects by revolutionary tendencies or action? By revolutionary I do not mean merely strong action, but action that contemplates the overthrow by force of society or any phase of society as we know it to-day. For the sake of easing the minds of the ordinary people in the community will the Minister make it clear that a person will not be declared unless he has a revolutionary objective - not a person who abstractly picks up one or other of the doctrines advocated by Marx or Lenin, as the Minister referred to a concept of Roman Catholicism.

                    <para>I am voicing this aspect of the matter, not because we are suggesting an alteration, but to clarify the position for the ordinary people. The Opposition does not -propose to alter it. We realize the grave difficulty of defining "Communist". If the Minister, on behalf of the Government, could give us an indication how he will apply it, that would be a real help, not only to the committee, hut also to many people in the general community who would be hesitant about embarking on discussions that otherwise they would have no reluctance to undertake. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. They sought the same objectives. Let us consider for a moment <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe's report. In that report he stated: " Marx laid the foundation in collaboration with Frederick Engels ". In fact, Engels played a part second to none in elaborating the teachings mentioned in the fourth paragraph of the clause. As I view communism, its philosophy was laid down by Marx and Engels, and Lenin and Stalin were products of another generation. Leninism sets out the tactics that are to be employed in implementing the ideals of Marxism. Apart from the fact that members of the Australian Labour party disagree fundamentally with the ideology of the Communists, which has been transplanted to this country, they also differ from Communists in their conception of the tactics that should be employed to improve the lot of society. I do not suggest for one moment that I know as much law as the Attorney-General or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> does, but, like many other members of the Labour movement, I have given the best years of my life seeking for a panacea to cure the ills that afflict society to-day. I see grave dangers in the definition of "Communist " contained in the clause. I was pleased that the Attorney-General did not pretend, for a moment, to suggest that he could explain all the consequences that may ensue from the passage of this legislation. The plain fact is that some of the greatest minds of the world have endeavoured to solve the social problems which confront us, but have not succeeded in doing so. At the same time we must  recognize that many of the views put forward by social reformers of the past have since been accepted and implemented. During Marx's lifetime there was great controversy about the respective merits of Marxism and the views put forward by Henry George. </para>

                    <para>In the State of Victoria, which I represent, great concern has been caused by the interrogation of a group of young Jewish migrants, who are  certainly  not Communists. The fact that that interrogation has taken place shows that we must be on our guard to conserve the rights and liberties of all sections of the community. The definition of "Communist" is so wide that it could embrace almost every member of the community. I realize the difficulties which confront the Government in endeavouring to draft legislation that will be effective, and I admit that its task is not easy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> mentioned, in some detail, the legal difficulties that may confront the Government in enforcing this measure. I am not concerned so much about the position of members of the Australian Labour party, who have behind them an organization which is sufficiently large to protect their rights, as I am about the position of members of small political and social groups who have not that protection. I suggest fo the Attorney-General that he should seriously consider the views expressed by members of the Opposition and the criticisms they have to offer of the definition of " Communist " so as to prevent the bill from doing injustice to individuals in the community. </para>

How, therefore, is an individual to be charged with being a Communist when there is no such organization as the "Communist party "? In its present form the definition of " Communist" is so wide that any one who subscribes to even one of the manifold radical views expressed by Marx or Engels is liable to be declared a Communist. A devotee of some particular religious faith might feel that because another individual was preaching the doctrine of atheism that that individual was engaged in a Communist activity, and might move the Government to " declare " that individual. Many of the current political, social and philosophical ideas are identical with views expressed by Marx, and it is obvious that under the present definition of " Communist ",  people  who urge those views, irrespective of their motive or standing in the community, will be liable to be declared. 1 therefore urge the Government to re-draft the definition of " Communist" so as not to jeopardize the freedom of ordinary, decent citizens and to set out more precisely what kind of subversive activity renders an individual liable to bc be declared. </para>

                        <para>- It does not follow that because a person calls himself a Communist he has read the works of Marx. To illustrate my argument, I mention that Marx is reported to have stated on one occasion : " I have sown a harvest of dragons, and I have reaped a harvest of fleas ". He meant to imply that the would-be interpreters of his philosophy were really mental pigmies, and did not understand what he had written. Is it not an obligation of the Government to appoint as its adviser some one who is familiar with the works of Marx and is expertly acquainted with Communist teachings? Apparently, the Government wants to deal with persons who advocate the overthrow of society by violence. Lenin is reported to have stated that Marx refused to be associated with Bakunin because he regarded Bakunin as the representative of anarchy, in that he had advocated the organization of groups for the purpose of overthrowing society by violence. In their manifesto Marx and Engels stated very clearly and definitely that the Communist party should be a majority party, consisting of a majority of the working class, and not a separatist organization or a minority organization. As I have already pointed out, the definition of " Communist " in the clause would, entitle a judge to determine for himself, without any real guidance from the legislature, who is a " Communist ". I have often heard judges complain that the Parliament passes legislation, which the judges have to implement, without clearly indicating its intention. Of course, if the interpretation placed upon legislation by a judge meets with the approval of the government he is regarded as a sound jurist, but if his interpretation does not coincide with the government's views then he is condemned as being a poor jurist. Lenin has been described as a man who developed the theories of Marx and placed his own interpretation upon them. In fact, Lenin divided Marx's philosophy . into three parts. The materialist conception of history meant, according to Lenin, that as the material conditions under which men and women work and live change, so their political and social ideas also change. For example, persons who are financially embarrassed or on the breadline, view matters very differently from other people more favorably placed. The craftsman enjoys conditions that are materially different from those of the workers engaged in intensive repetition work. Then he went on to explain at great length how those material conditions affected the ideas of the people. The other component that he laid down was the theory of surplus value. That means the value that is appropriated in the form of rent, interest or profit, after the cost of production has been met. I use the words " cost of production " in their widest sense. The cost of production includes wages, payments for raw materials, managerial expenses, and so on. Then he laid down another component, the theory of class struggle. He pointed out that there was a struggle between the " haves " and the " havenots ". That struggle has been going on over the ages, and it is becoming more and more intense. Those briefly are the three parts of Lenin's interpretation of the Marxist philosophy. The  Marxist  philosophy is. laid down in three volumes, the first and most important of which was written while Marx was alive. The other two were added by Engels from notes left by Marx. One of the objectives at which Karl Marx aimed was to change the state of society. He believed that the means of life - in other words the means of production - should .be owned in common by the people, rather than by a few privileged persons. The Marxist philosophy is- not a dogma, but a guide to action, having in view the conditions and circumstances peculiar to each country. For example, the guide to action in China would be very different from the guide to  action in a country such as Australia where every adult person has a vote, and where changes for the better can be made in a constitutional manner; but, where people are denied the right to vote, and are suppressed and frustrated, the guide to action would be very different from what it would be in Great Britain and in this country. No country in the world provided Marx with a better opportunity to study, and elaborate on his principles, than did Great Britain. He had full access to documents in the British museum. Lenin contended that the Marxian philosophy was based on German philosophy, English political economy, and French socialism. Therefore, Marxian philosophy is a profound study. My opinion is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe has not read the Marxian philosophy to satisfy his own mind. He has judged it on the evidence of people who considered themselves to be Communists. Possibly they had ideas that were quite alien to the philosophy of Marx. Just imagine putting the Marxist philosophy in the form of an act before a judge, and placing on him the full responsibility of interpreting what is meant by the definitions in this bill ! As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Katz</inline> said, this is a drag-net definition.. Surely there is an obligation on the makers of a law to supply a reasonable definition. That could be done quite easily if the Government so desired. It could define a Communist, for instance, as " a person who advocates the overthrow of society by violence ". Surely that is not beyond the capacity of the Leader of the Government or of the Attorney-General. I say, therefore, that whilst the Government could supply a clear definition of " Communist it has not done so. Instead it has left the matter open to interpretation. </para>

                        has used the word " revolution ". We very often refer to a " revolutionary " change when we do not mean bloody revolution, but a social revolution, brought about by constitutional means by people meeting together and discussing dispassionately and intelligently what can be done to change the state of society for the better. In logic, a thesis is laid down. Then there is the antithesis and ultimately there emerges what is known as the synthesis. Syntheses are frequently the basis of laws, particularly in countries where the people have an adequate franchise. Having all these things in mind, I consider that the Government is not justified in producing a definition such as this. I repeat that it is not beyond the capacity of the Government to set out specifically what it has in mind. The Government is taking action against persons who call themselves Communists. There is no reason why it should not be specific. To place a definition such as this in the hands of a judge is merely, to use a colloquialism, " passing the buck". The Government is quite capable of doing the job itself, but for obvious reasons - I say this without the least desire to be offensive - it does not propose to do that. It prefers a dragnet definition so that it will be able t« indict suspected persons such as, perhaps,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                        and others who have tried to get some clarity on the matter. When the late John Burns was indicted by certain members of the public after his resignation from the English Cabinet as the result of the declaration of war in 1914, he said that most people were either slaves of shibboleths or prisoners of phrases. Quite a number of people who say that they are Communists have not the slightest idea of what communism means, and very often people who say theY are not Communists are in fact Communists. When the acid test is applied, as it is periodically, and men have to decide where they stand, not by their words but by their actions, very often people who claim to be Communist* are found not to be Communists, and others who claim to be anti-Communist*, are found to be Communists.

                        has failed to reply - perhaps inadvertently - to my reference to the Acts Interpretation Act. If he is to make a further comment on this definition, I invite him to say whether, by subs ti tut- - ing the singular for the plural, the definition could be regarded as including : person who advocates "a teaching" of communism as expounded by Marx an-! Lenin. I am suggesting that unless some contrary intention is shown, that may he a proper interpretation under the Acts Interpretation Act.

                            <para>- I agree. I thought the Opposition had put the viewpoint rather effectively that there are so many teachings and so many phases of communism that it is a proper interpretation of this definition to say that a Communist means a person who advocates a teaching, a principle, or a practice of communism. If the Acts Interpretation Act does apply, I submit that that interpretation will stand unless it is expressly negatived. I know what the Government is aiming at. It wants to include within the provisions of this bill the person whom we know tobe a Communist, although we are in the greatest difficulty in defining the term. I readily concede the Government's difficulty. However, the Attorney-General will admit I am sure that the net cast by this definition is exceedingly wide. I should like to know whether he has in mind that, in administering this definition or acting under it, he will look for a revolutionary tendency in the sense that I put to him not long ago. Again I invite the Attorney-General to say something on the question that I have posed in relation to the application of the Acts Interpretation Act to this definition. </para>

                        <para>. - Before the suspension of the sitting, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> had indicated that he felt some difficulty in relation to the definition of " Communist " by reason of the application to it of the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act, which provides that words importing the plural shall include the singular. When one looks at this definition, no difficulty whatever is presented by reason of the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has not given sufficient emphasis to the words of the definition, particularly the words - </para>

After all, " the objectives " is a collective conception, and to think of that term as a singular conceptis to misread the clause and change its meaning to "an objective". That would be changing the meaning of the clause altogether: </para>
                    <para>It seems to me to be perfectly clear that if one applies the relevant Acts Interpretation Act section to this definition in the manner in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> suggests is possible, the only possible result is that one then reads "the objective". That would not make sense in this context once it was found that communism involved more than one objective. I suggest that analysis of the problem completely answers the suggestion that difficulty arises because of the application of the Acts Interpretation Act. </para>

                        and some other speakers have also made some suggestion that it might be possible to get over this difficulty of definition by emphasizing the revolutionary character of the activities of the organization. Quite frankly, I would not be prepared to go that far I invite honorable senators to turn to the paragraph of the preamble which reads as follows :  -
                    </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>And whereas the Australian Communist party, in accordance with the basic theory of communism as expounded by Marx and Lenin, engages in activities or operations designed to assist or accelerate the coming of the revolutionary situation in which the Australian Communist party, actingas a revolutionary minority, would bo able to seize power and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That accurately states the present objective of the Australian Communist party. It is expressed in a form which recognizes the possibility that the present activities in which that body may be engaged may not, of themselves, be revolutionary activities, but are activities or operations which, in the minds of the members of that body at any rate, are designed to accelerate the coming of a revolutionary situation. As I understand it, the members of the Communist body look forward to a set of circumstances in which they can say, " We now have a revolutionary situation ". That may be brought about by all sorts of circumstances. In their conception, it might come about of itself as I understand it or a situation could be assisted and accelerated .by activities which, in themselves, are not necessarily revolutionary activities. For that reason, I would not accept a suggestion that this definition should necessarily include some words which refer to revolutionary action. </para>
                    <para>The problem which this committee is faced with to-night in making up its mind about this definition is one which members of the Opposition must face themselves for their own purposes. If they have a better definition than this one, now is the time to bring it forward. As I understand it, this measure, insofar as it provides for the dissolution of the Communist party, will become law and before very long it will be impossible for the Labour party to define Communists for the purposes of its party platform and its own constitution by reason of membership of the Communist party. </para>

                            <para>- I am giving honorable senators opposite full credit for that. As I understand it, they do not want Communists in the Australian Labour party and if this measure becomes law, they will have to find some means to define what a Communist means. They will not be able to define him by reference to his membership of the Communist party, because that will have gone. So this problem, with which all honorable senators are faced as a legislature, is something that honorable senators on the opposite side should not try to escape from if they are sincere in their protestations. If they have any concrete suggestions to make on how this definition can be improved, I shall be interested to hear them, but the Government has not heard any yet. </para>

                            <para>- Let me come to express terms. The Attorney-General said that it was wide, and unquestionably it is, and that acknowledgement justifies many of the fears that this party has entertained about the measure. I concede at the beginning of my remarks that there is grave difficulty in defining a. Communist, and I should not like to be faced with the Attorney-General's task. I intimated that the Labour party did not propose to amend the definition. The Attorney-General has been good enough to refer to the recitals of the bill, indicate that what the Government has in mind is a body that is concerned with revolutionary activity, or which, if not revolutionary in character in itself, is designed to further, or assist, the Communist objective. That rather answers the second question that I posed to him as indicating that the Government is focusing its mind on activities that  are revolutionary, either directly or indirectly, in their operation. That reassures the Opposition very appreciably and, to a very great extent, removes the fears of the Opposition about the use of this wide definition in the hands of the Government. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>Regarding the Acts Interpretation Act, and the third question that I raised, I agree that in reading this clause as now drafted the word "the" is not affected. The word " objectives " may become " objective ", the word " teachings " may become " teaching ", " policies " become *' policy " and so on, each one of them having reference to a concept of communism. I think I can accept the argument that the Attorney-General has posed that whether the matter is expressed in the singular or plural, one comes to a total concept of communism. </para>
                    <para>The Attorney-General referred to the difficulties which will face political parties in identifying Communists after this bill becomes law and when, according to law, there will no longer be any members of the Australian Communist party. That body is to be banned by the Parliament and therefore will have no further entity. The point raised goes to the very root of one of the objections to the measure that was raised by the Opposition. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber have never differed from the Government in its broad purpose to ban communism and to take true Communists out of key positions in the unions which are related to vital industries. There is no argument about that. The Labour party has been doing a great deal in that field, as I indicated in my second-reading speech. The danger that was seen by the Labour party was that those people would no longer be identifiable in the community, and would present as grave a problem to the Liberal party and the Australian Country party as to the Labour party. Knowing the Communists and something of their machinations, I suggest that they will commence a process of infiltration of bodies that at the moment are completely free of them. The grave difficulty that will face executives of the organizations is that those persons will not have a label, and the very difficulty posed by the Attorney-General will then arise. Nobody will be able to say, "You are a member of the Communist party". </para>
                    <para>If it is desired to bring under the provisions of this legislation persons who were once members of the Communist party, it will be necessary to invoke the retrospective provisions which are admitted to be among its unpleasant features. It will be necessary to declare that a person who was, at some date prior to the passing pf the act, a Communist, may not be a member of the Labour party, or the Liberal party or the Australian Country party. That indicates one of the very real difficulties which will arise cut of the proposed method of dealing with the situation. The difficulty will arise, not only in connexion with political parties, but also in connexion with al! sorts of organizations which, at the moment, are happily free of Communist infiltration and influence. We may be sure that the Communists will not cease their activities. According to the findings of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe, who inquired into the activities of the Communist party in Victoria, there are 13,000 active members of the Communist party in this country. At the last general election, 89,000 people voted for Communist candidates. I do not believe that they were all Communist supporters or sympathizers. Many thousands of them, I am sure, were among those who voted straight down the ballotpaper, having no sense of civic responsibility. In some States, the Communist candidates occupied No. .1. position on the ballot-paper, and therefore attracted votes from people with no sense of responsibility. </para>

                            <para>- There must be some advantage in it, judging by the eagerness with which the position is sought by candidates for Parliament. Whether the number of Communists in Australia be 1 3,000 or 30,000, it represents a great many persons who must be kept track of by the security service, in order to make sure that they are no longer advocating Communist doctrines, or dc ing the work of Communists. It would appear that a constant check will have to be kept on the social, cultural and political life of the country in order to achieve the broad objective regarding winch  the Opposition and the Government  are at  one. </para>

                            <para>- It may be so described, but the change-over from the feudal system to the present industrial system in Europe was described as an industrial revolution, even though it was not a bloody revolution. The change was peaceful. Karl Marx advocated many of the methods that are necessary to bring about a more just state of society. There is at present among the people an urge for reform. They do not want to go  back to the conditions that existed before the war. Any one who has a real interest in the welfare of his country at the present time must be in favour of reform. The definition of " Communist " in the bill is so broad that it could include any person who genuinely desires to promote the welfare of his fellow men. Karl Marx wrote most of his works 100 year ago, and many of the reforms he then advocated have since been put into effect. </para>

We do not want this legislation to represent an attempt to -perpetuate a system that is already in the final stages of decay. This definition is very wide and inherently dangerous. The Opposition does not intend to move that it be deleted, but I suggest that the Government give serious consideration to narrowing and defining its field of application. </para></speech>

                    <para class="block">I interjected when the Minister for Trade and "Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> was speaking, and asked him exactly what he meant by " the theory of - communism ". All that the Minister did in reply to my remark was to read something allegedly written -by Stalin. That was not a reply to my interjection. I have asked the Attorney-General to explain precisely what he means by " the theory of communism " but he has not done so. That indicates that the Government has not made the study of what we call communism that we are entitled to expect of i t, especially as the writings of those who are accepted as authorities upon the subject are readily available. In the Parliamentary Library there is a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Marxian Economic Handbook</inline> by an author named W. H. Emmett, a Sydney engineer, who lias devoted approximately 25 years of his life to studying the writings of  Marx.  He is not a member of the Communist party, the Labour party,, or any other political party. He considers, in my opinion correctly, that thereis not that intelligent approach to the problem that there should be. That is one of the reasons why he acts in an isolated capacity. Another book in theParliamentary Library is entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Handbook of Marxism,</inline> written by Emile Burns. It is a compilation of most of the writings of Marx. In -my judgment, if the Government analysed and studied thewritings of Marx intelligently and critically, its approach to this problem would be very different from what it is. I have another book, which is not, as far as I know, available in the Parliamentary Library, containing an interpretation of Marxism, by Lenin. It would have been easy for those who drafted this bill toapply their minds to the problem and. having done so, to decide exactly what they meant and state specifically the acts that they considered Communists would commit and against which they desired to protect the community. Instead, we have mere assumptions. Reference is made in the preamble to the teachings of Marx. I had not heard one Government supporter explain what they are, although the Minister for Trade and Customs quoted a passage from Stalin's writings. That is rot satisfactory from the viewpoint of the Opposition or the judges who will be called upon to interpret the measure. Lawmakers are under an obligation tomake their intention as clear as it can be made. That has not been done in relation to this bill, although it could easily have been done. </para>
                    <para>Terms are often misused. Hitler misled millions of Germans by claiming that he was advocating and giving effect to what he called national socialism. No person who has any knowledge of the philosophy of Marx would accept what Hitler said. Although he described what he was doing as socialism, he was actually giving effect to a most vindictive form of capitalism known as fascism. He succeeded in misleading, not only millions of Germans, but also many persons in other countries, including the present Prime Minister of Australia, who. on the 12th December, 1938, in St. Stephen's Church, in Sydney, actually defended and justified what Hitler was doing to re-arm Germany. </para>

                        analogy that is not scientifically correct, but is sufficiently accurate to express the philosophy of Marx. He said that contained in society are the elements of its own negation and reconstruction. In order to present that statement in, a3 it Were, its elementary form, I have likened -Society to an apple ripening on a tree. Contained in that apple are the elements cf its own negation and reconstruction. The seeds do not mature nor are
                        <inline font-style="italic">they</inline>
                        released until the apple is rotten ripe. That is what is happening to society. In Russia, society had to become rotten ripe before the revolution occurred. Had the intelligentsia, or alleged intelligentsia, of Russia made an intelligent approach to the problems with which they were faced, as I am requesting the Government to do now, the Russian revolution, with its tragic consequences, might never have happened. That remark applies equally to the eastern countries now.

                    <para>There is a great deal more in thi, problem than the Government seems to think there is. It appears to me that it lias acted upon mere assumption and has indulged in wishful thinking. If it is not prepared to make the intelligent approach that can be made to this problem, and to study social problems as a scientist Studies scientific problems, it must accept the responsibility for the consequences. Dealing with the definition, I am certain that those who were responsible for it, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe, have not even a nodding acquaintance- </para>

I say emphatically that it was not correct. He did not make that intelligent approach to, and critical analysis of, the problem that, as a royal commissioner, he was under an obligation to make. Just as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe was under an obligation to study this problem as it should be studied, so are the Attorney-General and the other members of the Government under such obligation but, instead, they ask the Opposition and the people of this country to accept mere generalizations, which may mean nothing or everything. They have refused even to narrow the definition in the manner suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> by using the singular rather than the plural. </para>

                    <para>I believe that our criticism of the definition is justified, especially as there are thousands of unsophisticated persons in this country who do not study these questions as they can be studied and who, for very obvious reasons, will be caught in the net cast by this measure. The ultimate result may be that the innocent will be punished for the sins of the guilty. Then the Government will say that it has banned communism, but all that it will have done will have been to make communism even stronger than it was before. There are circumstances over which the Government has no control. They are rapidly changing economic conditions to which Marx directed attention. If the Government ignores those circumstances and approaches the problem in the way in which it has done, then the responsibility for what will happen will be the responsibility of the Government and not of other people. I have said before that practical experience without theory is blind, but theory without practical experience is futile. The most balanced approach to a problem is the approach made by men who have practical experience plus theoretical knowledge, but that has not been the approach in relation to this bill. . The Attorney-General, other members of the Government and the draftsman who arc responsible for this definition are as capable as is anybody else of preparing a clearer definition, and one that will specify the acts against which it is desired to protect the community, provided they will apply themselves to the task, but they have not done so. The policy of the Government has been to try to stampede us into acquiescence. It wanted the Senate to declare the bill an urgent bill and * to apply the " guillotine " in order to avoid the discussion that is necessary if we are to prevent the commission of the acts which the present Government parties condemn and which the Labour party condemns. Unless the Government reconsiders this definition, it will not discharge its obligation to the people and to the judges who will have to interpret the measure. </para>

                        <para>. - When I spoke on the motion for the second reading of this most amazing bill, I said that, to my mind, this definition was the most important part of it. [ regret deeply that, so far, nothing has been clone by the Government to alter it. This definition is more important than the onus of proof provisions. People will be caught in its wide net, and the onus of proof provisions will not apply until then. When my colleagues <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Katz</inline> were addressing the committee I was reminded of a verse in the scriptures.

                    <para>The definition of " Communist " in the clause is the most amazing definition that 1 have ever seen. It is apparent from the speeches of supporters of the Government, both in this chamber and in another place, that they expected that when this measure was introduced, the magic word " abracadabra " would be uttered and the measure would be passed by both Houses of the Parliament and receive the Governor-General's assent within a short space of time. Thereafter the Communist party would cease to exist. As honorable senators are aware, Great Britain still remains the father and mother of political liberty. Yet the Government of Great Britain was not so stupid as to introduce a bill ' such as the one now before the committee. The Labour party in GreatBritain was far too well informed oil. sociology, history, and the respectivemerits of Leninism and Stalinism tointroduce such a measure. The supporters of the Government are now beginning to discover the difficulties associated with this matter. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has already pointed out, if theCommunists change their name it will bedifficult to pursue them. </para>

                            <para>- From time to time the opponents of Labour have been called, the Liberal party or the United Australia, party according to the time and place. It has been claimed that Marxism and: Leninism are synonymous terms. That is incorrect. In point of fact, Lenin modified the doctrine of Marx. He interpreted Marxism in relation to conditions in Russia. Let us consider what has been, the attitude towards this subject in several democratic countries. Until lately there were fourteen Communist members of" Parliament in Norway. As a result of propaganda in the unions and what we would call leagues, there are now no Communists in the  Parliament  of Norway. That country was not so foolish as to* introduce a measure of this description. Likewise in Sweden the number of Communists has been greatly reduced by propaganda. Despite the strong: Catholicism that exists in Belgium, theParliament of that country has not introduced a measure of this kind. </para>

                            <para>- It is not fantastic. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Treatt has said that that is so in as many words. I recollect that in the House of Representatives towards the end  of  the Eighteenth Parliament the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> stated that opponents of Labour had claimed that there was no difference between members  &lt;of  the Labour party and Communists. The Liberal " storm-troopers called M hear hear ", whereupon the right honorable gentleman said that that would do him. Honorable senators opposite cannot have it both ways. Although the Government believes that that is a fact, it has not the guts to say so in the definition, because every social reformer and every member of the Labour party throughout the world could be included in it. Even the  President  of France,  M.  Auriol, who is a socialist, and other followers of the policies of St. Simon in that country, would be included. George Plekanoff, the great Russian economist, would also have been included. Judging from the expressions on the faces of honorable senators opposite it is obvious that I might just as well be talking about Mars. However,  I  remind the committee that the personal liberty of 8,000,000 citizens is at present in the hands of people who apparently have not even read a book on sociology. Having gone so far as to refer in the definition to people who subscribe to thedoctrines of Marx and Lenin, I wonder that the Government did not also refer  to  the advocates of the doctrines of Stalin.  I  contend, however, that the definition should merely have involved those "who are members of the Communist party ". It is quite evident that the members of the trade union movement in this country consider that the definition has been framed to include them. </para>

                            <para>- If that were so I should get more for it from them than from the intelligentsia in this chamber. The Australian Council of Trades Unions has carried resolutions of protest against this definition, because it considers that trade unionists would be within the definition. I do not believe that this bill has been introduced solely for the purpose of banning the Communist party. In trying to justify this definition the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer),</inline> who is at least more logical in his arguments than some of his colleagues - although that is not saying very much for him - mentioned the findings of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe. I have yet to learn that that gentleman is an authority on communism. He obtained all of his knowledge about the Communist party through an informer named Sharpley. I must say that prior to the appointment of the royal commission on communism in Victoria I had never heard of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lowe. I make that remark with all respect due to the judiciary. Marx probably had almost as great an influence on humanity as any man that ever lived. But even people who claim to be Marxists have fought amongst themselves and split into factions. When Lenin introduced his new economic policy he said that the Marxist doctrine would be inappropriate in Russia. Marxists claim that the Stalin philosophy is not Marxism. I do not think it is either. Tito claims that he has adopted Marxian theories. In China the Communist leader Mao Tse-tung fell out with Stalin and stated that he intended to apply his own Marxian theory to China. He was thereupon expelled from the central committee, and a Russian was sent to China to take control. </para>

                            <para>- That poses the question whether Stalin or Mao Tse-tung was Marxian. The whole of the socialist movement of the world is opposed to Stalinism. Every member of the Labour party in England is a socialist. In the last 30 years I have never- denied that I am a socialist. There is no such thing in existence as communism. The definition of " Communist " is so wide that I submit in all humility that if it is allowed to stand the Government will be a laughing-stock. It should be withdrawn and re-drafted so as to be at least intelligent, if not intelligible. </para>

                    <para class="block">I point out that as a result of amendments foreshadowed and circulated by the Opposition in the House of Representatives, the Government moved to alter the original clause so as to permit organizations to have access to the supreme court of a State as well as to the High Court. The present defini tion of " the appropriate court " provides that any organization concerned! by this legislation may apply to the supreme court of a State in which a majority of its members reside.

It. may well happen that an organization! which has representatives in, say, six States, may not have a majority  of  its: members residing in any  one  State.

I intend to move, therefore, that any such body shall be permitted to appeal to the supreme court of a State in which a substantial number of its members reside.

                        <para>. - I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that on this occasion he might extend to the Government similar consideration" to that which I extended to him in the first amendment to the bill that he moved in committee. There is not a great deal at stake, but I suggest that the substitution of the term "substantial number " for " majority " in this particular definition may create difficulties. As the clause stands at present, an organization which has been declared has three choices. It can appeal to the High Court, when it will experience no difficulty whatever, and where no question can arise about whether a substantial number of its members reside in a particular State. In the second place, it can appeal to the supreme court of the State in which its principal office is situated. In the third place it can approach the supreme court  of  the State in which the majority of its members are resident. I suggest that most  of  the organizations that may be affected by the legislation will not experience any difficulty in proving to the satisfaction of a State supreme court that a majority of its members reside in a particular State. There will be no practical difficulty, of course, in the way of an organization taking full advantage of the appeal provisions by approaching either the High "Court or the supreme court of the State in which its principal office is situated. Even assuming the existence of the difficulty suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> which is that an organization may not have a majority of its members resident in any particular State, I suggest that the organization already has ample rights of appeal. The Government wants to avoid the possibility of a multiplicity of appeals. It is true that some means may be found to  , overcome  the difficulty suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> but if we adopt his proposal we can imagine six separate applications being made to State supreme courts. </para>

                            <para>- How will the application commence? It will be made by certain persons on behalf of an organization, because, in many instances, the organization concerned will be an unincorporated body, and, in consequence, persons will be acting for it. Suppose that an organization has a substantial number of members in each State, and by some process the organizations of that body make application in each of the States to the supreme courts. The applications might even be made by different individuals. That is not outside the bounds of possibility. In any event, I suggest that the term " substantial number " is a somewhat vague expression. If there were no other considerations involved, I concede that there would be some force in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> contention. However, I repeat that an organization affected by this legislation can go to the High Court without any difficulty, or can go to the supreme court of the State in which its principal office is situated. If a majority of its members reside in a particular State, it can apply to the supreme court of that- State. </para>

                        <para>. - I appreciate the comments made by the Attorney - General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> and I regret that my reciprocal treatment of the Government cannot commence at this point. The Attorney-General has pointed out that an organization has three choices in determining what court it shall approach to lodge its appeal. However, in many instances, organizations affected by the legislation will not have a clear majority of members in any one State, and the organization will thereby lose the right to go to the supreme court of a State. The Attorney-General has acknowledged that not a. great deal is involved in my proposal. I suggest, therefore, that since my amendment is designed to concede greater freedom Qf approach to the courts, the Government should be prepared to acknowledge that it is reasonable. In connexion with the suggested use of the term " substantial number ", I point out that the interpretation of that term will be decided ultimately by the courts themselves. The courts must determine whether, as a matter of fact, the organization which presents itself before it in a State has a substantial number of members in that particular State. The substitution of the term that I have suggested for the word " majority " need occasion the 'Government no embarrassment, because the interpretation of that term will be resolved by the courts. Furthermore, as I have already pointed out, the Government has itself employed that term in clause 10 (3.). </para>

                            <para>- I acknowledge that. I do not want a situation to arise whereby an organization may approach the supreme court in six States simultaneously, and the possibility of that occurring did not appeal to me very strongly until it was mentioned by the Attorney-General. I say that only one right of appeal is conferred hy the present clause. The clause does not purport to confer a right of appeal to six supreme courts. I do not think that the possibility envisaged by the Attorney-General will arise. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that it makes any difference whether the State in which the smallest number of members of an organization resides, or the State in which the largest number of members resides, makes the application. The point is that once the matter has been determined by a supreme court, it cannot be raised again in any other supreme court. If the rather extreme position mentioned by the Attorney-General arose, and the members in six States lodged simultaneous applications to the supreme courts in the respective States, the Government would still be a party to all six proceedings. The Attorney-General knows perfectly well that the Government would immediately draw the attention of the courts to the fact that similar applications were pending in other States, and that the courts would say to the applicants, " Make up your minds in which court you want this matter determined ". Five of the courts would! adjourn the matter until it was disposed! of in the sixth court. Once the matter had been determined in that court,  it  would be regarded by the other five courtsas being <inline font-style="italic">res judicata.</inline> I think that  theadoption  of the amendment that I have moved will merely have the effect  of  granting greater freedom of access  om  an even basis to all organizations,  and!  although not a great deal is  involved, Bathe  Attorney-General has himself admitted, the  Opposition  is obliged to pressfor the inclusion of its amendment  in  the bill. </para>

It may be necessary torn ate some consequential alterations? to the clause, and I should like  am  opportunity to discuss that matter with) the Parliamentary Draftsman before  the  matter is finally resolved.

Sometimes the executive positions of organizations rotate amongst the States, whilst the secretary's office,  and  what might be termed " the principal office ", remains stationary. I am  prepared,  of course, to give considerationto the suggestion of the Attorney-General. Like him, I do not wish to rush thismatter without giving it proper consideration. The adoption of the Minister's suggestion may involve implications that I do not see  at  the moment.  My  counter-suggestion would be that  we  postpone consideration  of  this definition  for  the time being, and return to it when we have had an opportunity to consider the position. </para>

In effect, it gives retrospective operation to this proposed law. It enables steps to be taken that could have serious consequences for the individuals concerned. An act that a person committed two years ago and which was not unlawful at that time will become retrospectively unlawful by the operation of this bill. I concede the Government's claim made during the Minister's second-reading speech that there had to be some retrospective effect. I shall not argue that matter, but I now wish to draw attention to two important pronouncements. The present Prime Minister, in his policy speech delivered on the 10th November, stated - </para>

                    <para>That shows that the then joint Opposition parties gave most careful consideratold to the deadline. The electors were told that the deadline was the 10th November, 1949. I concede that some such deadline had to be drawn to avoid the difficulty that would be caused hy people resigning on the day before this bill became operative. Obviously deep consideration was given to the deadline. It was kept secret until the 10th November. Now we find that the hill provides for the deadline to be drawn approximately eighteen months earlier, on the 10th May, 1948. I think that calls for an explanation from the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - First, I emphasize that there is no provision in this bill that has retrospective operation in the sense that a man can be made guilty of acts which, at the time of their commission, were innocent. This bill, in its true interpretation, is entirely prospective in its operation. It is true that power is taken to declare persons of a certain class, and that that class is defined by reference to their membership of the Communist party at any time between the 10th May, 1948- the date on which the party adopted its latest constitution - and the date on which this measure Wl become operative. However, they will not become liable for any offence and they will not suffer any penalty merely because they were members of the Communist party between those dates. Further, it is not possible for the Governor-General under this legislation, as it has been presented to the Parliament, to declare a man merely because he was a member of the Communist party between those dates. The GovernorGeneral has to go further than that. Having found that a man was a member of the Communist party, that is, that he falls into the class of persons referred to in the bill, the Governor-General further has to declare that that man is a person who, at the time of the declaration, is engaged, or is likely to engage, in subversive activities. So, even in making the declaration, the only effect of this reference to membership of the Communist party between the dates referred to is to define a class of persons to whom the bill can be made applicable. The operation of the bill is limited in two respects. First, it can only he applied to persons who fall into a specified  class  and, secondly, the Governor-General must be satisfied that even persons within that class are engaged - not have been engaged - or are likely to engage, in subversive activities. I suggest, therefore, that it is an entirely false approach to this definition to regard this legislation as retro spective in the generally understood sense of that word. </para>

We are at least fulfilling every word of that undertaking. We also believe, from the knowledge we have gained of the subject, that, if we are really going to catch in the net all the people we are after, it is desirable that membership of the Communist party should be relevant as from the date that the latest constitution of the party was adopted, which was the 10th May, 1948. In these circumstances, I suggest that there is no reason whatever why the 10th May, 194S, should not be the specified date for the purposes of the bill. </para>

The Attorney-General said that the Government was honouring the Prime Minister's statement that no person " now " a member of the Communist party would be employed by the Government. If he claims that the Government is doing that and no more, he fails to answer my point that people who were members of the Communist party on 10th May and ceased to be members of it on the following day are still caught up in the declaration. That is unquestionably the case. </para>

                            <para>- If I proposed to reply in kind to that interjection, I might ask who the Government is trying to catch. The Attorney-General has said that the committee would have to accept the position that no penalty followed the declaration of a person as a Communist. There are two elements in the declaration of an individual by the GovernorGeneral. The first is that he is a Communist and was either a member of the Communist party after the 10th May or a Communist within the meaning of the definition that the honorable senators considered this afternoon and is prejudicial to the security of the country, if a man were prejudicial to security in fact and did not fit the definition of a Communist, he could not be declared. </para>

                            <para>- Not under this act. There would then be another course for the Government to take. So roping a person in as a Communist is plainly one of two essential elements that enables him to be declared. Surely the Attorney-General is not going to pretend that the consequences of a declaration are not serious, apart from those expressed in the bill? Those consequences are denial of employment in the Public Service and denial of office in a vital union and the removal from both places of the persons who happen to be in them at the time the declaration is made. What of the odium that will attach to a declaration of that nature? A man will never shed that odium which must attach itself to his family as well as to himself forever, and it may have drastic economic consequences for him and for them. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>The Opposition has expressed grave concern regarding the serious conse quences that flow from a declaration under this bill even as it is proposed to be amended by the Government. A man may be declared on two counts. One is that he is a Communist, and the Government may reach back two years to pick him up. The second count is that he is prejudicial to security. I do not know of any more serious allegation that could be made against a man in any country than that charge which means that he is a traitor and a danger to his country. Such an accusation would make any man a leper in the community. Yet, if I interpreted the Attorney-General's meaning correctly, he put it to the committee that there were no penalties flowing from a declaration under this bill. </para>
                    <para>I suggest that a. declaration attaches to itself the most dreadful social odium apart from the refusal of a position in the Public Service and in a trade union. A man would be branded for ever even if the declaration were set aside later. He would be known and would have the greatest difficulty in getting employment anywhere in the country. I assure the Attorney-General that honorable senators on this side do not regard lightly either the expressed or the unexpressed consequences of a declaration on an individual. That is one of the major factors that have influenced the Opposition in taking such a firm stand on the onus of proof clause which honorable senators will discuss at a later stage. </para>
                    <para>I shall refer now to sub-clause (3.) of the clause that the committee is discussing. At a later stage, subject to the acceptance of an amendment that I shall move to clause 5, I shall move for the inclusion of the words " or appeal " after the words " an application " in sub-clause (3.). I think that it would be more appropriate in any event to postpone consideration of that clause until the committee has dealt with clause 5. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is an amendment that was envisaged by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in the statement that he made recently. It is designed to ensure that before the Governor-General makes a declaration in regard to an organization, a responsible body will examine the material upon which he is to act. The body that has been chosen consists of the heads of three important departments and two other persons. It is thought desirable to bring in also some outside representation to be appointed by the Governor-General. I suggest that the amendment is one which should commend itself to the committee. </para>

                        <para>. - I am happy to reciprocate the courtesy that was extended to the Opposition by the Government earlier to-day when it accepted the amendment that was moved by the Opposition. Honorable senators on the Opposition side approve this new. sub-clause. The establishment of a committee does something to allay the fears that were held by the Opposition that the Attorney-General of the day might act upon a report that had come to him from the security service without screening the information himself and that he would act simply on a recommendation. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Opposition approves completely of the three prominent officers who are named in the amendment. It has great confidence in the three gentleman and is satisfied that the presence of any one of them on a screening committee will eliminate from their consideration any anonymous letters that they might receive and that after scrutiny they will relegate such documents to an appropriate place. </para>
                    <para>I point out that there is no obligation on this committee to furnish a report under the clause as presented. The duty that is cast upon the committee is to consider the material and I have no doubt that it will make a report, but I draw attention to the fact that that is not specified. It has to be assumed that the committee will at least make some recommendation after it has considered the evidence. An assurance was given to honorable senators earlier to-day by the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> that Cabinet itself will give consideration to the case of each person who is declared. I take it that the Attorney-General does not think that I am misrepresenting what his leader said in the course of his reply to the secondreading debate. That also gives the Opposition some confidence that a very high degree of responsibility will be exercised by the Government in determining upon the declaration of any individual. </para>
                    <para>The Opposition made the point ir. earlier speeches that two  Ministers,  neither of whom need be the Ministers in charge of the administration of this bill, might declare a man after reference to the Governor-General, and I believe that that led the Government to give the undertaking that no person will be declared until first he has been screened by this departmental committee. The Opposition has not the slightest objection to the personnel of the committee. On the contrary, honorable senators on this side entirely approve of the personnel  as  far as it is known to them. After the proposed committee has. considered a case, the Attorney-General will make his recommendation and then that will have the consideration of the full Cabinet. If the Opposition had known of these safeguards earlier, they would have allayed some of the fears that have been entertained not only by the Opposition but by thi press and a large section of the public. </para>

Consequently, I suggest a different form of expression. </para>

                            <para>- There is a section in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act which provides that a de-registered union may continue as a voluntary organization, although it loses its corporate entity. As I have said, the declaration of a body would be based on two counts, first, that it was a body that came within the definition in the act, and, secondly, that it was a body the continued existence of which would be prejudicial to the safety of the Commonwealth - in other words, that it was a treacherous, traitorous body engaged in activities designed to undermine the Commonwealth. The act provides that the declared body may appeal against the declaration that it comes within the definition in the act, but it is to have no right of appeal against the more serious allegation that it is a danger to the security of the Commonwealth, and no more serious charge could be preferred against an organization than that. The purpose of my amendment is to allow a declared organization to have access to a court on both points of the declaration, so that it may argue that it is not such a body as is described in the act ; and, even if it is, that its existence does not constitute a danger to the security of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    </continue><para>Later, we shall encounter a similar provision dealing with the declaration of individuals. I have less sympathy with organizations than with individuals, because the dissolution of an organization only means that its members lose the  right of association in a particular way. However, I regard as very serious the refusal of the Government to allow a declared body access to the court in order to obtain a judicial review of the most serious allegation that could be made against it. The Opposition feels strongly on this matter. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - The amendment is unacceptable to the Government. It is curious that the Opposition should persist with an amendment of this kind after it has swallowed the clause that provides for the dissolution of the Communist party itself, without any trial or right of appeal. I understand that the Opposition recognizes that the Communist party itself, is engaged in activities of a treasonable and subversive character. </para>

I ask honorable senators opposite, here and now, whether they approve of the dissolution of the Communist party, without trial and without appeal. That is a test. Only a few minutes ago, the Opposition agreed to clause 4 that has the effect of so dissolving the Communist party. If they do not approve of clause 4, then they were engaged in a pretence when they allowed it to be passed on the voices. </para>

                            <para>- However, I prefer to believe that the Labour party does realize that the Communist party is nothing but a treasonable conspiracy, and that it should therefore be abolished. Well, we have agreed to the clause that provides for the abolition of the Communist party. We now come to the clause which deals with affiliated .bodies, those bodies that may be the future manifestations of the Communist party itself, and as to which the Governor-General in Council may solemnly reach the conclusion that their activities are detrimental to the security and defence of Australia. Could any self-respecting government permit the continued existence of a body regarding which such a solemn declaration had been made? Quite obviously, such a body must cease to exist. The declarations in respect of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> suggests there should be a right of appeal must involve matters peculiarly within the knowledge of the government of the day, and as to which it is its responsibility to make the only effective decision that can be made. The question of whether a person or a body is engaged or is likely to engage in activities prejudicial to the defence or security of the Commonwealth is not one that can be satisfactorily dealt with by a court. That has been recognized by the highest courts of the British Commonwealth. I refer the committee to a passage from the decision of the Privy Council in the <inline font-style="italic">Zamora</inline> case, reported in 1916, 2 Appeal Cases, at page 107.

                            <para>- I am seriously asked by a honorable senator opposite, " What is wrong with that ? " I shall tell him what is wrong with it. Let us assume that there is in existence an organization of the kind referred to in clause 5 and that Cabinet has unanimously and solemnly come to the conclusion that it is engaged in activities prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth. Let us assume that it appeals to a court and that it has the right of trial by jury. If the court or the jury is left in a state of mind in which it is not certain that the organization is engaged in subversive activities - it thinks that it might be, but it is not certain - then, according to the Labour party, the organization must be allowed to continue to carry on its activities. That is the proposition that is advanced by the Opposition, and that is the proposition that it must justify. The proposition is that if the Government says that an organization is engaged in subversive activities and is undermining the security of this country, and if a court, having considered the matter, is left in a state of mind in which it is not satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the organization is engaged in those activities, although it thinks it might be, the organization must be allowed to continue in existence, presumably until it has undermined the security of this country. Apparently, the Labour party is not prepared to agree that anything should be done about it until the damage is done. We are not prepared to accept that proposition. We cannot accept the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- That is in the opinion of the Attorney-General or the government of the day. It is to be left untested by anybody. The bare declaration of the Governor-General, made on the advice of the Executive Council, is to be the factor that will damn an organization for ever, even though the Attorney-General is in possession of all the evidence. No court is to be allowed to throw any light upon the matter. There is to he a complete and utter abrogation of the rule of law, which one would  expect  the Attorney-General to support in unqualified fashion. I reject altogether the suggestion that he made, when running for cover, that he and the Commonwealth should not be compelled to disclose security secrets. Before the Attorney-General recommended that an organization be declared under this measure, he would have, as he has admitted, a mass of evidence at his disposal, gathered from all kinds of sources outside the security service. I do not invite him to disclose the size of the security service, 'but I venture to say that if he mentioned the number of persons who are engaged upon that work, we should see instantly that, in order to justify a declaration of this kind, he would have to rely upon information from all kinds of sources, because an organization of the type that we have in mind would be scattered throughout Australia. It would be wrong if the government of the day, having all the evidence necessary to convict an organization of treason, sedition or subversive activities, made no move to do so. The rule of law is designed to prevent that. This clause provides for arbitrary action by the Executive - unassailable in courts of law and not subject to the processes of law. Under this measure, an issue could be determined upon the " say-so " of the Attorney-General or the Government. It is proposed that the declaration shall be made by the Governor-General, but everybody knows that that is a pure formality. v </para>

In these matters, the Governor-General will act upon the advice of the Executive Council. At a meeting of the Executive Council only two Ministers, neither of whom is the Minister who has sponsored the declaration that may be under consideration may be present. </para>

I played some part in the establishment of the security service that now operates under the formal jurisdiction of the Attorney-General. I have some knowledge of this service, its charter and activities. For two years, I acted as Attorney-General, in the absence from this country of the right honorable member for  Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt).</inline> On only one occasion during that time was it necessary for me to decline to reveal the source of my information. I do not accept for a moment the cover that the Attorney-General seeks when he speaks of the need for secrecy about the security service of this country. That aspect of the matter has already been dealt with adequately by other members of the Opposition, who have referred to the activities- of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States of America and a recent prosecution in England. </para>

                            <para>- I agree that it may be necessary to take precautions to prevent trouble from happening. The security service is available for that purpose. The Government already possesses power to prevent the association of persons for any purpose whatsoever. The Minister has already admitted that the net cast is exceedingly wide. It ranges from bodies affiliated with the Australian Communist party, about which I raise no question, to bodies that may be merely influenced by one or two men. of a large number. I have already cited cases in which kindergarten committees and school committees could be picked out. This is a very wide cast of the net. The Opposition is not prepared to concede the principle that it will stand aside all the processes of law and that the provision for recourse to the courts should be thrown aside in favour of a bare declaration by the Executive Government of the day. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> The power of the Executive to declare without recourse to law has operated in Germany against the Communist party and the Jews. The Social Democrats, a party which was similar to an industrial party in this country, was declared without any reason being given. Even the press of this country expressed horror at that action. The matter never reached the courts, and there was no appeal. In dissolving the Social Democrats party no doubt the executive of the Reichstag thought that it was serving its country. When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said that he would dissolve the Communist party, and the country endorsed his policy, we did not object. However, the right honorable gentleman in his joint policy speech, did not tell the people that his Government would introduce a new law that would enable the Executive to declare a man guilty of a most villainous action, without giving him the right to clear his name before a court. The Government contends that such persons can be charged with an overt actThen the person has to be committed. A group of persons could be charged with conspiracy. This is a serious charge for which the existing law provides heavy penalties, particularly when persons conspire to use violence against the government. The country's intersts  can be protected by bringing the matter quickly before the courts where it can be dealt with effectively. It should not be possible for the Executive to declare groups of persons in this country subversive and give them no right to clear themselves. </para>

                            <para>- They might under the present Government. People declared by any government should have full recourse to the law. The first move made by the Chifley Government against the leaders of the Communist party was to issue a statement about their position. The Government considered that a statement made by the Communists concerned could possibly be interpreted as seditious. But the Government did not abrogate the rule of law in 'this country, the Attorney-General of the day took action. The Parliament made the law, and the courts were there to interpret it. There has been no outcry from anybody. The former .Government did its duty and maintained what we considered to be one, of our most highly 'treasured rights, that is the right of access to and the protection of the courts. I think that we have a strong case. </para>

                        <para>. - I consider that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> has not stated this matter clearly to the committee. He has accused the Opposition of agreeing to the banning of the Communist party, and then of being directly opposed to its former attitude. I point out that the Government has stated to the Parliament that the Australian Communist party is subversive and that it is prepared to follow the members of that body in their various guises. Were that the only consideration we would probably be prepared to look at this matter in a different light. The Government is assuming that the party will adopt other guises, and it intends to declare those bodies. If the Government has evidence that members of the Communist party are trying to retain their organization in another form, I think that it is only fair to the Parliament and to the people that the Government should say to some appropriate body, " We have evidence that this particular organization is an offshoot of the Communist party ". </para>

                            <para>- I disagree entirely. I take the view, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> McKenna has stated it, that there are two points at issue. The Government is conceding only one point. It is not prepared to take up the other attitude. I believe that if the Government has all of the evidence, it should be capable of saying to the court, " These people are subversive ". There should be no diffidence about agreeing to the Opposition's proposed amendment. There is no risk involved in the Government going before an open court and proving that those people are subversive. </para>

                        <para>. - A few nights ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> raised on the adjournment the matter of recruitment for the Australian Regular Army, and I told him then that I would make inquiries of my colleague, the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis).</inline> I have discussed the matter with my colleague, who informs me that the Army estimates provide for 19,000 personnel, of whom 3,000 may be civilians. Every endeavour has been made, not only by the present Government, but also by ' the previous Administration, to bring the Australian Regular Army to full strength, and although a relatively good response has been obtained, the Army is not at full strength and there are vacancies. Because of that situation the Army authorities, by direction of the Government, have been in communication with the War Office in England, and have discussed the position with them. They are now contemplating launching an appeal in the United Kingdom for the recruitment of up to 4,500 personnel for the Australian Regular Army. By agreement with the War Office, recruitment of the personnel will be made from four categories : (a) personnel in the United Kingdom who have served in the British Army during the war and have since been discharged; (6) army personnel, including national servicemen, who have completed their full-time service; (c) personnel in the United Kingdom who have been graded as " B " class for British army requirements; and <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> personnel held on the supplementary reserve of the British Army. </para>

                            <para>- I could not say. Honorable senators may remember that when this matter was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett,</inline> he suggested that it might be wiser to invite suitable men to migrate to Australia, and to enlist them after their arrival in this country. The Minister for the Army informs me that there is no bar to that procedure being followed. Men who migrate to this country from the United Kingdom may join the Australian Regular Army on their arrival, and they will be very welcome if they do so. The last point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett,</inline> was if I may say so, not in keeping with the high tone of his earlier remarks. He suggested that the Australian Government's purpose in recruiting men from the United Kingdom for the Army was to use them, as strike-breakers. My colleague asks me to say that that is not a fair approach to the matter. The present Government, like its predecessor, has a great responsibility to maintain -the Regular Army in a fit . state. The experience of both Administrations has demonstrated the difficulty of maintaining the Army at the strength at which it should be maintained, and I suggest to honorable senators opposite that, instead of making critical comments on the Government's endeavours, they might reasonably be expected to assist us to implement our plans. In conclusion, I say that it ill-behoves an honorable senator who is a member of the Australian Labour party to accuse the present Government of desiring to use the Army for strikebreaking purposes, because in this generation the only occasion on which the Army has been used to break a strike was when it was so used by a Labour administration. </para>

James from his position as resident medical officer at the Repatriation. General Hospital, Heidelberg, Victoria, and I requested information concerning the reason for his dismissal. So far no answer has been forthcoming. The notice of dismissal expired yesterday, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. James</inline> is now out of employment. He says that he does not know the reason for his dismissal. I am informed that he is a particularly brilliant medical officer.

                    <para>In the recent war he had six and a half years service with the Army, including service overseas. During the four years in which he has been employed at the Repatriation General Hospital, at Heidelberg, he has served that institution faithfully and well. He  is  not aware of any complaint having .been.made against him by his superior officers. To indicate his value to the hospital, I mention - that some little time ago he was asked not to take annual  leave because of the pressure of work. There is an acute shortage of doctors, and medical . officers with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. James's</inline> qualifications cannot be picked up every day. At the time of his dismissal, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. James</inline> was engaged in treating arthritis in patients who were also suffering from schizophrenia, tuberculosis or nitrogen mustard cases, and he had undertaken special research in those branches of medicine. </para>

                            is a  temporary officer of the Commonwealth Public Service, the termination of his employment lies with the authority vested in the Repatriation Commission. The Public Service Board does not propose to intervene in this matter. . . .

                    <para class="block">That looks like a clear case of " passing the buck ". First of all, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. James</inline> was informed that the Public Service Board had decided to terminate his employment; but, as the portion of the letter that I have read indicates, he was then informed by the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board that the Repatriation Commission had terminated his employment, and that the board did not propose to intervene in the matter. The doctor is a popular young man, who is well liked by his patients and the staff, and they want to know why he has been dismissed. Forty medical officers at Heidelberg hospital have held a meeting and have requested that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. James</inline> be reinstated in his position pending an inquiry, and I think that that request is fair and reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- He is only a temporary employee, but he is a very brilliant medical officer. Since Australia is short of doctors, I do not think that the matter of his temporary status is relevant. His services should have been retained, at least until a definite charge was made against him and he- was- given  an opportunity to answer it.  His  dismissal at the present time, when so much publicity has been given to the debate on the Communist Party Dissolution Bill, casts a grave reflection upon him. According to my information, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. James</inline> is not a Communist, has never been a Communist, and has no affiliations with the Communist party. I now ask the Minister for Repatriation whether he will appoint a board to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. James</inline> from the Repatriation General Hospital at Heidelberg? </para>

The decision to terminate <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. James's</inline> service was made by .the Public Service Board in accordance with its authority. At this stage I have nothing further to add to the statements that 1 have already made. </para>
