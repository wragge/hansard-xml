                        <para>- Honorable senators have ample protection. I do not think that any, honorable senator has been suspended since I myself  Buffered  that fate years ago. Under my presidency, any honorable senator who has been maligned or attacked by the press, by other members of this Parliament or by any one outside the Parliament will receive the utmost protection. The Senate will give him a good hearing and, if he behaves himself, he will be in no danger of suspension. </para>

                        <para>- Can the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs say whether, at a world Communist conference at Peiping recently, a decision was made, amongst others, to intensify Communist aggression in Australia? Has the press reported that, at that conference, Russia issued direct and  precise orders to its agents to increase communist activities throughout SouthEast Asia and Australia? Did some person claiming to represent Australia at the conference say that Australian ports where action could bo taken were Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne in that order, and that Communists would begin their activities at Brisbane because Communist transport workers there had a strong revolutionary minority that was likely to become a majority this year? Did a high Soviet official tell the conference that, by the summer of  1950,  imperialist war plans would be far developed, and that port and transport workers in communist states, including Australia, must tie up war convoys in the Pacific? Was a passport issued to any person to represent Australia at that conference? If so, to whom and by what government was the passport issued? </para>

                        <para>- I cannot say offhand how many women are employed in Parliament House. I understand that there is a rest room, but I assure the honorable senator that I shall make the fullest inquiries into, the matter. If there is discontent about the accommodation provided I shall see that something is done. Since I have been  President  of the Senate - and in this matter I speak for the present  Speaker  of the House of Representatives and his immediate predecessor - the greatest difficulty that has  confronted the Presiding Officers has been to provide rooms for those who need them. After long experience in the industrial movement I realize that in the Parliament we should do the greatest possible good for the workers, but we have encountered considerable difficulty in making facilities available for members of the Parliament and staff because the space that should be available in Parliament House has been occupied and the building has been turned into a secretariat. That has made the position of the Presiding Officers, who endeavour to do the right thing by members of the Parliament and those who work in Parliament House, very difficult. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the amount of public money involved is negligible in comparison with the importance of the housing problem. If any method exists to overcome the shortage of houses then we should examine it thoroughly. However, I do not want my remarks to be regarded as a complete answer to the honorable senator's question, and I should like it to be placed on the notice-paper so that it can be answered fully. While honorable senators on opposite sides of the chamber may disagree on the methods to be adopted to overcome our housing difficulties I know that we all agree on the need to do the best we possibly can in this matter, and I should not like any honorable senator to feel that that is not being done. </para>

This question involves considerable detail. However, a complete answer to criticism of the kind implied by the interjection made by the Leader of the Opposition is the fact that  no  question relating to matters administered by the Minister for National Development remains unanswered on the notice-paper. </para>

                            <para>- In view of the Government's expressions of goodwill towards East Asian peoples, does it not think that the continued recognition of Chiang Kai-shek, who has no real backing in China, is unjustified, particularly as the Communist <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> government has been recognized by several countries and has the backing of the hundreds of millions of Chinese? How does the Government  hope to promote goodwill by continuing to recognize Chiang Kai-shek who has no backing at all from the hundreds of millions of Chinese? </para>

                        <para>- In reply to the first question, I repeat what I have said in this chamber before, that it is hoped that legislation will be brought down during the present session. That depends largely upon the way in which the business is completed in this chamber and in another place. In regard to the second question, the representations made in writing by the various soldiers' organizations were considered by the subcommittee that was elected by the Cabinet to go into these matters. I personally met the federal officers of various soldiers' organizations throughout Australia and also the  President  of the War Widows Craft Guild, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. G.</inline> A. Vasey. In regard to the third question, the amount asked for by the majority of the organizations in Australia, but not by all of them, was £7 a fortnight or £3 10s. a week. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> in his second-reading speech, particularly emphasized that the Government would not do anything that would be likely to influence the decision of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration on the basic wage case. We can all agree with the necessity for such a precaution, but I remind honorable senators that there is more than one way of killing a cat. The Minister was at great pains to convince the Senate that the Government would not take any steps that might influence the Arbitration Court, but the Governments of Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia, all Liberal administrations, have already intervened in the basic wage hearing. Each of those Governments has requested the court to take into consideration the social services benefits that are available to the people to whom the new basic wage will apply. Apparently, therefore, the Minister for Social Services was speaking with his tongue in his cheek when he assured the Senate that the Government had no intention to influence the Arbitration Court. There is no need for the Government to influence the Arbitration Court, because, as I have pointed out, influence is already being exerted by three State governments, apart from the representations that are being made to the court by the employers' representatives. Therefore, there must be some reason for the Minister's remarks. There must be some expectation that the basis on which the basic wage is calculated will be altered. The Minister also pointed out that statements made by Labour candidates during the recent election campaign indicated the fear that we feel that the payment of child endowment in respect of the first child will be followed by a reduction of the basic wage. During that campaign Labour candidates pointed out, as they have always done, that child endowment is essentially related to the basic wage, and that if benefits made available to the families of married workers are to be taken into consideration by the court there will be a real danger that the court may choose to regard the family unit as consisting only of a man and his wife, or a man, his wife and one child. The Minister endeavoured to offset that criticism by stating that child endowment is a matter for the Parliament, whereas the determination of the basic wage is solely a matter within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. However, if the provision of child endowment is solely a matter for the Parliament, and I believe that it is, I can see no reason why the Government should have any objection to accepting the amendment foreshadowed by the Opposition. The effect of that amendment will he that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court will be instructed by the Parliament not to take into consideration payment of child endowment in respect of the first child of a family when determining the basic wage. The policy of the Government parties concerning this matter as stated by the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> when he appeared before the electors as Leader of the Opposition during the recent election campaign differed from the interpretations that have since been placed upon it 'by the Minister for Social Services when he said - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It seems to me that during the election campaign the present Prime Minister held a different view. I believe that the right honorable gentleman considered then, and still considers, that there is a possibility that the payment of child endowment will have some effect on the determination of the basic wage, and that is why, in my opinion, he mentioned the alternative of making a payment of 10s. per week for the first child. My interpretation of the statement that he made at that time was that regardless of whether the court awarded an increased basic wage, 5s. a week would be paid in respect of the first child; but if the court decided to alter the basis on which it determines the living wage, perhaps, by altering the size of the family unit, the Government would them make a payment of 10s. a week in respect of the first child. Furthermore, the speech made by the Minister for Social Services when he introduced the bill confirms my impression. The Minister said that if the basic wage is altered and its amount is calculated by referring to the needs of a. married couple without children, provision will be made to raise endowment from 5s. to 10s. per week for the first child. I submit, therefore, that the Minister for Social Services and his colleagues feel in their hearts that the,le is a possibility that the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration will, as the result of the passage of legislation now before us, alter the present method of determining the basic wage. </para>
                    <para>Whilst I do not profess to have the legal knowledge possessed by some honorable senators opposite, I understand that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act does not contain any formula to guide the court in fixing the basic wage, which is left almost entirely to the discretion of the court. That act provides that the court may hear and determine all matters relating to payments, wages, hours and conditions of work, privileges and rights or duties of employers and employees. The court is given almost carte blanche authority to do anything that it may consider necessary for the settlement of industrial disputes. Because of its powers the court can determine the basic wage only as the result of an industrial dispute. Because of the " common rule " adopted by the court in making awards, a determination by the court in respect of one industry may be made to apply to other industries, which strengthens the suggestion that the court might feel itself obliged, in fixing the basic wage, to take into account the fact that child endowment is paid in respect of each child. In the State of Western Australia, which I represent, 90 per cent, of the trade unions are registered under the State arbitration court, so that the great majority of the workers of that State are covered by Western Australian awards. Almost the only workers whose conditions are determined by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court are members of Federal unions, and many of these unions are also registered with the State arbitration court. The Parliament of Western Australia passed an amending act, number -50 of 1925, which provides that - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>That is the basis on which the State Arbitration Court in Western Australia determines its basic wage. I emphasize the reference to domestic obligations of the average worker. What are domestic obligations? In the main, they involve the rearing of a family. Under the provision that I have just read the State Arbitration Court, in determining its basic wage, must take cognizance of the domestic responsibilities of employees to whom its wage will apply. I recall that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Dwyer, when he was  president  of the State Arbitration Court of Western Australia, stated that the average family unit in that State was not ti man, wife and two children, but a man, wife, one child and a fraction of one. The State Arbitration Court of Western Australia has always determined its basic wage on a family unit of one man., wife and one child. That point must bo carefully considered, 'because should the State Government desire that social services benefits be taken into consideration in the determination of the Western Australian State basic wage, the endowment of the first child in a family fi t the rate of 5s. or 10s. a week proposed under this legislation would affect the determination of the State Arbitration Court of Western Australia. I assume that the same observation would apply, to determinations of the basic wage by State arbitration courts in other States as well as to that of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Social Services went to great pains to tell the Senate that child endowment was introduced by the Menzies Government in 1941. We are well aware of that fact. However, the succeeding Labour Government had to implement that legislation and meet the financial commitments involved under it from the first payment onwards. The.. Labour party has never claimed that it. introduced child endowment. </para>

                            <para>- What I am saying is that the Labour party never claimed credit for the introduction of child endowment in 1941, but it had to implement the legislation that was introduced by the Menzies Government in that year. I make that clear because it has been implied that the Labour party had endeavoured to gain some popularity based on legislation that had been introduced by another government. However, what the Minister did not tell us was the reason for the complete change of mind of the present non-Labour Government compared with that of the Menzies Government when it introduced child endowment in 1941. He did not tell us that the measure introduced by the Menzies Government excluded the first child from endowment and that that Government was opposed to the endowment of the first child in a family. That is as important as it is illuminating. What is the reason for that change of mind on the part of the non-Labour parties? They changed their minds out of the consideration of political expediency at the recent general election. It is remarkable that the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> who held that portfolio in 1941 when he introduced the Child Endowment Bill, gave various reasons to the Parliament why child endowment should not be provided in respect of the first child in a family. Yet, Government supporters at the last election promised to endow the first child, and they did so .in the belief that that promise would contribute substantially to the defeat of the Chifley Government. The Minister for Labour and National Service in his second-reading speech, when introducing the Child Endowment Bill in 1941, said - </para>

The chief judge pointed out that, considered on the basis of needs only, the basic wage offered only a meagre existence for a family of four. We have always believed that the basic wage should be sufficient to provide a reasonable standard of living for a man, wife and one child and that assistance should be given to parents who have more than one child. I suggest that that is a reasonable approach to child endowment. I have not the slightest doubt that if the whole of the family is endowed, the Arbitration Court will proceed to fix the basic wage on the basis of the needs of a man and wife only. What would be the position in this country if differential wage rates were fixed for single men, men with wives only, and men with wives and children? History has proved that the average employer desires to obtain labour as cheaply as possible. If there were differential rates, which class of person would employers engage ? </para><interjection>

The New Zealand social security legislation gave a family benefit of 4s. per week to dependent children in excess of two. That, I understand, was also the extent of the legislation recommended in the minority report of the Royal Commission on Child .Endowment in 1928. The 11)40 report of the Victorian select committee proposed that the payment should begin at 4s. a week for the fourth child. The many European  schemes  existing before the present war either did not endow the first child or else  paid  it at a lower rate. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> I thank the Senate for its indulgence. I did not intend to speak for so long. However, this legislation is so important that honorable senators should give full expression to their views. It is quite evident from the Minister's words that there was no intention by the Government of 1941 to make child endowment available in respect of the first child., Why have the anti-Labour political parties changed their opinion on this matter? During his second-reading speech on this measure the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> said, <inline font-style="italic">.inter alia -</inline>  . . endowment of children provides practical  encouragement  and aid for those who have the responsibility and privilege of caring for families ... lt is, in effect, a  redistribution  of the national income to achieve that end . . . the expense of roaring a family to maturity .should not bo borne entirely by the parents. </para>

As I have mentioned before, thousands of married couples in Australia reared families before child endowment or bonuses were paid. But now there is a new school of thought. Whether it is called socialism or not is immaterial. Many members of all political parties in this country believe that the less fortunately situated members of the community, from a financial point of view, should be assisted. The funds required to finance the proposals contained in this legislation should be provided by the people most able to pay. When child endowment legislation was first introduced in the federal sphere the intention was that the scheme should be financed from the proceeds of the Pay-roll Tax. However, the yield from that source was insufficient to meet the total commitment, and, of necessity, it had to be supplemented by an appropriation from the National Welfare Fund, which is a trust fund established by the Parliament to finance the payment of social services. Is not this an illustration of socialism \ </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The members of the Liberal party have learnt, something from Labour's policy. A.t the risk of offending some honorable senators opposite I repeat that the only reason why the anti-Labour political parties promised to endow the first child was that more than 1,000,000 families in this country who would benefit as a result of the proposed legislation would be induced to vote for the election of the Government now in office. Of that number, 450,000 families would each receive 5s. a week endowment for first children up to the age of sixteen yeaTS- </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>I regret that the Government has decided not to pay the additional endowment until the 20th June. In view of the statements made by anti-Labour candidates during the election campaign many people in this country expected that payment of the proposed endowment would be made quickly. Admittedly this is the first legislation to be introduced by the present Government, and for that action the Government is to be commended. But  the fact remains that seven months will have elapsed before the promises made in November wall be honoured. The Government should have arranged for payments to commence immediately following the enactment of this legislation. The Minister has estimated that an additional expenditure of £15,000,000 will be involved to endow the first -child up to sixteen years of age in each family during the financial year J 950-51, thus raising the estimated total cost of child endowment to £46,250,000 for that financial year. It was estimated that £31,000,000 would be required during the financial year 1945-50 to meet child endowment commitments in respect of children in excess of the first child under the age of sixteen years. In 194S-49 £24,323,413 was expended on child endowment. In that year the pay-roll tax yielded only £19,802,924 thereby necessitating . a contribution of £4,520,489 from the National Welfare Fund. That proves my assertion that the pay-roll tax will not provide sufficient revenue to meet the cost of implementing this legislation. It is now estimated that the additional annual cost will be £15,000,000, bringing the total .to £46,250,000 as I have indicated. I mention these figures to support my contention that after all this is socialism in practice. Something is being taken from the common wealth of the community to provide assistance to people who for very legitimate and good reasons are entitled to it. </para><para>

                        has indicated to the chamber that it is proposed to insert two amendments in the bill. One is to give a direction to the Arbitration Court that child endowment shall not be taken into consideration when determining the basic wage. I recollect that either the Minister for Social Services who introduced the bill or the Attorney-General interjected that that proposed amendment could only be regarded as pious and would be of no effect. They are both estimable gentlemen and one at least is a lawyer. I do not know whether the Minister for Social Services is a legal man.

                            <para>- That may be fortunate. I have not had the benefit of a legal training but I have had a lot of training in common, sense and I believe that this Parliament has complete power in respect of child endowment. It has complete power to see that the recipients of child endowment shall be the people entitled to receive it, and nobody else. There is something to think about in that observation. The power of this Parliament to make laws is limited by a written Constitution. Because there was some legal doubt as to whether the constitutional power of this Parliament was being exceeded in the payment of child endowment and other social services benefits a referendum was held. The people were asked to give <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Commonwealth Parliament complete authority in respect of certain social service payments, one of which was child endowment. The people, as a result of that referendum, have written into the constitutional powers of this Parliament, power to make any laws at all in respect to that matter. The Parliament also has the power to direct any persons anywhere, in whatever authority or jurisdiction, as to how they shall deal with this payment to assist parents in respect of their dependent children under sixteen years. So it does not appear to me that the statement that the proposed amendment is pious is correct. I feel that in dealing with this legislation relating to child endowment the Parliament has a right to tell any arbitration authority in this country that when it is determining the basic wage it shall not take into consideration the benefits that are provided under this measure. I believe that that is a correct analysis of the powers of this Parliament. However, I just make that observation in passing. It will possibly be analysed further in the committee stages. </para>

                    </continue><para>The other point to which I wish to refer is the proposal of the Opposition to insert an amendment to increase the payment from 5s. to 10s. a week. I ask honorable senators opposite what justification is there to discriminate between the first, second and subsequent children in respect of child endowment payments? What reason do honorable senators advance? Is it a. financial reason or some other? In its present form the bill provides for an increased appropriation of approximately  £15,000,000 a year: Therefore, to make available a uniform 10s. rate to all children under sixteen years would cost £30,000,000 extra a year. Full coffers have been left to this Government, and I believe that it is expected that there will be a credit balance of £121,000,000 in the National Welfare Fund. In view of that position why should there be any differentiation between the first child and the second, third, fourth or fifth child of a family? It may he, as said earlier, that the Prime Minister anticipated some action being taken in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court when he provided for the 5s-. and the alternative 10s. rate of child endowment. So when the Minister for Social Services states that family expenses rise steeply with the birth of each child, that is a further reason why favorable consideration should be given to making the payment 10s. for all children. As the result of m.y personal experience, I believe that as additional children come into the family, so the rate of child endowment should be increased progressively. By that I mean that there should be a sliding scale. Payments could probably be 10s. for the first child, 12s. 6d. for the next child and so on. In that way some definite reward would he given to the people of this country who are prepared to stand up to the national requirements to increase this country's population and make it more safe for democracy. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - I rise to support this measure.. Despite all that has been said by honorable senators opposite, I am proud of the fact that it was a government led by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> which introduced child endowment in the- Commonwealth sphere. It is flitting, therefore, that one of the first acts of the present Menzies Administration, should, be to extend this form of financial help to mothers who are rearing families in this country. I give credit to the Labour Government for halving, on two occasions, increased child endowment, payments by 2s. 6d. a week. However, in the- light of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash's</inline> ahl.e speech to-day, I am amazed that, as he has been thinking; on the* same lines for the past eight years, he- has not sought before now the introduction of a graduated scale of payments such as he now proposes. During Labour's  term of office, the coffers of this country were full to overflowing, and. surely there was a responsibility on whatever government occupied the treasury bench to ensure that the children of this country should be given every possible care. The present  Government  could easily have decided to grant a further increase of 2s. 6d. a week to the 640,000 families already receiving child endowment, but instead it has chosen to distribute the wealth of this country more evenly by bringing the 450,000 Australian families in which there is only one child within the child endowment scheme. In addition, of course, this 5s. a week will be paid in respect of the first child in families that are already in receipt of child endowment. The proposal that there should be a graduated scale of child endowment is in line with leading thought on this subject. Eleanor Rathbone, a famous member of the House of Commons, was the first to put in print  ,'i  scale of family allowances. The proposal to add 5s. a week to the payments already being made to Australian families, and to make a similar payment to families with only one child is a fine gesture on the part of this Government. The fact that the Government parties, after a period of years, have changed their minds on the question of endowing the first child, should give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> some cause for hope. The attitude adopted by the first Menzies Government on this matter was dictated by the interests of nationa.1 economy. If we are a more enlightened party to-day, as we have shown by our decision to endow families with only one child, surely that is a matter for satisfaction to all honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>The Opposition, in its attack upon this measure, sought to relate child endowment to the determination of wages bv the Arbitration Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> mentioned the Western Australian Arbitration Court. I may be wrong, but I do not think that the honorable senator can cite any case in which family allowances were taken into consideration by that court in assessing wages. Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Nash</inline> was speaking, I endeavoured to recall- any such case,, but I was not able to do so-. So far as I am aware, child endowment has not been mentioned in the Western Australian Arbitration Court. </para>

I was happy to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> plead the case of age pensioners. However, again I remind him that although the Government of which he was a supporter had ample funds at its disposal it did not do much to improve the lot of invalid and age pensioners, nor did it extend endowment to the first child. This Government, in accordance with its election promise, is reviewing all pensions. It has already increased the allowances payable to tuberculosis patients and their dependants. Admittedly these allowances are not. yet sufficient, but at least there is an upward trend. The Department of Social Services is at present reviewing all pensions with a view to bringing them more into line with present day living costs. I am pleased indeed to have an opportunity to support this measure. </para>

During my trip to Western Australia last week to help in a State election campaign, mainly in centres containing large numbers of trade unionists, I frequently heard the Menzies Government congratulated upon the introduction of this measure and upon its promised review of all pensions. Many women told rae also that they were most concerned about the position of aged people in the community. They said that whilst they welcomed the extension of child endowment, they would have preferred to see their fathers and mothers receiving more adequate support from the Treasury. 1 support wholeheartedly the proposal contained in this measure. </para>

                        <para>. - In view of the misrepresentation indulged in by the anti-Labour forces during the general election campaign, and, to some degree, during this debate, I preface my speech on this measure by saying clearly, and I trust convincingly, that the objective of the Labour party is to establish complete economic security for the working classes so far as that is physically and financially possible. I have always regarded child endowment not as an end in itself, but as a means towards Labour's objective.I have been asked frequently what stands in the way of the implementation of Labour's policy. My answer is that the greatest obstacle is the readiness with which the great bulk of the workers are prepared to acquiesce in their own subjection. In 1911 I had to appear before the State Arbitration Court of Western Australia on behalf of the plumbers union. We were claiming 13s. a clay as a minimum wage instead of the11s. ruling at that time. I was very careful to say to the judge: "Your Honour, I tender a full and complete apology to the court for the modesty of our claims ", If the workers of this country realized the extent to which they are entitled to share in the fruits of their labour, they would be receiving much more than they are getting to-day. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I regard this Government's willingness to support child endowment as merely making a virtue of a necessity. Throughout the years, the Labour movement has pioneered social services reform. It has continuously drawn attention to what the workers are entitled to. One of the results of this campaign was that, years ago, we succeeeded in convincing the workers of the need for their own representation in Parliament. Constant pressure by Labour forces has been responsible for every social reform that we enjoy to-day. Had it not been for that struggle the workers would not be any better off to-day than they were 100 years ago. Indeed, in thinking of the lot of the species <inline font-style="italic">homo sapiens</inline> the slogan I always keep in mind is : " All things yield to pressure; where there is no pressure there can be no results ". The Labour movement has had to bring pressure to bear even on the workers themselves to point out to them what they should be receiving and what their obligations to their families are. When I see the workers readily acquiesce in the treatment meted out to them to-day, as so many of them do, I am more than ever convinced of the need for action to protect them. We have only to look at the willingness of so many of the workers to-day to accept a paltry 5s. a week to realize how easily they can be "pushed around ". I particularly invite the ladies amongst the honorable senators opposite to consider what earthly benefit a paltry 5s. a week can confer on the workers at a time when the cost of living is so exorbitant. The prices charged for the necessaries of life are so high that they amount to systematic robbery, and when the workers realize that fact I know that the membership of the Parliament will be very different from its present composition. The workers will not in futurebe misled so easily by the representations, subtle and otherwise, of those who exploit them. Labour has tried to tell the people what it has done for them in the past. We have recalled the struggle that wewaged for the payment of a living wage.. The basis for the living wage was first fixed by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in 1907, when he decided that that wageshould be based on the needs of a man, wife and three children. Many years later, in 1941, when it was brought home to an auti-Labour administration that something would have to be done to increase the income of the workers, the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> who was then the head of the Administration, decided that rather than permit the basic wage to be increased by Ss. or 9s. a week he would provide child endowment. If we pass this measure, which provides for the payment of 5s. a week in respect of the first child of a family, we have no assurance that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court will not take that amount into consideration as income when it fixes the new basic wage. After all, the members of that court are handicapped by their training. They are the slaves of precedent, and are more afflicted by inhibitions than are ordinary persons like myself. Indeed, their training renders them almost incapable of indulging in original thought. When perfectly unsophisticated persons, like you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and I submit to them a proposition that is new they instinctively declare that it cannot be accepted. </para>

Their stockintrade is, " The act says so-and-so ", and they cannot get beyond that. I can quite imagine that they would want to lower the basic wage by reducing the size of the family unit, more so if prices fall overseas with the possibility of the recurrence of an economic depression in this country. They would readily seize upon such an argument to say, " We cannot afford to pay these high wages ". </para>

                    <para>I turn now to consideration of some observations made by the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> when he moved the second reading of the bill. For instance, the Minister said that a bread-winner's income is based not so much upon his needs as upon the economic value of the work on which he is engaged. That, of course, is quite wrong. If the workers were paid the full economic value of their work there would be no profit left for distribution amongst the proprietors and investors. The workers are merely paid a wage to enable them to subsist, and that wage is based upon the cost of living figures. The major portion of the wealth produced by the workers is appropriated, or expropriated, by their employers. The workers are certainly not paid their economic value. Of course,, they are becoming more and more conscious that they receive only a pittance, and many of them realize that if they were prepared to accept less their present low wages would be still further reduced. However, because the workers are organized to protect themselves, and because they elect people like myself to the Parliament, they receive a little more consideration than they would do otherwise. But I emphasize that if the workers were not prepared to fight to defend their conditions they would probably not be any better off to-da.y than are the workers in China, India, and other backward countries. There is very little altruism in this world ; most of the protestations of idealism, are pure affectation. When I hear, and read, that members of antiLabour administrations have the welfare of the workers at heart, I am disgusted 'because I know that all the time they are seeking to perpetrate the most infamous practices. There is no real altruism in them ; they are merely indulging in affectation and playing on the credulity of persons who do not know better. As an example, the Minister for Social Services, in the course of his second-reading speech, said: "It is, in effect, a re-distribution of the national income to achieve that end ". I have yet to learn that there is such a thing as " national income ". There is, of course, a totality of private incomes, but the nation, as a nation, receives no income at all. The average, worker receives his wages, and that is all he gets. The wheat-growers and wool-growers and many other prosperous sections of the community receive a great deal more than mere wages; but the workers do not receive a single Id. beyond their wages. </para>
                    <para>Although the Minister, when he used the term "' our national income ", was very careless in his choice of a collective pro-  noun, he . should realize that there are a few workers who realize, as I do, that the term is very restrictive, because the incomes of most members of the community are very small. In reality, no redistribution of income will take place; all that will happen if this measure is passed is that there will be a re-distribution of the money allocated to the workers so- that the workers will receive a little less as wages and a little more as endowment. The reason why the employers are prepared to make this seeming concession to the workers is that they realize that they cannot get anywhere without a labour force that is prepared to work for them. When the conditions of that labour force become so poor that the workers do not want to offer their services it becomes necessary to offer them some concession to encourage them. That is why »anti-Labour administrations are prepared to prescribe that a minimum wage is to be paid and that the workers are to receive child endowment and other concessions. All the time the employers and their representatives in the Parliament have in mind capitalizing the labour power of the workers. They know also that they must make provision for the future because the workers of the present generation cannot work much longer. The whole theory of the state of society known as capitalism is to exploit the labour power of the workers, which means conscripting children born into the world and preparing them to be exploited and impoverished, as their parents have been. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is done in the name of democracy and freedom, and that is all a part of our national life to-day. The Minister also said, and I noted how he emphasized  the  words - </para>

                        <para>This Government stands for the highest possible standards of living in Australia. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Nothing of the kind ! Supporters of the Government have never stood for the workers ; they stand only for the interests they represent. Proof of that statement was provided by our experience during the depression. At that time, when we had a plethora of land, machinery, labour power and everything else required to establish and maintain the highest standard of living for our people, non-Labour governments reduced the workers to the level of the dole. I well remember how, in 1938, my colleagues and I in the Opposition in this chamber pleaded with the government to provide something for unemployed workers for Christmas. The Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> was then leader of the government in the Senate. At that time mountains of wheat were being eaten by weevils and factories throughout the land were idle. We merely asked the government to provide relief for unemployed workers for Christmas; but we might as well have appealed to a wooden god, because the government did not make one penny available for that purpose. It adopted a cold and callous attitude, and merely said that it could not accede to that request. In those d,a vs hundreds of thousands of workers were left unprovided for; they were dispensable. However, after the recent war broke out the workers became indispensable almost overnight, and unlimited money was found to enable them to be fed, clothed and housed. They received much better consideration in time of war than they received in pre-war days. That statement is not an exaggeration. I have described exactly what took place; and the same thing will take place again if the workers of this country are foolish enough to continue to elect non-Labour governments. </para>
                    <para>As I said earlier, I approach this problem in the cold light of plain facts. I am suspicious of the Government because this measure makes no provision to stabilize the purchasing power of the sum that it now proposes to make available as endowment for the first child in a family. Just as the purchasing power of every increase of the basic wage has been reduced by subsequent increases of prices, it is quite possible that the purchasing power of this benefit will be reduced immediately after it has been made available. Whilst supporters of the Government are adamant that the price of labour power shall be fixed by competent tribunals, they are equally adamant that the prices of commodities shall he left to the determination of company directors, bankers, and other commercial interests, to whom they give a free hand to charge whatever prices they like. I suggest that that is the reason why this bill contains no provision to maintain the purchasing power of the? benefit. What can one purchase with 5s. to-day? I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> when she is again in Melbourne to visit the Victoria Markets in order to learn for herself about the high prices that are being charged for foodstuffs required by children. Pensioners and workers on the lowest wages wait till the bell rings at the markets because vendors then practically give away any produce still left on their hands rather than go to the trouble of removing it. But for that fact hundreds of people, particularly those who have healthy families to provide for, would not be able to obtain fruit and vegetables at all, because they cannot afford to pay the ruling prices. </para>
                    <para>I repeat that the bill makes no provision Io maintain the purchasing power of this benefit of os. In effect, the Government proposes to throw the first child in the family to the wolves. Unless the Government is prepared to take a strong stand in respect of the control of prices, it cannot complain if the Opposition views all its actions with suspicion. Recently, in order to meet the present situation I suggested to the Prime Minister that the Government should declare a state of emergency in order to prevent the people from being robbed as the result of the increasing of prices. I had in mind pensioners and workers in the lower ranges of income. I was told that that could not be done. However, something along these lines can, and must, be done. I suggest that if the - Government wishes to protect the workers' children and aged pensioners about whom we hear so much, from being robbed to the degree that they are being robbed - and the more helpless people are the more they are robbed by their own kind - it should introduce a system of prices control. It should take other steps also. There must be rigid control of banking as well as rigid control of prices because we know that enormous and ever increasing capital charges which have never been incurred are included in and collected through prices. As we are not, now at war, the Government should ako abolish all indirect taxes because pensioners and persons in the lower ranges of income pay as much in indirect taxes as do honorable senators who are in receipt of a salary of £1,500 a year. </para>

That is the whole difficulty. When the workers realize the degree to which they are kept in subjection, as, probably, they will when we become properly civilized - we are still only semi-civilized - that objective will he attained. Why should not those who produce our food and clothing have the same freedom of access to the means by which they live as honorable senators have? I am certain that when these issues are weighed on the scales on the Day of Judgment, the utility value of honorable senators opposite will not be found to be as great as that of the workers who produce the necessaries of life. </para>

                            <para>- I was replying to the interjection made by the Attorney-General. I shall only add that, if the Government did all that I wanted it to do, honorable senators opposite would be obliged to do something else for their living than sit in this chamber. I made two points. In order to protect children from the ever-increasing prices the Government must assume control of banking and prices and abolish indirect taxes. Perhaps, it could go further and strike a capital levy. However, I should not imagine that I would receive support from honorable senators opposite for that suggestion. Those are the requisites for the establishment of a balanced economy based on principles of equity. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour movement is a majority movement that gives effect to majority policy. The more intelligent the workers become and the more they insist that they shall receive a greater measure of justice than they are receiving to-day, the nearer we shall get to that objective. The fact that I am a member of the Senate after proclaiming that principle for over 60 years i.° proof that that fact is gradually sinking into the minds of the workers. However. I have never met people so difficult to convince -as honorable senators opposite are. When we know, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> pointed out, that a non-Labour government which introduced child endowment in 1941. decided not to endow the first child in a family because it said it was not necessary to do so, and we now find after a lapse of nine years a government of the same political colour introducing legislation to endow the first child in a family, all I can say is that it has taken a long time to knock that intelligent idea into the -heads of our opponents. The Attorney-General said that the Parliament has no power to issue a directive to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I join issue with him on that statement. Whilst the court may say that the Parliament has no such power, the fact remains that the Parliament is the supreme governing authority in the country and the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is subordinate to it, and, therefore, must take directions from it. </para>

                            <para>- The Attorney-General said, in effect that the Parliament has no power to give a direction to the Arbitration Court. I believe that we have power to do so. I go further, and insist that we have that power. The authority of all courts is an authority that has been delegated to them by a parliament. The Attorney-General's statement that this Parliament has no power to give a direction to the Arbitration Court is contrary to the facts. The Parliament could, for instance, amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act to provide that weekly hours of work should not exceed 40 and that the minimum rate of pay should be £10 a week. The court would have to accept that direction. In my judgment, ir would be a very good thing if we took that course, because an enormous amount of time and money would be saved if such a direction were given to the court. Instead, the oouvt has been occupied for months in examining the evidence that has been tendered to it, although that evidence is in fact only statements of the impressions that have been formed by witnesses of all kinds as a result of the experiences through which they have passed. As we know, no two persons view a proposition in the same light. The evidence that is tendered to the court is more subjective than objective. A statistician, for instance, may give evidence of what, in his judgment, constitutes the national income, but his evidence is based upon assumptions that have never been tested. The court may, and generally does, accept such evidence as <inline font-style="italic">ex cathedra</inline> evidence as do many persons who do not know the facts. If the approach to the case were made on the principle of inductive reasoning, that is, by questioning premises and assumptions as they should be tested, the evidence would be very different from what it in fact is, coming from highly paid statisticians. If the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> expects persons like myself to believe that what he has said is correct, he will eventually be disillusioned. </para>

                    </continue><para>The legal mind is handicapped to a much greater degree than is the ordinary mind. It is a great handicap to accept the law too literally. The history of the law proves, if it proves anything, that the magnitude of a breach of the law is always lessened by the magnitude of the individual who commits the breach. Consider the criminal law, for instance. The magnitude of a breach of the criminal law is lessened by the magnitude of the individual, until the point is reached at which the King or his representative can do no wrong. When an approach to these problems is made in the Arbitration Court, it is made, in the main, bypersons who have no practical experience of industry or of the various branches of production. That is why I am so sparing in my criticism of them. The French philosopher Rousseau said that man is born free but is everywhere chained. Actually the reverse is the case. Man is born in the chains of heredity and environment, which includes custom and law, but everywhere man has tried to break those bonds. If I were asked to say what is the cause of the trouble in the legal world, I should say that it is the ego trying to break through the inhibitions, and not making a very good joh of it. </para><para>The Minister, in his second-reading speech, said - </para><quote>

                    </quote><para class="block">That statement was, to say the least, obviously incorrect. The court has never determined the basic wage on the basis of the highest amount that industry could afford to pay. The aCt would not allow it to do so. There was a time when that was done. As far back as 1911, when I was secretary of the Plumbers Union, I had to prove to an arbitration court in Western Australia that the plumbing industry could pay the minimum wage of 13s. a day that we were claiming. I succeeded in proving it so successfully that the employers consented to pay 13s. a day. I proved my case by collecting over a considerable period a number of plumbers' bills, which, in many respects, are like doctors' and lawyers' bills. I proved that the industry could pay more than 13s. a day. But since then the basis of assessment has changed, and now the basic wage is based upon the least amount that the workers will accept to render the services that they are supposed to render and to rear children to take their places when they are dead and gone. The statement that the Minister made was misleading, although possibly it was not his intention to mislead. In his second-reading speech he also said - </para><quote>

The court does not try to ascertain the highest basic wage that can he sustained by industry.

                            <para>- We have been told that the determination of the basic wage is left entirely to the Arbitration Court. The Arbitration Court consists of men who have had a legal training and have been appointed by the Government to their present positions. They are just as susceptible to the pressure of public opinion and to what other pressure can be brought to bear upon them as is any person who is not a member of the court. All legal men and laymen are, to some degree, the creatures of their prejudices and phobias. When men areappointed to high positions in the Arbitration Court they carry with them to their new positions the prejudices and phobias with which they have been indoctrinated from infancy to adolescence. They are just as susceptible to opposition, pressure and changes of circumstances as is anybody else. That has been proved clearly. An examination of the judgments that the court has delivered will show that, not only have the judges disagreed with one another, hut also that they have, to some degree, yielded to the pressure of the people, who have become more enlightened and critical, less docile and not so readily prepared to accept what the court decides. Although many references have been made to the court being free and untrammelled, the Government itself suspects the court. That is borne out by this statement in the Minister's second-reading speech - </para>

                        <para>In this regard, however, the Government will carry out its pre-election promise that, if the foundation of the basic wage is altered and its amount calculated by reference to the needs of a married couple without children, then provision will be made for raising the endowment for the first or only child under sixteen years from as. to 10s. a week. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">It is therefore clear that the Government suspects that the court will reduce the basic wage after this proposed legislation becomes law. Let us consider what would be the position if, after that happened, the court further reduced the basic wage. What would the Government do? By implication the Government has made it clear that people who are responsible for increasing prices unnecessarily will be able to continue to raise prices to the limit that the people will tolerate. One could be pardoned for inferring from the statements that have been made on this matter by honorable senators opposite that there is an implied instruction to the court to reduce the basic wage. If the Government were sincere in its desire to protect the interests of the first child in every family it would accept the proposed amendment. In his second-reading speech the Minister also said - </para><quote>
                        <para>After allowing for natural increase and for migrants, it is estimated that the cost of -endowing the first child will be approximately £15,000,000 for the financial year 1950-51, and this will bring the estimated total cost of child endowment for that year up to £40,250,000. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">As I have said previously, the money cost is not so important as the economic cost. In effect, what the Government contends is that the children should have a little more to eat. The cost is merely incidental to the main issue. I point out that, metaphorically speaking, the men and women employed in essential production and services carry the whole of society on their backs. They likewise " carry " the people engaged in the production of luxury goods. My remarks apply equally to members of Parliament, the legal fraternity, the Church, and all sections of our community that are not actively and continuously employed in essential production and services. When emphasis is placed on cost, all that i3 being said, in effect, is that a little more is to be taken from employees in essential production and services, because they provide the cost of everything. Therefore, the workers in essential production pay ' for child endowment. Taxes are paid by people employed in non-essential production in proportion to the extent to which workers in essential production are taxed directly and indirectly, particularly the degree to which they are taxed indirectly. If age pensioners were not subject to indirect taxation their pensions would be worth considerably more than at present, and probably there would not he continual agitation for increases.

                        has said that women are becoming more conscious of financial matters. A number of trade unions consist mainly of women. It has been my experience that in many instances they do not distinguish between finance and economics. If women were so advanced in relation to financial matters as the honorable senator has claimed, there would be a greater number of women members of the National Parliament. I contend that the women of this country, in the main, have been imposed upon to such a degree that they are now far from being financially conscious. When this measure becomes law the women will realize that they will be paying a little more for tea, sugar, bread, and, perhaps, lamb chops, the cost of which is now 2s. 9d. per lb. However, they are not conscious of the extent to which they have" been misled deliberately by bankers, lawyers and anti-Labour politicians. If what the honorable senator said was true there would be no necessity to compel the women of this country to record their votes at the ballot-boxes. They would not be able to get there quickly enough to record their votes for candidates for th, Parliament who would protect their interests. I know that the honorable senator has had a lot of experienc  in domesticmatters. She is just as capable of appreciating what has happened as is anybody else. I was therefore astounded t" learn that she was proud to be associated with the Government's proposal to endow the first child in each family under th&lt;* age of sixteen years by 5s. a week. When concluding his second-reading speech on this measure, the Minister said -

                            <para>- Government senators have claimed that the carrying of the amendment would kill the bill. 1 hope it does. This bill should never have been born. The best thing that could' have happened would have been for it to die at birth. I am not convinced that the passage of this bill will result in greater contentment and happiness among the workers, as has been claimed by honorable senators opposite. Under existing conditions I consider that the reverse will be the case. As I have already pointed out the enactment of this legislation will be followed immediately by an increase of the prices of commodities required for children. There is nothing in this proposed legislation to prevent that from happening. It is - well within the possibilities of practical politics to protect children from being exploited and impoverished as at present. But this Government does not attempt to protect them. </para>

In the ultimate analysis, what they receive in the form of money wages, commodity wages and conditions of employment, depends entirely on their intelligence and their organized strength. And if they are prepared to bring greater pressure to bear against those who are responsible for deliberately faking and loading prices they will get a lot more consideration than if they tamely submit to what is being done. I am not at all impressed by all the pretence that is associated with parliamentary procedure. There is such a thing as extraparliamentary power. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted."]</inline> In the last analysis, what really counts in politics and social life is the exercise of that extra-parliamentary power. It means the power that is inherent in the workers themselves, the power and weight of organized numbers fortified by their intelligence to the degree that they are intelligent and informed. The Attorney-General made reference to the possibility of this bill being killed as though it was an individual who was in danger of being killed. If the bill were killed, to use the honorable senator's phrase, it would not make much difference provided that that power was exercised and conditions of living and employment were improved. It follows that the conditions under which the children of the people lived would be improved also. 1 believe that the age should be raised in this and other legislation which affect children. This bill provides for a child up to sixteen years of age. As the father of four big healthy boys, I consider 1 should have been able to keep them at school and provide for them at least until they were eighteen years of age. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I did not catch what the honorable senator said, but I do not suppose that it was anything very intelligent anyhow. At sixteen years, children are just beginning to learn, if the Government is really sincere about endowment, it should raise the age to eighteen years. It is necessary to have a better system of education. "We must raise the intellectual and cultural level of the growing generation if we expect a state of society better than that in which we are living. When honorable senators are dealing with children, they are dealing with boys and girls who look to them for guidance. Children cannot speak for themselves, and it is a moral obligation on all parents to speak for them. When I look round in Australia and other part? of the world and see the conditions into which children are born, and realize the helplessness of many of their parents, 1 think there is a moral obligation on me, and on others occupying a similar position, to ensure that every tiling possible is done for the children. To say that th, children would receive the treatment to which they are entitled simply because Parliament would be pleased to pass a paltry 5s. a week is to say something which in my judgment is not true. Children are entitled to receive much better treatment than they are receiving, particularly the children of parents in the lower income groups, the children who are born and reared in the slums, and are forced into the factories at sixteen years of age and under, and whom the nation may want to conscript for military training. </para>

I remember the number of times I have been denied the privilege of " earning a livelihood, and when I was blacklisted and maligned. Such action meant a direct blow at my children. If a miracle could be performed, there is nothing better that T would ask than that I should live my life over again with the same knowledge as I have now of the extent to which children are denied the opportunities and essentials of life to which they are entitled. As they grow into men and women they are legislated against in many ways in institutions like this chamber. During the 'thirties they were deliberately starved. I am thinking of the children of the men who had to work for the dole in that dark period. In this very chamber an appeal was made to honorable senators to do something for the children, but nothing was done. The price is now being paid. Most of <inline font-style="italic">thu</inline> so-called criminals of to-day were children deprived of a chance in life. They were reared in a vicious environment and society is punishing crimes for which it paved the way. As I read in the press of young men and women who are gaoled for various terms, I try to imagine the background of their experience. I can see the slums, the malnutrition and the way in which they have been educated and generally misled. I see them as the victims of criminal conditions. They suffer for the sins of legislators and of the boards of directors controlling monopolies who are continually increasing prices and imposing conditions which make it most difficult to rear children and treat them as they should be treated. It is going on to-day in every part of this country and to speak here of "greater contentment and happiness in this great land of Australia " is deliberately to add insult to injury. Therefore I believe that I am justified in speaking in the terms that I am using. </para><para>I emphasize how necessary it is to reconsider the whole position of the children consistent with whatever powers we have. The Labour movement to which I belong has done that ever since it was formed, but simply because of sustained opposition it has not been able to accomplish what it desired. Years ago the Labour movement advocated free milk for school children. The proposition was laughed at. People became indignant on the public platform and asked, " Why should we be taxed to give free milk to somebody else's children ? " I remember them saying that the idea was preposterous and that it was robbery; yet to-day it is done. The Labour movement advocated free lunches for children of poor parents who were unable to provide or pay for them. The same arguments were used, yet during the war when the parents were indispensable and could not be ignored to the extent that they had 'been ignored previously, and when the nation could not afford to overlook the fact that it was under an obligation to provide for the children, free lunches were provided for the children in many places throughout the world, particularly in England. I can remember the time when such an idea was considered Utopian and it was said that it was not financially possible. I remind honorable senators that in the thirties there were 13,000 young men in. Melbourne alone who left school and were unable to obtain employment. Fifty per cent, of them were being provided for by their parents or relatives. The other 50 per cent, were receiving the dole. They formed community homes in COSdemned houses, living on scraps. When the bells were rung at the close of business in the markets, they picked up piece? that were left over, or paid a few shillings for meat. These were some of the young men upon whom Australia depended to defend the nation. When I urged in this chamber that the Government should put these young fellows into technical schools, pay them the basic wage, and train them to be craftsmen, I was told that that would be financially impossible, and that, in any case, the matter was the responsibility not of the Commonwealth but of the States. I pointed out that in the event of war this country would have to rely upon its trained young men and women. When I was appointed Minister for Aircraft Production, one of the Government's first moves was to establish classes to train operatives in the manufacture of aircraft components. These  people were paid the basic wage while undergoing training. </para><continue>

                            <para>- I was merely pointing out, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that there is  a  need to do much more than to pay a paltry  5s.  a week in child endowment. I was emphasizing my point by mentioning some personal experiences in the 1930's and in the war years. As the result of the action of the Labour Government in time of war, we have to-day thousands of healthy well trained men and women who, but for the war, would not have had an opportunity to acquire technical training. The ramifications of child endowment are wide. There is much more involved than the mere payment of an additional 5s.  a  week in respect of the first child of each family. Five shillings  a  week is not even pocket money in these days of high prices. Even 10s. is little enough. Again I urge the Senate to accept the amendment that the Opposition will move at the committee stage - that  a  direction should be given to the Arbitration Court to disregard child endowment payments in fixing the new basic wage. If the Arbitration Court failed to heed such  a  direction, the Commonwealth Conciliation and  Arbitration  Act could be amended to compel the court to comply with the wishes of the Parliament. </para>

                            <para>emphasize that the Opposition is not opposed to the endowment of the first child. It is opposed however, to anything that may tend to reduce the basic wage directly or indirectly. Every time prices rise, the purchasing power of the £1 falls and, in effect, wages are reduced. Theremust be some protection from the effects  of  this trend. I cannot understand how any member of this Parliament can justify permitting prices to rise as rapidly as they are rising to-day. The increases are not justifiable. Even if this bill were to provide for  a  payment of 10s. or 15s. in respect of the first child in each family, almost immediately, the benefits of the measure would be destroyed  by  further price increases. If any honorable senator can show me how that can be prevented, except by legislating specifically to that end, I shall be open to conviction. So far, I have not heard anything that would indicate to me that the Government is sincere in introducing this measure. This proposal is worthless. The bill is somuch window dressing unless  we  also pass legislation to shield recipients of child endowment from further exploitation through increased prices. Again I ask honorable senators opposite to suggest something that could be done to protect the children of this country whom this bill is designed to benefit. The Minister's second-reading speech emphasized that the Government was deeply concerned about the children. I merely say, " Show me how you propose to protect the parents and children against further price increases, further indirect taxation, and a further depreciation of the value of the money that theyreceive ". If the Government has any worthwhile proposal to offer, it will have a good case in support of this measure, but if not, the bill, as I have said, is mere window dressing, and I believe I havean obligation to tell that to the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not intend to make a long speech on this measure. When I saw the second-reading speech of the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> blazoned in the daily papers, I thought that perhaps the measure would make a real contribution to the emancipation of working-class families, but it should be clear to every one that 5s. a week  is  totally inadequate. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> has pointed out, if the Commonwealth Government in 1930 or 1931 had contributed an additional 5s. towards family income, material assistance would have been given. One would think that a measure dealing with child endowment would be one of the most important bills that could come before this Parliament, but this measure is of no great significance. If. the Government were serious in its professions of sympathy for working-class families, it would first endeavour to give effect to some of its election promises. Our most urgent need to-day, I should think, is to put value back into the £1. That was one of the promises on which the present Government was elected. By appreciating the value of our currency, the Government would be rendering a greater service  to the children of this country than it is by introducing this measure. There is another major disability that is interfering with the welfare of not only the first child in each family, but of all children. I refer to industrial dislocation. Prior to the elections we were told by the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> through the press that, if he were elected to office, he would bring peace back into industry. If that objective were achieved it would mean much more to Australian families than the payment of 5s. a week for the first child. </para>

By securing peace in industry the Government would do much to restore the purchasing power of the fi, and thus would do more for the children of this country than it will achieve by passing this legislation.

They have a thorough knowledge of the working of the Arbitration Court. </para>

                            <para>- Representatives of this Government are present as observers, but there are different kinds of observers. I have no doubt that the court will take into consideration the effect of this legislation when making its determination. T remind honorable senators that when the Prime Minister announced his child endowment plans in Ids policy speech, the Arbitration Court immediately suspended the hearing of the basic wage claim. We asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> yesterday, by way of interjection, " Why did the Arbitration Court suspend the hearing?" He did not even venture an opinion in reply. My own opinion is that the members of the court took cognizance of what was said by the antiLabour parties during the election campaign and realized that if those parties won the election they would increase the payment for child endowment. For that reason the court decided to adjourn the hearing of the case. For <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> information I can tell him that the basic wage is determined on the needs of a man, wife, and one child, and it does not provide for a family with more than one child. It is evident, therefore, that the court must take into consideration any financial benefit conferred on the workers by the Parliament, and that is why the court adjourned the hearing of the case before the election. </para>

                            <para>- The Government is trying to keep peace in industry and is trying to avoid antagonizing the trade unions, which have loyally abided by arbitration. We, on this side of the chamber, who have amongst us some of the leaders of the unions, realize that if the hearing of the basic wage case was suspended any further by the court there would be serious trouble, not with the Communists but with the ordinary peaceful, law-abiding unionists. Because of the spiralling cost of living it is extremely hard to maintain industrial peace even amongst those unions which have proved themselves to be loyal, democratic and fair-minded. It is because of the plight of the members of those unions that the court decided to resume the hearing of the basic wage claim. Of course, I can quite understand that supporters of the Government, who know nothing about industry except that many nf them derive considerable profits from it- </para>

                            <para>- I think that I know sufficient about the Arbitration Court to debate it with the Minister for Social Services at any time and in any place. I am merely stating facts. All that the Minister knows of the Arbitration Court is that periodically the court awards a certain wage to the workers in a particular industry, and that later, he reaps the reward of the labours of the workers in that industry. I know that the Minister realizes in his own heart that the payment of the proposed increased rate of child endowment may adversely affect a married man with a wife and one child. Because he is reasonably decent he is concerned about that, and that is why he cannot sit still while I am stating the facts. The gun which the Government is presenting to the Arbitration Court is loaded in both barrels. The Government has already intimated to the Court that if it takes into consideration the payment of 5s. a week child endowment the Government will offset any reduction of the basic wage which the court may order in  consequence  by increasing child endowment to 10s. a week. Members of the Arbitration Court might, therefore, easily come to the conclusion that since the Government has apparently determined that the workers are to receive an additional 10s. a week by way of endowment they should take that sum into consideration in determining the new basic wage. </para>

                            <para>- The formula that is used to determine the basic wage takes account of any loading of the wage hy such concessions as child endowment, and the judges of the Arbitration Court, if they are to be fair, must takeinto account any such loading. That is why I say that the judges of that court will inevitably credit the workers withhaving received an additional amount by way of income unless they are specifically instructed by the Government that the proposed increase has nothing whatever to do with the determination of the basic wage and is merely something in the nature of a social gratuity from a bounteous treasury. If such an instruction is given to them they will probably take the view that the additional payment of child endowment is nothing more than a small windfall for the workers, and they will disregard it in determining the basie wage. Married men with one child may then receive some small benefit from the Government's proposal. </para>

Honorable senators opposite have asked why did not Labour introduce endowment when it was in office? 1 remind them that after 1916 Labour did not again attain real political power until 1941. Incidentally, from my observation of the tactics adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and other honorable senators opposite, and from the whispers which we receive from time to time of the counsels of honorable senators opposite, I do not think that it will be long before Labour again occupies the treasury bench. </para>

                    <para>I believe that when the Government decided to increase the payment for child endowment it was actuated by a sinister motive. If the basic wage is to be calculated on the needs of a man, his wife and one child, industry is going to be relieved of quite a large amount of money, and we all remember that it was " big business " which subscribed so generously to enable the anti-Labour parties to put forth a spate of Fascist, Nazi, and even Com.munist, propaganda during the five weeks that preceded the last election. Naturally, " hig business " expects some dividends on its investment. After all, it fathered the child that was born on the 10th December last. There is not one honorable senator sitting opposite who did not publicly oppose the implementation of the previous Government's free medicine scheme during the recent election campaign. If honorable senators opposite were sincere in their concern for even the children of this country they would  have  compelled the British Medical Association to abide by the legislation that was enacted by the Parliament in the interest? f&gt;f the children of Australia .particularly, and of the working men and women in  general.  But they were not sincere. They opposed the introduction of free medicine, and to-day the workers of Australia, although they are paying for free medicine, are still not receiving it. The propaganda used to defeat the Government's proposals for the introduction of pharmaceutical benefits was appalling. As an example I shall quote the experience of a wife of a constituent of mine. The family have a boy ten years old, and they told me that until the recent elections they had never discussed politics with any one. During the election campaign the wife of my constituent had occasion to visit their local doctor, and she took the opportunity to ask him whether, if Labour were returned to office, and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme was implemented, she would still be able to consult him. The doctor replied : " No, my dear woman; you will have to go where the Government directs you, and you will be standing in a queue for hours and hours ". That is typical of the propaganda indulged in by members of the British Medical Association, and this is one reason why some of the w omen of Australia voted against Labour. I  suppose  that even under Hitler's Nazi regime no more  scurrillous  propaganda was disseminated. Now, that the antiLabour parties have been returned to power they are anxious to appear to be fulfilling the promises that they made before the election. However, I repeat that if they were sincere, even in their protestations of concern for the children of this country, they would attempt to do something of real benefit for them. We of the Labour party want to do something for the children.- We tried to do so when we were in power, but we failed because the people of Australia would not give us the constitutional power to control prices. Members of the political parties opposite told the electors during the recent election campaign that they could do many things. Now we, as members of the Opposition,, look forward to the Government honouring its promises. If the Government can put value back in the £1, which ha.3 depreciated to almost one-third of its old value, then they will be doing a great act of justice to the women and children of Australia, who may not need the child endowment that the Government proposes to confer on them. </para>

                        pointed out that twocourses are open to the Parliament in dealing with this legislation. The first is that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court be directed that the payment, of additional child endowment is not to be taken into consideration in fixing the new basic wage. I say quite frankly that the members of the court would probably not resent such action by the Parliament as an interference with the discharge of their duty but would probably regard it as an attempt by the Parliament to clarify the formula on which the court determines the basic wage. The other course suggested by the honorable senator is to increase the proposed payment for the first child from 5s. to 10s. a week. As one who has reared four children I cannot say that any one of my children cost twice as much to rear as any other child of the family. All children in any family should receive the same rate of endowment.

Official statistics show that Australian families, instead of increasing are decreasing. That is because parents rare not prepared to bring into the world children to whom they have no hope of giving economic security. Some people may say that the average young man, or young woman, to-day does not possess the pioneering spirit of the early Australian settlers. That is beside the point, because the opportunities available to young people to-day are not the same as those that were available to young people prior to the outbreak of World War I. </para>

                            <para>- That is so: but they did not produce anything material that could be evaluated in monetary terms. Certainly, industry shall continue to produce; but if honorable senators opposite believe that the Arbitration Court should compute the basic wage on the basis of what industry can afford to pay, members of our armed forces would not have been paid anything during the recent war, because they were not engaged in industry. War is not an industry. </para>

                            <para>- With all respect to my colleague, I liken lawyers to barnacles on a ship - when they are scraped off the vessel is enabled to travel faster. However, if the Arbitration Court were to fix the basic wage on what industry could afford to pay to-day, it would have to fix a wage of approximately £20 a week. But we must be realistic. We cannot have the Arbitration Court fixing the basic wage unless the Parliament, which created the court, assists it by setting up some organization to regulate prices in the same way as it has set up the court itself to regulate the basic wage. The Government has the opportunity to do something that will be of immediate and substantial benefit to the children of this country by appointing , an organization of that kind. I shall support any such proposal regardless of the political colour of the government that introduces it. I repeat that an organization must be set up to control prices in the same way as the Arbitration Court has been set up to control the basic wage. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. However, I shall not support the establishment of any organization that will delay the hearing of claims before the Arbitration Court. To-day, the court is hearing a claim for a basic wage of £10 a week. I put this to honorable senators opposite: If they were workers in industry and contributors <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> union funds, and, after their union had waited for two years for the Arbitration Court to hear their claim for an increase of wages, and in the meantime costs had spiralled as they have spiralled in the last two years, they were told by their organizing secretary that arbitration was the only way out of their troubles, would they not be very dissatisfied ? </para>

Fortunately, we can leave the welfare of the British people in the hands of the great leader whose government has just been re-elected in that country. We cannot do anything of real benefit to the children of this nation under proposals of the kind embodied in this measure. This bill is sheer humbug. What canone buy with 5s., when apples cost 9d. each and lamb costs 2s. 9d. per lb.?

I want the Government to understand that members of the Opposition did not come down in the last poli tical shower. We know just as well as our  opponents do that there is as much chancethat the Government will seek a double dissolution on this measure as there is that I shall become Emperor of China. We must try to work out a solution that will give some relief to the children of Australia who are suffering because of the present high cost of living.

                            <para>- What is the use of building a house except upon soundfoundations ? In this instance, the Government is putting on the roof firstIt should make a start by laying the f oundations just as the Chifley Government proposed to make a start by establishing medical and pharmaceutical benefits. We must start where the trouble begins, and provide for children at their birth. Probably, they will be our next soldiers and unemployed, just as our children have been in the past. Wemust give the children a decent standardof living and a reasonable chance of existing in comfort. If honorable senators opposite are sincere they will heed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> suggestion that the government of the day should intimate to the Arbitration Court that it does not want the court to take into consideration the provision of this endowment for the first child when it is determining the basic wage. The Government should do that whether the rate of endowment be 5s. or 10s. a week. I believe that it will be 10s. a week, because I think that honorable senators opposite have as much sympathy for our children's welfare as honorable senators on this side have, and, therefore, will agree eventually to increase the rate of .endowment to 10s. We can see  further than the profits of big business. Labour governments that  preceeded  the present Government foresaw what would happen in this country after the recent war had ended. Consequently, the Chifley Government asked the people to give to the National Parliament in peace-time power to control prices on a nation-wide basis. It is a great tribute to that Government that during the war prices rossless in Australia than in any other country. That was due to the magnificent job that was done by the Prices Branch, which, incidentally, was set up by the Menzies Government at the outbreak of the war with Professor Copland at its head. That gentleman did a gigantic job in that position. Later, he relinquished that position. </para>

                            <para>- Because the people refused to give power to this Parliament to continue to control prices on a nation-wide basis in peace-time, Professor Copland relinquished his position as Prices Commissioner after he had trained his assistant in the Prices Branch, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCarthy,</inline> a senior officer in the Public Service, to take his place. The Chifley Government acknowledged his great qualities and offered him the opportunity to work in the wider sphere of research in building up this nation, and he accepted that opportunity. If the Government is not prepared to set up some tribunal to control the cost of living and profits, it will be useless for the Arbitration Court to increase the basic wage or for the Government to provide endowment for the first child. That will only continue the vicious circle. For the benefit of those honorable senators who are not aware of the procedure "that is followed by the Arbitration Court in fixing the basic wage, I point out that unions are not allowed to apply foi increases until the cost of living index shows that the cost of living has increased. At present, unions that are not Communistcontrolled, but are affiliated with the Labour party, have been waiting for two years for the court to hear their claim for an increase of the basic wage. </para>

However, we say that the Government should approach this matter in a proper way.

                    <para class="block">Coming from a Minister of a government like the present Government, that is a fine statement ! I trust that the Minister was sincere when he made it, because if the Government has changed its front and is now prepared to fall into line with the Labour party, it will enjoy a harmonious term of office. However, on every occasion in the past when the Labour party proposed that some progressive action be taken, the interests represented by the present Government opposed it. I have heard honorable senators opposite talk about "good trade unions ". To-day, they claim that the Australian Workers Union is a "good trade union ", but I remember when its organizers were beaten up by gangs employed by station owners because they dared to ask for a reasonable wage for shearers.

                            <para>- The people of Australia must be told the truth. Some of them have, like the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper),</inline> been asleep for a long time, and they must be awakened. The Minister for Social Services stated in his second-reading speech that each time progress is suggested there are to be found some reactionaries who oppose it. Those are the people who are represented by the liberal party. If the Government were to introduce a bill designed to benefit the workers of Australia, it would not be opposed by honorable senators on this side of the chamber. </para>

                            <para>- I am wholeheartedly in favour of the Arbitration Court as a body to deal with the claims of the workers in industry, but I am very much concerned over the length of time that it takes to decide the cases that come before it. I wish to make it clear that I am not suggesting that the judges of the court do not work hard, because I know that they do. But the Parliament must realize that the affairs of the workers of this country are growing in magnitude all the time. We must assist the court to deal expeditiously with the claims that come before it. I appeal to the Government to urge the court not to take child endowment into consideration when determining the -basic wage. I believe that the judges of the court will not be offended by such a request and that they will be prepared to accede to it. If the Government does that, and also establishes an organization to control prices, it will have gone some way towards honouring the pledge that it made to the people of Australia during the last general election campaign to increase the purchasing power of the £1. If these things are not done, the children of this country will derive no benefit from the proposed weekly payment of 5s., which we suggest should be increased to 10s. I do not oppose this hill, because, as I have said, I am prepared to support any legislation that will benefit the workers, but the Government should, I suggest, give some consideration to the views that have been expressed by honorable senators on this side of the chamber, because we represent almost 50 per cent, of the people qf Australia. If the Government accedes to our suggestions, it will have done something to improve the welfare of the people. </para>

                    <para>Instead of concentrating its efforts upon putting value back into the £1, the Government has introduced this bill for the payment of a miserable 5s. a week in child endowment and has invoked the Crimes Act. We have asked on numerous occasions how the operation of that act will affect the trade unions that are represented by honorable senators on this side of the chamber. We represent those unions that are affiliated with the Australian Labour party. We also represent some waterside workers., seamen and coal-miners, but we do not represent executives of their unions. We desire to know in what way the Crimes Act will affect the trade unions that we represent, because there are occasions when it is necessary for the workers to protest against the bosses paying too little for the only thing that they have to sell, and that is their labour. Every man in this great free country of ours should have the right to decide to whom he shall sell his labour. When we have asked questions of responsible Ministers, we have been given irresponsible answers. I say that the action of the Government will breed discontent among the members of the unions that are affiliated with the Australian Labour party and thus bring misery to the children who are dependent upon them. </para>
                    <para>We shall doubtless have an opportunity in committee to deal in detail with some of the provisions of this bill. I appeal to the Government to consider favorably the amendment in respect to the increase of the endowment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has foreshadowed. When the Labour party was in office, we could not see our  way clear to making money available to endow first children, but I am happy to know that this Government can find the money for that purpose. The cost of endowing the first child in a family will be £15,000,000 a year, making our total annual expenditure on social services approximately £115,000,000. If the Government is able to do that, it should be able to view with favour our suggestion that the endowment be increased to 10s. a week and also that it be suggested to the judges of the Arbitration Court that that payment should not be taken into consideration when the basic wage is determined. </para>

                            <para>- The judges of the Arbitration Court are very learned men. They are also very impartial. I believe that they desire to do whatever they can do in the interest of both employers and employees. I have no hesitation in saying that I would prefer to be a senator rather than a judge of the Arbitration Court. The judges have a gigantic task, and we are not assisting them as much as we could do. We have asked them to fix the basic wage, but while they are hearing evidence prices are steadily increasing. That is not fair to the judges. Those judges are faced with a gigantic task. Both employer and employee organizations place reams of evidence before them. We should give them a lead by establishing a tribunal to fix wages and profits in order to enable the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to make its decisions more quickly and thus help to preserve peace in industry. I hope that at the committee stage of this measure honorable senators will have a further opportunity to discuss the various aspects of this matter. Before that stage is reached, however, I hope that the Government will have recognized the wisdom of the submissions of honorable senators on this side of the chamber, and increased the amount of endowment proposed to be paid in respect of the first child in each family under the age of sixteen years to 10s. a week. I hope, also, that the Government will see fit to inform the judges that extension of child endowment should not be considered by them when determining the basic wage, and that it is merely a gratuity from the Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - I support this bill. It seeks to extend child endowment by the payment of 5s. a week for the first or only child under sixteen years of age in every family. This is merely an extension of the system of child endowment that became law in 1941. I believe that that was a great step forward in our social advancement. It was introduced by the Menzies Government of the day, to which I give credit., I give credit, also, to the then Opposition, which acclaimed the measure as a step forward in our national way of life. The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> presented a very clear and concise statement of the Government's intentions to the Senate. I sincerely regret that the matter of the basic wage has intruded into this debate, because I regard the basic wage as a national matter. Not one honorable senator opposite, in referring to the basic wage, cited one instance of the court even suggesting that it had taken any notice whatsoever of child endowment when assessing the basic wage. I was constrained to look up some of our industrial laws to discover what the term "basic wage" means. It is not defined by any judgment. We could say that perhaps it is the lowest wage that could be legally paid to an employee in a particular geographical area. However, we must not confuse the basic wage with the minimum wage. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 clearly sets out that the minimum wage is the wage payable to employees in a particular industry. As has been said by many other honorable senators, perhaps what we now loosely call the basic wage originated in 1907. Most honorable senators have paid tribute to that very great Australian, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins. He had no legislative provisions to guide him in determining the Harvester award of 1907. He was a pioneer in this field, and more or less had to " take a shot in the dark ". He considered that the specification " fair and reasonable" in regard to a wage claim meant the normal needs of the average employee living in a civilized community. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">From the evidence placed before him he considered that £2 2s. represented the necessary average weekly expenditure in r. labourer's home of about five persons. I ask honorable senators to note particularly that there was nothing specific in that opinion. It was not based on a detailed and comprehensive investigation. That judgment, which raised the workers' standard of living by about 27 per cent., may be regarded as the basis of the computation of the Australian basic wage. Since then, as honorable senators know, there have been additions, and on one occasion, a subtraction. It has always been the aim of the court, and employers generally, to improve the standard of living of the workers. It hurts me to hear statements that honorable senators on this side of the chamber are not concerned with the interests of employees in industry. We are just as concerned about their welfare as are those honorable senators opposite who have contended that employers are interested only in making profits. How can honorable senators opposite reconcile that contention with their broadcast assertion that the Government wants to see men unemployed? There is nothing wrong with the making of a fair and legitimate profit. Employers want men to be engaged in industry. Obviously, if men are out of work the employers cannot make profits. That is a complete answer to the humbug that has been resorted to by honorable senators opposite. </para>
                    <para>Perhaps most members of this chamber are more conversant than I am with the industrial laws of Australia. However, I have endeavoured to keep abreast of the times in that respect. The index numbers "A", "B", and " C " were introduced, each designed to improve the method of arriving at a fair basic wage. In 1919 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> A. Piddington, K.C., was  chairman  of a royal commission appointed to inquire into the actual cost of living of a man, his wife, and three children under fourteen years of age. One or two remarkable facts were elicited by that commission. It was found that the average family of children under fourteen years of age was only 1.65. In its wisdom the court refused to adopt the Piddington royal commission's finding as the basis of wage fixation, because the findings were based not on the needs of the unskilled worker, but on the needs of all employees, both skilled and unskilled. It also held that industry could not afford to adopt that basis. It is interesting to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington</inline> suggested in his report that a basic wage should be fixed for a man and his wife only, and that a bonus should be paid for each child of the worker. A great boom period followed the termination of World War I. What was commonly called the " Powers 3s. " was introduced. Australia then passed through bad years, which every one regrets occurred. We should profit by the experiences of those years. The history of the past is only useful if we can build something better as a result. Although that was a terrible period for every section of our community, it should act as a spur to us to see that the conditions of those days shall not recur if it is humanly possible for us to avert them. I was very pleased to hear some honorable senators say that they would devote all of their efforts to prevent a recurrence of those dark days. In 1931 the basic wage was reduced by 10 per cent., and in 1933 it became evident that the wage rate had decreased by more than 10 per cent, in terms of purchasing power. That was adjusted by adopting the Commonwealth Statistician's " allitems " index. I mention these things to show that down the years attempts have been made to improve the method of computing the basic wage. As some honorable senators have mentioned, a fresh start was made in 1934 to try to devise a system by which the workers, and industry generally, would be contented. In 1943 the Arbitration Court, consisting of Chief Judge Dethridge, Judge Drake-Brockman, and Judge Beeby, fixed a wage of £3 4s. for Melbourne, with variations for the other States. Judge Beeby considered that £3 5s. 6d. should be the amount. It is interesting to note that margins for skill were restored at that time. In 1937 a prosperity loading was granted. That was fixed at 6s. for New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, and 4s. for South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. There is no hard and fast rule to establish the principle upon which the basic wage is calculated. It is not fixed solely in relation to productivity. I stall mention some of the pertinent judicial comments that were made. Judge Beeby said - </para>

The highest average number of dependent children under sixteen years of married male wage and salary earners at any period of their life being a little over two. . . .

                    <para>On the 8th November, 1941, the Australian scheme of child endowment was introduced, and I believe the people of Australia acclaimed it as having very great virtue. It has become part and parcel of the national life. That child endowment scheme was to be financed partly from Consolidated Revenue, but chiefly from the pay-roll tax. It is interesting to note that pay-roll tax actually collected in 1948-49 was £19,801,526. Again in 1946, Acting Chief Judge Drake-Brockman inquired into the basic wage, and on the 13th December, 1946, he gave an interim judgment. No mention of child endowment was made in fixing the basic wage in that judgment. In South Australia the Board of Industry, in its report declaring the living wage to be paid to adult wage employees in the metropolitan area, said, in effect, that although a family may receive child endowment, it would be wrong to deduct that amount from the basic wage and proclaim the answer as the living wage. It also said - </para>

                        <para>It is believed that 75 per cent, of wage-earners receive no child endowment and therefore they would suffer a fall in their standard of living if child endowment were taken into consideration. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is interesting to note that of those 75 per cent, of wage and salary earners, 16 per cent, are men with one dependent child. I am firmly of the opinion that the Arbitration Court desires to protect the standard of living. If honorable senators would study the speeches made when child endowment was introduced in 1941, they would find that it was most noteworthy that practically every member who spoke on the bill, and, incidentally, on the pay-roll tax, said that it would be something paid to better the standards enjoyed by basic wage-earners with two or more dependent children. Those honorable members in 1941 believed that, and it has been proved since by the higher standard of living of the children.

                        <para>The hoard has decided that while it regards the payment of child endowment as a reality which should not be ignored, the board should not make any reduction in the living wage by reason only of the payment of those amounts. The board considers that child endowment should be accepted by it as a raising of the standard of living for the benefit of the children in all families where there are two or more children. </para>

                    <para class="block">That point of view is interesting, and it is the way that honorable senators on this side of the Senate look at it. Child endowment raises the standard of living of our children and as the Minister for Social Services said clearly and concisely in his second-reading speech, it is the great desire of the Government to raise the children's standard of living. This Government extends the benefit of child endowment to the first child at the rate of 5s. a week and that will be a welcome addition to the budgets of mothers. In practice, child endowment is paid to the mother, not to the father. I stress that point because I recall that my wife first received child endowment when I was away from Australia in 1941. I recall that she accepted it as something she could spend for the direct benefit of our six children. Chaos would occur if a single man were paid a certain wage and a married man were paid a similar wage plus an amount for each child. </para>
                    <para class="block">Every person who has been an employer will recognize how impossible such an arrangement would be. The man for whom the employer would look in that event would be a single man, provided he could do the job. I do not suppose that any honorable senator opposite would act any differently if he had a gardener or some other employee. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators on this side of the chamber desire to help the family life that is so dear to most Australians. The strength of our Empire lies in our homes. Honorable senators know that family expenses rise with the birth of each child, but the breadwinner's income is not solely based on the needs of his family. If his family increases, his wage does not rise - and that is where child endowment is of great value - because it is mainly based on the economic value of the worker in the employment in which he is engaged. Child endowment assists to supply some of the needs of the increasing family. Such a payment has a psychological effect, too, which cannot be disregarded. It gives some measure of security to the mother who is the keystone of the family. The very fact that she receives a regular amount of money, varying according to the number of children, relieves her of much anxiety. This tends to increase the happiness of the family. Happiness in the home makes the future outlook of our citizens brighter and better. I believe that the payment of child endowment has been a great contributory factor towards raising the standard of living of our children. Let us regard child endowment for a moment from the narrow viewpoint of an investment. I doubt if any other national investment will return such good interest and ensure such a repayment or dividend as will child endowment because it will mean happier and healthier children. If strong and healthy children are given a good start in life, they will develop into men and women sound in body and mind. A good start for them will certainly reduce the nation's sickness bill and relieve much of the suffering that exists among aged people. </para>
                    <para>I believe that every party is greatly concerned with the adequate care and attention of our sick, whether as infants or in adult life. I cannot over-emphasize the importance of preventive measures. Much has been said about the doctors. As a family man I should like to pay a tribute to them, particularly to the country doctors. It ill-becomes anybody to suggest that the doctors are on strike. I have yet to learn of a doctor refusing to attend the sick or suffering. Doctors are not limited to eight hours a day. If they were and had some honorable senators to wait until 9 o'clock next morning it would perhaps make them realize how unselfish are the men of the medical fraternity. No one suggests that 5s. a week is sufficient to maintain a child but it is at least a welcome contribution. The mothers of Australia will certainly use it wisely, to give the best value to the child. It is because of this wise spending on the part of the mothers that the Government is pleased to help to bring happiness to the home. I support this bill and believe that the sooner it is brought into operation the better it will be for the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators on this side of the chamber agree entirely with the principle of child endowment of any description. We agree with the principle of first child endowment but it has been made clear from this side of the chamber that there are too many dangers in the Government's proposal. I go so far as to say that there is a motive behind this proposal to endow the first child. Further, I repeat what I have said before in other places that it is a concealed attack on the basic wage by the representatives of big business. There is no question about it. In every newspaper recently and in every speech heard from anti-Labour politicians, whether they belong to the now Liberal party or the Australian Country party, the cry is that wages are the main cost in industry and that the enormously high wages paid at present are almost wholly responsible for the high prices of all commodities. The anti-Labour people believe that. We hear from every direction that wages are far too high. I repeat that this measure to pay 5s. for the first child in every family is definitely a concealed attack on the basic wage. Because of that, honorable senators on this side of the chamber are apprehensive about the proposal. In closing his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> made a very stirring appeal on behalf of the mothers of families. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber agree with that sentiment, but if the Government is sincere why docs it not accept the foreshadowed amendment and make the payment 10s. instead of 5s.? For honorable senators on the Government side to rise in this chamber and express concern for the family unit and the children and then to refuse to accept an amendment proposing to double the amount of the endowment for the first child indicates insincerity. Honorable senators opposite who argue that this measure will not influence the Arbitration Court's determination of the basic wage are consistent only in their inconsistency. They say that the Government has no power or desire to influence the Arbitration Court, bur again I remind them that three State governments of the same political colour as this Administration have actually intervened in the basic wage hearing in an effort to influence the court to take into consideration social service payments in fixing the basic wage. Therefore the attitude of honorable senators opposite to this bill is hypocritical. After <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> had spoken on this measure, the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> immediately said that the Government did not have authority to instruct the Arbitration Court not to take child endowment into consideration in determining the. basic wage; but apparently the three governments to which I have referred consider that they have ample authority to endeavour to induce the court to take that very matter into consideration. The Government cannot have it both ways. If it is improper for the Commonwealth Government to endeavour to influence the Arbitration Court, then it is improper for State governments to take such action. It is apparent to any reasonable person that this Government is not sincere in introducing this measure. Honorable senators opposite represent big business which, of course, is out to reduce the basic wage. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Much has been said about the importance of the family unit. We all realize that the family unit is the corner-stone of the community, but even the Minister for Social Services himself admitted in his second-reading speech that this measure would benefit a little more than 1,000,000 families. I have before rae the latest figures showing the number of wage and salary earners in the Commonwealth, excluding rural workers, household and domestic workers, and members of the defence forces. As far as I have been able to ascertain, there are roughly 75,000 rural workers in the Commonwealth. [ base that estimate on the last census. Some thousands of men are in the defence forces, and, of course, a. substantial number of women are engaged in household and domestic duties. My figures show that, excluding those categories, at December, 1949, there were 1,816,200 male and 6SO,S00 female salary and wage earners, making a grand total of approximately 2,500,000. It is clear, therefore, that if this measure is to benefit only 1,000,000 families, approximately 1,500,000 wage and salary earners, excluding- the categories that I have mentioned, will be prejudiced if the court takes the proposed payment of 5s. a week for the first child into consideration in computing the basic wage. In other words, the wages of these peoplewill be reduced, relatively speaking. On the Government's own admission, it fears that this may happen; yet the Attorney-General has said that the Government has no power and no desire to influence or direct the Arbitration Court to disregard the effects of this measure  in  determining the basic wage. Clearly, the Government intends to leave the matter entirely to the court. At present the basic wage is computed on the basis of the needs of a family unit of a man, wife and one child. </para>

                            <para>- It may not be necessary for honorable senators to answer interjections, but sometimes it is quite pleasurable to do so. However, perhaps I had better leave what I was going to say. The question that I have not yet heard answered in this chamber is why the anti-Labour government - I think it was called the United Australia party Government, meaning, of course, "Unemployment and Poverty" Government - did not introduce child endowment for the (first child in 1941. That question has been asked several times but, so far, it has not been answered. Even now I hear roars of silence from honorable senators opposite! To-day they claim deep concern for the welfare of the family unit, but in 1941 they definitely opposed the payment of child endowment in respect of the first child. The present Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> who at that time was the Minister for Social Services, said, according to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> that endowment for the first child was not necessary. </para>

                            <para>- The reason for the Minister's opposition at that time was that provision for the first child was made in the basic wage. When child, endowment was first introduced in 1941, there existed in this country a state of affairs similar to that existing in December last. A claim was being heard by the Arbitration Court for an increase of the basic wage. The indications were that the basic wage would be increased and the anti-Labour Government, representing big business interests, thought that if it introduced a child endowment scheme, the Arbitration Court would be influenced either not to increase the basic wage at all, or to grant a smaller increase than it would otherwisehave determined. </para>

We are not miserable enough to go to a mother and say to her: "Here is 5s. a week to keep your first child ". Apart from that, however, we do want some definite assurance that the payment of the additional endowment will not have the overall effect of reducing the basic wage, which is, I suggest, the motive behind the bill. If honorable senators will bear with me I shall endeavour to prove that that is the motive of the Government. I listened attentively to the speech delivered by the Minister, and about two-thirds of his time was taken up in trying to convince the Senate that the Government is concerned with the welfare of the people.

                        <para>After allowing for natural increase and for migrants, it is estimated that the cost of endowing the first child will be approximately £15,000,000 for the financial year 1950-51 and this will bring the estimated total cost of child endowment for that year up to £46,250,000. This is asubstantial amount in relation to the total governmental expenditure. It is an amount which is received by a large proportion nf Australian families. It is, therefore, the desire of the Government that it should be received by those who are entitled to it with the minimum of inconvenience and that it shouldbepaid by the Government as economically as is possible. </para>

It has always been a fetish of members of the anti-Labour parties to speak of " equality of sacrifice " and the " obligations of all ".

                    <para class="block">Can you imagine the right honorable gentleman wearing bowyangs and waiting his turn in a soup kitchen for a meal? The whole thing is absolutely ludicrous. TheGovernment's idea of achieving " equality of sacrifice " is to re-impose income tax on every income earner. Indeed, members of the Government have repeatedly said that every one should pay income tax, and previous anti-Labour administrations have imposed taxation on all workers. It is obvious that the only way that the Government can carry out its promise to reduce taxes to persons with large incomes is to re-impose taxation on persons with small incomes. Honorable senators opposite cannot deny that their political parties speak with two voices. In this Parliament they have said that they have no constitutional power even to influence the Arbitration Court, but anti-Labour governments in the States of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia have intervened in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to oppose any increase of the basic wage. After the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> during the recent election campaign, had stated his intention to increase child endowment payments - it was nothing more than a piece of election bait - the Commonwealth Arbitration Court promptly adjourned the hearing of the hasic wage case. Why did it do so? It gave as its principal reason that child endowment had become a political issue. Theactionof the judges in adjourning the hearing of the case, which is a most important one andhas dragged on since 1948, for two months was typical of the delays which the courts place in the way of the workers when they seek an improvement of their conditions. Then honorable senators opposite wonder why the workers become restive- </para>

                            <para>- Prior to the suspension of the sitting, I had emphasized the inconsistency and insincerity of the Government in introducing this measure. Ostensibly, the object of the bill is to grant relief to families by endowing the first child. My colleagues have pointed out that if the Government is sincere in its desire to achieve that objective it should at least make a substantial contribution for that purpose; but under this measure the Government proposes to endow the first child in the family at the rate of only5s. a week. Previous speakers have also pointed out that as the result of rising costs, particularly since the 10th December last, the purchasing power of the £1 has been reduced by half during recent months. That fact has been stated on the authority of the Prime Minister himself. With that courage to which I referred earlier, the right honorable gentleman made the very brave statement in his policy speech at the recent general election that the non-Labour parties if returned to office would take definite steps to put value back into the £1. However, although numerous questions have been asked in this chamber and in the House of Representatives on this matter, Ministers have consistently refused to give any indication whatever of the action that the Government proposes to take in that direction. At all events, if the Prime Minister's statement that within recent months the purchasing power of the £1 has been halved is correct, surely Government supporters, in view of their professions of concern for the welfare of families, if not in the name of justice, should be prepared to accept the amendment that has been foreshadowed by the Opposition to increase the rate of endowment under this measure to 10s. a week. The Government proposes to provide 5s. a week in order to enable parents to keep their first child. I can only describe such a proposal as a mockery. Honorable senators opposite do not like to be reminded of what happened in this country during the depression years. </para>

                            <para>- That is so ; but I remind the honorable senator that supporters of the non-Labour parties absolutely refused to make money available to the government of that day for the purpose of relieving distress among the unemployed. The honorable senator himself, as a senior military officer, will no doubt recall that a large proportion of volunteers at the outbreak of the recent war were found to be medically unfit for military service. That was because during the depression years the youth upon whom we were to depend for our safety and freedom were inadequately fed, clothed and housed. I know that the truth hurts honorable senators opposite: but that fact cannot be denied. </para>

I and my colleagues are still wholeheartedly in favour of that being done, but only if the Government gives the assurance that the endowment of the first child will not be permitted to affect the present basic wage. The Government has not given that assurance and, apparently, it does not intend to do so. I do not wish to delve into history, but honorable senators opposite who profess so much loyalty to the Prime Minister, know that " Bob " was discredited in 1941. That was the year the first child endowment bill was introduced in this Parliament.

                            <para>- As I said earlier, we support the proposition that endowment should be provided for all children in a family, but with the proviso that the Government give the definite assurance that the provision of such endowment will not be permitted to be the real effect of reducing the rate of the basic wage. The' Government has not given us that assurance. It cannot, and will not, do so because this measure, in reality, is a concealed attack ,upon the basic wage. In support of that contention, I shall refer to certain statements that the Prime Minister made during the recent general election campaign. In addition, the Minister for Social Services, throughout his second-reading speech, expressed what he. would call doubts, but. what. I suspect were really his hopes, that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court would take the provision of this endowment into consideration when it was computing the basic wage. The Attorney-General said that the Government had not the power, or the desire, to ask the Court not to take this benefit into consideration when it was computing the basic wage. The attitude of those Ministers indicates that the Government in introducing this measure desires to bring about an overall reduction of the basic wage. They cannot get away from that fact. The Prime Minister, who, as I said earlier, has never faced an enemy and has never successfully faced an issue- </para>

                            <para>- During the recent general election campaign the Prime Minister in his policy speech made certain statements on behalf of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party with respect to child endowment. Incidentally I could say quite a lot about the unity that is supposed to exist between the Liberal party and the Country party, particularly in Victoria. </para>

At the risk of repetition I say again that the Liberal party in this country speaks with two voices. There is no supposition or theory about what I shall say now. It is a fact that the Liberal governments of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria have made an approach to the court with the express intention of endeavouring to force it to take social services in general into consideration in the computation of the basic wage. If honorable senators on this side of the chamber are given an adequate guarantee that endowment for the first child will not be taken into consideration in computing the basic wage, then we shall be with the Government, except that we want the payment to be 10s. a week and not 5s. a week. Is is cheaper to maintain an only child or a first child than it is to maintain other children ? From the practical viewpoint, it is more costly to maintain the first child or an only child.

                    <para>I want the Attorney-General to listen to the next part. I should really like him to take a verbatim note of it. It is what was said by his own leader, the Right Honorable Robert Gordon Menzies, the man who fooled sufficient people to enable him to climb to the treasury bench. His Government is in office but not in power. We know that the Liberal governments of three States are approaching the Arbitration Court. This is what " Bob " said- </para>

He also referred to me as a " coal-miner from Blair Athol ".

                            <para>- I directed the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sandford</inline> to the fact that he must not refer to honorable senators as " miners ". I thought that he would deduce from that that he must not refer to them as " Billy Boy ". However, occasionally honorable senators, in the exuberance - I will not say of their own verbosity - of the moment, refer to one another, mostly jokingly, in terms that are not strictly in accordance with parliamentary procedure. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sandford</inline> to refer to the Prime Minister as the Prime Minister and not as " Bob ". Many of us refer to the right honorable gentleman as " Bob " outside this chamber, but when we are speaking in the chamber we should conform to the parliamentary decencies and refer to him as the Prime Minister. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sandford</inline> will lose anything by doing that. I hope that in the remainder of his speech he will do so. </para>

                            <para>- I have been quoting from the policy speech of the Right Honorable Robert Gordon Menzies, the Leader of the Liberal party. I understand that there is an alliance between the Liberal party and the Australian Country party, despite the prolific use of daggers some time ago. I believe the right honorable gentleman delivered the policy speech on behalf of those two parties. I want to emphasize the point that I am trying to make. It cannot be stated too often. Repetition is sometimes boring, but on occasions it is very effective. </para>

                            <para>- It is to the Minister, because it is the truth. The vital factor in our opposition to this bill is the lack of guarantee by the Government that endowment for the first child will not be taken into consideration in determining the basic wage. If the Government will give us a definite guarantee that it will not be taken into consideration, we shall urge that the endowment be increased from 5s. a week to 10s. a week. The present rate of endowment for children other than the first child is 10s. a week. How can the Government resist our claim in view of the astronomical increase of prices that has occurred since it assumed office on the 10th December, 1949, and which has been caused mainly by the vociferous, united and consistent advocacy by the non-Labour parties of a " No " vote at the referendum on prices control ? However, that is beside the point. If the Government is sincere in its expressions of concern for the welfare of the children of this country, let it exhibit some evidence of its sincerity. Let us have a guarantee that it will represent to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court that child endowment should not be taken into consideration in the determination of the basic wage. We fear that it will be taken into consideration. Our fears have been strengthened by the statements of the Prime Minister and by the speech of the Minister for Social Services on the motion for the second reading of this bill. The inference can be drawn from the Minister's speech that child endowment will be taken into consideration by the court. We on this side of the chamber are intelligent people. </para>

                            <para>- If I cared to digress there is a great deal that I could say about the Gallup poll. The present Prime Minister's prognostications on the occasion of the American presidential election are still fresh in the minds of the people. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline> I shall now deal with some of the contentions of Government senators. I almost said " the Opposition ". I should have been just a few months early. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> said that child endowment was a noble acceptance of the principle that families with children should be helped. That was a courageous statement. However, I remind the Senate that the honorable senator was not a supporter of an antiLabour political party during the depression period, when tens of thousands of children in this country were suffering from what was termed malnutrition. The fact was that they were suffering from starvation. </para>

                            <para>- Killing child endowment for the first child and killing the bill are synonymous terms. This is the Government's method of " getting out from under ". Obviously the promise that the anti-Labour candidates made during the election campaign was merely for the purpose of gaining votes. They had no intention of honouring it, and now seek to escape the consequences of it. Surely some Government senators realize that very few commodities for children can be bough't with 5s. a week. At least the position would be a little better if the amount were increased to 10s. a week. </para>

He made an ostensibly sensible statement that, when this bil! was enacted, it would add 5s. to the basic wage. I have already mentioned the inherent dangers in that connexion. In my opinion the Government's motive behind this measure is to effect an overall reduction of the basic wage. </para>

                            <para>- The manner in which this bill' was presented was laughable and 'ludicrous. I submit that right-'thinking people will agree with my contention. Apparently in all sincerity the Minister stated .that if the court took the 5s. a week endowment into account in fixing the basic wage, the Government would increase the amount of endowment to 10s. I submit that if the court took the endowment of 5s. a week into account in fixing the basic wage, and the Government then increased the amount to 10s. a week, in accordance with the Minister's statement, the court would then have to take the second 5s. into account. Under such conditions the overall basic wage could be reduced by 10s. or more a week. That is an example of the munificence of this Government, which professes so much concern for the family unit and the starving thousands for whom its associates in the Senate in the 30's would not grant a penny. This Government has stated that, in certain circumstances, instead of making endowment of the first child 5s. it will make it 10s. Is that not to-day's funny story ? Quite obviously, the court in the next computation of the basic wage would take the 10s. into account. If the Government is so concerned for the family unit and if its professions of concern for the children of the country are sincere, why will it not make the endowment £1 a week? The Government is spending millions of pounds on immigration, and rightly so, but the best immigrants this country can have are Australian-born children. If there was any sincerity in the Government, it would accept an amendment to make endowment for the first child 10s. instead of 5s. a week. The Government might say that it cannot afford it. What utter stupidity, when relative values of money are considered and when it is remembered that in 1930 or about that time the government of the day could not wring from an antiLabour majority in the Senate permission to provide £18,000,000 to provide work so that starving children could be fed. On the outbreak of war in 1939, £18,000,000 was spent in a day, and for destruction. There was no problem of money then or through the whole six years ;of the war. Yet the Government turns round now and says that it is going to give 5s. endowment for the first child when, as honorable senators on this side have pointed out, 5s. at present, and particularly since the .10th December, 1949, would not buy a decent feed .for a child. </para>

                    <para>The Attorney-General, replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> said that if honorable senators on this side persisted in a proposal to submit an amendment to make the endowment payment for the first child 10s. a week they would kill the bill. "Will the people of Australia believe that? I guarantee that the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper),</inline> who has been interjecting, has paid 5s. a head for the dingoes which are his main concern in Queensland. At every opportunity while he was Leader of the Opposition in this chamber he spoke about the dingoes in Queensland. I reminded the Minister earlier, and remind him again, that he is surrounded by political dingoes now, so he should be careful. I shall give another illustration in justification of the fears in the minds of honorable senators on this side of the chamber, and I emphasize again that we are mainly concerned with the motive behind the Government's action. That motive is definitely an overall reduction of the basic wage. I say that emphatically. </para>

                            <para>- Order ! An honorable senator, in speaking, must repeat himself continually to the extent of becoming tedious before he can be said to come within the rule. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sandford</inline> has repeated certain matters on several occasions. He has not been exactly tedious. He has been rather entertaining. Nevertheless there comes a time when an honorable senator should cease repeating arguments. I should not say, in giving my decision, that he has been guilty of tedious repetition ; but he has repeated several arguments in order, I suppose, to emphasize them. </para>

                        <para>. - I should not have entered this debate but for the trend that it has taken. I believe that this measure represents a dishonest attempt by the Government to interfere with the standard of living of the Australian people. The proposal is, in effect, to add 5s. a week to the income of approximately 1,000,000 families in Australia, but in fact, those families, together with everybody else in the community, will actually have their standard of living lowered if this measure becomes law. The Minister knows quite well that the passage of this bill would mean that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court would take child endowment for the first. child into consideration in computing the basic wage. The Government has shown complete disregard for the court. On the 1st March, in this chamber, I asked the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> the following questions - </para>

                    <para class="block">In effect, the Attorney-General said that when the measure came before the Parliament the matter to which I had referred would be explained. The Minister explained it in his second-reading speech by saying that if in fixing the basic wage, the court took into consideration the endowment payment of 5s., proposed in thi9 bill, the Government would increase the amount to 10s. That is the Government's explanation, but apparently the Attorney-General regarded his duty so lightly that he did not consider the matter worth explaining when I asked him several questions about it. He treated the Senate with contempt by refusing to give a direct answer. Whether or not my subsequent questions involved matters of policy, the first question was really simple enough to warrant a direct answer. I merely asked whether the Attorney-General's Department had made a certain investigation. Apparently it had not done so. </para>
                    <para>This measure will affect the welfare of 3,000,000 workers in Australia, and may have a profound influence on the Australian economy. If the court takes child endowment for the first child into consideration when fixing the basic wage, single men and women in industry, married men and women with no children, or with children over sixteen years of age, will lose, I consider, 12s. a week in the basic wage. If the Government were to accept the Opposition's proposed amendment that the endowment be increased to 10s., people with families would at least be cushioned to some degree against the inevitable reduction of the basic wage. This measure will reduce the standard of living of the people generally. The amendment that has been foreshadowed by the Opposition is not out of line with the general principles of the bill. After <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> had spoken on this measure, the Attorney-General rose immediately and said that if the Opposition pursued its proposal to make the endowment payment under this bill 10s., instead of 5s. the bill would be dropped and the people would be the losers. What authority did the Attorney-General have to make that statement ? He had not had time to discuss the matter with the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan)</inline> or with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> How did the Senate act when the Scullin Government was in office? It reviewed and interfered with the Scullin Government's legislation. I remind honorable senators that when the first Curtin Government took office, one of its first pieces of legislation was an amendment of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. When that bill came before the Senate which, at that time, had an antiLabour majority, it was amended. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> was a member of the Senate at that time. He was then, of course, in opposition. Although the bill was purely a repatriation measure, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> moved for the inclusion of a clause providing for preference to ex-servicemen. That had nothing to do with the bill. However, the Curtin Government was forced to accept the amendment. It did not squeal or say that it would drop the legislation. I believe that the present Attorney-General was also a member of the Senate at that time. If so, he will recall that the anti-Labour parties supported <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand's</inline> amendment, although it had no relation to the legislation then under consideration. There fore, I cannot understand how the Attorney-General had the effrontery to say, in his speech on this measure, that if the Opposition persisted with its proposed amendment, the bill would be dropped. </para>
                    <para>We have been told often that the true function of the Senate is to be a House of review. Very well; we shall review very carefully all the legislation that is brought before us. The Attorney-General's statement that the legislation would be withdrawn if amended by the Senate, was supported by the Prime Minister some days later. Any government that adopts such an attitude is obviously hoping that it will not have to proceed with certain legislation. I do not think that honorable senators opposite are very much concerned about endowing the first child., otherwise they would be prepared to make the payment of 10s. to keep it in line with the existing legislation. We do not want half price payments in this country. We are well able to pay " full fare " for all the children. If the Government considers that endowment of the first child is desirable, it should not hesitate to agree to a payment of 10s., but I am afraid that honorable senators opposite are more concerned with the interests of their supporters who paid the fares of the honorable gentlemen into this Parliament. At election time, huge advertisements were inserted in the newspapers by organizations such as the Chamber of Manufactures. The only way those people can be repaid is by reducing the basic wage, and this measure is part of a conspiracy to do that. It is significant that the proposal to extend child endowment has been brought forward while a basic wage hearing is in progress. If this legislation were passed by the Senate to-night, and by the House of Representatives to-morrow, it would not become effective until the 20th June. Why has the 20th June been selected ? Clearly the bill has been introduced at this stage in a calculated effort to interfere with the deliberations of the Arbitration Court. In conclusion, I say that although the Government proposes to pay 5s. a week to 1,000,000 people, it will take from those people, and from 2,000,000 more people, 2s. 6d. a week, and reduce the standard of living. </para>

                        <para>. - I have been very interested during the debate to listen to the speeches made by Government supporters concerning important pronouncements on social services, and I have been more than interested to read in the daily press the allegations that Labour senators have performed acrobatic somersaults in their attitude towards this proposal. However, I do not think that I can fairly be accused of having done that. I do not think that there is anything in the attitude manifested by the Australian Labour party towards this measure that is incompatible with what we have always stood for. At no time has the Labour movement pronounced against child endowment. In reply to the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> may I inform the honorable senator that Labour administrations were responsible for most of the social security legislation enacted since federation. After the honorable senator referred to the issues before the people at the last election as a contest between free enterprise and socialism I was rather amazed to hear her wholeheartedly support the bill now before the Senate, which is essentially a socialist measure. That bill proposes to make a better distribution of the national income so that those who need it most, that is the mothers of families, may receive a little more. Members of the Australian Labour party have always stood for child endowment, and we supported it long before child endowment was introduced in 1941. In 1927 a royal commission was1 appointed to inquire into the desirability of introducing child endowment in Australia. That commission consisted of five members, and the Australian Labour party was represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Muscio</inline> and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Curtin. In the light of the debate that has taken place on this bill it is interesting to notice some of the conclusions arrived at by the members of the royal commission, which are expressed in reports of the majority and the minority of the members of the commission. In the majority report it was stated that of. the trade unionists who gave evidence before the royal commission both as individuals and as representatives of their unions, all representatives advocated the introduction of child endowment payments for children up to the age of sixteen years. The rate of payment suggested was 10s. a week. I emphasize that that recommendation was made in 1927, more particularly because we hear a great deal now about putting value back in the £1. It is obvious that if honorable senators opposite were consistent they would advocate payment of child endowment of at least £1 a week. </para>

                    <para>Members of the Opposition have been accused of opposing payment of child endowment for the first child of a family when this matter was previously before the Parliament. Let me repeat now what I said then, which is that no one is more agreeable than I am to the payment of child endowment, provided that the basis of payment remains unaltered. </para>

                            <para>- Some assurances have been given by the Government in that respect; but members of the Opposition say : " "Why make it only 5s. a week? Why differentiate between the members of a family? Why not make it 10s. a week ? " Of course there is a snag in this proposal, and supporters of the Government realize its existence, because the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said that if child endowment were to receive cognizance in the determination of the basic wage the Government would consider increasing the child endowment payments. And that is where we beg to differ from the Government, because never yet in Australia has any court of arbitration excluded such a payment from its calculations in determining the basic wage; nor has any portion of the basic wage been specifically set aside for a man, his wife or the members of his family. Every .State has adopted a different system of calculating the needs of a family. In some States the needs assessment has been based on a family unit of a man, wife and one, two or three children; but in no State has that assessment received legislative effect. I do not think that any State government yet has the courage to say that the wage should be fixed for a man, his wife and any specified number of children. In 1914 or  1915.  the late </para>

The Australian Labour party, however, says that the standard of payment should be payment for the work that is done. If the calculation is to be based on what industry can afford to pay the rate paid to-day would be considerably in excess of actual wages paid in any industry. </para>
                    <para>When supporters of the Government claim all the credit for the introduction of child endowment it is interesting to inform ourselves of the history of child endowment legislation in Australia. Child endowment is not a new thought. In the days of the younger Pitt child endowment and family allowances were being discussed. In the Napoleonic era payment of family allowances was introduced in Prance as a normal part of an employee's remuneration. In the early twenties after World War 1. two countries in war-torn Europe which had been particularly ravaged by war introduced payment of child allowances. Those countries were Belgium and Germany. Australia, which we imagine has always taken the lend in social services, did not rise to the height of those countries until 1941. True it is that a royal commission was appointed to consider child endowment in 1927, and, as I remarked earlier, in the light of all that has been said in this debate it is interesting to note now that the Government of that time was willing to abide by the majority decisions of the royal commission, and, therefore, did nothing about child endowment. In other words, it did not take any action along the lines proposed by the minority, which comprised the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Muscio..</inline> The minority report of the royal commission recommended that industry should bear the cost of child endowment, and asserted that it was the function of the nation to give as much help to the family man in rearing his children as possible. That report also emphasized that it was just as much the duty of industry to bear the cost of providing endowment as it was of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Muscio</inline> submitted a very lucid report, but unfortunately that report was pigeon-holed and was not unearthed until 1941, when, in the dying days of an anti-Labour administration, action was taken to implement their recommendations. A measure to provide for child endowment was introduced by the present Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> and it received the blessing of the Labour members of the Parliament. I would ask those members of the Government who have not yet done so to peruse the report of the debate which ensued in the House of Representatives, and subsequently in this chamber, nine years ago. Members of the political parties that now support the Government subjected the administration of that time to a great deal of criticism, and it is significant that many of those who criticized the principle of child endowment at that time now occupy high places in the present GovernmentHad they been quite truthful at that time many of them would have said that they were totally opposed to granting child endowment. An examination of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports of 1941 discloses that not one Labour voice was raised against child endowment. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane,</inline> who then led the Labour party in the Senate, advocated the very thing that I now advocate, which is, that child endowment should be paid in respect of all children. Furthermore, he urged that the rate of payment then proposed should be increased. However, members of the Labour party were compelled to accept the little leaven offered by the government of that time; but they promised that if Labour were returned to office, child endowment would be liberalized. I am happy to say that Labour subsequently fulfilled its promise. When Labour assumed office one of its first tasks was to increase child endowment, first to 7s. 6d., and subsequently to 10s. a week. I 'am not trying to detract I2. any respect from the good intentions of the present 'Government in this matter. I welcome the bill, but, for the edification of those members of the Senate who have not been members of this chamber for very long, I must say that it has been a very hard task at times for Labour to pass much of its social legislation. For instance, let me recall to honorable senators that when* the Fisher Government introduced legislation for tne payment of maternity allowances one member of the Parliament who opposed the proposal said that the payment of maternity allowances would be " a sop to proflicacy". That was a deliberate insult to the womanhood of Australia. </para>

                    <para>S-anator TANGNEY.- The mothers of Australia made sure that he is not here -now. That was one piece -of legislation that was introduced by a Labour administration. Let me also remind honorable senators that when the Curtin Government assumed office .in the darkest days of the war, and at a time when the government had to assume responsibility for the preservation of all of us, it took that occasion to keep faith with the people of Australia. Let me also remind honorable senators that it was a Labour administration which introduced widows' pensions, and I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson,</inline> whom I knew when she was a widow battling to support three small children^ must appreciate that. The honorable senator, like many other fine women in this country, had to work hard to support her children because in those days no assistance was provided for the widows of ihis country. .It was also a Labour administration which introduced maternity allowances. I know something of the circumstances surrounding that measure because I was a member of the special services committee that recommended the introduction of nraternity allowances. It was decided to pay mothers a small allowance of £15 to cover the medical expenses of confinement and leave a little money for the mothers. What happened then ? I shall repeat now what was told to me by eminent nurses and church authorities in various States. At that time the ordinary medical charge for confinements was £5, and 90 per cent, of the births in public and private hospitals were normal births where the mothers did not require the attendance of specialists. Rut as soon as the maternity allowance was increased to £15, what happened? Immediately, mothers had to have specialist treatment, and the specialist charge, invariably, was £15. Therefore, they were no better off than they were previously. This matter was brought to my attention by the matron of the largest maternity hospital in Western Australia, Matron Walsh, and various church representatives in the different parts of Australia. The Government then decided to do something to ensure that the legislation that it had enacted in the interests of the mothers of this country should not be nullified by the selfish attitude of persons like those who .have defied Labour's efforts to .establish medical and pharmaceutical benefits. The 'Chifley Government made it possible for mothers to collect "the maternity allowance at the rate of 2.5s. a week, commencing a month before the due date of confinement. Let us see what happened then. The effect was amazing; immediately arrangements were made for mothers to collect their maternity allowance at the rate of 25s. a week instead of being obliged to accept it in a lump .sum of £15, the health of that section of the community improved to an amazing degree'! No longer did 90 per cent, of mothers need specialist care; the proportion who did so immediately decreased to the normal 10 per cent. We want more and more legislation of that kind that 'has had such beneficial effects upon the community. </para>
                    <para>I mention "these facts in the debate on this bill, because this morning we were told that the non-Labour parties had done this and that for the people, and the question was asked why Labour had not done more during its eight years of office. No Government anywhere 'has a record in "the social services field comparable with that, of the: Curtin, and Chifley Labour Governments. Furthermore, while those Governments were passing such splendid social service legislation for the betterment of every section of the community, they were fighting a war; and the wareffort of the people of Australia during the five years of Labour- administration and two preceding years of non-Labour administration compared more than favorably with that of any other country, ally or foe. We have heard praise from the highest quarters of what Australia accomplished during- the war; That work was not just done by the Government; it was done because every man and woman in the community realized that it was his, or her, job to- do all that was possible in our war effort. But side by side with that effort and the fact that we had to find enormous sums of money for the prosecution of the war, we were also able to put a wide range of social services legislation upon the statute-book. </para>
                    <para>The Labour Government instituted widows' pensions.. I know what that benefit meant to recipients. Before I was elected to the Senate I was employed as a teacher at a school for backward and so-called delinquent children. At that time I worked in conjunction with the Children's Court. I saw children brought before the court who were described as delinquents, but they were not delinquents; society was delinquent. Those children were the product of divided homes or homes in which the breadwinner had died and the mother was obliged to do menial tasks such as washing and scrubbing offices, with the result that she was able to spend very little time with her children after school hours. Realizing the need that existed for the provision for such assistance and what a comfort it would prove to widowed mothers, I was very pleased indeed when the Labour Government instituted widows' pensions. Those pensions are not as high as we should like them to be, but they are provided, and the rates were doubled by the Labour Government that instituted them. </para>
                    <para>With the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> and certain honorable members of the House of Representatives, </para>
                    <para class="block">I was a member of. a committee that investigated the hospital situation throughout Australia. Our inquiries convinced us that the two greatest causes of anxiety on the part of the average Australian were the fear of unemployment and the fear of sickness. We learned how vastly uneconomic it was to do nothing for our sick people, particularly for the sick breadwinner who remained at his job until the time had passed when medical, help could be of real benefit to him, because his cry - and all of us have heard it - was, "How can I go to hospital? Who is going to look after my wife and children ? ". Many a man has been lost to the economic life of this country because his family lacked the requisite finance to enable him to obtain medical attention when he was most in. need of it. Sitting in the Senate some years ago, when the Chifley Labour Government introduced legislation to provide unemployment benefits, I heard an honorable senator, who has since died, say that the Government was thereby giving sops to idlers and was encouraging idlers in the community. I said then, and I repeat it now, that that was an unjustified attack on the Australian worker, because I have yet to meet a decent Australian citizen who would prefer that his wife and children should be kept by government grant, no matter how willingly it might be given, rather than work himself in order to keep his family in comfort. The amount of unemployment benefit was not great but, such as it was, it kept a roof over the unemployed man's wife and children while he received medical attention. That was not class legislation. The Chifley Government also provided hospital benefit at the rate of 8s. a day, and I am only one of many who have reason to be thankful for that assistance. Therefore, the Chifley Government was not remiss in looking after the needs of those in the community who are most in need of help. The object of that legislation, of course, has been to provide social security to the people and to render assistance to all sections of the community by imposing the heaviest taxes on those best able to bear the burden. </para>
                    <para>I have mentioned these facts to show that the Labour party is not opposed to the provision of endowment for the first child in a family, particularly when we now have the Government's assurance that this benefit will not in any way interfere with the Arbitration Court in its determination of the basic wage. That is the only interpretation that I can place upon the introduction of this legislation. That being so, we on this side contend that the Government should not differentiate between the members of a family and, therefore, should endow all children in a family, including the first, at the rate of 10s. a week. A Labour Government in New Zealand did so over five years ago. Therefore, there is no justification for the accusation published in various newspapers that the Labour party has turned a somersault in respect of child endowment. I was not built to be an acrobat, either in mind or body. Our attitude is in line with what Labour governments have done in the social services field since 1941. We have a record of which we can be proud because, in addition to introducing so much new legislation, Labour governments also reviewed existing legislation in this field. They doubled the age and invalid pension. Although I do not think that even now that pension is sufficient we took every opportunity to increase it in order to bring it more into line with our economic prosperity. </para>
                    <para>I hope that the Government, which has inherited overflowing coffers, will give some of the overflow to the sick and unfortunate members of the community who are just as much entitled to such help from it as the inhabitants of Burma are. The Labour movement has always stood for child endowment. A Labour Government in New South Wales introduced child endowment for the first time in any State in 1927. In Australia, to-day, we have the spectacle of 4½ per cent. of the population of the country possessing 22½ per cent. of the nation's wealth. That is why we say that this measure is welcome, and why we shall propose that the rate of endowment under it be increased to 10s. a week. I congratulate the Government upon the introduction of this measure to endow all children in a family, and I trust that it will earn the gratitudeof the mothers of Australia still further by accepting the amendment that the Opposition has foreshadowed to increase the endowment to 10s. I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister will not find that the Arbitration Court will take this matter into consideration when it considers the basic wage. All of us know what happened in December last; but I shall not dilate upon that subject. However, I know also that when the royal commission on child endowment or family allowances was appointed 23 years ago it at once found itself up against the question of how the various wage-fixing tribunals would view the provision of child endowment. The National Parliament should have power over industrial tribunals to ensure that child endowment shall not be offset by a corresponding reduction of the basic wage. I support this proposal to provide endowment for the first child, because I know that it will be of immense benefit to people throughout Australia. I know also that the people will not be satisfied with half a loaf, seeing that when the non-Labour parties, at the last general election, promised to introduce child endowment for the first child, they were quite certain that it would be equal to that provided in respect of other children. I am confident that it was in that belief that so many people supported the nonLabour parties on that occasion. I sincerely hope that their confidence has not been misplaced. Therefore, I support the provision of endowment at the rate of 10s. a week for every child in a family. </para>

                    <para>I propose now to deal with the claim of the Labour party that it has improved the conditions of Australian mothers since 1941. In that year, child endowment was introduced by the Menzies Government. Payment was made at the rate of 5s. for every child other than the first child. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sandford</inline> said that the Labour party increased the endowment by 2s. 6d. in 1945 and again by 2s. 6d. in 1948, but almost in the next breath he said that since 1941 the value of the £1 has depreciated from 20s. to 10s. In those circumstances, the Labour party cannot honestly claim that it benefited one child or one mother in Australia by the increases of child endowment for which it was responsible. We have promised the Australian people that we shall put value back into the £1. Before that can be done, industrial peace must be established. I congratulate the Government upon ite efforts to achieve that objective, in the course of which it has done some things that the Labour party had not the courage to do. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber are sincere when they say that they desire industrial peace to be established in this country. We believe that only by increased production can value he put back into the £1, and production cannot be increased without industrial peace. </para>
                    <para>In 1941 the Liberal party and the Australian Country partyintroduced a measure which provided for the payment of an endowment of 5s. a week for every child other than the first child in every family. We have now introduced another measure, providing that an endowment of 5s. a week shall be paid in respect of the first child. The Labour party, which made no promises about child endowment during the election campaign, now urges that the endowment should be 10s. a week for every eligible child, and also that the Government should instruct the Arbitration Court that the payment shall not be taken into consideration in the determination of the basic wage. I hope that the Government will never approach the Arbitration Court on any matter of policy affecting the determination of the basic wage. It should be the policy of all parties that the Arbitration Court shall be allowed to function as a free institution, in the interests of the welfare of the people of Australia. If it were to be subjected to interference by political parties, its value would be considerably decreased. </para>

                            <para>- This measure, if it is passed, will benefit 1,110,000 Australian families. I have always believed that some machinery should be devised by which the whole of the Australian people could help those Australians who are rearing families. By means of this measure, the Government proposes to make approximately £15,000,000 a year available for the assistance of family men in this country. It is confident that the measure will receive the support of the Australian people. The present Government parties promised the electors that it would be introduced, and that promise has now been honoured. The attitude of the Labour party to the bill is insincere. During the general election campaign the payment of endowment in respect of the first child did not form part of its policy, but now, three months after the election, it is demanding that the endowment be 10s., not 5s. a week. If honorable senators opposite are sincere in their demand, why did not they say during the election campaign that, if returned to office, they would do what they now say should be done ? We believe that the economy of this country is sufficiently strong to enable the Government to expend £15,000,000 a year for this purpose. Let us begin by paying the endowment for the first child at the rate of 5s. a week. It can easily be increased later if it is found that our economy is strong enough to enable the additional expenditure to be incurred, but no government would have sufficient courage to reduce it. If sufficient funds are available later, the endowment, not only in respect of the first child, but also in respect of subsequent children, can be increased. </para>

                    <para>The Labour party claims that it represents the workers of Australia. If honorable senators opposite really believe that, they should cross to this side of the chamber. The Liberal party and the Australian Country party are now looking after, not only the workers of Australia, but also the whole of the people of Australia. They are the only parties that can look after all sections of the community. The Labour party looks after only a small section of the community, and I doubt if the workers are included in that section. I commend this bill to honorable senators, and I am confident that the Opposition will vote unanimously for its passage in its present form. </para>

                    <para>. - I take this opportunity to direct the attention of the Senate to the plight of ex-servicemen in this country who are suffering from war neurosis. I refer, specifically, to a ministerial reply that I have received to-day in answer to questions that I placed on the notice paper several weeks ago. On more than one occasion since I have been a member of this chamber I have brought to the notice of successive Ministers for Repatriation the sordid picture of our ex-service personnel who are incarcerated in civilian mental asylums. In my opinion the reply that I received to-day from the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> docs not meet the circumstances adequately. Nor does it hold out any great hope of relief for these unfortunate people. It i3 couched in language similar to that which has always been the bulwark of repatriation administration. Although many years have passed since the termination of World War I., the onus to prove that their injury resulted from war service still rests on the patients themselves. Many of our ex-service personnel are in mental institutions throughout Australia to-day because successive governments have made no practical attempt to provide them with suitable quarters in surroundings that would at least give them a faint hope of recovery. They should be quartered in a more congenial environment, perhaps with other ex-service personnel whose disabilities are not so great as their own. In his lengthy reply the Minister stated - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The cases which the honorable senator has in mind are apparently those whose neurosis is not accepted as being due to war service. Such cases are the responsibility of authorities other than the Repatriation Commission which. I might add, takes a very sympathetic view of the relationship of any disability to war service. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I contend that that is merely burking the issue. If the treatment of these cases is not the responsibility of the  Repatriation  Commission - which I do not doubt, because this is a hardy annual - it is the responsibility of the Australian Government, irrespective of its political kidney. I refuse to be side-tracked by replies such as this. The Government should arrange for suitable quarters to be erected in the many military hospitals in this country for repatriation cases needing restraint. In this connexion the Minister's reply reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In the larger States most of the restrained patients are in the repatriation blocks, but in the smaller States the numbers are insufficient to warrant the building of separate blocks for the segregation of the -homicidal and suicidal patients, therefore they are housed in special State accommodation. </para>

                <para class="block">The greatest criminal of this country, even if he is a violent prisoner, receives better treatment than do our ex-service personnel who, through enemy action, are to-day suffering from neurosis. It is a condemnation, hard and stark, of the inactivity of the various governments, that these men are to-day being treated in such a manner. The concluding paragraph of the Minister's reply reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The housing and treatment of all cases of neurosis not accepted as due to war service is the responsibility of the State governments, and the Repatriation Commission has no say in or control of their treatment, therefore it is not proposed that the Federal Government should secure temporary premises for their housing aud treatment. </para>

I believe that no section of the Australian people ever dreamed that they would live to see the day when the men who volunteered to defend this country with their lives would be incarcerated in mental hospitals. It is a shocking condemnation of the various governments in this country. I call on all honorable senators to urge the Commonwealth or State Governments, wherever the responsibility lies, to remedy this scandal, and to no longer permit these sordid circumstances to continue. </para>

                    <para>. - I draw the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> to the fact that, until he submitted a motion a few minutes ago to the effect that the Senate should resume after the Easter recess on the 19th April, honorable senators were unaware of the proposed date of the resumption of sittings. Is anything gained by keeping secret the date on which the Senate will resume? Honorable senators, particularly those who represent distant States, must make their arrangements in advance. The withholding of this information until almost the last minute hinders them considerably. I suggest to the Minister that at a reasonable time prior to special adjournments of this kind in the future, he should confer with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> about the proposed date of resumption. It could be arranged that if certain forward business is carried out the Senate could resume on a given day, and that if other business had to he held over this chamber could resume on another day. I trust that in future the Minister will be able to notify honorable senators some time before the formal motion for a special adjournment is moved, of the intended date of resumption, in order to facilitate their travelling and other arrangements. </para>

                    <para>. - People in widely-separated parts of New South Wales have recently suffered considerable loss through the most disastrous floods that have occurred in this country for years past. Last week practically every house in Wagga Wagga was inundated, and even at the present time people at Darlington Point and Hay are awaiting the full weight of flood waters. When I directed a question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister in this chamber recently in connexion with the alleviation of flood distress, he suggested that as I knew a lot about the matter, I should tell him something about it, and he would then be pleased to consider what could be done. This was a matter in which the Government should have moved. Two days ago the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> intimated that he intended to inform the Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGirr,</inline> that the Australian Government would expend £1 for £1 with the New South Wales Government in connexion with the alleviation of flood distress. I point out that the Flood Belief Committee is required to furnish certificates in connexion with its expenditure. To comply with the requirements of the Auditor-General, the sum that the Government proposed to allocate for a specific purpose must be stated. The Government should not enter willy nilly into a £1 for £1 expenditure arrangement. I remind the Senate that I represented the Commonwealth on the Flood Belief Committee from 1945 until the 10th December last. In connexion with the floods at Kempsey and Maitland last year the Australian and the State governments each made £40,000 available in the first place for relief purposes. The Flood Belief Committee had to pay for all items used in connexion with the floods. Although Royal Australian Air Force personnel dropped blankets over the flooded areas, the Flood Relief Committee was required to pay for the use of the aircraft, and had to reimburse either the Royal Australian Air Force or the Army for the cost of the blankets. In addition, it was required to meet the cost of food, fodder, the wages or Army personnel operating the Army ducks, freight, and clothing. It also had to pay the State departments and instrumentalities that arranged for the cleaning up of the debris. How can the Flood Relief Committee function efficiently unless a stated amount is allocated to it to expend? Later we asked the Prime Minister and the Premier of the State for further assistance in connexion with the Kempsey flood and they made another £40,000 available. Yet the committee was criticized. The newspapers were glad to accept any criticism regarding the " cheapness " of the Chifley and McGirr Governments. Members of Parliament now in the Ministry wanted us to hand out money willingly to local committees so that they could spend it. The secretary of the committee on one occasion explained that the committee could not hand out money in that way, as the expenditure had to be certified by the Auditor-General. The committee dealt with the claims as they arose with the knowledge that it had £80,000 to spend. In some instances it went back and reviewed the early claims. It is impossible to work effectively without a definite amount being made available. Floods have occurred recently in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Extensive areas in the north coast district of New South Wales, from the Queensland border down to Maitland, in the south coast district as far as Nowra, and in the Murrumbidgee area are being flooded. The New South Wales Government is not a taxing authority. It has only certain sources from which it can derive funds and if it has to continue to provide funds for every flood that occurs - and they have been occurring since 1945 - it will not be able to stand the strain. Then the Commonwealth Government will find the New South Wales Government applying to the Commonwealth Grants Commission for further assistance. It is up to the Commonwealth to see that these places are restored to their former state of cleanliness, that the people are able to get back into their homes and that some relief is granted to people, not as compensation but to cushion the feelings of those who suffered very badly. I make this appeal in all sincerity. </para>

                <para class="block">I say to the Government that some statement should bo made early as to the amount of money available : it' should not be on the £1 for £1 basic. On that basis, if the New South Wales Government determines that it will expend only £10,000 on flood relief from its fund the Commonwealth will make a similar sum available. But if £10,000 is to be the amount the Government should tell us. Let us know definitely what the amount is to be. The committee should know just what amount is meant by the £1 for £1 arrangement. The statement should be made early to enable the committee to render a service. Its members work early and and late. Their one anxiety is to assist the people in distress. If they live in a home; the committee wants to give them some comfort by way of a cheque to restore their furniture, clothing or linen. If the sufferer is a farmer, the committee wants to help him to get back into production. Matters such as these are the only concern of the committee, which should be given every encouragement. The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> knows, as an accountant, that it is a very bad principle to spend money and to discover afterwards what amount was available. The amount should be stated first, and everything should be done in a proper and orderly manner in the best interests of this Parliament and whatever State Parliament is concerned in the flood damage relief. </para>

                        <para>- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> is not in the chamber, but I have discussed the matter with him and also with the Opposition "Whip. I was not in a position to make an announcement earlier, because I did not know how long the Opposition was going to continue the debate. Honorable senators on this side are <inline font-style="italic">ready</inline> to vote on the bill now before the chamber at any time. When the Senate would adjourn and for how long was entirely in the hands of honorable senators on the Opposition side. I have not meant any discourtesy, as I think the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition Whip will agree. It was only yesterday, when I saw the way that the debate was going, that we were able to determine when the Senate would resume its sittings. I was hoping that the Senate would be able to adjourn until the end of April, but with the business to be transacted it has been found necessary to meet earlier. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty</inline> and all honorable senators that it is my wish to reciprocate the courtesy that I have received from their Leader, and as soon as I am able to pass information on, I shall be. glad to do so. </para>

                <para>Replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour,</inline> I point out that it has been traditional with all governments, whether Labour or Liberal, not to attempt to make political capital out of national disasters and personal tragedy. As I understand it, the practice has been to leave the immediate attention and alleviation of suffering in the proper hands, that is in the hands of the State government, because it has control of transport, the police force, and the machinery necessary to extend relief immediately where it is most urgently required, and then to share the expense incurred on a £l-for-£l basis. The Commonwealth has not that machinery. I am not stating that dogmatically, but that is the position as I know it. If 1 am wrong, I should like the honorable senator to give me particulars. I was inearnest, and am still in earnest, in asking him to give me details; but I am hesitant about committing the' Commonwealth Government to intrude into a matter which is peculiarly the duty of the State. I do not think the Commonwealth Government can do more than say, " You do the work and we will bear half the expense ". The Commonwealth Government is not in a position to know whether £5,000 or £50,000 is a proper amount to give. </para>
