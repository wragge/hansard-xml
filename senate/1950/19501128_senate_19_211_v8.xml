                        <para>- I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General with the statement that, owing to the frequent flooding of the Maitland district during the last two years, there is great apprehension among the people who live in the low-lying areas of that district whenever the level of the Hunter River rises substantially. Will the Minister request his colleague to consider askingradio stations in the Maitland district to broadcast, at regular times, announcements stating the height of the river and, when the water reaches a level of 25 feet at Belmore Bridge, to broadcast hourly bulletins until the danger of a flood has passed? </para>

                        <para>- Has the Minister for Trade and Customs read a statement published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of last Saturday on behalf of Australian public opinion polls ? If so,' has he noted that the statement says that a comprehensive poll, which has just been completed, was taken after the Senate passed a bill for a referendum on prices control? I do not want to go into details, but it is claimed that the poll indicates that three in four of the persons interviewed desire prices control to remain and, notwithstanding that, according to the  results  of the poll, ' South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania show a slight preference for State control of prices rather than for Federal control, a referendum to alter the Constitution to give the Commonwealth power over prices would be carried in each of the six States. I ask the Minister whether it is the intention of the Government to proceed :with the referendum for which' provision is  made in the Constitution Alteration (Prices) Bill? </para>

                        <para>- I was  in  Brisbane during the week-end and did  not  have an opportunity to read in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> the statement to which  the*  honorable senator has referred. With  all  respect to the honorable senator, I point out that it would be quite impracticable to draw any sound conclusion from the poll unless one knew the nature of the questions that were asked of the persons interviewed. I am certain that everybody is in favour of lower prices, but if people were asked whether they were  in  favour of wage pegging, man-power direction and control and other controls that would be inherent in an effective system of prices control, their answers might be somewhat different from the answers that they would give to an  inquiry  whether they were in favour of prices control. Not having had an opportunity to read the report and not knowing the nature of the questions asked of the persons interviewed, I have no further comment to make. </para>

Can he inform me whether the re-organization and enlargement of the Engineering Branch is contemplated ? If so, why was not this urgent matter concerning telephone and telegraph facilities not carried out simultaneously with the re-organization of similar branches in other States? Can the Minister inform me what is the earliest, date on which such a re-organization could take place? </para>

                            <para>It is nut the practice to load cargo for other States on top of Fremantle cargo. When it is understood that  a  vessel may be loading cargo at two or three ports overseas for discharge at three or four ports in Australia, and that all cargo may not come down to the ship in proper sequence for port of discharge, it will be appreciated that over-stowage is sometimes inevitable. Nevertheless, in view of the difficulties thereby caused, the attention of the Conference lines in London some time ago was drawn to the matter and as the discharge and re-loading of the eastern cargo is costly and must delay the ship, it is obvious that shipowners themselves are anxious not to overstow where it can possibly be avoided. </para>

There is, and has been for. some time past, congestion in the port. As in the case of other ports, although the same rate of work is not now being obtained as in pre-war days, Fremantle has not compared unfavorably with other ports. Under to-day's conditions one of the major problems is shortatge of waterside labour. Other factors, of course, also come into the problem, such as the rate at which cargo can be moved to and from the wharfs to enable the labour available to be used to its fullest efficiency. </para>

                        <para>- According to a report in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of Friday last, 30 Australians have been killed in Korea, and 120 wounded. Can the Minister for Trade and Customs say whether it is the policy of the Government to supply the newspapers with such information, and with general information about the Australians in Korea, while withholding it from members of the Senate? If that is not the policy of the Government, when may we expect a statement to be made in the Parliament regarding the situation in Korea ? </para>

A statement on foreign affairs is to be made in the Parliament this evening, but I do not know whether specific reference will be made to Korea. </para>

                        <para>Can the Minister representing the Postmaster-General state whether it is a fact that the general manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in December, 1949, recommended the week-end penalty rates paid to journalists, typists and announcers, employed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Is the Minister also able to say whether it is a fact that the general manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission has recommended that the payment of week-end penalty rates be discontinued. Is it a fact that the Australian Broadcasting Commission Staff Association is incensed by the action of the general manager in this matter, and intends to take a vote on the holding of a strike on the 2nd December. If the matters I have mentioned are facts, will the Minister take action to restore the payment of week-end  penalty rates in order that industrial pence within the Australian Broadcasting Commission may be maintained. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>A reduction was recently made by the commission to the penalty rates in order to overcome anomalies existing between those enjoying such rates and other staff. The alteration brought the penalty rates into line with a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator with respect to announcers and other awards of the Arbitrator and Arbitration Court covering week-end penalty rates for shift workers. The Commission has suggested to the Staff Association that if an amendment of the new conditions is desired an approach should be made to the Public Service Arbitrator for a variation, as he is the appropriate authority to determine any dispute between the commission and its staff. The Staff Association was previously under the impression that the Public Service Arbitrator was not empowered to deal with the matter but they have now been assured by him that he can do so. The association has, however, indicated that it prefers at this stage to continue discussions with the commission. </para>

Before I could make a statement on this matter, I should have to obtain further particulars of the case. If, as the honorable senator has indicated the grant of such a loan would assist in the restoration of the health of the man concerned, the matter appears to come within the province of the Repatriation Department as the restoration of the health of former members of the forces is its main function. If the honorable senator will give me full particulars of the case concerned I shall examine it on its merits and give him a considered reply as early as possible. </para>

                        <para>- I address a series of questions to the Minister representing the Minister acting for the Minister for the Interior. Is it a fact that at the cessation of hostilities in World War II. licences had been issued to only eight persons in Canberra to operate hire cars and that 26 hire cars are now in operation? ls it a fact that many of the holders of such licences are standing about the streets at the shopping centres of Canberra for hours each day while awaiting calls for the use of their vehicles and that many of them have engaged in other forms of employment in order to supplement their incomes? Does one of the holders of a hire car licence also work as a milk vendor to supplement his insufficient earnings from the operation of his hire car so that he may be able to enjoy <inline font-style="italic">what</inline> is regarded as the Australian standard of living? Were additional hire car licences issued in order to prevent those who have held such licences for many years from disposing of their hire car plates in the normal way of business? As the Government has consistently stated that it favours private enterprise, will the Minister ascertain whether hire car operators who have built up goodwill by rendering services to the people of the National Capital may now sell their plates as freely as taxi plates are sold in other parts of Australia? </para>

                            <para>No; there is no congestion of claims for basic wage variations awaiting the decision of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Employing the procedure provided for early in the present month by theConciliation and Arbitration Act 1950, the court has settled a formula for applying the principles laid down in its general determination on the basic wage. That formula is applicable both to the awards which were before the court during the recent general .basic wage inquiry and to other federal awards, in&gt; respect of which claims for variation have since been lodged. 1 am advised that, as a result, variations are being settled with the utmost despatch and that, by the end of the present week, it is likely that virtually all ff dural awards will have been varied so as. to provide for the increase in the basic wa«;e determined by the court. This speedy result is a tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Foster and his colleagues. </para>

                            <para>The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is well aware, however, of the seriousness of the damaged trees caused by mistletoe. In collaboration with the Forestry and Timber Bureau, investigations have been commenced since the end of the war in an attempt to find a satisfactory method of controlling the pest. Work clone to date has indicated that by means of an appropriate dosage of copper sulphate it may be possible to kill the mistletoe without undue injury to the trees. Copper sulphate pills inserted into the trunk of the tree have proved more satisfactory than liquid doses of the chemical because of smaller damage to the tree, but are much slower in their effects. About 5 per cent, control of mistletoe has been achieved with copper treatments, without serious injury to the tree. In addition to inorganic poisons, the possibility of controlling mistletoe by means of 2,4-D is being explored as, in preliminary trials, better results with less injury to the tree have been obtained with injections of this substance. The creeping mistletoe <inline font-style="italic">(Phrygilanthus</inline> spp.) appears to be more susceptible to 2,4-D than the pendulous type <inline font-style="italic">(Losanthus</inline> spp.), whereas the reverse holds for copper sulphate. As these trials have not yet been completed, it is not possible for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization to make definite recommendations regarding the control of mistletoe at this stage. However, as soon as the work is completed the results will be published. </para>

                        <para>. - I consider that the three measures before the chamber in connexion with wool, namely the Wool Sales Deduction (Administration) Bill 1950, the Wool Sales Deduction Bill (No. 1) 1950, and the Wool Sales Deduction Bill (No. 2), have been wrongly named, because their titles suggest that provision is to be made merely for deductions. They are, in fact, taxation measures. If the Government were honest in this matter it should have called the bills wool sales taxation bills, or "The Wool Grab". In his budget speech on the 12th October, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> said - </para>

                        <para>By requiring wool-growers to make certain pro-payments of taxation in this financial year, it will hold off a substantial part of the excess purchasing power to which the increase in wool prices has given rise. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The Treasurer made no bones about the matter, because he referred to " prepayments of taxation ". By introducing these bills which are sectional in their application, the Government has perpetrated a trick on a section of the Australian people. Because of the prosperity of the wool industry the Government has, in effect, said to the wool-growers that it proposes to take positive action to reduce their spending power, in the interests of the national economy. The proposal is immoral when we bear in mind that the Treasurer proposes to utilize the deductions which are expected te yield £103,000,000, to balance the budget. In other words, the right honorable gentleman proposes to balance the budget by a new method that has not been heard of before in this chamber. Instead of obtaining revenue for governmental purposes in the recognized manner, that is by direct and indirect taxation, the Treasurer proposes to tell the wool-growers of this country bluntly that although it is pleased that they are enjoying prosperous conditions, the Government is experienc ing difficulty in redeeming its promise to reduce taxation and that, in effect, it proposes to increase taxation in order to balance the budget. The Treasurer intends to deduct from the wool-growers 20 per cent, of the proceeds of wool sold both in Australia and overseas. He has admitted that this is a pre-payment method of taxation. It is an onslaught on a section of the Australian community. I am not aware of any provision in our taxation laws requiring taxpayers to pay tax prior to earning the relevant income. Under the " Pay-as-you-earn " method, instalments of tax are deducted from workers and other people weekly or fortnightly. As a result of excessive deductions based on overtime payments, in accordance with the formula, a taxpayer may pay a greater amount of tax during a year than is subsequently found to be due by him. Accordingly, when his assessment is completed he receives a refund from the Taxation Branch. In other cases a taxpayer may have to make up the leeway of tax. There is a vast difference between the system under which instalments of tax are deducted from the source of .income weekly or fortnightly, and the intended method under the proposed law. The measure before the chamber provides that after the 28th August, 1950, certain amounts shall be deducted willy nilly from the wool-growers, as the result of the profits that, they have received from the sale of their wool after that date. This is a retrospective application of taxation. The wool-growers have been let down badly by their representatives in the Parliament. This is an issue upon which members of the Australian Country party should have stood for the interests of the wool-growers, instead of supporting the Government. </para>
                    <para>I cannot understand why there  should  be discrimination against one section of the community. We have been told that the  Government  intends to introduce legislation to- tax excess profits. There are several industries in Australia, apart from wool-raising, in which high profits are being made at the present time. An excess profits tax would be the fairest way of drawing  off  surplus income from those industries, as well as from the wool-growers, and there would be  no  unfair </para>

                        1950. discrimination. The Government prefers, however, to impose a special tax on the wool-growers in order to raise £103,000,000 in an attempt to balance its budget. I can imagine what an outcry there would have been from the newspapers had such a proposal emanated from a Labour government. We would have been told that it was another attempt by bureaucracy to impose socialism on the community at the expense of a particular section.
                    </para>
                    <para>I have been informed that the legality of this legislation is open to challenge. The Constitution provides that there shall be no. discrimination in taxation. No person should be taxed until he has acquired the asset which, in law, is taxable. The financial year begins on the 1st July and ends on the 30th June. However, the Government does not intend to wait until the end of the year before grabbing the income of the wool-growers. It proposes to take 20 per cent, of the proceeds of the sale of wool, whether that deduction represents more or less than the amount which the grower will be ultimately liable to pay in income tax. The wool-growers are not a' large section of the community, and most of them produce only small quantities of wool. While there may be some justification for applying this proposal to bigpastoral interests, it is certainly unfair to apply it to the small wool-growers. Over the years, the wool-growers have had to take the good with the bad. They have had to accept world parity price for their product, whether that price was high or low, and they have received very little assistance from governments. During the war, it was practically impossible to do ordinary maintenance and developmental work on grazing properties because of shortages of labour and material. In this Senate, there have been frequent references to the scarcity of barbed wire and wire netting which graziers needed to protect their properties against rabbits and wild dogs. The Labour Government made allowance for that fact by permitting primary producers to set aside, tax-free, certain reserves with which to finance works when it became possible to carry them out. This legislation includes a hardship clause which, it is claimed, can be applied to particular cases, but apart from that, the Government proposes' to grab its percentage of the proceeds of all wool sales. The proposal is discriminatory and immoral. If the Government had been honest it would have admitted that, although it had promised to reduce taxation, it now found itself unable to do so; and that, in fact, it was necessary to increase taxation so as to raise an additional £103,000,000. </para>
                    <para>The Government says that it proposes to skim off £103,000,000 from the incomes of the wool-growers in order to check inflation, but I very much doubt whether, that result will be achieved. The money is to go into Consolidated Revenue, and will be expended during the year. Indeed, the Government is budgeting for a deficit. So far as the effect on inflation is concerned, it does not matter whether the money is expended by the wool-growers or by the Government. The record of this Government during the last eleven months does not encourage the belief that it is likely to expend revenue in such a way as to check inflation. At the moment, the outlook appears blacker than ever, particularly when we remember that, next year, the Government will have to put into circulation an additional £70,000,000 in the form of war gratuities. Therefore, not only will the Government be expending the £103,000,000 that it proposes to take from the wool-grower under this legislation, but also it will have to provide more than £70,000,000 for the payment of the war gratuity. Obviously, the position instead of improving will become worse. With all that additional money in circulation, serious thought and action by this Government will be required to save our economy from going on the rocks. During the depression years, our economy was wrecked by deflation. This time, unless remedial action is taken, it will be wrecked by excessive inflation. It is necessary that the National Government should at all times have absolute control over the currency so that it may issue or withdraw notes according to needs. The interests of the people generally must be the primary consideration. </para>
                    <para>Whichever way we look at this proposal, it is a sectional tax, and I am convinced that if the validity of this legislation were to ,be challenged by the wool-growers, there is every possibility that it would be declared unconstitutional. In the interests of equity, I believe that some' such action should be taken. Despite all that honorable senators opposite may say about the Curtin and Chifley governments, those administrations did, at least, levy taxes in accordance with ability to pay them. This Government seems to be returning to the old system under which people in the lower income groups had to pay relatively high taxes so that their more fortunate fellow citizens could have their commitments reduced. If that is to be the policy of the Government, this country will never get out of the financial morass into which it is drifting. </para>
                    <para>This legislation is contrary to the wishes of a majority of those whom it will affect, and were I a wool-grower, I should not hesitate to go out into the streets, and denounce this action by a government which professes to be particularly interested in the welfare of country people. Members of the Liberal party are so " liberal " that they are prepared to say to one section of the community, " Your income is too high. We propose to take some of it away from you. Next year, if what we have taken is more than you owe us in taxes, we shall make a refund to you ". That is bad enough, but I .believe that the Government has no intention to implement this scheme for one year only. The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> said in his second-reading speech that, each year, the Parliamentwould determine the deduction for the subsequent year. This year, 20 per cent, is to be withheld. Next year it may be IS per cent., 10 per cent., or any other figure that the Parliament may determine. Clearly this tax is not being imposed to meet a specific non-recurring situation. The situation is expected to recur year after year, and the purpose of this legislation is to help the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> to balance his budgets. </para>
                    <para>As I have said, this is a sectional tax to be levied on the wool-growers; but to what section of the community will the principle be extended next? </para>
                    <para class="block">What other source of revenue will the Commonwealth tap at its convenience?

                    <para class="block">That letter sums up succinctly the attitude of the wool-growers to this proposal. In order to balance its budget, the Government proposes to take from the wool-growers no less than £103,000,000 and it does not propose to pay interest on the money. In truth, it proposes to confiscate the wealth of the growers. Much has been said about the evils of confiscation in comparatively recent times. Honorable senators opposite have said that the term " confiscation " has a red tinge about it, yet they support a government which proposes to confiscate money which the wool-growers have earned by honest trading in the product of their labours. Wool-growers have always been prepared to accept the best price they can obtain for their product at auction. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> in introducing the budget, said that the wool cheque for last season amounted to £300,000,000.

On more than one occasion Government spokesmen have stated that they uphold the principle of free enterprise as opposed to organized and long-term marketing arrangements, yet the wool-growers who are engaged in free enterprise are to be penalized because they are prosperous as the result of high ruling prices for wool. I admit that the present very high price of wool constitutes a threat to our economic stability, but it does not justify a proposal to subject wool-growers to a special impost amounting to £103,000,000.

                        <para>. - This bill has given rise to a great deal of discussion, and rightly so. As honorable senators on both sides of the chamber have frequently stated, there is an inflationary trend to-day and it is necessary that something should be done in an endeavour to control it. In the last four months the price of wool has jumped to double the record price of last year. Whereas wool-growers then received £80 a bale for their wool, they are now receiving £160 'a bale. It is not difficult to realize that that has brought a large amount of additional money into circulation in this country, and that the Government is faced with the necessity of endeavouring to curb the inflationary effect of that money. From what has been stated in this chamber, that position could be dealt with in a variety of ways. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The 20 per cent, deduction, which is referred to by some people as a 20 per cent, tax, is nothing more than a prepayment of tax by wool-growers, deducted at the source. When wool is sold, the 20 per cent, deduction will be made and will be used as a prepayment of tax for which the wool-growers will be assessed at a later date. Naturally there will be various anomalies in the implementation of the prepayment. Those who know the conditions in the wool industry, and especially the conditions applying in Western Australia, will appreciate that conditions differ in the various States. The conditions in Western Australia, which is not highly developed, differ from those obtaining in the other States of the Commonwealth. Western Australia has many small farms, and consequently small farmers and wool-growers. It is to meet the needs of such persons in the various States that the hardship clauses have been inserted in this bill. As the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> has already stated, those provisions will be administered in such a way that the small farmers will not suffer because of the introduction of this measure. I hope that the Treasurer and the Commissioner for Taxation will pay special attention to the conditions that obtain in Western Australia, because I am certain that more wool-growers in that State will seek redress under the hardship provisions than in any other State. If there is an assurance that their difficulties will be dealt with expeditiously, I believe that half the objections to this measure will be overcome. It is hoped that where a farmer has been subjected to the 20 per cent, deduction and is not subject to income tax, the amount deducted will be made available to him straightaway under the hardship provisions. </para>
                    <para>Instances have been cited to illustrate how the 20 per cent, deduction would be an amount equal to three, four, five or even eight times the tax payable by producers. Such cases would also come within the hardship provision. There are anomalies in most legislation when it is first introduced. I trust that the Government will adjust the anomalies in this bill and that it will be brought into such good working order that it will not cause hardship to any one. </para>

                        stated that several telegrams were received by him from Western Australian people, and I have no doubt that most honorable senators from Western Australia have received similar telegrams. I do not think that any State raises more objection to this measure than does Western Australia. The . wool- growers of that State would have preferred the legislation to operate for oneyear only, but I am assured that tinepresent proposal is intended to operatefor one year and that although the deduction at the rate of 20 per cent, will continue after the end of the financial year,, such deduction will be subject to refund! unless the same or a lower rate is fixer! by Parliament for the next financial year..
                    </para>
                    <para>Another difficulty in relation to thismeasure also concerns the small woolgrower. It must be appreciated that » grower who produces six bales of wool to-day receives an income of practically £1,000. The only exemption, as far asthis tax is concerned, applies to an amount of £20. Had it been possible to provide for the exemption of an income of a larger amount, I think that it would have been better. However, I understand!' the risk that that would have involved. I hope that all the cases that come within that clause will also come within the hardship provisions and that the people concerned will not suffer because of it. I ask the Minister in charge of this bill to make a special request to the Treasurer to the effect that Western Australian small farmers, who, I feel sure, are those whowill suffer most, will receive as much consideration as possible under the hardship provisions in order that they may not suffer inconvenience and shortage of money. Those small farmers who are to-day enjoying the second or third year of decent prices are at last receiving incomes that would permit them toimprove their farms, to which they have been looking forward for years. In improving their farms they would be helping tn increase production, which is what this Government or any other government would wish them to do. If they are not obliged to make a pre-payment of tax, thesooner a decision in their favour is given by the Land Valuation Board, the better. </para>
                    <para>Other propositions were made when the.? matter was first discussed. There was the question of the imposition of an export tax. which the Country party resisted. There was also the question of the appreciation of the £1. I do not wish to set myself up as an expert on that matter, although I have always felt that it would perhaps be better if it had not been; bandied about as it has been. I am  confident  that by means of this prepayment of tax the Australian wool-grower will be its a far better position than he would have been had either of the other proposals been adopted. I noticed in a newspaper report at the week-end that in New Zealand the Government " froze " 33^ per cant, of the proceeds of the sales of wool. That percentage was worked OUt under an agreement between the wool-growers and the Government, and the " freezing " is to apply for an indefinite period. No "interest will be paid on the money "involved. That is far more stringent than is this scheme. I hope that when it is apparent that the necessity to restrict Spending power has vanished, the Government will ensure that this legislation will vanish also. </para>

                    <para>I ask the Minister in charge of Hie bill to tell the Senate what he calls this levy. Even if it is called an export levy on wool sold outside Australia it is still taxation. Money will still be taken from the wool-growers under the taxing power of the Commonwealth. Obviously it cannot be an excise duty, because although the money will go to the Commonwealth it will not remain with the Commonwealth for purely Commonwealth purposes but will be earmarked as a credit for subsequent allocation to wool-growers. I ask the Minister to say what head of power, apart from the taxation power, would justify this very extraordinary action by the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>I point out that if the Treasurer is claiming that this is not taxation, he may be running a very grave risk from the constitutional viewpoint. If it is not taxation, then it is, as honorable senators on this side of the chamber have claimed, a forced loan or, to use the words of the Constitution, an acquisition of property. Something will be taken from the wool-growers, and every honorable senator knows that the Commonwealth cannot acquire property except upon just terms. The High Court, as the custodian of the rights of the people of this country under the Constitution, is charged with the duty of ensuring that property shall be acquired only upon just terms. The court has held again and again that, under those conditions, it is proper, for one thing, that interest be paid. I warn the Minister that the Government, by its continued denials of the taxation element of this measure, is treading upon what may be dangerous ground. </para>

One is tempted to ask why it is exhibiting this nervousness and evasiveness in relation to the taxation element of these measures.

                    <quote>
                        <para>In the long run (and not very long at that), increased production will mean competition among sellers, and therefore lower prices. Greater turnover will mean reduced costs. A resolute reduction in the burden of government and, with it, in the rates of tax, will mean reduced costs of production. In brief, higher production will mean lower costs; and lower costs will enable us to enter and secure overseas markets which are now not supplied by us because we are not producing the goods. We will attack all these problems with vigour and imagination. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I invite honorable senators to note the vigour and imagination with which the Prime Minister and the Government have attacked the problem of, to use the words of the right honorable gentleman himself, " a resolute reduction in the burden of government and, with it, in the rates of tax ". This Government is faced with the dilemma that both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have specifically promised reductions of taxes. That is the reason for the Government's nervousness and avoidance of the words " tax " or " taxation " in these bills or in speeches delivered upon them. </para>
                    <para>There has already been a breach of the Government's promise to reduce indirect taxes, because an additional £10,000,000 of sales tax is to be imposed. These measures represent a further breach of the promise to reduce taxes, because they are designed to take from the wool-growers of Australia, willy-nilly and at short notice, £103,000,000 by way of taxation. There can be no argument about that. If the Minister in charge of the bill claims that this is not taxation, I should like him to tell the Senate to what head of power he relates these measures. In short, this is a new and direct tax that will be imposed this year upon the wool-growers of Australia only, and upon no other section of the Australian community. I point out that it will be a colossal tax of £103,000,000. </para>
                    <para>We have been told in this chamber that this payment, as the Government calls it, or this tax, as the Opposition knows it to be, will place wool-growers upon the same basis as ordinary wage and salary earners. In this year, 1950-51, a wage and salary earner will pay income tax, as he goes, upon what he earns this year and deductions will be made weekly or fortnightly from his wages or salary. He will not handle the money deducted from him. On the 30th June, 1951, he will send in, a return of his income and in due course he will pay a little more or receive a refund, if the money deducted from his wage or salary has exceeded the average drawn up by the Commissioner of Taxation in the light of his experience of the average man. Businessmen - in the term " businessmen " I include primary producers, persons engaged in secondary industry and all classes of persons who derive income from sources other than from salary or wages - will, during the currency of this financial year, pay provisional income tax at the rate determined for this year, but, because their net incomes or assessable incomes for the year will not be known until after the 30th June, 1951, they will pay tax upon figures that represent their net incomes for 1949-50. That will have the effect of putting wage and salary earners upon exactly the same basis as businessmen, including wool-growers. When businessmen have sent in returns of their income, they will, like wage and salary earners, in due course either pay a little more or receive a credit or refund. The wool-growers of Australia, like everybody else in that category, are due to pay provisional tax this year based upon the incomes that they earned last year. Now, out of the whole field of business people in this country, they are singled out by this measure to pay 20 per cent, of the gross proceeds of the sale of their wool, whether inside or outside Australia, in addition to their provisional tax this year. That is the first criticism by the Opposition. The wool-grower is singled out of all. the categories of businessmen in this community, and a direct approach is made to him because, in the first place, he has ready cash, and in the second, because the Government .can very readily get its hands upon that cash. </para>
                    <para>I shall refer now to the three very evil principles involved in the proposed tax. I have already dealt with the first, which is that it is directed at one class only. I am not prepared to deny that, under its taxing power, the Commonwealth may be completely discriminatory against classes and individuals. That, of course, is immoral, as one honorable senator on this side has stated, and it is not what one would expect from the Government, the duty of which is not only to uphold the words of the Constitution, but also to revere its spirit. Section 51 of the Constitution provides - </para>

                    <para class="block">Therefore, a safeguard against discrimination was written into the Constitution in 1901. Whilst this bill may not offend the words of the Constitution, it certainly cuts right across the spirit of the Constitution, and across the main principle .of fair dealing in taxation. </para>
                    <para>The second evil feature in this measure is that this tax is to be calculated not on what a man has left after paying the expenses of earning his income, but on his gross sales. This is a very bad principle, because conceivably a man may have no net or assessable income at all, or have very little assessable income which, if it were known, would certainly not justify a levy of the magnitude imposed under this measure. </para>
                    <para>The third very evil feature of this measure was the one that was referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett,</inline> when he contended that the Government is mortgaging the revenues of future years. There is no reason why the Government should not confine to one year action to meet the extraordinary circumstances that have been created by the proceeds of the wool sales this year. Under this measure the Government will draw off as revenue this year £103,000,000 that would normally be collected next year. Adverting to the second evil principle I concede at once that the calculation of tax on gross sales may not impose any great hardship on wool-growers who are in business in a big way, and will have colossal incomes this year. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> has pointed out, about 73 per cent, of the wool-growers of this country produce only between one bale and 30 bales of wool a year. They would run only from 40 to 1,200 sheep. Many of those wool-growers are really mixed farmers. It may be true of a good many people in that category, and who are concerned with wool, that even in this year of grace, they will have a particularly bad time in some areas because of floods, droughts, fire and pests. Many of them have suffered heavy losses which may result in an overall net loss for the year. </para>
                    <para class="block">The situation may well arise that a person who suffers a heavy loss over the year will have 20 per cent, of his gross sales of wool taken from him under this measure. The honorable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> in another place advanced a very powerful submission in connexion with re-stocking. He mentioned that on some properties sheep can be carried for only six months of the year, and that every year those farmers have to buy sheep on the open market. To-day the major portion of the purchase price of sheep for that purpose would be represented by the value of their wool. In due course, when the wool is shorn and sold, the Government will take 20 per cent, of the gross sales. Quite obviously that would he prima facie a capital levy. That Ls a good illustration of the iniquity of this measure. </para>

I doubt whether many of them would be able to prepare a Statement of affairs, and to present their submissions in the manner that the commissioner would require, in order that he may consider a request on the ground of hardship. There may be a delay of 30 days before the commissioner announces his decision. If he delays beyond that time, the wool-grower could apply to a valuation board, of which there are about 40 in this country. If his claim is held to be justified, who will pay the costs that he will have incurred, including travelling, expenses, and time that he has lost <inline font-style="italic">m&gt;</inline> prosecuting his claim? He will not  get  the amount back if he is indebted in  anyparticular  to the Taxation Branch. I suggest to the Government that it would! be fair to consider a basis of costs or reimbursement to a man who is successful in his application to the valuation board  or  to the commissioner, and that prima facie there is a case where some provision foainterest should be made. </para>

                    <para>An honorable senator has referred towhat has happened in New Zealand. Ashe pointed out, in' that dominion complete agreement has been reached between* the wool-growers and the Government, asa result of which the amount involved^. 33?,- per cent, of the net proceeds of  thewoolgrowers'  wool, remains in the handsof the wool-growers themselves. Apparently the Government has  not  approached the wool-growers of this country on the lines that were adopted  by  the New Zealand Government. Another honorable senator has suggested that if this matter were put to the wool-growers,, they would unquestionably come to  therescue  of the Government by lending perhaps £100,000,000 to assist the Government to overcome its present difficulty-.. Of course, that would involve the payment of interest. That is why the Governmentmay yet find itself involved in connexion with this matter. I have been told  by  representatives of the wool-growing, interests that as soon as this measure is passed by the Parliament, an applicationwill be made to the High Court of Australia for it to be declared invalid. I have given them no advice, and1 I do not know the legal grounds  on  which they rely, but let us compare the position in  New  Zealand, where the Government and the wool-growers  got  together in the national interest, with thehostility that animates the woolgrowersof Australia, who are just waiting for theflag to fall to rush off again to gain theprotection of the courts of the country., The fault for this cannot  be  laid at the door of the wool-growers. Unquestionably it is the fault of the Government  of  the day. Admittedly, the Government is in an awkward fix, because it promised the people of this country that it would reduce governmental expenditure.  I  [point out that its expected expenditure this financial year will be £172,000,000 more than in the previous year. </para>

I am sure that honorable senators from Queensland will remember the Payne report, in which it was stated that, during ten years prior to 1939, the wool-growers were receiving less for their wool than the cost of production. Now, the growers, in their one moment of exhilaration, are singled out by a rapacious and extravagant Government for special taxation. </para>

                    <para class="block">Under the Constitution, the Commissioner of Taxation cannot hold money. Everything that he receives must be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. He  may establish a credit in his books in favour of the unfortunate wool-grower who is singled out for this sectional and discriminatory treatment, but the commissioner will hold no money in the till. The Treasurer has made it plain that he intends to put the £103,000,000 into the budget on the revenue side, and that he is going to expend every penny of it. Will any honorable senator opposite claim that the wool-growers would have expended every penny of it on luxury goods ? If so, they do the wool-growers a grave injury. Will the Minister say what will happen if the appraised value of wool sold for delivery overseas is greater or less than the actual sale price? No payment is to be made until the proceeds of the sale are received by the wool-grower, but what will the grower be required to pay if the appraised value is higher than the actual sale price? Will he be required to pay on the fictitious appraised value, or on the actual price realized overseas? Will an adjustment be made before he is called upon to pay anything ? </para>
                    <para>There is another important feature of the measure which has not been discussed at length, but which becomes evident if we project our minds into 1951-52, and see how the grower may fare then. This year, he will pay provisional tax based on his income of last year, and then he will pay this discriminatory tax of 20 per cent, of the gross proceeds of the sale of his wool. Let us now consider what is to happen in 1951-52. The Commissioner of Taxation, working on the basis of the 1950- 51 income, will probably find that the wool-grower is about square in his account. But in 1951-52, the grower-will be called upon to pay provisional tax based on the exceedingly high income he has earned this year, and he will be committed to pay at that rate even if he suffers a calamitous decline of income in 1951- 52. This tax of 20 per cent, is to be collected year after year, unless the provision is varied. If there is an easing of the war tension, and the demand for materials for re-armament falls off, as we hope will be the case, it is certain that the price of wool will tumble. That might happen dramatically and suddenly. It could even happen next year if there should be an improvement in international relations such as we hope will take place. </para>
                    <para class="block">Should that happen, the wool-grower will be committed next year to the direct payment of a ruinous amount. It is certain that, sooner or later, he will run into great difficulty, and it will happen in the year in which the price of wool falls. </para>
                    <para>I repeat that this is a discriminatory measure which comes ill from a government supported by parties which preach the doctrine of free enterprise. Now, the wool industry, which has been a Cinderella industry for so many years, is getting its one bright year, and the Government comes along with .a measure designed to take the cream off the profits. The growers could well use the money to improve their pastures, and to strengthen their financial position. Such a provision comes ill from a government which is committed to the policy that was stated by the present Prime Minister before the last election in these words - </para>

This being so, should  Ave,  as a nation, allow steel to be used indiscriminately so that it goes into some constructions which are for merely luxury purposes or for industry of low priority? Should we not begin to organize our economy so that what is most important is first served, regard being paid all the time to producing some balance between the civil and military demands made on our total resources? </para>

A sectional assault is to be made on the wool-growers, and we are to revert to the control of materials. If we may judge from recent wool sales, there is a great shortage of wool in Australia. I should not be surprised if the shortage was contributed to in part by the fact that Government supporters were so active in the 1949 election campaign in pulling the wool over the eyes of various categories of voters. It is certain that the wool was plentifully and effectively applied. </para>

We commit ourselves to the statement that if the Labour party gets into power again we shall introduce legislation immediately to repeal this measure. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - The main theme of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> speech was that the bill is directed against one class only; that the deductions are to be calculated on gross sales; and that it is proposed to collect immediately revenue that is not yet due. In the notes that I have prepared, I have dealt comprehensively with those three points. Therefore, instead of taking them separately, I shall discuss them as they fit logically into the pattern. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Before dealing with the bill itself, I propose to discuss two points made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna.</inline> The first is his claim that the Government promised to reduce taxation. It would have been only fair to add to any quotations dealing with that subject the point which we made that such reductions would take place if economic conditions permitted. No one will deny that a marked change in economic conditions has taken place because of the growing war cloud. The charge has been made that the Government is extravagant. The short reply is that no  speaker  on the Opposition side of the chamber has put forward one suggestion as to how expenditure can be reduced. Indeed, all Opposition speakers have claimed, in regard to various activities, that the Government should expend more money than it is expending at present. </para>
                    <para>During the debate on this bill, statements have been made that were both wild and wide. I should like, therefore, to re-state the principles of the legislation. First, I shall cross swords with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> by saying that the wool deduction is not a tax. Under this legislation, the wool-grower will not have to pay one penny piece more in tax than any other member of the community on a corresponding income. All that the wool-grower will be obliged to do, is to pay his tax earlier than he would have been required to pay it in the absence of this legislation. There is to be a deduction of 20 per cent, from the gross proceeds from the current wool clip. That sum will be paid to the Commissioner of Taxation who will credit it against the wool-growers' assessments for the current year when they are finally issued. Therefore, in simple terms, the net effect of this legislation will be to call upon wool-growers to pay certain amounts during the current wool season that they would not otherwise have had to pay until perhaps April of next year. Any one who attempts to establish that the wool-growers will be victimized or harshly treated by this legislation has a hard task ahead of him. The plain truth is that the wool-growers will not be taxed differently from other members of the community. In fact, but for this legislation, the wool-growers would be in a much more advantageous position than most other members of the community in respect of taxation. Furthermore, if action were not taken to deal with the present situation, there would be grave danger to the national economy. Let me illustrate my point. All income earners are taxed at the time of earning their income. Under the pay-as-you-earn system, tax deductions are made from wages and salaries. Provisional tax is paid by those whose incomes are not received in the form of wages or salaries. Provisional tax is estimated on the income of the year preceding the year in which the tax is paid. Let us assume therefore that a wool-grower receives two assessments, one in May, 1951, and one in </para>
                    <para class="block">May, 1952. The first is based on his income for the year ended the 30th June, 1950, and the second is based on his income for the year ended the 30th June, 1951. The provisional tax included in the May, 1951, assessment is based on his income for the year ended the 30th June, 1950; but as everybody knows his income for 1949-50 will have been far short of his income for 1950-51 because of the extraordinary rise of wool prices. So, the provisional tax payable will be far short of his actual tax liability. There is no such discrepancy in the tax instalments paid by wage and salary earners. If a wage or salary earner receives an increase of pay, his tax deduction i3 immediately increased. That is not so with the wool-grower. His income has increased enormously, but under the present system, his provisional tax is based on the very much lower income that he received during the year ended the 30th June, 1950. He will not be called upon to pay provisional tax on his higher income until he receives his second, assessment in May, 1952, which will be ba,»ed on his income for the year ended the 30th June, 1951. Therefore, but for the proposal now before the Senate, the wool-grower would not have to account to the Commissioner for Taxation for his tax indebtedness on his greatly increased income until May, 1952. On the other hand, as I have said, if a wage or salary earner is fortunate enough to receive an increase of his income, under the pay-as-you-earn system he immediately pays increased tax instalments. The purpose of this legislation is to place the wool-growers on the same footing as the wage and salary earners. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that. It is true that the position in which wool-growers find themselves to-day is shared by all members of the community who have received a substantial increase of income, but never before in Australia's history has any single group of taxpayers received such a large increase of income in such a short period as the wool-growers are receiving this year. Surely therefore, in view of the extraordinary economic conditions that are now being experienced by this nation, no one can object to the wool-growers being placed in the same position as the vast majority of Australian taxpayers. </para>

                    <para>Obviously, the magnitude of this proposal is such that one could not possibly hope to avoid all criticism and objection, but I contend that whatever objections there are to it, they are secondary to the need to withdraw from circulation the substantial sum of money to which I have referred. Our wool cheque for 1950-51 is estimated at £515,000,000, compared with £286,000,000 last year. There can be no doubt that this increase of £229,000,000 to the income of wool-growers in one year will add to inflation. The need to withdraw portion of that money from circulation cannot be doubted. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators opposite ask why the wool-grower has been singled out for this treatment. My answer is this : Just as the threat of war has resulted in the extraordinary increase of the price of wool, so also has it resulted in a need to increase national expenditure substantially. That is the justification for the Government requiring the wool-grower to pay his tax liability now when the national need is greatest, just as a greater majority of others in the community are meeting their tax commitments as they earn their income. The Government therefore has decided to withdraw from circulation £103,000,000 of the additional £229,000,000 that the wool-growers are to receive this year. That action is being taken in accordance with the Government's financial policy. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. Honorable senators opposite complain consistently that the Government has not taken courageous steps .to deal with inflation; yet now that it is taking such a step criticism continues unabated. I contend that the legislation is fair and I repeat that the wool-grower will not be asked to pay Id. more than his normal tax liability. He will merely be asked to meet that liability sooner than he would otherwise have had to meet it. The result must be anti-inflationary. There has been some confusion of thought among honorable senators opposite on that point. It has been claimed that as the £103,000,000 will be expended by the Government instead of by the wool-growers, this legislation will not curb inflation. The truth, of course, is that if the £103,000,000 that this measure proposes to withdraw from circulation were left with the wool-growers, it would be necessary for the Government to obtain an equivalent sum by some other means such as treasury-bills." Thus, £206,000,000 would be expended instead of £103,000,000. </para>
                    <para>What alternative to this scheme has been suggested by honorable senators opposite? I have not heard one suggestion for the curtailment of' any specific expenditure. Even <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator McKenna</inline> could only say that the Government was extravagant. Nobody has suggested that expenditure on social services, defence, the war gratuity, or anything else should be reduced. </para>
                    <para>The Government hopes that this is an abnormal year. Money has to be found for specific commitments. Some honorable senators opposite have suggested that income tax rates should be increased to meet the Government's needs but let us examine that suggestion to see how futile it is. Income for the current year is derived in two ways. It is either deducted at the source from salaries and wages or it is received in payment of assessments based on incomes for the year ended the 30th June, 1950. The sum with which we are concerned is £103,000,000. That is not a small amount. To obtain that money in the current year, income tax rates would have to be increased steeply. I am certain that honorable senators opposite who have advocated increased income tax rates have not made a close study of the figures. The Government is not prepared to increase income tax rates to the degree that would be necessary to yield the desired revenue. "It is confident that the prepayment of tax by wool-growers out of their extraordinarily high income this year will meet the situation. The Opposition would have the. greatest difficulty in persuading taxpayers of the necessity to increase taxes to meet what may well be, and what we certainly hope will be, a passing crisis in our financial affairs. Therefore, I have gone to the trouble of calculating the increases of income tax that would be necessary to yield the additional £103,000,000 that is to be provided by the wool deduction scheme. A taxpayer with a wife and two children, in receipt of an income of £500 a year, instead of paying £14 ls. in tax this year, would have to pay £21 16s. The same taxpayer on £700 a year would be called upon to pay £6S 8s. instead of £41 lis. On an income of £1,000 the increase would be from £96 5s. to £149 4s. </para>

Continuing my comparison, I point out that a taxpayer earning £1,500 a year and now paying £226 14s. a year income tax would have to pay £351 10s. The Government believes that it would not be justified in imposing such savage tax increases, even if by that means it could obtain its additional revenue requirements this year. The Government will abandon the wool deduction scheme as soon as it can safely do so. It is not intended to be permanent. I ask honorable senators whether they would prefer that scheme or the tremendous tax increases which I have just mentioned. I ask wool-growers which they  would  prefer. The wool deduction scheme provides a sound solution of what we hope are merely passing financial problems. I doubt whether increases of income tax of the kind I have outlined would ever be eliminated. </para>

                    <para>In the few minutes that remain to me, I shall endeavour to deal with some of the comments made by Opposition senators during the second-reading debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty</inline> said that a woolgrower would be liable to pay an additional 10 per cent, if his woolbroker  failed to pay to the Commissioner of Taxation the amount which he had collected from him. That is not so. .Clause 6 (2.) of the bill absolves the wool-grower of liability in such circumstances. The honorable senator also criticized the proposal to confer on the Commissioner power to fix the value of wool when he is not satisfied that the price obtained for it is fair and reasonable. He contended that that power would extend to all sales. Clause 20 provides that the only classes of transaction covered by the power of the Commissioner to fix values are, first, where the wool is disposed of other than by sale - that is, by barter or exchange - and, secondly, where it is sold other than at auction. That power is usually given to the Commissioner in legislation of this kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty</inline> also said that if the Government was still in office next year and decided not to review the legislation, the deduction rate of 20 per cent, would continue to apply. It is clearly stated in this legislation that the percentage payable shall be that fixed by the Parliament for the financial year. </para>

                        in claiming that this proposal was not in effect a prepayment of tax, referred to the exemption of wool producers in the Northern Territory. The wool deduction will not be collected from persons who are not liable to pay income tax. This proposal in truth involves a prepayment of income tax because it does not apply to those who are not liable to pay income tax.

Administrative staffs were decreased by 480. The increase of the number of Commonwealth employees in the last nine months was due largely to an increase of the number of employees in the Postal Department by 5,205.

The overall increase of the number of Commonwealth employees has also been due in part to an increase of 1,883 in the number of employees of the Department of Works and Housing.

Frankly, I do not know. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.  1  do not combat his claim that the Government has based this bill on its taxing power. I should not think that there would be any argument on that score. I can only explain why the money to be collected from the wool-growers is called a deduction and not a tax, by stating the business viewpoint that a tax presupposes a new field of revenue or some new set of circumstances, whereas this is merely a part of the general revenue scheme. </para>

                        <para>. -  During the second-reading debate the Minister compared the position of a wool-grower with that of a wage or salary earner. Does he differ from the view which I expressed that the woolgrower is to be placed in a position entirely different from that of any other class of businessman in the community? There is no parity between the position of the wool-grower and the wage or salary earner because in addition to ordinary income tax a rigid deduction of  20  per cent, is to be made from the income of the wool-grower. It, is inevitable that, with  91,000  wool-growers, a deduction of  20  per cent, will be too little for some and far too much for others. It is not possible to get the same close approximation of actual tax in a scheme such as this as in the case of a wage and salary earner whose tax is adjusted week by week or fortnight by fortnight. Will the Minister say that I am wrong in contending that the woolgrower will be in a position completely different from that of any other businessman in that whereas the businessman pays provisional tax for this year which has been calculated on the income which he earned last year, the wool-grower will pay provisional tax and an additional deduction from his wool income of  20  per cent, under the provisions of this bill ? In these circumstances it cannot be contended that the wool-grower will be in a position of parity with other businessmen in Australia. </para>

I have stated, I hope clearly and distinctly, that it is true that this measure places the woolgrower in a different position from that of other people on whom provisional tax is levied. I have said that this legislation is entirely justified having regard to the circumstances of the nation. The Government is committed to heavy expenditure as the result of conditions arising from the threat of war, and the great rise in the price of wool has resulted from the same threat of war. Therefore, I believe that it is quite fair and equitable that this deduction should be made from the incomes of the wool-growers and applied to meet the Government's budgetary commitments. </para>

                        <para>. -  The answer is that the producer who exports wool will pay  20  per cent, of the appraised value fixed by the Australian Wool Realization Commission. If he desires to defer payment until the wool is actually sold, he may do so by arrangement with the Commissioner- of Taxation. In such a case, the appraised value would not be arrived at before the wool was exported. It can scarcely be imagined that the Australian "Wool Realization Commission would fix an appraised value higher than the actual sale price, which would then be known. Subject to that, there is no provision in the bill for an adjustment. </para>

                        <para>.  -  Why, then, is it necessary for the fixation of an appraised amount? This bill, or another measure with which we are also concerned at the moment, permits the postponement of payment until payments are in fact received. Why should not there be a calculation based upon the actual proceeds at the time that they are received? I take it that the appraisal takes place at the time of exportation, and that there is some interval of time between then and the receipt of the proceeds, assuming that the wool is sent abroad for sale. The amount that it will realize is not determined at the time it leaves Australia. I could understand it being necessary that there should be some appraisal by the Commissioner of Taxation, but as this legislation permits a wool-grower to defer payment until he in fact receives his proceeds, why should not his payment be based, not upon an assessment or appraisal, but upon the actual proceeds? </para>

                        <para>. --Sub-section (3.) of this clause deals with liens on wool and mortgages of livestock. Where a person holds a mortgage or a lien over a wool-grower's clip, this provision might well be the means of that grower losing his property. The 20 per cent, deduction must be made, although the making of that deduction might be completely out of the hands of the wool-grower, who would normally collect the wool cheque. Where grave hardship is likely to be caused to the woolgrower, some relaxation of that provision should be made. A decision made by the Commissioner of Taxation might be too late to prevent foreclosure. That decision might be made after the owner of the property had lost either his property or his sheep. </para>

                        <para>. - I think that the honorable senator overstates the position. After all, this deduction is only an application of the general principle that a Crown debt has priority over other debts. If, for purposes of illustration, the 20 per cent, deduction were replaced by, say, the payment of rates to the local municipal council, there could be no cavilling at it. The same principle is applied in relation to this measure. It means that the Crown debt ranks before the secured debt. I do not think it will result in the consequences envisaged by the honorable senator. </para>

                        <para>. - That is the very point to which I was drawing the Minister's attention. He now states that the Crown has first claim, which means that the 20 per cent. must be paid. In relation to loans, liens, or mortgages that were entered into before this legislation became law, it would still be necessary to discharge them if the property-owner wished to retain his stock or his property. I have no doubt that many property-owners have entered into negotiations and have contracted liens or mortgages which must be met on a certain date. It might well be that a person is dependent upon the whole of his wool cheque to meet such a lien or mortgage. If his wool cheque is £5,000 the Crown will deduct 20 per cent., or £1,000. That £1,000 might be the means of losing his property, if he is not able to come to some arrangement with the Commissioner of Taxation before his other commitments must be met. Is the policy of the Government the same as that of financial agencies and the Commonwealth Bank : that there will be no fixed mortgages, but that when demands are made, they must be met? </para>

All transactions must fall within two categories. They must be either normal transactions, or abnormal transactions. If the situation, to which the honorable senator has referred, should arise, it would be an abnormal transaction. If it is an abnormal transaction, it is necessary to look to the hardship provisions in the bill. I suggest that the extraordinary case should not be confused with the normal case. So far as the normal case is concerned, surely the short answer is that as a result of the tremendous increase of wool prices, the average woolgrower, even after paying the 20 per cent., will have far more money left in his hands than ever before. </para>

                    <para>. - Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> of sub-clause (1.) provides that any person who holds an amount in excess of £20 in respect of wool sold by him on behalf of a producer shall be liable to pay to the commissioner an amount equal to the prescribed proportion of that amount which, this year, is to be 20 per cent. Twenty pounds is a very small amount to be credited to a person who would describe himself as a wool-grower. The provision covers a very insignificant field of exemption. Why was that figure chosen? The 91,000 wool-growers of Australia will pay a total amount of £103,000,000. If all wool-growers made an equal contribution the amount paid by each would be approximately £1,132. It seems rather incongruous1 that when such a large average sum is involved provision should he made for an exemption only 'in respect of an amount under £20. Has the Government given further consideration to the request of the Australian Primary Producers Union of Victoria that the amount of the exemption should be raised to £1,000 ? </para>

                    <para>. - The amount was fixed at £20 to ensure that all wool transactions shall be subject to the deduction. The Government considered the request that the exemption be raised to £1,000 but decided not to accede to it. The underlying principle of the bill is that all growers should make a contribution to the scheme. It would he difficult to administer the bill if the exemption were raised to £1,000 because many wool-growers do not sell the whole of their clip in one sale. Many of them spread their sales over the whole of the year. If the exemption were raised to £1)000 wool brokers would be involved in a great deal of work in ensuring that wool-growers had not made other sales which, if added to the sale negotiated through them would make the total sales in excess of £1,000. </para>

If that be so, I should like to know why, in the event of breaches of the provisions of clause 6 the persons concerned should be mulcted in a fine not exceeding the amount payable to the commissioner. If, in fact, the wool deduction is not a tax, why should such a person virtually have to pay double the amount he would otherwise have had to pay? </para>

Some of the money that will be taken from the wool-growers will be set against their future tax liabilities. </para>

The penalty for failure to comply with that provision is a find not exceeding the amount pay able to the Commissioner. Under clause 11 provision is made for refunds when the rate is reduced after commencement of the financial year or when no rate has been fixed. Apparently, it is the intention of the Government to give to the person entitled to a refund an I O U which may be subsequently wiped out by the tax imposed in the following year. A penalty is to be imposed on the woolgrower who does not make immediate cash payment in relation to the sale of his wool, but when the Government has to make a refund it will be a sort of " Kathleen Mavourneen " affair because it may be absorbed by the tax imposed in the following year. The Government should show more leniency to those who, through circumstances beyond their control, may contravene the provisions of clause 7, or alternatively it should provide for the payments of cash refunds at the end of each year if the amount taken from the wool-grower exceeds that due by him. </para>

The penalty prescribed in this clause will be imposed not on the wool-grower but on the broker or agent who will be responsible for lodging returns and paying the appropriate amounts to the commissioner. Refunds to be made under the provisions of clause 11 will be paid to the woolgrower, Refunds will be dealt with in the most expeditious and practical way. They are to be applied in reduction of the tax liability of the wool-grower or paid in cash, whichever may be appropriate. </para>

I remind him that similar additional work is imposed on employers who have to make deductions of income tax from the salaries and wages of their employees and on small and large shopkeepers in respect of sales tax collections. The Government does not intend that the wool brokers should be remunerated for any additional work which they will have to do as the result of the passage of this legislation. </para>

I interrupted the Minister when he was speaking this afternoon and asked whether the rate could be increased or decreased and whether it would be continued or not. The Minister stated that it could not be  increased, but he  was unable to say whether it could be decreased. </para>

                    <para>. -  Irrespective of what I may have said this afternoon, the correct position is that a new rate must be fixed by the Parliament. It may be any rate, higher or lower than 20 per cent., according to the will of the Parliament. There is, however, a provision in the Wool Sales Deduction (Administration) Bill which prevents a wool-selling broker from deducting more than 20 per cent. </para>

There is room for confusion of thought because of the provision that until such time as the Parliament fixes a rate it continues at 20 per cent. But if we consider the circumstances under which the Parliament did not fix a rate, the result would be that the 20 per cent., which continues  until  such time  as a rate is fixed, would  have to be refunded to the wool-growers. The position is that the Parliament must fix a rate each year, whatever that rate may be. Until that is done, the 20 per cent, operates. </para>

                    (Western Australia) ([9.30]. - I ask the Minister whether consideration can be given to exempting from the provisions of the bill small wool-growers who would suffer hardship because of the imposition of the 20 per cent, deduction. I should like to see some line  of  demarcation drawn between large wool-growers and small wool-growers. It is obvious that it would be most expensive for a small wool-grower to be compelled to make an application to the Commissioner of Taxation. For example,' a woolgrower with an income of £2,000 would suffer hardship if the legislation applied to him. I consider that it would be reasonable to draw a line of demarcation, so- that it would be a formal matter for small wool-growers to show that their incomes were of such small proportions that they should be granted certificates of exemption merely on their business figures and their capacity to earn.

                        <para>- I suggest that the difficulty might be overcome by exempting those wool-growers who have less than, say, 500 sheep. That is not a very large number of sheep. Producers with 500 sheep or less could easily be exempted from the provisions of this scheme. If that were done, it would assist small wool-growers who are endeavouring to improve their properties - men whose income this year will probably be £2,000, one-half of which will be needed to pay their expenses. It is men of that kind who will suffer hardships as a result of this scheme. I suggest to the Minister that the Government should review the position and consider whether it will be possible to do something to relieve the burden that will be cast upon small growers if the bills are passed in their present form.. I am not asking the Government to do anything that is impossible or anything by which it will lose money. Under the present proposals, the Government will get very little money from men with 500 sheep or less, but much hardship will be caused to those men. The Minister has made it clear that the Government is not prepared to compensate a wool-grower for expenses incurred in making what in many instances would he a long trip to interview the Commissioner of Taxation and ask for relief under this clause, even if his application were successful. The cost of making an application would, in many instances be so great that many small wool-growers would prefer to suffer the hardships that the loss of part of their incomes would inflict upon them. They would be unable to afford the time lost or expense involved in making an application for relief under this clause, and would probably come to the conclusion that the benefits that they would derive from a successful application .would not compensate them for their expenditure of time and money. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the difficulties of small wool-growers are not appreciated by some honorable senators opposite, who were probably born with silver spoons in their mouths, or inherited large estates. Their lives are entirely different from the lives of small producers who have had to struggle hard. Because they have had such a flying start in life, they have never stopped to think about the other man's point of view. </para>

                <para>All of the primary producers' organizations support the proposition that I am now presenting to the committee. Their main objection to this scheme is that it will cause hardship to small producers. I. suggest to the Minister that, even at this late hour, the Government should consider whether it will be possible to assist small wool-growers by providing that growers who have up to a certain number of sheep shall be exempted from the provisions of this scheme. Such an exemption would eliminate 95 per cent, of the cases of hardship that will be likely to occur under the present provisions. </para>

                <para class="block">It has arisen at each stage when the bills have been under consideration. The Government has not brushed aside lightly the representations that have been made in this connexion, and which have come, not only from primary producers' organizations, but also from members of the Government parties. The small woolgrower to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has referred is rather a myth. In normal times, 500 sheep would not provide a farmer with a living, and a farmer who has only 500 sheep has other interests. The Government does not consider that it would be right to exempt a woolgrowerof that kind from the provisions of thescheme, because he is receiving the benefit, not only of high wool prices but also of the income that he derives from his other pastoral activities. </para>

                    <para>. - I realize that many small wool-growers have other interests, but I am concerned about the men with very small flocks who have been struggling to improve their pastures and clear their properties. There are thousands - per- hans tens of thousands - of them in Australia to-day. In my travels through Tasmania I have been amazed to see the vast improvements that have been made in some areas, where large tracts of land have been cleared and put under grass during the last few years. Many men are putting their money back into their land in an effort to increase production, as this Government and the previous Government asked them to do. It is true that many of them have interests other than sheep, but there are occasions when some farming activities are not profitable. Sometimes the mixed farmers to whom the Minister has referred find themselves with their potatoes rotting on their hands because ships are not available to transport them to the large centres of population. They are helped by windfalls such as increased wool prices. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Minister has not given any reason why the Government would be inconvenienced by making the exemption for which I have asked. The only reason that he has given for refusing to accede to my request is that because the big man - is in a position to pay, owing to the fact  that he has wool, the little man should be asked to pay also. If that be a valid reason for not exempting from the provisions of these measures small men who are doing more to increase production in this country than is any other section of the community, why does the Government not propose to apply a similar scheme to big men in other sections of primary industry whose incomes may be ten or 50 times larger than those of small wool-growers? In my opinion, the Minister has advanced the weakest reasons that I have ever heard produced in an attempt to justify the rejection of a concrete proposal. If the suggested exemptions were granted, not only the Government but also many small wool-growers would be relieved of much embarrassment. </para>
                <para>Very few small wool producers would know  how  to present their cases properly to the Commissioner of Taxation if they applied for relief. All that they know is how to work and produce. If a producer were fortunate enough to meet a member of Parliament, he could explain his case to the member, who could present it properly to the Commissioner, but if the producer were not fortunate enough to have some one to do that for him, his applications would probably be rejected by the Commissioner, not because the Commissioner was unsympathetic, but because, owing to the way in which the case had been presented, he could not justify acceding to the application, even though in truth it was a reasonable one. It might be that the producer, owing to faulty bookkeeping, for instance, had not produced all the evidence necessary to support his application. In dealing with small farmers, that would be the position in seven out of ten cases. </para>
                <para>It would not hurt the Government to grant the exemption for which I have asked. In fact, if it were granted, the Government would regain some of the prestige that it has lost as a result of the introduction of these unpopular bills. The exemption would help, not only the Government, but also the small producers. The main objections raised by primary producers' organizations to this scheme is that it will adversely affect the small man who is trying to find his feet and is doing his utmost to assist the Government by increasing production. That is the man that the Government is trying to push down. </para>

The position may well arise that when an agent or broker, acting for a principal, has deducted moneys pursuant to this bill, he becomes bankrupt. His estate may yield nothing, or a relatively small amount, sufficient only to pay his creditors 5s. in the £1. The question that I pose to the Minister is: Does the obligation to find, in the one case the whole of the money and in the other case 15s. in the £1, rest upon the producer of the wool? If that be so, the producer may be called upon to pay twice. If money has been deducted by a broker, acting, I suggest, as agent for the Commissioner, and nothing is paid to the Commissioner owing to the bankruptcy of the broker, is a producer to be called upon to pay again? </para>

                        <para>- I assume that the word " person " where first occurring mean a broker. As I read the clause, the obligation is upon the broker to pay the amount to the Commissioner and to deliver the certificate. The condition under which the Commissioner may credit the producer of the wool is not that the broker has failed to pay the amount to the Commissioner but, in terms of the clause, that the broker has not delivered the wool deduction certificate to the producer. The clause is not qualified by the words " and has paid the relevant amount to the Commissioner ". I understand the Minister to mean that where a broker has become bankrupt and has failed to pay the amount to the Commissioner, if the Commissioner thinks it just to credit the amount to the producer he has discretion to do so. </para>

It is necessary for the rate of deduction to be fixed each year, but until a new rate is fixed the existing rate will operate. However, when the new rate is fixed, it will apply retrospectively for the whole of the year. Thus, the rate this year is 20 per cent. If the rate is fixed at 5 per cent. for next year,deductions will be made at the rate of 5 per cent. for the whole of next year, and the Government will refund deductions in excess of 5 per cent. If the tax were not reimposed at all next year, the Government would have to refund the whole of the moneys collected under this provision. </para>

                        <para>. - Clause 5 provides for the granting of exemptions from deductions in certain circumstances. I have already pleaded on behalf of the small wool-growers, and I suggest that provision should be made in this clause for exempting them from the  operation of the act. In making that pica, I am not moved by any political consideration. My only wish is to assist the small wool-growers and, incidentally, the Government. It would be of no use for me to move an amendment to give effect to what I have in mind, because if the Government refuses to accept it, the amendment will be thrown out of the House of Representatives. I suggest that the Government should agree to the postponement of clause 5 so that a suitable amendment may be considered to give relief to a section of the community who will receive no benefit from this legislation. I do not want Ministers to say later that the matter has not been brought to their notice. Organizations of wool-growers are hostile to the measure, not because it is proposed to take some money from the wealthy interest, but because this legislation will prove injurious to the small growers. </para>

The number of small wool-growers is large, but they are not, for the most part, dependent entirely upon their wool clips.

                        <para>. - I have already pointed out that, under the Government's proposal, there will be discrimination between one group of wool-growers and another. Most of the wool sold overseas is handled by woolbroking firms which, in addition to being stock and station agents, are financially associated with big pastoral interests. Members of the Labour party have been twitted with having referred to those interests in the past as wool barons. Under this legislation, they will receive a better deal than the ordinary wool-growers who sell their wool on the local market. Wool sold overseas is to be taxed on its appraised value. Because the nations are stockpiling wool for defence purposes, the overseas price will be, in general, somewhat higher than the Australian price. Sometimes, the big woolbroking firms which ship wool for sale overseas do not wait for it to be submitted at auction abroad, but sell it on the high seas at a higher price than it would have fetched at auction in Australia. Nevertheless, should that happen, they will pay only 20 per cent, on the appraised value. The legislation should be amended to provide that those who dispose of their wool in that way shall pay 20 per cent, on the full price realized. </para>

                            has said that there will be a difference between the appraised value of the wool and the selling price. The man who sells his wool overseas must either pay the deduction on the appraised value, or make an arrangement with the Commissioner of Taxation to pay it when he receives the proceeds of the sale. There may be something in what the honorable senator has said, but there cannot be much in it. The appraised value of the wool, as fixed by the Commissioner of Taxation, will be in practice the auction value of the wool at that date. Thus, the seller can gain an advantage 'by disposing of his wool overseas only if there is an increase of price between the time his wool is appraised and the time it is sold overseas. However, I do not think that advantage could be taken even of that loophole because when a grower sends his wool overseas he will arrange with the commissioner to pay his deduction when he actually receives the proceeds from the sale of his wool. Even if he did not do that, he would have to disclose in his tax return his income from the sale of his wool overseas. After all, this deduction is only 20 per cent, of his gross proceeds, and he will have to pay the full amount eventually.

                        <para>. - This is not a contentious bill, t am sure that honorable senators on both sides of the Senate will support it. I congratulate the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(.Senator Cooper)</inline> upon the introduction of a bill which will "fill the bill ". The all-round increases of repatriation pensions proposed in this measure is commendable. They are certainly most timely. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay</inline> that everything possible should be done for men who sacrificed their health, and for the dependants of others who lost their lives, in the two world wars. Anything we can do for these people we should do willingly and cheerfully. No payment that we can make to them can possibly compensate them for the losses they have suffered. </para>

                    <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay</inline> that a measure of this type should be above party politics. The Minister endeavoured in his second-reading speech to keep the measure on that high level. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay</inline> claimed that, in 1943, an all-party committee of this Parliament had made recommendations upon which subsequent repatriation legislation was based. That i,« quite true, but I contest <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay's</inline> right to criticize this Government for not having followed a similar course on this occasion. The honorable senator did not mention, for instance, that the committee to which he referred was appointed by a non-Labour government in 1940, or that when the Chifley Government increased repatriation pensions in 1947 and 1948, the committeewas not consulted. In fact, the Chifley Government did exactly what the present Government has done on this occasion. As I have said, in introducing this measure, the Minister for Repatriation endeavoured to place the discussion on a non-party basis. He could have pointed out, for instance, that in 1949, the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia petitioned the Chifley Government for an increase of pensions, but was told that its request would be considered after the elections. The Chifley Government's failure to increase repatriation payments earned it considerable unpopularity in the electorate. The defeat of the former Minister for Repatriation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barnard,</inline> was an indication not only of his own personal unpopularity, but also of the unpopularity of the Chifley Government for its handling of repatriation matters generally. </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline>
                        as an attempt to introduce party politics into this debate. I remind honorable senators opposite that, on all possible occasions, they have flaunted that policy speech in our faces; yet now they turn round and object when an honorable senator on this side of the chamber quotes from it to prove that the Government intends to fulfil its election promises! Such tactics are hardly in keeping with the Opposition's plea to consider repatriation matters on a non-party basis. I maintain that the Minister for Repatriation did his best to keep this legislation above party politics.

                        said that the Government had taken a long time to introduce this legislation. That is a charge that one frequently hears from honorable senators opposite. I maintain that the Government is doing what it promised to  do. It announced that a review of repatriation payments would be made by a sub-committee of Cabinet. That was done expeditiously, and this measure has been introduced to give effect to the committee's recommendations. The only criticism that the Opposition has offered of this measure is that payments to certain pensioners are insufficient and that payments to others are too great. The Government was well advised, I believe, to take considerable time to prepare this legislation thoroughly, rather than to rush its introduction, only to have it criticized because of its failure to do justice to all classes of beneficiaries under the Repatriation Act.

                            <para>- I realize that few workers earn only the basic wage to-day, but I shall take that wage as a measure. Totally and permanently incapacitated pensioners have an extremely limited earning capacity, but the Department ofRepatriation has no objection to their earning what they can. A totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman with a wife and three children receives a pension of £7 for himself, an allowance of £1 10s. 6d. a week for his wife, and £1 14s. 6d. for the children. If the children are attending school he also receives an education allowance of £1 13s. for them. In addition, of course, there is a child endowment payment of £1 5s., bringing his total income to £13 3s. On the other hand, a man receiving the basic wage of £61s. 6d. in Tasmania will receive an increase of £11s. a week shortly. He will also have his child endowment payment of £1 5s., making his total income £9 2s. I believe therefore that the repatriation pensioner is liberally treated. Certainly he does not receive too much, but he is hot badly done by. In addition to his repatriation payments he gets many other concessions.  His  income of £13 3s. a week is free of income tax and social services contribution. He receives free medicine and free hospitalization if he is sick. Those are the people whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay</inline> complained were not being treated fairly. He said that an ex-serviceman in receipt of the ordinary base pension was far better off because he was in a position to earn a substantial income. Those are the two main classes of pensioners, and it might interest honorable senators to know that there are 157,000 of them. For that reason, the base pension has been increased from £2 15s. a week to £3 10s. a week, an increase of 15s., and in spite of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay</inline> has said I am sure that the recipients are all very pleased to receive that payment. </para>
