            <para>- The question contains an entirely false accusation. The accusation is that the British Medical Association is breaking some law that has been passed by this Parliament. I am not aware that the British Medical Association has broken any law. As far as I can gather, the honorable senator is referring to the conduct of doctors in relation to certain provisions of an act passed by this Parliament that were declared by the High Court to be invalid. </para>

              <para>- No, that provision, of the act does not stand. Once the High Court has declared, that a particular provision is invalid, it is exactly the same as if the law had never been made. The words appear in the written document that is called the act of Parliament, but they have no legal effect. The High Court has held that that is the position with regard to the particular provisions to which the honorable senator refers, and he is drawing an entirely false inference when he suggests that there is any failure to comply with the law. The particular law to which he refers does not exist. </para>

In the first place, the section of the Crimes Ac; to which the honorable senator refers can be brought into operation only if there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance. I am not aware that any serious industrial disturbance has been created, at any rate, by the medical profession. As I endeavoured to -explain, the provisions of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act which were designed to require doetors to use certain forms, the use of which entitled patients to receive pharmaceutical benefits free, have been declared invalid by the High Court. The position is the same in regard to that matter as if the provisions had never been made at all. </para>

            <para>- In order to reduce the high cost of house-building the Government has thought fit to allow vital building materials to enter this country free of duty. One of the conditions of that concession is that the benefit shall go to the ultimate user, the actual home-owner, and that no contractor or other intermediate person shall gain any advantage therefrom. It is not so much a matter of rebate as a by-law exemption from the payment of duty. As the honorable senator has very wisely and s_. &#34;&#39;bly suggested, the people who do in fact benefit are the ultimate users, the buyers, or the people who own the homes eventually. The policy of the Government is directed to that end. </para>

            <para>At the present time the Commonwealth is not carrying out research on the poliomyelitis virus itself, although investigations are being made into the epidemiology of the disease by collecting data concerning each new case as it occurs. Virus research in general is being heavily subsidized by the National Health and Medical Research Council. This research work is concerned with viruses which are much more readily cultivated than poliomyelitis virus. It is hoped that the work in the more easily handled viruses will eventually bring to light knowledge that will be applicable to all virus infections including poliomyelitis. Any reasonable application by members of the medical profession in the States for the utilization of such Commonwealth resources as arc available will be sympathetically considered. With regard to the accommodation and education of children disabled by poliomyelitis, although no Commonwealth institutions, other than Repatriation General Hospitals (which are utilized only for repatriation purposes) are available in the States, it is the Government&#39;s intention to generally assist financially State responsibilities concerning hospitals and education. </para>

            <para>- There is no restriction on the private banks entering into time-payment business. The trading banks can engage in hire-purchase business if they so desire, and, in fact, some of them do. The second question is whether income tax should be chargeable upon profits earned by the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank is a government institution. To charge the Commonwealth Bank income tax would in truth be merely to transfer money from one pocket to another. The Commonwealth Bank works in accordance with a specific act of Parliament, which provides for the distribution of the profits earned by its various sections in certain specific directions. There would be little point and no advantage in requiring the bank to pay income tax. </para>

The distance from the Westlake settlement to the shelter shed on the existing bus route is less than half a mile. A regular service for school children is provided on the existing route. Previous requests for the diversion of buses into Westlake have been refused. Any additional running would have thu effect of increasing the loss already incurred on the bus service. Residents of other localities in the city area live at similar distances from the bus route as Westlake residents. </para>

            <para>The Commonwealth Government is doing a great deal to assist the State of Western Australia with the development of the northwestern portion of that State. A programme of road construction, including a major bridge over the Ord River, and stock route improvements is being financed by the Commonwealth Government. These developments are expected to cost more than &#163;2,000,000. Their purpose is to open the way for an expansion of the cattle industry to provide increased ment supplies for the United Kingdom. Scientific investigations are also being conducted at an experimental station near Ivanhoe by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and the Western Australian Agricultural Department into the agricultural possibilities of the area, commandable for irrigation from a proposed dam at the Ord River Gorge. Research is being applied to various forms of crop production and to establishment of pastures for fattening cattle. The economic soundness of going ahead with a major dam construction and irrigation project in this region cannot be determined until the scientific investigations have reached a more advanced stage. The Government recognizes the possibilities of development in the northwest and I will ensure that, iii planning for national developmental works, attention will continue to be directed to this region. </para>

              <para>The Aluminium Production Commission has tested, proved and acquired control nf  bauxite reserves of economic grade in Australia to the extent of approximately 8,600,000 tons. An agreement has been signed with the British Aluminium Company Limited under which that company will act as technical consultants and advisers to the commission for an initial period of ton years. Valuable assistance has already been obtained by this menus. A technical staff with knowledge and experience of aluminium processes has been built up locally. The site for the plant on the Tamar River at Bell Bay, Northern Tasmania, is currently being developed, clearing, drainage and road construction works aru being carried out. and temporary buildings such as workmen&#39;s huts, change rooms, mess rooms, offices, stores and garage are under construction. Mobile cranes, tractors, concrete mixers, electric welders, air compressors, electric generators and motor trucks are at work on the site. Contracts have been signed with the Hydro-Electric Commission of Tasmania for power supplies, and with the North Esk Regional Supply Authority for the construction of a water supply line. A housing scheme providing for 250 workmen&#39;s homes at George Town, two and a half miles from the works site has been commenced through the agency of the State Agricultural Bank. Houses for officers of the works staff will also be erected <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the commission at George Town on land already acquired. All design work is within sight of completion, and a considerable amount of plant and equipment has been purchased, the main items being steel vessels, pipes, valves and plate for construction of alumina plant, calcining kilns, pumps, ball mill, heat exchangers, classifiers, filters and electro-filter dust-collecting equipment. One thousand one hundred tons of heavy structural steel for buildings have been purchased from an  agency  of the Norwegian Government <inline font-style="italic">em</inline> a captured German aluminium plant, and steel for certain lighter-framed buildings has been acquired in Australia. A complete rectifier unit, capable of supplying to the reduction furnaces D.C. power sufficient for the production of 13,000 tons of ingot per annum, was purchased in England <inline font-style="italic">ex</inline> a war-time reduction plant, at <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> very advantageous price, and delivered to Tasmania. Orders have been placed for the large transformers necessary to convert the 110,000 volt high tension current to 33.000 volts in the commission&#39;s sub-station. The necessary switchgear, circuit breakers and auxiliary supplies and equipment - meters, insulators, transformer oil, &#60;&#163;c. - have also been ordered. Steam boiler plant - two units each 20,000 lb. steam per hour - have been ordered from  Babcox  for delivery in early 1952. Certain machine tools for the works maintenance and repair shop have been bought locally, mainly <inline font-style="italic">asn</inline> disposals, and tenders for the balance of workshop equipment are under consideration. Mobile and travelling cranes are on order. A contract for a large tonnage of reinforcing steel from overseas will be placed within a few days. Five thousand pounds worth of chemical equipment and stocks, purchased and used in the developmental laboratory at Hobart, have now been stored at Launceston for later use in the works laboratory. Further large contracts for materials and plant supplies are under consideration. Despite difficulties of procurement of plant and materials, the commission is working for the completion of its plant ready for operation by mid 1.952. 2. (a) Production of ingot aluminium is likely to commence in 1952. (6) Production of magnesium at same works has not been considered. </para>

            <para>The Commonwealth Government will examine proposals of a national character put forward by the States for development of  our  natural resources. The Commonwealth has not yet received any request from the New South Wales Government for assistance with the Clarence River project, but the Queensland Government has asked for financial assistance with major developmental projects on the Mareeba-Dimbulah area and the Burdekin region to which, I understand, the senator refers. The Queensland Government&#39;s proposals are still under examination by an expert committee. Since no request has been received in connexion with the Clarence project, the question of priorities has not yet been considered. Although it is clear that there is a limit to the number of projects that can be undertaken at any one time, the Commonwealth Government will, in reviewing requests for assistance from the States, take into account the importance of the schemes from the standpoint of national development, decentralization and the availability of labour, materials and financial resources. </para>

            <para>.- The question of child endowment is linked with the basic wage. It can be asserted that Australia was the first country to have a basic wage. The principle was established in what is known as the <inline font-style="italic">Harvester</inline> judgment. That basic wage was obtained by the workers at great expense because at that time they did not have the Commonwealth Statistician&#39;s figures to work upon as they have now. The wives of workers went into the witness box and were subjected .by representatives of the employers to searching cross-examination, particularly in relation to the cost of the garments that women wore at that time. The <inline font-style="italic">Harvester</inline> judgment was the cause of much industrial unrest, because, owing to the action of the employers, it was followed by what was known as the <inline font-style="italic">Excise Harvester</inline> judgment. Some time after that, a strike occurred in Melbourne, and much bitterness was aroused. Many men were victimized. The basic wage was secured only after continued efforts by the trade unions. Originally it  wa3  assessed on the basis of the needs of a unit of five - a man, wife and three children. I say in passing that the <inline font-style="italic">Harvester</inline> judgment was delivered by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins and that, as the members of the legal fraternity in this chamber will agree, his judgments were circulated throughout the world. Legal luminaries in the United States of America cited many of them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Following the <inline font-style="italic">Harvester</inline> judgment, certain action was taken in some States, particularly in New South Wales. The trade unions in that State obtained a judgment from the Board of Trade. Prior to World War I. they received a wage of &#163;2 14s. a week. &#163;2 8s. a week was regarded as the living wage, and the additional 6s. a week was paid to them to give them an opportunity to establish banking accounts. Honorable senators on the Government side have contended that the claims of the Opposition do not warrant interference by the Parliament with any court or tribunal charged with fixing the basic wage. New South Wales was the first State to introduce a basic wage. Some honorable senators may remember the conniving, engineering, and lobbying that occurred in the New South Wales Parliament at that time. I shall show that similar machinations to those that took place in 1919 occurred in 1950. In 1919 the then Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> introduced a measure to provide for the payment of child endowment. At that time the basic wage in the premier State was &#163;3 a week. The workers were dissatisfied, and presented a ease to the Board of Trade, which was the basic-wage-fixing tribunal at that time. It was currently rumoured that the Board of Trade was preparing a judgment granting a basic wage of &#163;3 18s. a week. The bill that was introduced in the State Parliament contemplated a basic wage of &#163;3 Ss, a week, with  endowment. As a result of workers&#39; demonstrations and agitations the New South Wales Government withdrew the bill.. The basic wage that was then decided upon by the Board of Trade was &#163;?&#62; 17s. a week.&#34; </para>
          <para>Let us consider the history of child endowment. The present Commonwealth Ministers were not responsible for what I am about to refer to, because they did not then occupy their present positions. In 1927 family endowment legislation to provide 5s\ a week for each dependent child of employees in the Commonwealth Public Service under the age of fourteen years was introduced. In the same year similar legislation was introduced in the State Parliament. Endowment in New South Wales was to be financed by a three year levy on total wages. The levy was imposed for three months and one week. The amount collected in that manner during that period was &#163;1,250,000 which was sufficient to finance the payment of child endowment for one year in that State. During 1927 the remuneration of Commonwealth public servants was reduced by &#163;11 a year which was equivalent to the amount of endowment they received. Therefore neither the employer - the Commonwealth Government - nor the general taxpayers contributed to the fund. The employees themselves suffered a reduction of pay to ensure that those of their number who had families should receive child endowment. In dealing with basic wage applications the Arbitration Courts in the various States have regarded the family unit as three. I shall not criticize the judges of the various courts because I realize the responsibility that devolved upon them in determining basic wages for various sections of employees in industry. In the basic wage judgment of 1940 Chief Judge Beeby said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Assuming that the Court, by the indirect methods at its disposal, decided to re-arrange the division of national income, it does not follow that such purpose would best be achieved by an increase in the basic wage applicable to all wage-earners, irrespective of family responsibilities . . . During the proceeding* I was impressed with new evidence and argument submitted as to the inadequacy of the earnings of the lower-grade wage-earners with families. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Naturally, judges are concerned more with questions of law than other considerations. However, great weight is thrust upon them, and they examine the evidence submitted carefully. It is obvious that the Chief Judge recognized the great responsibility that rested upon him, and I am sure that the judges who are at present hearing the basic wage application similarly recognize their responsibilities. In his second-reading speech on the measure before us the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> said - </para>

            <para>If statements by honorable senators opposite during the recent election campaign can be taken as a guide, it will no doubt be alleged by them in connexion with this measure, that the introduction of endowment for the first child will be followed by a lower basic wage. </para>

          <para class="block">The Minister said deliberately that the basic wage would be reduced after the introduction of child endowment for the first child in each family under the age of sixteen years. </para>

          <para class="block">Had Liberal governments been in office in all of the States I am convinced that other applications along similar lines would have been made to the court. The Liberal party considers that the wages of the workers should be reduced by an amount equivalent to the amount of child endowment received by them. The present Government has said that it is not representing the employers in the proceedings before the court. What wonderful assistance the Government is giving to the court at present! The Attorney-General, in reply to a question last night, said that this Government had two members of the bar present at the hearing. What are they doing?

I suppose if they think that the case will go against their Liberal confreres in the various State parliaments, they will put up a fight in the court to protect their Liberal friends.

They are in harmony when it comes to trying to prevent the workers from obtaining an increase in the standard of living. I have here the documents filed on behalf of the general body of employers.

              <para>- The employers have always gone into the courts to try to prevent the workers from getting a decent standard of living. That was their attitude even before the honorable senator was born. They did it in 1907 and in 1.950 they are continuing their fight in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. We who have been engaged in industrial matters know that the employers have always maintained that they could not pay a decent living wage. Their contention has always been that industry could not afford it. However, even in my time in the fight for higher wages, the industrial movement has found a change of front and tactics on the part of employers. At one time, if certain industries were not in a sound position, industry as a whole hid behind them to justify the claim that the employers could not afford to pay a living wage. To-day the whole aspect is altered. When wages were reduced by 10 per cent, in 1931, all the university professors and the economists of the land went into the court and said, &#34; Our economy is down and out. It cannot continue to pay the present rate of pay that the employees are receiving and the employees will have to accept a 10 per cent, cut in wages &#34;. What is the position to-day? The employees are putting up a fight in the court. How different is their attitude to-day towards an application for an increase in wages from their attitude when the 10 per cent, cut was imposed. The reduction of wages was accomplished almost over-night but when the employees have a case for a higher basic wage, months pass before a decision i9 reached. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator is talking about the Arbitration Court. I would like to give the chamber a few facts in relation to it. The Arbitration Court waa made .possible by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I remind the Senate of the effect on the basic wage of the well-known <inline font-style="italic">Excise Harvester</inline> judgment. I well remember the gas workers of Australia attempting to secure an award from the Arbitration Court. First of all, they had to have an organization registered under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. In many instances the employees who attempted to form an organization under that act to secure an award were victimized. Large organizations such as that which is now known as the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board insisted that a man seeking employment with them should sign a declaration that he would not attempt to join an industrial organization- </para>

              <para>- I was speaking of a statement made by the Minister when he introduced the bill. He was alluding to the Opposition, and I did not attempt to hide that fact, but I contend that in his second-reading speech he made a direct reference to the basic wage. No word had been spoken by a member of the Opposition on that point when the Minister made that statement. I want to point out, with reference to this question of prosperity and ability to pay a higher wage, that figures can be produced to show that industry can pay the full basic wage as well as full child endowment. In 193S the national income of Australia was &#163;814,000,000. In 1948-49 it had jumped to a total of &#163;1,955,000,000. That was the national income of Australia according to the last figures available. In 1931 it was said that the national income could not stand the wages and they were reduced. The employers in every instance go to the court. They want every penny paid out of the National Welfare Fund to be deducted from the total basic wage. The figures I have quoted show that in this period of prosperity, Australia can afford to pay the 10s a week in child endowment for the first child without affecting the basic wage.

          <para class="block">On every hand there is increased productivity and greater wealth for the community and the Government proposes to pay 5s. a week child endowment for the first child. It has already been indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that the Labour party will propose an amendment increasing that amount to 10s. with the proviso that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court shall not take that payment inso  consideration in fixing the basic wage. At the time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> made that statement, the Attorney-General said, by way of interjection, that it would be unconstitutional. That is a matter of opinion. For instance, child endowment is not paid under a Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court decision or by any powers possessed by that&#34; court. It is paid from the National Welfare Fund and through that fund by the .people as a whole. Each worker pays into the fund, and this Government proposes to continue that method. Honorable senators should not lose sight of the fact that when a man with a wife and three children receive &#163;1 a week for child endowment, he and his family pay into the National Welfare Fund. So does every employee in the community, whether he has children over sixteen years or no children, or is unmarried. The Government proposes to pay the workers 5s. a week from their own money. Part of the fund comes from wages&#39; tax, but that tax is charged to- industry. It is charged against profits, and therefore the workers themselves pay every penny piece that goes into the fund. The Attorney-General has said that Labour&#39;s proposed amendment of this measure is unconstitutional. What did he mean by that? He was referring, of course, to the provisions of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, but he forgot that there is now specific constitutional authority for the Commonwealth to legislate, in respect of child endowment. In 1946, the people of Australia agreed to the proposal that the Commonwealth should be empowered under the Constitution to legislate in respect of social services,&#34; including, of course, child endowment. That provision gives, ample power to this Parliament to ensure that its child endowment legislation shall achieve its objective. The Commonwealth has ample authority, I contend, to prevent the Arbitration Court from depriving the people of Australia of the benefits of child endowment, by making a corresponding reduction of the basic wage. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act empowers the Commonwealth to take action to prevent or settle industrial disputes extending beyond the boundaries of any one State. Therefore if an industrial dispute extending beyond the borders of any one State arises from any action by the Arbitration Court to offset child endowment payments by decreasing the basic wage, the Commonwealth would, I submit, have the power to deal with that situation. The Commonwealh Arbitration Court has had reserved to it power to fix the basic wage, to determine standard hours, to fix female rates of pay, and to prescribe annual leave. This Parliament has, in the past, increased or decreased the powers of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and I believe that it could do so again. To-day, all workers, whether their earnings are augmented by child endowment or not, are being robbed scientifically and methodically. In Victoria, for instance, prices control has been removed from 160 commodities. Prices will not rise until the end of this month, but the cost of living variations of the basic wage which will become operative on the 1st&#39; May will be based on prices ruling in the first quarter of the. year. In other words, although prices will rise considerably after the end of this month, the cost of living variations will be related to present-day prices. Similarly, cost of living variations to be made in August of this year will be related to prices ruling in the second quarter of the year. That is going on all the time, yet honorable senators opposite wonder why workers are discontented and complain about the slowness of the </para>
          <para class="block">Arbitration Court. Price increases are felt most severely by large families. In Victoria, the price of wood, gas, and electricity is being increased. These commodities are vital to all households in which there are children. Spiralling costs are the cause of much of the unrest amongst what we term the extreme elements controlling certain industrial organizations. The Minister in his second-reading speech said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I emphasize this point. Those who dogmatically state that endowment of the first child will actually reduce the basic wage do so either in ignorance of the procedure or with the deliberate intention to falsify the Government&#39;s intentions. I will add only this: The Government has already made clear what it will do if the court alters the principles of computing the basic wage and takes as the foundation for calculation the needs of a married couple without children. In that event the Government will bring down an amendment to provide uniform endowment of 108. for all children. If, on the other hand, the court adopts some new principle altogether for computing the basic wage, the Government will reconsider the matter in the light of the new circumstances. </para>

How can that statement be reconciled with what the Minister said in his second-reading speech on this measure? He said that if certain things happened, the matter would be reconsidered. What is the Government going to reconsider? Why did the Minister not say clearly what he meant? </para>

              <para>- Of course I can. It is quite clear to me. Even a lawyer could not see two meanings in it. Presumably the Government&#39;s lingual experts assisted very materially in compiling the Minister&#39;s second-reading speech. Why does the Government wish to introduce child endowment for the first child? Simply because it has so engineered the whole economy of this country that the workers themselves have to pay the entire cost of child endowment. The policy of the Labour party is that the basic wage is  sacroscant.  If the Arbitration Court takes child endowment for the first child into consideration in fixing a new basic wage, the workers will be worse off than before. For instance, over-time payments which are calculated on the basis of time and a half, or double time, will be reduced substantially. It is all well thought out. The Liberal party&#39;s offer to the people of Australia was shrewd. There are 450,000 families in which there is only one child and 640,000 families in which there is more than one child. Honorable senators opposite calculated that they required a swing of only 1 per cent, or 2 per cent, of the voters of the Commonwealth to convert their 1946 defeat into a 1949 victory. By promising to endow the first child in each family, they hoped to gain the support of more than 1,000,000 families totalling about 2,200,000 voters. They were successful, but their promise was a great illusion. The people really thought that a Liberal Government would give them something. Little did they dream that they would only receive something that they pay for themselves in deductions from their pay envelopes. </para>

              <para>- It was imposed because for years, under anti-Labour governments, Australian workers did not receive enough money to keep their families. The Labour Government established the National Welfare Fund to finance its social services programme, which included the care of the aged, the sick and those who have the misfortune to suffer unemployment. That is something that Liberal governments have never attempted to do. Anti-Labour administrations did not trouble about that. However, at the recent election, the anti-Labour parties tried to outbid Labour by proposing to grant this illusory benefit of child endowment. However, I am certain that the people of Australia will awake shortly to the duplicity of the Government parties. </para>

Although the present basic wage is inadequate, it does ensure to the workers something like a living wage. </para>

              <para>- Everything that has been said by supporters of the Government to-night convinces me that the Government is determined to keep down the basic wage. It has two legal representatives present at the basic wage inquiry in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. What instructions has the Government given to them? They are allegedly present in the court as observers; hut on whose behalf are they observing? I think that the whole scheme outlined by the Government reeks of insincerity, and because of that conviction I shall have great pleasure in supporting the amendment to increase child endowment for the first child to 10s. a week. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>WEIGHT  (Tasmania)  1  10.10&#93;. - I consider that supporters of. the Government are not concerned to justify the introduction of a system of child endowment. The first Menzies Administration had the proud honour of introducing the legislation to provide child endowment. I believe -that I can repel the accusations of insincerity  that have been levelled against the Government by suggesting that the Opposition&#39;s criticism of the present proposal springs from rancour engendered in members of the Labour party because of jealousy that the Liberal party should have pioneered this legislation. That rancour has given rise to all the heartburnings that have been evidenced during the debate. There is a great deal of difference between the attitude of the socialist party of 1949 and the attitude of the Australian Labour party of 1941, and it is to be remembered that the Child Endowment Act of 1941 was passed through both Houses of the Parliament with the applause of all parties at that time. To-day, we have the sorry spectacle of the Opposition advancing a case, not against the principle of child endowment, but against the extension of that principle for the purpose of adding a benefit of 5s. a week in respect of the first child of every family. The drafting of the objections of the Opposition to this measure is, I understand, to be entrusted to <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator McKenna,</inline> who is a lawyer and is, therefore, according to his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> capable of duplicity in every statement that he may make. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> presented his case with a great deal of effect. The Opposition case is based upon notions that have been outmoded for twenty years, and when I come to deal with the relationship between child endowment and the basic wage, I shall point out that the whole basis of that argument was completely removed by the&#39; adoption by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in 1934 of a different basis for the assessment of the basic wage from that which was previously adopted, which was the needs of a family of five units. </para>
          <para>The argument put forward by the Opposition is an interesting piece of humbug. It consists of two complete contradictions, the first of which may be summarized as follows : &#34; When this measure goes into committee we shall move an amendment designed to increase the benefit in respect of the first child to 10s. a week &#34;. I point out at once that that proposal emanates from a party that had the opportunity during the last eight years to draw upon a  swollen and  inflated </para>
          <para class="block">Treasury to increase child endowment. The Treasury was inflated, not because of Labour&#39;s efforts, but because of the unusual circumstances arising out of the recent war. Having adverted to that fact, the first thing that I desire to say is that Labour deserves credit for having on two occasions made increases of half a crown to the recipients of child endowment, and of having increased the benefit from the original rate of 5s. to the present rate of 10s. a week a child of all families of two children and more. Labour is entitled to credit for that. However, a moment&#39;s reflection shows how baseless is the suggestion which Labour now makes that the mere addition, of 5s. a week in respect of the first childis going to have the effect of reducing thebasic wage. I hasten to say that it was the late John Curtin, the Leader of the Australian Labour party in 1941, who, when addressing himself to the subject &#176;f child endowment said, &#34;I am not sillyenough to believe that the first child will receive no benefit from this plan, even though the payment begins with the second child &#34;. All I want to add for myself is that I should have thought that all of those who support the policy then enunciated by a former Prime Minister would have read his remarks, and would certainly not be silly enough now to suggest that there is any distinction in principle .between an increase of 5s. a week in respect of the second and subsequent children to 10s. a week, and payment of an endowment of 5s. a week for the first child. It is obvious - and the late John Curtin expressly recognized this fact - that child endowment based on legislation that has been in operation, although expressed simply as a multiplier of the second and subsequent children, inevitably operates for the benefit and advantage of all the children in a family of two or more children. </para>
          <para>Members of the Liberal party are proud of their advocacy during the 1946 and 1949 election campaigns of a policy plank which provides family endowment for the first child. Speaking subject to correction, I assert now that during neither of those election &#39; campaigns did any responsible member of the socialist party suggest that it was any part of his party&#39;s policy to endow the first child by 10s. a week. I pause for a reply. In the silence that has followed I want to repeat, with the significance to which it is entitled, that in neither of those election campaigns did the socialist party Bay: &#34;We shall combat the Liberals&#39; meagre proposal to endow the first child by 5s. a week with a promise of 10s.&#34;. They did not suggest then that they would double the endowment payment. Now they put forward this fantastic argument that because family endowment is allegedly interrelated with the basic wage any increase of family endowment will operate to reduce the basic wage. In reply to that contention, the first point I make is that child endowment is paid not only to wage-earners, but also to all self-employed persons, and is not subject to any means test. Secondly, insofar as child endowment is paid to any wage-earner, it is paid to all wage-earners and not merely to those whose remuneration is fixed by Commonwealth or State arbitral tribunals. The contention put forward by members of the Australian Labour party that an increase of child endowment will operate adversely on the income of a section of the recipients of child endowment is therefore a very specious argument. Secondly, I point out that in 1927, if my recollection is correct, the New South Wales Parliament had before it a proposal to pay child endowment, not in respect of the second and subsequent children, but in respect of all children. An amendment to that legislation was submitted to restrict the endowment to the second and subsequent children, at the same time excluding the first child ; and the right honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> who in the eyes of some honorable senators opposite is under the disadvantage  of being a lawyer, went on record on that occasion in the New South Wales Parliament, of which he was then a member, as saying - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I repeat that, if the first child is omitted from  the  scheme, we may as well tear up the bill. .It will not be a child endowment scheme but simply a removal of the effect of the basic wage, in an attempt to equalize that basic wage on the one hand providing for one child, and a federal basic wage on the other hand providing for three children. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That argument is directly the reverse of the argument that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has submitted in this debate. On that occasion, the right honorable member for Barton continued - </para>

            <para>- That may have been due to some degree to the legislators in the New South Wales Parliament at that time. The right honorable member for Barton on that occasion advanced an argument that is directly contrary to the proposition now being submitted by honorable senators opposite. He said that if the New South Wales Government at that time endowed the first child it would make that measure unparalleled for itsinconsistencies and one that could not be understood either in its principles or in its application. I shall be fair, and I intend to be brief. I shall concede that the majority report of the Royal Commission on Child Endowment or Family Allowances that was submitted to the Australian Government in 1929 pro- vided some basis for that submission. The minority report of that commission which differed from the majority report in this respect was made by the late John Curtin and another member of the commission. That majority report said two things : first - </para>

          <quote>
            <para>In Australian systems of wage regulation  . . the two have been blended into one, every basic wage containing unanalysed elements of endowment. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was one of the weighty arguments by which the majority on that commission supported the recommendation against child endowment. However, the essential points that I should expect, honorable senators opposite would be the first to respect were that the late John Curtin and his colleague differed from both those points of view, and that that commission, whose report was against, the introduction of a system against which no honorable senators has argued, urged as its reason for its view the relationship between the basic wage and child endowment. The majority on that commission based that view simply upon the notion that the Arbitration Court then fixed the basic wage upon the needs of a five-unit family; and no other basis for the assessment of the basic wage was then urged. However, from a succession of judgments of the court since 1.929 the conclusion is inescapable that the court no longer assesses the basic wage upon a five-unit family and its needs, but fixes the wage on the basis of national production and what the national economy can afford to pay. The court has said repeatedly - in 1.934, 1937, 1941 and again in the munitions case in 1944, after a most elaborate examination of the principles underlying the assessment of the basic wage - that the primary factor that governs its assessment of the basic wage is not the cost of living or the needs of a family of a specified unit but what industry can afford to pay. Therefore, the argument of honorable senators opposite concerning the inter-relation between the basic wage and child endowment proceeds from the outmoded notion that was expressed in the majority report of the Royal Commission on Child Endowment or Family Allowances in 1929 and pays no respect to the unvarying series of judicial pronouncements by the Arbitration Court in the years that I have mentioned right up to 194.4 when the court re-affirmed its view in the munitions case and was careful to state that the principle that underlies its assessment of the basic wage is not the needs of a five-unit family but national productivity and the capacity of industry to pay. I shall support what I have said by making a few brief quotations from those judgments. In 1934 the court said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The adoption of a family unit is not necessary. What should be sought is an independent ascertainment and prescription of the highest basic  wage  which can be sustained by the total of industry in all its primary, secondary and ancillary forms. </para>

          <para class="block">In 1937 the court said - </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">In that judgment, the court went on to say that to remove the disparity between the childless family wage-earner and a wage-earner who had a family, some scheme of child endowment was desirable. </para>

            <para>- I hope that my citation of the court&#39;s judgments which falsify the basis of the arguments of honorable senators opposite may prove of advantage even to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooke.</inline> In 1941, the court confirmed the &#34; new start &#34; made in 1934, when it departed from the needs basis in fixing the basic wage and adopted the principle of the capacity of industry to pay. The court said that supplementary to the unit or basic wage which industry could pay, the economic difficulties which confronted those who bad children dependent upon them compared with those who had no children, should be bridged by a scheme of child endowment. I trust that I have quoted sufficient extracts from the authorities to show that child endowment can affect the basic wage only if the basic wage is assessed on the basis of the needs of a five-unit family. It is only to that basis that the submissions, whether made by Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, or the employers, and referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Katz,</inline> apply. I was careful to note two things while the honorable senator was speaking. Every one of the submissions from which he quoted addressed itself to the hypothesis that the Arbitration Court might revert to the original basis of fixing the basic wage, that is, insofar as the wage may be computed on the needs of a family unit. I asked by way of interjection whether he would not agree that the court now assesses the basic wage on the basis of national income and the capacity of industry to pay, but he did not oblige the Senate by reading from the relevant portions of the submissions to the court. The point that I am making is that since the majority report of the royal commission of 1929 propounded the notion to which I have referred, the view expressed in the minority report with which the late John Curtin concurred was accepted by the national legislature in 1941. At that time it was accepted by the Menzies Government, and the late John Curtin was sufficiently great and generous to acknowledge that that government was the first to pioneer this great principle of social services in this country. </para>
          </talk.start></continue><para>It is an outmoded notion to think that the endowment of the first child of a family at the rate of 5s. a week will have the effect of reducing the basic wage. Such endowment could have that effect only if the principles that were applied by the Arbitration Court prior to 1931 were resurrected. However, by a consistent line of decisions, the court itself has expressed the view that that basis is no longer tenable and that the present basis of national productivity will be found to have no relation to the argument that child endowment should be considered in fixing the basic wage. </para><para>

          </quote><para class="block">That sentence presents neatly the view that the judges of the Arbitration Court have expressed in most of their decisions. They have pointed out emphatically that, with a system of wage fixation such as we have in Australia, under which the wage of one unit of industry - the wage-earner - is fixed, irrespective of whether the wage is determined on the basis of a family unit or of national income, the wage-earner who has the glorious responsibility of supporting a family is treated unjustly in comparison with a childless wage-earner. It is to the everlasting credit of the judges of the Arbitration Court that they presented in a fair and impartial manner that supplementary question which needed, not their attention - because they had said repeatedly that they had no power to supply the deficiency - but the attention of the legislators of this country. The court respectfully presented that problem for the consideration of the legislators. Quite independently of that, as one of the judges said, it decided to adjourn the basic wage case. </para><interjection>

              <para>- The judges said that it was not within their power to rectify the disparity that exists, on the basis of the present basic wage, between a family man and a childless man. The sentence that I have just read from the judgment of Chief Judge Beeby neatly presented the .problem. It was not the adequacy or inadequacy of the basic wage on either of the bases of fixation. The problem then presented was the disparity between the case of a man with family responsibilities and that of a man with no family responsibilities, on any basic wage, however fixed. </para>

              <para>- I was about to address myself foursquare to that suggestion, empty though it is. A general election had to be held in 1949. The Chifley Government postponed it for as long as it could, but eventually it had to face the people. It fell to the lot of the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to expound the policy of the Liberal party. He presented to the people the policy that the Liberal party had put forward in 1.946, when there was no basic wage case before the Arbitration Court, and said that we adhered to our policy of providing child endowment for the first child. The right honorable gentleman was not inexpert at the game. He knew of the scurrilous arguments that would be advanced to exacerbate industrial discord between workers and employers. Those arguments had been advanced in 1946. He realized that the Labour party would tell the people that if an endowment of 5s. a week was paid in respect of the first child, the basic wage would be reduced. In order to forestall such a tortuous proposition, the right honorable gentleman said that if the Arbitration Court, contrary to the views that it had expressed since 1931, adopted for the basis of the assessment of the basic wage in the present case the needs of a family unit, the amount of the endowment for the first child Would immediately be increased from 5s. to 10s. I should have thought that the fairness of that proposition to wage-earners would have been apparent to and accepted by even those of the meanest intelligence. That question having been thrown into the political arena, the Arbitration Court was found not- to be inexperienced. It said, in effect, &#34; We know that the trade union advocates who have not yet graduated to the legislature will come before us during the next month and put forward the same shibboleth. It will not be conducive to the proper maintenance of the jurisdiction of the court for it even to be thought that the court is concerned with the decision of a political question &#34;. Therefore, to its great credit, it said, &#34; We shall adjourn the case for a month while the people decide the political issues &#34;. The consideration of the evidence which had already been submitted to the court provided the judges with ample employment during the adjournment. </para>

            <para>.- The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> said in the course of his speech on the motion for the second reading of this bill that Labour is&#34; opposed to the payment of child endowment in respect of the first child. There was no justification for that statement. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber have not indicated that they are apposed to the measure. We have indicated that we think it should be improved and that wage-earners should be safeguarded. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has foreshadowed the amendments to the bill that we propose to move. </para>

          <para>The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> said that the bill gives effect to a pre-election promise that was made by the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. I believe that the Minister was quite sincere when he made that statement, but he forgot to say that the promise was made only because the present Government parties had reason to believe that it was an election winner. I do not believe that honorable senators opposite are really actuated by an earnest desire to do something for the working-class people of this country when they support a measure providing for the payment of child endowment of 5s. a week in respect of the first child. </para>
          <para class="block">There are now approximately 640,000 families in Australia that are in receipt of child endowment for second and subsequent children. It is estimated that approximately 450,000 additional families will receive child endowment if this bill is passed.  The present Government parties had their ears well to the ground when they promised to pay an endowment of 5s. a week to 1,090,000 families in Australia. That is the real reason why this legislation has been introduced. It will possibly have an effect on the determination of basic wage applications throughout this country. In Western Australia, during the election campaign, people who were expounding the virtues of honorable senators now sitting opposite did not hesitate to tell the electors that if they voted in favour of the anti-Labour parties, endowment of 10s. a week would be provided for the first child in every family under the age of 16 years, not 5s. a week as contemplated in this measure. In effect they declared &#34;Return us to power and we will see that one-child families will receive child endowment of 10s. a week&#34;. </para>

              <para>- Although I did not personally hear that statement I have no reason to doubt its authenticity. I would be prepared to accept the word of the person who told me against that of any honorable senator opposite. The reason why this legislation is now before the chamber is that it was an election winner. Furthermore, 1,090,000 families will benefit by it. That was a very strong incentive. It may be argued that the Labour party itself could have made a similar gesture to the people of Australia. However, I remind honorable senators that the former Prime Minister stated that Labour would go to the country on its record of achievements during the last eight years. No promises to tickle the ears of the electors were made by Labour candidates. Although the measure before us will benefit a large number of people I consider that the promise of first-child endowment was a political bribe by the anti-Labour parties I admit readily that the proposed endowment of 5s. a week for the  first  child in every family under the age of sixteen years will be beneficial to many married couples in this country. Nobody could argue against that proposition, particularly in view of the increased cost of living. The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> referred to that aspect of the matter during his second-reading speech. If the Government were sincere in its claim, that it is studying the interests of the people of this country it should have increased age and invalid pensions rather than decided to endow the first child. My knowledge of industrial matters inclines me to the belief that in the determination of basic wage applications  in both the Federal and State spheres the courts take into consideration the number of units in a family. That applies particularly to Western Australia. Although the average family in this country is regarded as comprising a man, his wife and two children, I have reason to believe that the latest determination of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation an&#39;d Arbitration will be arrived at on the basis of the average family comprising a man, his wife and one child. It would therefore appear that it would be desirable at present to provide practical help and relief for the aged and invalid pensioners of this country rather than in respect of the first child in a family. I say candidly that my wife and I reared a family without any assistance whatever, as have thousands of other citizens of this country. </para>

Although the Government is proceeding with its endowment legislation, all that hae been done in respect of the widows and elderly people is that the Government has undertaken to closely investigate their disabilities. I realize that honorable senators opposite will say, &#34; Why did not the Labour Government make some promise in respect of age and invalid persons?&#34; I recall that the former Prime Minister asserted during the election campaign, that if elected his Government would give immediate attention to the incidence of the cost of living on age pensioners who were not in receipt of any income other than their pensions. The Labour Government was not unmindful of the plight of elderly people in the community. Unfortunately, however, those people inclined to the belief that they would receive a better deal from the present Government than from its predecessor. The present Government believes that in the application of its financial and economic policy an improvement will be brought about insofar as the purchasing power of our currency is concerned, thereby benefiting pensioners and other persons in fixed-income groups. Whether that suggestion is capable of application remains to be seen. It is certainly not a very enticing prospect for people in the groups that I have mentioned. </para>
          <para>When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> was Leader of the Opposition in the last Parliament he stated that child endowment problems were closely associated with the amount and structure of the basic wage. That was an important statement. Evidently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has overlooked that statement of the right honorable gentleman. The right honorable gentleman also said that the basic wage was under a complete re-examination by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. I presume that the right honorable member meant what he said. That reexamination must have been either for the purpose of granting an increase to the wage-earners, or for the purpose of considering the adoption of a different foundation on which to determine the basic wage. The right honorable gentleman said further that the definite difficulties of family life must be eased. I agree that the greatest possible benefit should be given to our citizens who are rearing families. But after making that statement, the right honorable gentleman in his policy speech said - </para>

          <para class="block">I submit that on  this  declaration of policy, the Government is envisaging the possibility of an alteration of the foundation on which the Arbitration Court of this country determines the base wage. I do so because I believe that if the courts of Australia determine a base wage, whether it is on the basis of a two family unit of a man and his wife, or on production capacity, it will have the effect of decreasing tremendously the amount in the wage envelopes of the workers. The payment of 5s. endowment for the first child in such circumstances will not recompense the average family for the &#93;09s it will suffer should that situation be developed. I put that aspect, to members of the Government and also remind them of the attitude of the Opposition in its desire to have this act amended on the lines that have been indicated, but here is something more important still as a result of that declaration by the Prime Minister prior to assuming office. </para>
          <para>Honorable &#39; senators will recollect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> made his policy speech on the 10th November, and I have read to honorable senators the promise that he made in respect of child endowment. What was the immediate effect of that pronouncement? The hearing of the basic wage case in the Arbitration Court was suspended until after the election which took place on the 10th December, so that there was a period of approximately three months from the time that the declaration was made until the court resumed the hearing of the case, when nothing was done. I ask honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber to endeavour to assess the economic loss that has been inflicted on the great majority of the workers of Australia because, first of all, of the election promise which the court regarded as a matter which was <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> and secondly by the decision of the court to withhold any further discussion on the matter until the people had made a determination as to which government was to fill the treasury bench. What did the court have in mind? I do not know and possibly honorable senators opposite do not know either. But I think it can be suggested that as a result of this intended legislation, the court will see the way clear to alter the foundation on which the basic wage may be determined in the future. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> made some reference to the introduction of child endowment in 1941. He seemed to think that honorable senators on this side of the chamber were jealous because an anti-Labour government introduced child endowment in that year. That is an absurd and childish observation. Why should honorable senators on this side of the chamber be jealous? All they want to do is to see that the greatest possible benefits are made available to the people of this country provided those benefits are not given at the expense of a section of the people. The honorable senator referred to something that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Curtin said in respect of the introduction of child endowment. </para>

              <para>- That is the opinion of the Minister, but what I had in mind was that it might be as well to remember that there was a reason which actuated the anti-Labour Government in 1941 in introducing that legislation. It was a very potent reason. It was well known that if something was not done by Government effort to relieve the difficulties of a. married man with a family of more than one child, there would be an increase in the basic wage of that period. Consequently the Government was of the opinion, I believe, that it would be better to relieve industry of the additional cost that would be involved, and place the burden upon the taxpayers of this country. I know that when the legislation was introduced it was to be financed by a pay-roll tax. But the pay-roll tax has not met the commitments that have to be met. Consequently revenue from the National Welfare Fund has to be used to meet the commitments. I ask leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

            <para>. - I wish to draw attention to what I consider to be a very serious omission. It concerns the men of the garrison battalions engaged in Australia in the recent war. In the early hours of the 5th August, 1944, a bugle rang out signalling a break out of 1,100 Japanese prisoners of war from Cowra prison camp. In a fanatical and desperate bid for freedom, they set fire to their huts and rushed their guards, who comprised members of the 22nd Garrison Battalion, mostly veterans of World War I. Three of the guards lost their lives. Because of the consummate bravery and resource of a handful of Australian guards, the break-out, which might have had serious consequences to the people of the surrounding countryside at the hands of the fanatics, was quelled, but not before 234 Japanese were killed and more than 100 wounded. In view of these facts, I wish to know what action was taken or contemplated to recognize the bravery and initiative of the members of that garrison battalion, and others in  the garrison forces in Australia who gave outstanding service to their country in circumstances of hardship and isolation in the northern areas of Australia. I consider that this has been a very serious omission and that it is about time that the attention of the Government was directed to it. I believe certain recommendations have been made but no effect was given to them. </para>

          <para>SenatorO&#39;SULLIVAN (QueenslandMinister , for Trade and Customs;  &#91;11.16&#93;. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - I endorse very strongly the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murray</inline> in regard to the outstanding gallantry showed by the garrison troops on the occasion to which the honorable senator has referred. It is rather unfortunate that the previous Government did not see fit to take any steps to recognize that gallantry. I shall he very happy to take this matter up with my colleagues to see that some fitting and adequate recognition is paid to these gallant men. </para>
