The Department of Supply was given the responsibility by the previous Government of running this central pool of transport. As it is probably the largest transport organization in Australia, the Government, in accordance with its promise to investigate every major phase of departmental activity and expenditure, felt that there was a prima facie case to subject this large transport organization to a close scrutiny by the most informed and experienced men whose services it could obtain. The department itself suggested the names of the gentlemen who have been appointed to the committee. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to  direct a question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. During the general elections campaign the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> when Leader of the Opposition promised the people that if returned as the government at Canberra, he would put value back into the £1. I am not quoting from a press report or from a magazine or any pictorial. Unfortunately the statement to which I shall refer did not appear in the press, but was broadcast by one of the radio stations in Launceston. It was to the effect that the Prime Minister gave an assurance to business people, whom he addressed during the Easter recess at Launceston, that it was not the responsibility of the Government to put value back into the £1. Will the Leader of the Government in this chamber confirm or deny that the statement was made by the Prime Minister. If it was made, was it correct? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator's question shows how difficult Standing Orders are. The honorable senator was not quoting from a newspaper report but from something which is much more unreliable - his own recollection. I did not hear the Prime Minister make that remark, if in fact he did make it, but if the honorable senator is really interested, I suggest that he ask one of his colleagues to ask the Prime Minister in another place. I am sure that the Prime Minister will be able to give a very satisfactory answer. </para>

I understand that under the war service homes building programme, many contracts are let to private builders and the settlement payment is very protracted, sometimes running into months and causing financial embarrassment to quite a number of the private builders who build war service homes under contract. Will the Minister take up with the Minister for Works and Housing the question of expediting the settlement of these payments? </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what newspaper report the honorable senator has read but if he has based his question on some statement that he has read in a newspaper, I have been misreported. I have not said when butter and tea rationing will be lifted. With regard to the protection of the public against the possibility of exploitation by merchants who might be tempted to make a profit on stock already held by them by selling at an increased price, every precaution has been taken to ensure that that shall not happen. On a previous occasion there was an increase in the price and the merchants were made to declare what tea they had in stock at that time. They were then made to pay back to the Tea Control Board the difference represented by the increase. If and when there is an increase in the price of tea - and I am not in a position to state whether there will be an increase or not - the public will be protected because the Tea Control Board is the only importer of tea". The" board in turn distributes to about 25 wholesalers and they deal with the" retailers who sell to the public. There would be nd difficulty in the Tea Control Board making all the"  wholesale  merchants declare what stocks they had in hand. The board probably has that information because the merchants get replenishments against coupons. The board could insist that the amount by which the price of tea was increased would be paid back to  the  board and the public would be protected.  There  is no prospect of the public being fleeced. </para>

                            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> has said, the butter ration in Britain was recently increased from 4 oz". to 5 oz. a week. The Australian Government is maintaining regular contact with the British Government. I believe that conditions in Britain are still such that the British people' require from Australia as much butter" as they cai! get. I am certain that' the Australian people are prepared to suffer the inconvenience of butter rationing for a little longer if they believe that by so doing they are giving practical help and assistance to our kinsfolk in Britain, especially at a time when it is important for us to show that we are prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder with them in times of sunshine as well as- in times of difficulty. The day may come when Britain will say,- " Thank you very much for your sacrifices on our behalf, but we no longer require you to impose rationing upon yourselves. We are now receiving adequate supplies". If and when that day arrives  the real purpos'e for which butter rationing in this coun'try" was first imposed will have ceased to exist. </para>

The information for which the honorable senator has asked is contained in publications that are available in the Parliamentary Library, and I can refer him to them, if he so desires. It is somewhat unreasonable to expect my staff to extract the information. If the honorable senator encounters any difficulty in extracting it, or if what he is searching for is not to be found in the library, I shall make it available to him if I can get it. </para>

As the Governor-General's Speech also indicated that the Government was closely investigating the matter, and believed that its economic and financial policy would result in an improvement of the purchasing power of the currency, thereby benefiting pensioners and other fixed income groups, will the Minister inform the Senate of the Government's financial and economic policy? I should like to know also whether the application of that policy has improved the purchasing power of the currency since the 10th December last? </para>

                    <para>. - This is a bill to repeal the Banking Act 1947 and to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945-1948. Its introduction, is in my opinion, just one more round in the long fight between the crusty-backed tories- and the Labour party on this issue. In the latter part of the last century Labour party candidates contested an election for the New South Wales Parliament on the issue that a Commonwealth Bank should be established. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley was elected as an Independent to the first Commonwealth Parliament in 1901, after he had advocated on the public platform the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank. It was not until July, 1908, that he joined the Labour party because he had by then realized that he could make no progress as an Independent against the forces opposed to the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank. Ever since the bank was established in 1911, there has been a series of moves and counter-moves in connexion with it. The Labour party has struggled for its retention and extension ; the parties opposed to Labour have tried to restrict its operation, and to defeat the purpose for which it was established. After the first world war, the private bankers and the greedy profiteers who had made hay, not while the sun shone, but while the land was darkened by the clouds of war, came out of their funk holes, and pressed for the establishment of a board to control the Commonwealth Bank. It was during one of the most hopeless and dithering regimes that we have ever had in Australia - that of the Bruce-Page Governments - that the Bank Board was appointed, and began to apply a policy that was in keeping with the world's decaying economy of that day. Australia passed through a boom, and then slid into a slump, during which the Commonwealth Bank Board exerted its influence against the Scullin Government, which was trying to miti gate the effects of the depression. The board, and those who supported it, succeeded in defeating the Scullin Government. During the depth of the depression, the Commonwealth Bank Board issued a report in 1932 from which I quote the following sentence: - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <quote>
                    <para>The board clearly indicates that any further amounts required for public works will not be financed by the bank, but must be obtained from the market. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The effect of the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945 is to ensure that it shall be the duty of the Commonwealth Bank, within the limits of its powers, to apply a monetary and banking policy directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia, and to exercise its powers under the act in such a manner as, in the opinion of the bank, will best contribute to the stability of the currency, the maintenance of full employment, and the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia. That is the key note of democracy. This bill, which seeks to amend the Banking Act 1945, is redundant and has no economic purpose. It is completely political and plans to interfere with an organization which has done magnificent work under the able management of the present Governor of the bank, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs,</inline> his predecessor, the Advisory Council and a competent staff. Honorable senators on the opposite side have agreed that the Commonwealth Bank is efficient. </para>
                <para>I have before me a report of the Commonwealth Bank for the year ended the 30th June, 1949. The profit and loss account shows that the net profit for that period, including the note issue department and the savings bank, was £7,683,000 after making provision for contingencies. This profit compared with £7,175.000 in 1948 showed an increase of over £500,000. Of the aggregate profit, £5,576,000 was paid to the Commonwealth Treasury and of that amount £4,460,000 went to Consolidated Revenue and £1,116,000 to the National Debt Sinking Fund. Thus the profits of the Commonwealth Bank went back to the people who, indirectly, are shareholders. In addition, £600,660 was paid to certain States, and the balance of £1.507.000 was credited to capital and reserve funds of the bank and the savings bank as provided by law. Those activities clearly show the bill now before the Senate to be completely unnecessary. By the introduction of the bank board, the Government hopes to interfere with a highly efficient organization. It also plans to put its " stooges " in the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank. Supporters of the Government admit that many features of the bank are desirable and provision is made in the bill for the expansion of certain avenues of business, but the General Banking Division of the bank operates in active competition with the private banks and the whole pattern of the Government's scheme is to change the attack that was made previously on the private banks. At one time there were numerous calls for a referendum. Catch-cries alleged interference with private enterprise and the stifling of competition. Now the Government proposes to reverse its tactics by establishing a bank board so that it can stifle the competition of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                <para>The General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank has continued to expand. To the 30th June, 1949, deposits showed an increase. Loans and advances moved from £25,000,000 at the 30th June, 1948, to £39,000,000 at the 30th June, 1949. Housing loan advances included 3,100 new Credit Foncier loans. The Rural Credits Department advanced £3,500,000. Members of co-operative societies were assisted, and loans to them reached £217,000,000 compared with £181,650,000 the previous year. Those figures show a big expansion in housing loans and rural credits. Both are important features of the Australian economy. Loans were not high last year in the Mortgage Bank Department because of high prices for primary products and good seasonal conditions, but an aggregate amount of £731,000 was lent to 379 new borrowers. Those figures demonstrate that in the field where financial assistance is necessary, the Commonwealth Bank is carrying out its national functions. In the Industrial Finance Department there has been no abatement of the demand for financial assistance and during the year 25,306 advances totalling £13,979,000 were approved. Depositors' balances in the Common- wealth Savings Bank increased by £17,000,000 and eleven branches were opened making 415 branches operative. The activities of the bank were infinitesimal in 1932 compared with present operations. Banking facilities are also available at agencies and special facilities have been provided for immigrants. I have drawn attention to this report because I wish to emphasize that the main point of the amendment of the Banking Act 1945 is the creation of a bank board. The proposed board will undoubtedly throttle the General Banking Division of the Commonwealth Bank as the Government intends it to do. The private banks were vigorous in their opposition to the Labour Government's nationalization proposals, but their silence on this legislation is most noticeable. Clearly the Government has some ulterior motive in seeking to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank Board. Honorable senators opposite have failed to advance a reasonable argument in support of this interference with the present constitution of the Commonwealth Bank. The silence of Labour's traditional opponents on this legislation makes them most suspect. There is no talk of a referendum now. In a democratic economy, the people should have full control over economic policy, including the expansion of credit, through their representatives in the Parliament. That is their undeniable right. The Government pretends that the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank Board will give to the Parliament control over the Commonwealth Bank's policy, but, in a subtle back door way, this bill actually takes that right away from the Parliament. The provisions under which documents relating to a dispute between the Commonwealth Bank Board and the Treasurer shall be laid on the table of each House of the Parliament are a mere facade of democracy. What can we do when the documents are laid on the table in this chamber? We have not the power to do anything. We could debate the documents as we do a statement on international affairs, but we have no power to act. </para>
                <para>The present Government parties have taken a complete somersault in their banking policy. They have opposed the Commonwealth Bank ever since its foundation, yet we now Lear them approving of it. The present constitution of the Commonwealth Bank was approved by the people of this country at the 1946 general election, and I am certain that when they are fully informed of this Government's proposals and the issues are clarified, they will pass judgment on those who cashed in on the confusion that existed during the recent general election period. It is of the utmost importance that the resources of the Commonwealth Bank should be available to assist in the maintenance of full employment. As I have said, there is no talk of a referendum now &lt;&gt;n the proposal to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank Board, or on the Government's interference generally with an efficient organization that has proved itself down the years. If ever there was a need for a slogan it exists now. Our slogan should be "Hands off the Commonwealth Bank ". The provisions of this legislation which make the Government the final authority in banking policy sound very fine, but the real reason behind the proposal to reconstitute the Commonwealth Bank Board is to prevent any future government from giving effect to its financial policy as circumstances prevailing at the time warrant or to hinder the application of that policy. We are enjoying a wave of prosperity at present, and the effect of this vital alteration of the constitution of the Commonwealth Bank may not be immediately noticeable, but any one who has any knowledge of economic cycles knows that inevitably the present boom period will be followed by a slump. The Commonwealth Bank as at present constituted would not make the mistakes that it made in the past under board control. I have already instanced the bank's failure to assist a government in time of need. The board informed that Government - </para>

                <para class="block">Board, and in the Government's economic policy generally, are the seeds of a depression. I believe that a depression is on its way now, but it will not come quite the same way as the last depression came. The capacity of the Australian people to buy goods is fast diminishing. Since the lifting of prices control, the purchasing power of the Australian £1 has fallen rapidly, with the result that to-day, people earning up to £S a week are not able to buy the necessaries of life. Therefore it will not be long before factories and other producing organizations find that they are unable to sell their goods. For instance, in Launceston, Patons and Baldwins Limited have found it necessary to dismiss an entire shift because of the reduced sale of knitting wool at present prices. Knitting wool to-day is beyond the reach of wage-earners. The abolition of the shift meant that last week and the week before hundreds of people were thrown out of work. The honorable senator who interjected, and all her political colleagues must share the responsibility for that. They confused the people, by telling a pack of stories. They said that the States could control prices. We know now that people throughout the length and breadth of the country want prices control to be reintroduced, and that fact answers the interjection made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> a few moments ago about the identity of those who will create the next depression. The destruction of goods and materials in war-time inevitably creates a grievous shortage of goods during the aftermath of war. During war huge sums of money are circulated amongst the community. That has the effect of inflating the prices of goods and services, and the only way in which a nation's economy can be controlled is by prices control. </para>
                <para>In presenting this measure to the Parliament the Government has stated that it represents a step towards more democratic control of the Commonwealth Bank. However, as I have pointed out, the bill will not achieve anything of the kind, because it will replace control by the Government of the Commonwealth Bank by a system that provides merely for the presentation to the Parliament of certain  reports and papers in a particular contingency. What jurisdiction the Parliament will have over the bank is not stated, and it would appear that the Parliament's control of the bank will be confined to examining certain papers when they are laid on the table. In any event, we have never witnessed the introduction of a progressive financial policy by any anti-Labour Administration. If the anti-Labour parties that are now in office had really desired to effect some progressive reform in our financial system they could quite easily have done so under the existing legislation. However, they are not satisfied with that legislation. For the past three years they have been endeavouring to upset it. Their friends initiated proceedings against the Commonwealth in the High Court, and subsequently a very lengthy appeal was decided by the Privy Council. Some of the judgments given by the judges of both tribunals will undoubtedly come to be regarded as historic documents. The importance of the proper control of banking is that national policies of credit and full employment are associated with our banking system. The present trend in Tasmania, where, as I mentioned a few moments ago, supply is exceeding demand because of increased prices, causes us to think deeply of the similarity between present conditions and those which prevailed from 1930 to 1932. We know that a government may make or break a country by the wisdom or otherwise of its financial policy, and may even avert a depression. </para>
                <para>The Government's intention to appoint the present Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and certain public servants to the proposed board is more or less a sop to those who criticize the bill. The plain fact is that the seven " additional " members of the board - which, by the way, was to have been a small one - could become a fifth column. "Additional" members will undoubtedly be chosen from people with long banking experience. Although the bill provides that appointees to the proposed board must not be in the employ of a bank at the time of their appointment, there is nothing to prevent a person who has retired from a bank from being appointed. Persons who have had a lifetime's experience of orthodox and outmoded methods of finance before they retired from banking will, therefore, be quite eligible for appointment, and if they are appointed to the proposed board they will undoubtedly endeavour to mould the board's policy in accordance with their ideas. The cry of such people always is: "Hold your ground; protect your privileges. We know of the growing demand by the masses of the people, but let us protect our privileges and keep the people out". That has been their theme down the years, " Let us keep them out ". For that reason I have no hesitation in describing the appointees to the proposed board as potential fifth columnists. If we want to undermine our enemies we place stooges in their midst. It has been said many times that this bill represents a pay-off to the private banks for their support of the antiLabour parties- </para>

                        <para>- This measure is designed to repay those who assisted  in  the campaign against the nationalization of banking and in the recent Commonwealth election campaign, who hoped that if the anti-Labour parties got into power they would be able to attack what Labour had done during its term of office. There is no greater difference of policy between the political parties opposite and Labour than that which exists on banking, and the control of the Commonwealth  Bank.  The vital principle involved is the principle of liaison between the people's representatives in the Parliament and the Commonwealth Bank. By means of the measure, the Government is endeavouring to drive a wedge between the Commonwealth Bank and the Parliament. If it were passed, the Commonwealth Bank would become the instrument of the private banks. </para>

                <para>Before the bank nationalization legislation was introduced, many persons tended to forget that, through the years, some private banks had been engaged in establishing a banking monopoly. There were 21 private banks in Australia in 1917, but by 1931 the number had been reduced to nine, and a small group of private banks had what was in effect a monopoly of the general banking business of this country. Between 1917 and 1931, twelve banks were absorbed by other banks. Three were absorbed by the Bank of New South Wales, one by the Commercial Bank of Australia Limited, four by the National Bank of Australasia Limited, three by the E. S. &amp; A. Bank Limited, and one by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited. A fairly substantial monopolistic ring of private bankers was formed. The growth of that monopoly called for very strong action. It could be countered only by extending the activities of the Commonwealth Bank. As I have already said, the bank has been allowed to extend its activities only when it has been under the control of a Governor. The history of the bank shows clearly that its activities have expanded under the control of a Governor, and contracted under the control of a board or stooges. For that reason, the slogan of members of the Labour party in the Senate and the House of Representatives and of the persons who voted for the Labour party at the last general election, comprising almost 50 per cent, of the population, is, "Hands off the Commonwealth Bank". </para>
                <para>Why does the Government wish to alter the present system of control of the bank, except for political reasons? Honorable senators opposite have not advanced a reasonable argument in support of the proposed alteration. </para>

                    <para>- It should continue to do so, but we have no guarantee that it will. If a Commonwealth Bank Board is established, the Parliament will lose all contact with the Commonwealth Bank other than that afforded by the tabling of papers. If control of interest rates by the Commonwealth Bank were abandoned, the private banks would increase their profits by increasing interest rates, and the Commonwealth Bank would be forced to do the same thing*. I hope that that will not occur. </para>

                <para>In my opinion, the case that has been presented by the Government in an attempt to justify the introduction of this measure is a case presented by guilty men. Honorable senators opposite realize that the present Government parties will not remain in power for very long, and they wish to do whatever they can to throttle any progressive financial measures that may be introduced by a Labour government. That is, quite clearly, the background to this measure. I do not propose to beat about the bush. That is the real reason for the introduction of this bill. The Government does not want any extra power for itself, because the 1 945 banking legislation, as it stands at present, gives it more power than it will ever need to use. It hopes that, while it is temporarily in office, it will be able to throttle, restrict and frustrate the financial policy of future governments. I consider that no further argument is required to show that the bill is unnecessary. Honorable senators should realize that the repeal of the 1947 legislation is not necessary to prevent the nationalization of banking because that legislation has been practically invalidated by the decisions of the  High  Court and the Privy Council. In fact it has been described as a " dead horse ". I am prepared to say that I shall live to see the day when the banks will be nationalized. I am still a young man. The present measure however is just one of the early skirmishes in the battle for control of the country's finances. The nationalization of banking is a vital policy of the Labour movement to which that movement has adhered all through its history. It is a policy with which people who have an interest in the perpetuation of democracy must agree. 1. quote once again the saying' that " Government is finance, and finance is government ". A wedge cannot be driven between the two if democracy is to bp perpetuated. We on this side of the chamber have no regrets about, and are not ashamed of, any legislation that  we  introduced during our term of office. We tried to the best of our ability to  improve  the welfare and standards of living of the people. We believe that in view of  the  decisions of the High Court and the Privy Council the private banks should be allowed to continue their operations but we believe also that the Commonwealth Bank should be given fuller scope for expansion. We believe also that the board system of control of that bank hap shown in the past that the board ha* not been capable of conforming with the policy of a government of the day. That was particularly so in the years 1930 and 1931 when a Labour government <inline font-style="italic">wa.&lt;</inline> in  office. A subsequent Labour administration was able to prove that under the system of control by a governor the Commonwealth Bank was able to strengthen and expand its activities. </para>
                <para>I sum up my remarks by saying that I consider that the provision designed to re-institute the board system deals with a matter of vital principle. That principle is the " to be or not to be " of economic democracy. The re-institution of the Commonwealth Bank Board would be a retrograde step. The board system failed in the past and, to judge it on it? record, just as we judge a racehorse on its form, we should not try that system again. I hope that this measure will bc defeated. It will be defeated. I hope also that the people of Australia will make it their business to study the implications of the interference by the Government with the conduct of the Commonwealth Bank. I am quite certain that people throughout the length and breadth of the land who are interested not only in their own welfare but also in that of their children, will ensure that the old shellbacks and  diehards  keep right out of the field of activities of the Commonwealth Bank. If this measure were to be passed we should have turned the clock back to times that should have gone forever. 1 am certain that the destiny of Australia is very much safer under a longsighted policy than it will be under a policy established by retrogressive measures, such as the present bill, that are not in the best interests of the people. </para>

                        has gone to great lengths in an endeavour to establish a case against the re-institution of the board system of control of the Commonwealth Bank. He complained that we are not providing for the holding of a referendum on that issue. In direct answer to him I say that a very effective referendum on the issue was held on the 10th December last, when the present Government was returned to office with an absolute majority in both Houses of the Parliament. I use the words " in both Houses", because the majority of new senators who were elected at that election belong to the Government parties. The Government that the honorable senator supported itself refused, and continued to refuse, to hold a referendum on the question of the nationalization of banking although such a referendum was consistently asked for by the people. The honorable senator himself refused the holding of that referendum when he supported the Chifley Government. It is quite obvious that the honorable senator's heart was not in many of the statements that he made to-day, because he stumbled and struggled through his speech, making very heavy weather of it. He indulged in the same old stories that we have been hearing from the Labour party for many years and that he and his colleagues indulged in during the last general election campaign. Many of his statements were indicative of a miserable and suspicious mind. He indulged in the use of such terms as " stooges ", " fifth column ", " pay-off ", and of other innuendoes that are such base suggestions that a decent person can afford to ignore them. I hope to be able to explode again many of the arguments of the honorable senator.

                <para>One of the main matters with which the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>
                <para class="block">Menzies) dealt in his policy speech immediately prior to the last general election was a proposal to provide for banking reform as is embodied in this measure. The Prime Minister said then that if the Liberal and Australian Country parties were returned to office they would repeal the Banking Act 1947, and I understand that the Opposition, excluding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne,</inline> generally accepts the expressed will of the people in that matter. That is not to say that honorable senators opposite disavow their policy with respect to the nationalization of banking. They do not disagree with nationalization, but a majority of them at least accept the opinion of the people on that matter as a definite mandate to the present Government. That is quite logical and proper. </para>

Honorable senators opposite support socialization and yet agree to the repeal of the Banking Act as giving expression to the people's will. There is nothing inconsistent in that. I believe that every honorable senator, indeed, every one in the community should have the right the express his beliefs. This is still a free country. We believe in the expression of beliefs so long as those expressions are not of a subversive or revolutionary character. In a democratic country that is as it should be. Whilst some honorable senators opposite believe in socialization, they were prepared to accept the verdict of the people on the 10th December last. In his policy speech, the Prime Minister stated further - </para>

                        <para>- I shall endeavour to do so. The only point of disagreement between the Opposition and the Government appears to be over the decision of the Government to reappoint a Commonwealth Bank Board. Unfortunately, the Opposition has presented the activities of the previous bank board in a distorted way. Honorable senators opposite have claimed that the board was responsible for the depression of some years ago. I remind them that, in 1937, the trade unions of Australia used the splendid recovery that we had made from the depression as the basis of an application to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for a prosperity loading on wages. The original bank board was established in 1924, and it handled the depression of 1930-1932 so effectively that Australia was the last country to be affected by the depression, and one of the first to emerge from it. The board financed Australia's war effort, and controlled all financial activities connected with the prosecution of the war. The economic depression was world wide. When it hit Australia, a Labour Government was in office, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> was Prime Minister. However, I do not blame him for the depression. I do not blame any government for it. I am fairer than some honorable senators opposite, who are willing to blame any one for the depression but themselves. I say that the depression was world wide, and the economic position of Australia during that time was the result of circumstances over which no government had any control. The depression was caused by the collapse of overseas prices for our exports, with the consequent collapse of our export industries. </para>

                <para>I believe that the re-appointment of a Commonwealth Bank Board will not adversely affect the operations of the bank. Indeed, I believe that it will give those operations a fillip, and will tend to increase the activities of the bank. It will assist in the expansion and development of Australia. In addition, the people will have far more confidence <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the bank when they know that it is being controlled by a board of experts instead of by one man. </para>
                <para>When the Commonwealth Bank was first established, it was not intended that it should become a monopoly, but that it should enter into free and fair competition with the trading banks.

                        <para>- Very well, I withdraw them. In any case, I prefer to accept the statements of Labour leaders of the past rather than those of the men who lead the Labour party to-day. I believe that there should be free and fair competition between the Commonwealth Bank and the trading banks. Such competition would be very helpful to all concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> spoke of the wonderful success of the Commonwealth Bank, and said that since its establishment it had earned quite a lot of money for the Treasury. It is true that it has earned about ?85,000,000 for the Commonwealth Treasury since it was established. We all agree that the Commonwealth Bank, has done a very good job. However, I point out that during the three yearperiod from 1947 to 1949, while the bank was under the control of one man, the total profits amounted to just about ?17,000,000, but of that amount no less than ?13,000,000 represented profits from the note issue. During that period, the net profits of the bank, including the Commonwealth Savings Bank, but excluding the note issue, amounted to about ?4,000,000. In the same period, the trading banks paid to the Commonwealth Treasury in taxes more than ?11,000,000. Thus, while the Commonwealth Bank earned for the Treasury about ?4,000,000, the trading banks paid approximately ?11,000,000 in taxes, in addition to which trading bank dividends were taxed in the hands of the shareholders. It will be seen, therefore, that during the period of three years while the Commonwealth Bank was under the control of one man, the Treasury received much more as a result of the operations of the trading banks than it did from the Common: wealth Bank. If there is to be free and fair competition in banking; the Commonwealth Bank should pay taxes on the same basis as do the trading banks. For one thing, municipalities provide services for the Commonwealth Bank for which <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> does not. pay. I realize that, all profits earned by the Commonwealth Bank go to the Treasury, but. I believe that, all government trading enterprises- should be liable to taxation on the same basis as are private firms. That would tend to promote the efficiency of government enterprises, and only then could it be claimed that there was fair and free competition between government and private enterprise. </para>

                <para>The people of Australia must be protected from dictators whether they be political, financial or industrial. Under the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945, the Chifley Government appointed a dictator to control the Commonwealth Bank. Admittedly he was answerable to the Treasurer. Honorable senators opposite have great imagination. They have already indicated who is to be appointed to the new bank board and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> has told us that stooges are to be appointed. He should be the last to suggest that, and he knows to what I refer. Honorable senators opposite have drawn on their imaginations to forecast what policy the Commonwealth Bank Board will pursue and the consequences that will follow. They appear to have worked themselves into a state of frenzy over the figments of their imaginations and their faulty reading of the history of the banking of this country ; or is it only make believe ? All honorable senators realize that honorable senators on the Opposition side have to make a show for their outside supporters. They have not progressed beyond that stage where they think that all the Opposition has to do is to oppose legislation and employ delaying tactics. "Why should the Opposition in this chamber try to dictate to the Government? Politically, the majority of the Opposition is the result of an election held some years ago. At the election of senators last year, the people of Australia returned 23 supporters of the Government and only nineteen of the Opposition. What view should prevail - the view expressed by the people only a few months ago or the view expressed several years ago? The majority of the Opposition in this chamber do not represent the popular vote as decided on the 10th December last. Indeed, it was claimed that the law was deliberately designed to keep a certain party in control of this chamber notwithstanding that the people rejected the government of the day. </para>

                        <para>- The legislation introduced recently provides only for a double dissolution. Fifteen Opposition senators did not face the electors in December last, and they were determined to keep control of this chamber by hook or by crook. Supporters of the Labour party claim that the will of the people should prevail. If they believe that, they should accept the expressed will of the people which was given on the 10th December because the Government had an unmistakable mandate to put this legislation on the statute-book. I am not giving away any secret when I suggest that the Government might have to ask the people for another mandate. </para>

I remind honorable senators that when attempts were made to tamper with the currency in 1930 and Australia's name was being besmirched by the Australian Government through default in interest payments, the people of this country rose in their wrath and swept that government from the treasury bench and elected a new government which righted Australia in the eyes of other nations and restored confidence. </para>

                <para>The Opposition has endeavoured to create an impression that this bill is at variance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems when, in fact, that commission recommended the establishment of the board or, to be more correct, the continuation of the board. No business of any magnitude is controlled by one man. There is always a board of directors. Yet Opposition senators would retain a one-man control system in the Commonwealth Bank which influences the entire financial affairs of Australia. The </para>
                <para class="block">Socialist Government in Great Britain, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Attlee,</inline> retained an independent board of directors to administer the nationalized Bank of England. Honorable senators opposite prefer not to believe that it is possible to find disinterested and able men for such a task outside official circles. They do a grave injustice to their fellow-countrymen. The vital fact remains that the people supported the bank board against the Scullin Government years ago. Honorable senators opposite conveniently ignore the fact that in the 1931 elections, which were fought largely on the financial policy of the Labour party, Labour lost 28 seats out of 46. They are gluttons for punishment. </para>
                <para>Control of a central bank by a board is not an innovation. The only countries that do not have boards to control their central banks are Russia and the Communistcontrolled countries. Yet that is the method advocated by honorable senators opposite in spite of the expressed will of the people. Everybody is out of step except the Australian socialists! The socialized Bank of England under the socialist Government has a board of eighteen directors. The Australian Government proposes a board of ten for the Commonwealth Bank. The reserve bank of New Zealand has a board of nine directors and eleven directors control the Bank of Canada. The reserve bank of India has a board of fourteen members. The South African Reserve Bank has eleven directors on its board, the Bank of France has twelve and the Central Bank of Eire is controlled by a governor and thirteen directors. The banks of Portugal, Rumania, Finland and many other countries are controlled by boards of directors. </para>

Honorable senators on the opposite side of the chamber have complained that the Commonwealth Bank Board did not issue unlimited credit some years ago.

                    <para>To create credit for £20 million for loan work is unsound, and I expect the banks to refuse to do so. Such a proposal means permanent inflation which could not be checked as is implied, and would demand further inflation. All this talk about creating credit and inflation is most damaging. Since inflation was suggested, efforts are being made by men in England to withdraw their money from Australia as they would lose by payment in the depreciated currency. Depreciation of currency would decrease values of savings banks deposits, property would increase in price - there would be a rush to sell bonds for investment in property and financial panic may result. </para>

                <para>Quite a number of honorable senators on the Opposition side complain bitterly that banking employees took part in the recent federal election. Surely those men had a perfect right to defend themselves Their banks were to be closed and their jobs were at stake. There was no other way. They could defend themselves only by taking part in the federal election campaign. Honorable senators have not heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> or other senators on the Opposition side objecting to Australian Workers Union organizers and other union employees going from door to door canvassing for the labour party. They cannot have it both ways. If honorable senators object to bank employees participating in the general election campaign, they must object to the union organizers whose jobs were not at stake doing the same. Even funds from Communist-controlled unions were used to assist them.

                    <para>.- The speech to which we have just listened is of the kind that can be turned on like a tap when defence is required of vested interests, including tho private banking institution. However, although I have heard the speech before many times, I propose to deal with one or two points that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> made.  His  outstanding point of course, was that even he appreciates Labour men when they are dead. During the last federal election campaign, I addressed a meeting at Ipswich in Queensland. At the conclusion of my remarks. an old gentleman rose to move a vote of thanks. He said, " Forty years ago in this town, we put up for election to  the Commonwealth Parliament, a man named Andrew Fisher. At that time the newspapers were full <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> scurrilous cartoons about him- One depicted him as a tiger, restlessly pacing up and down behind the bara of a cage. The caption was, ' Don't let this socialist tiger free ! ' But the socialist tiger not only got free, but he won the election, and every seat in the Senate. To-day, this man who was so much maligned when I was a boy, is held in the greatest esteem. People say : ' What a pity it is that there are not more men like Andrew Fisher in the Labour movement'". It was the same story when John Curtin died - when alive, maligned; when dead, revered. Mention has been made in this debate of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> G. Theodore, who was Treasurer of the Commonwealth when the Scullin Government was in office. He top was maligned during his political life, and it was extraordinary indeed to read in the newspapers when he died recently the glowing tributes to his virtues. So it will be, I am sure, of present-day Labour leaders such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,</inline> whose only crime is that they are in the public life of this country and have its interests at heart. They are good men and the day will come when the story that we have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> to-night will be repeated. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The honorable senator made a great song about the fact that boards control banks throughout the world. That is not the point at issue. The board proposed by the Government in this legislation will be completely removed from the control of the Parliament. Before I finish my speech, I hope to prove that assertion completely. The one-man control about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> said much, has never existed. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Coombs</inline> was never the sole controller of the Commonwealth Bank under Labour's administration. He was directly under the control of the Treasurer, who in turn was under the control of Cabinet, and of the Labour party. That was a completely democratic system. It is strange to look back over the years and see what one might describe as the eternal fight between the forces of progress, and the forces that go under the name of Conservatives. Incidently, it is interesting to note that the dictionary definition of " conservative " is " against any change ". That is epitomized <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the two forces in the public life of this country, one of which is the Labour movement, which hag had only one name throughout its history. </para>

                <para class="block">That has been the fight of the Labour movement down the years. We have always appreciated the fundamental necessity that the monetary policy of a nation must be controlled by its Government. Some one must control it. Do not think for a moment that it ever goo* uncontrolled. Labour's fight has always been for national control. It may be interesting to examine briefly the history of the Commonwealth Bank. In 1905, part of the platform of the Australian Labour party was the establishment of a Commonwealth bank. In 1911, the Fisher Government passed legislation with only minor amendments setting up this great institution. Provision was made for a capital of £1,000,000, but only £10,000 was called upon to launch the bank. The £1,000,000 was never needed. That shows what a profitable business banking really is. Ever since its establishment, the bank has made substantial profits which have been returned to the various governments, and through them to the people. In 1912, the bank opened its doors with a staff of twelve, including the Governor, two typists, and a messenger. The bank was barely two years old when World War I. started and its staff numbered only 250. However, it immediately assumed leadership in the banking field, and guaranteed the private banks against any failure on their part to cope with the immense financial problems that existed in those days. During the  war years, the Commonwealth Bank financed commodity pools, to the amount of £437,000,000. It handled war loans amounting to £250,000,000 at a cost of only 5s. 7d. per £100, which was approximately oneeighth of the cost of such loans had they been floated in London. By comparison, loans floated by the State governments between 1910 and 1915 cost £2 7s. Id. per cent. The story of the Commonwealth Bank's service to this country during World War II. is too well known to be recapitulated in detail by me now. However, I point out that, in those years, the Commonwealth Bank raised loans totalling £1,166,684,000 at a cost of 5s. per cent., and financed purchases of Australian produce and of tea, coffee and jute of a total value of £510,000,000. It also made available rural credits amounting to £61,000,000, and financed exporters to the tune of £168,000,000. That job was done by the people's bank. I do not think that the private banks could have done it. Even if they could, the cost to this community would have been so great that every member of it would have carried the burden until he died and then passed it on to posterity. An effort to stop the expansion of the Commonwealth Bank was made in 1924, by the then United Australia party, Nationalist party, or Liberal party Government - I do not know what honorable senators opposite called themselves in those days. The present tragic Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> was then the "tragic Treasurer" of the Commonwealth.  His  method of halting the bank's progress was to change control of the bank al the death of the Governor, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, who had guided it so successfully through its difficult early years, and to hand the institution over to a newly constituted Commonwealth Bank Board. We all know who the members of that board were, and we know what interest they had in problems of the great mass of the Australian people., They represented the private banks, insurance companies, and trustee companies. The Commonwealth bank was controlled by a board until 1941, when, under the wartime banking control regulations, the first real steps were taken towards giving legal power to the Commonwealth Bank to become a great central bank. In 1945, the bank was formally constituted as a central bank, and at that point it was, in my opinion, at the height of its efficiency. It was invested with all the legal authority necessary to enable it to do its job for the people of this country. To-day we have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> what a wonderful institution the Commonwealth Bank has been down the years, but the honorable senator would have to be a spell-binder or a Franquin to convince anybody that the Commonwealth Bank Board was anything but a board of directors appointed from the private banks for the sole purpose of safeguarding the interest of those banks. The members of that board wanted to retard as much as possible the progress of that bank. I can prove that quite simply by demonstrating the progress made by that bank before it was shackled. In 1920 there were 32 trading bank branches and by 1925 that number had increased to 70, and nine additional savings bank branches had been opened. However, between 1925 and 1930 the number of trading branches increased by only eighteen. That was the progress made under the former Commonwealth Bank Board. I repeat that in five years only eighteen more branches and one additional savings bank branch were established. However, under the regime of the Scullin Government the number of trading bank branches increased from 88 to 261. That is a story of expansion and real progress. During that period savings bank branches also increased from 79 to 96, making a grand total of 289 branches of the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Savings Bank, compared with 96 in 1930. Consider the stagnation that followed during the period from 1932 to 1939 under an anti-Labour administration, when the defenders of the private trading banks again controlled the government of the country. During that period the number of trading bank branches increased from 261 to 275; in other words, only fourteen additional branches were opened in seven years, or two new branches a year. That is the " progress " made under the control of the bank board and an anti-Labour government. In fact, it was stagnation and the murder of a great institution. In the meantime Labour had again assumed office, and the number of branches of the bank increased in 1949 to 415, with sub-branches, branches in London, at airports and in the migration centres. At last the bank had shaken itself free of the bonds that bound it, and its energies had been unleashed. The people's bank had been allowed to compete with the trading banks. During the long period in which the bank was controlled by a board, branch managers were under definite instructions from the board that they were not to compete with private trading banks. That board was composed of bedstead manufacturers, representatives of the tobacco trust, private banking institutions, the Union Trustee Company, the graziers of Australia and the polo players. However, we must give those gentlemen credit for at least one thing, which is that they did their job well. The present Government has now set out to do its job. We know the story of the last Commonwealth election campaign. Whilst the banks were, in my opinion, quite entitled to fight at the last election, because this is a democracy and every one who has a point of view is entitled to express his opinion, and to influence others to agree with him, the private banks went a lot farther. They importuned their employees to go out and do a job against Labour. Lists were sent out from the head offices of the banks to be completed by branch managers showing the names of those who volunteered to help the banks. "We know what would happen to the men who did not put their names down. When Labour candidates were addressing meetings during the election campaign they noticed that there were always three or four of the local bank officers on hand to interject. It reminded me of the early days of fascism in Europe, when young men were sent to trade union meetings to deny the trade unionists the right of free speech. </para>

Indeed, I challenge him now to do so. Apparently the banks' propaganda was so effective that even people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> believed it. Certainly the fact that he believes it is no compliment to his mental ability, but it is a tribute to the effectiveness of the banks' propaganda. As I have said, bank clerks went from door to door instilling fear into the people. The employees were paid to do the job. They were able to take time off to go from door to door in every country town endeavouring to frighten the people. </para>

When fear is instilled into a person, reason goes out; and it cannot be denied that the banks did a great job by sending their clerks to instil into working men and women a fear that was completely unwarranted.

                <para class="block">The' drive to establish <inline font-style="italic">sc.</inline> pool of unemployed in this country can succeed only if the Commonwealth Bank is divorced from, its function of being the people's bank,, so that it can once again become a bankers5 bank. Honorable senators opposite wonder why we are, to use their word, quibbling about the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank Board. We say that the action of the Government in proposing to establish a board1 of the kind for which provision is made in this bill, is a " pay-off " to the private trading banks, through whose efforts it is now in office. It is proposed that the board shall consist of five Commonwealth public servants, three of whom are  specified  in the bill and two of whom have been named by the Treasurer, and five persons from outside. They are the mystery men. It may be that they will comprise a fifth column. The Secretary to the Department of the Treasury, who is to be a member of the board, will obey the directions that are given to him by the Treasurer. He will not be appointed to the board as a man of independent mind who will weigh the pros and cons of any problem that arises. If he receives a direction from the Treasurer, he must obey it. If a Minister gives the head of a department for which he is responsible a directive on policy, the head of the department must obey it, irrespective of whether he believes it to be foolish and unworkable. </para>

                        <para>- That interjection is not relevant to the point that I am discussing. The five outside members of the board and the member who will automatically follow directions given to him by the Treasurer, could, if they joined together, prevent deadlocks from occurring in the board. If the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank disagreed with them,, they could prevent the Governor's point of view from being put to the Treasurer and to the Parliament. There are many questions upon which the Government must make a decision soon. There is talk in the City of Sydney of a strong move for the increase of interest  rates, and pressure is being brought to bear upon the Government, especially by newspaper interests, for an appreciation of the Australian pound. Those are matters with which a Commonwealth Bank Board of the kind that is proposed could and would deal. </para>

                <para>The Commonwealth Bank is the pride of this country and the envy of other countries. It was born in the mind of the Labour party, which has, through the years, encouraged and assisted its development. Despite the temporary check to its progress as a result of antiLabour governments placing a board in charge of its affairs, it did a great job for Australia and, under the present system of control, is doing a magnificent job. Now it is proposed suddenly to change that system of control, for the reasons that I have put before the Senate. There are things that the Government wishes to do that cannot be done under the present system, and therefore it is proposed to alter the system. I am certain that the Opposition would not object to a proposal to establish a board consisting of five public servants. "We object, not to a board as such but to a board of a kind that will remove from the Parliament any say in the control of the affairs of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                <para>The ridiculous proposal has been made that, if a disagreement occurs between the Treasurer and the board - and I say that disagreements will not occur - a paper setting out the pros and cons of the dispute will be tabled in each House of the Parliament. That procedure would be quite useless, because by the time the paper was tabled the dispute would have been decided. The Governor-General in Council would already have instructed the Commonwealth Bank and its board as, to the policy that should be adopted. </para>

                        <para>- I am convinced that the present system of control of the Commonwealth Bank should not be altered. This is a national issue. We must safeguard the prosperity that we now enjoy. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'byrne</inline> said, some signs of a depression, I do not know of what severity, are to be seen. Owing to the inability of the Government to put the value back into the £1 and the great increase of prices that has occurred during the six months that it has been in power, the commodities that the people need have become almost too expensive for them. Bread, milk and cheese are all very dear, and even tea is in doubt. The £1 now is worth much less than it was on the 10th December last year. One cause of a depression is a shortage of goods, and such a shortage can be created artificially. Goods may be available, but it may be beyond the capacity of the people to purchase them, with the result that they are left in the factories and in the shops. A depression could occur in this country if goods were available in abundance but we could not afford to buy them, even though we were enjoying a nominal high standard of living. There are signs of trouble in the economic field. I appeal to the Government to use the strength and weight of the Commonwealth Bank to prevent a recurrence of the cataclysm of 1930 and 1931.. That must be avoided at all costs. One way in which to avoid it is to permit the Commonwealth Bank to continue under the present system of control, backed by a wise government. </para>

                        <para>- I differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> regarding the wisdom of the statements made by the Opposition. The only conclusion to which 1 can come is that honorable senators opposite are attempting deliberately to delay the legislative programme of the Government. As a new member of the Senate, I have been dismayed by those delaying tactics, because I realize that they are being used for political motives and not to further the best interests of this country. The same tactics were used by the Opposition when the bill dealing with child endowment was before the Senate. Unless the Australian Council of Trades Unions uses its influence with the political side of the Labour movement, it is doubtful whether the people of Australia will be paid endowment for the first child in every family. I hope that saner counsels will prevail. The Opposition is using the tactics of delay and obstruction only to obstruct the legislative programme of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I have risen, not to stone-wall, but to deal with the bill, which is in complete conformity with the policy that was put before the people at the last general election by the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. We told the electors quite clearly that, if returned, we should repeal the Banking Act 1947 and re-introduce board control of the Commonwealth Bank. I can understand why the Opposition has made but few references to the clause of this bill relating to the repeal of the Banking Act 1947. It must make honorable senators opposite squirm in their seats to know that their plan to nationalize banking in this country has been thwarted - I hope for all time. The Labour party regards the nationalization of banking as a panacea. The Privy Council ruled that many sections of the 1947 act were invalid. At the last general election the people showed in no uncertain manner that they disapproved of it, and as a result the Labour party is in opposition in the Parliament. </para>

                <para>One feature of the debate that I do not regard as being very uplifting has been the constant references by honorable senators opposite to gentlemen who acted as they thought best to combat the pernicious doctrine of bank nationalization. They have been called "stooges". I do not know what meaning the dictionary ascribes to that word, but I know that the Opposition used it in a derogatory sense. Those men acted purely and simply in their own interests. Unquestionably, they were members of banking ins'titutions. They were employees of banks who realized the danger inherent in nationalization of banking. </para>

                        <para>- The election was fought on that issue, among others. We recognized the 1947 banking legislation for what it really was - the spear-head of socialism in this country. I consider that the campaign of those bank officers was on as high a plane as the Labour party's campaign. Honorable senators opposite have made damaging statements against those gentlemen. I refer to them as " gentlemen " because they were gentlemen. My experience with the bank officers who were engaged on that work convinced me that they were men of the highest standards, and I know that other honorable members on this side of the chamber support me in that view. The terms that honorable senators opposite have used in relation to those people - " lies " and " misrepresentation " - are unworthy of senators and should never have been uttered. They were worthy men and their efforts were fortified by the fact that the people of Australia supported them when they expressed their opinions at the last general election. In any event, the repeal of the Banking Act 1947 is embodied in this measure and will, I hope, mean the end of the socialization programme of the Labour party as far as banking is concerned. Honorable members opposite have occupied a great deal of the Senate's time with references to the economic depression of the early 1930's. They have lauded themselves in respect of the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank by a Labour administration. I am willing to give the Labour party due credit for establishing that bank. I do not desire to be niggardly in that respect because the Commonwealth Bank is a very great institution and I give the Labour party credit for establishing it. Honorable senators opposite view with suspicion our proposal to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank  Board.  They have made many attacks on the Government parties which, they say, intend to sabotage the Commonwealth Bank in the interests of the private banking institutions. Nothing is farther from the truth. "We have heard a great deal from the Opposition about how Australia was thrown to the wolves during the depression, the implication of course being that the board that then controlled the Commonwealth Bank under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson had acted in the interests of the private financial institutions and that the depression was deliberately and wantonly forced upon the people. I qualify that statement to a curtain extent, because a few honorable senators opposite have been fair in their approach to this matter. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Katz</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator ^Flaherty,</inline> who deserve credit for the moderate manner in which they approached this problem. </para>

                        <para>- In the main the charges levelled by honorable senators opposite cannot be substantiated. I do not doubt for a moment that mistakes have been made in the past. We probably could have, at times adopted some other course with different results, but the mistakes were made in good faith.  Nobody  is infallible. We do not claim that the board that we propose to establish will be infallible. But we must acknowledge the fact that the Commonwealth Bank Board as it was constituted in the years of the depression acted as it thought right in the interests of the people. </para>

Some of the authorities that I shall quote would not be challenged by even honorable senators opposite. The first authority is the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems.

                    <para>The world depression in itself ranks as a major disaster in most countries. Australia, as a trading country, is bearing a full share of its paralysing effects. Simultaneously, other misfortunes of equal severity have come upon us. The fall in prices has been much heavier in the case of raw materials and foodstuffs than in regard to other goods. Thus, the position of countries like Australia which depend for their prosperity upon the export of raw materials and foodstuffs is much worse than that of manufacturing countries. Our plight is probably the worst of all since Australia has almost the highest net value of exports, per head of the population, of any country in the world. </para>

                        <para>- Prior to the suspension of the sitting I had dealt with the delaying tactics of the Opposition, the proposed repeal of the 1947 banking legislation, and the charges that have been made by the Opposition about the responsibility for the depression. I have cited authorities that no honorable senator could contest. At any rate I am not prepared to pit my general and economic knowledge against that of persons who have had a vast experience in these matters. Surely honorable senators opposite have no right to pit their puny economic knowledge in these matters against the authorities that I have cited. In any case, most of them are only halfbaked. </para>

He likened this country to a toad beneath the harrow when he averred that all we in this country could do was to avoid the spikes. We have never lacked initiative, and I hope that we never shall. I believe that his contention was correct. Although we did not successfully avoid all the spikes, we did relatively well and emerged from the depression earlier than did most other countries. In fact, Australia's recovery was nothing short of remarkable. </para>

As I have already said, nothing is further from the truth. The Government has no quarrel with the 1945 legislation, except that it does not believe in one-man control. I shall review, briefly, the events that preceded that legislation. It was based on an agreement between the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks in 1941. </para>

                        <para>- I assure the Senate that that agreement formed the basis of the 1945 legislation. There was an arrangement between the Commonwealth Bank and the private trading banks prior to the advent of the Curtin administration. During its regime the basic elements of the 1941 agreement were embodied in the national security legislation. That cannot be disputed. I shall not challenge any of the main principles of the 1945 measure, because my political life does not date back very far. </para>

The Commonwealth Bank was also empowered to control the credit policy of this country. </para>

                        <para>- I entirely agree with it. It also added to the Commonwealth Bank the function of controlling the advance policies of the trading banks, with which I agree. By that legislation the Commonwealth Bank was compelled to give effect to the policy of the Treasurer. However, no provision was made for reference to the Parliament of any issue on which the Governor of the bank and the Treasurer of the day could not agree. </para>

                        <para>- Control is far safer in the hands of a board than in the hands of one man. It is imperative that the elected representatives of the people should have the opportunity to review any conflict between the board and the Treasurer. That is very important. The Opposition expressed concern about the constitution of the board. Although honorable senators opposite are apparently perfectly satisfied with the first five of the proposed personnel, they do not accept the Government's assurance that the other five appointees will be men of experience and independence, in no way  connected  with the trading banks of this country. </para>

                        <para>- I merely repeat the assurance that is embodied in the bill. We shall appoint men experienced in the banking business, but not connected with banks. Many suggestions have been made about the identity of the other five appointees. The absurd suggestion has been made that Professor Hytten will be appointed to the board. That is almost laughable. It has also been suggested, either in this chamber or in another place, that the honorable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth)</inline> will be appointed. I point out that adequate safeguards are provided in this measure. The appointees will be free from sectional interests and unassociated  with other banks. The Government assures the Opposition that those men will be chosen in the light of their experience and knowledge. They will be men able to give a balanced judgment in relation to important matters. I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum's</inline> contention that this measure conforms with the recommendations contained in paragraph 575 of the report of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems in relation to board control. This aspect of the matter has been mentioned previously by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer).</inline> With few exceptions, board control has been accepted the world over as the best method of business management. The Commonwealth Bank is a very great institution. The Opposition has not a monopoly in the matter of regard for it. We are just as anxious to strengthen the Commonwealth Bank in every way possible as are honorable senators opposite, and this bill is designed to achieve that end. </para>

                        <para>- I do not deny that the bank has functioned well in the past, but that does not prove that it cannot function better in the future, and we intend that it shall. It can do better only if it is placed under the control of a hoard. Other provisions of the bill are also designed to extend the influence and operations of the Commonwealth Bank. For instance, the bill provides for an extension of the activities of the General Banking Division, the Rural Credits Department, as well as the Mortgage Bank Department, and the Industrial Finance Department. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. The standing order regarding this matter mentions a document. I do not profess to know what rulings have been made on the point, hut I do not think that the standing order relates to a book. Something can he said for the point of view that the standing order refers only to a situation in which an honorable senator quotes from a letter, for instance. In such a case, it would be proper to move that the letter be tabled. I find it difficult to believe that if an honorable senator were quoting from a precious book, the Senate could order him to lay it on the table, so that it would come into the possession of the Senate, and, presumably, might remain there. I am not taking this point in order to try to prevent the tabling of the matter from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> quoted. We shall be glad to provide as many copies as may be required. I merely suggest that the standing order does not properly apply to a book. </para>

I do not know whether it was a book or a paper. Apparently, he quoted from printed matter of some kind.

The honorable senator must have a very short memory, or he is ill-informed. When the bill was first presented to this chamber by courtesy of the Opposition - and I emphasize that it was by courtesy of the Opposition - .we allowed it to be carried straight through to the second-reading stage without delay. If we had wished to delay its passage we could have held up the first reading for a day, and we could have delayed it further when it came to the second-reading stage. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and the existence of such an arrangement refutes the charge that the Opposition has delayed the bill. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> has been in the Senate a little longer he will realize that it is not only the right of every honorable senator to speak on the business that comes before the Senate, but also his duty to do so if he has a contribution to make to the debate. I refute with all the emphasis I can command the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford,</inline> or any other Government supporter, that the Opposition is delaying, or has sought to delay, the bill. </para>

To that claim I give the flattest contradiction, and I do so for three reasons. I quote the following from a print of the joint opposition policy speech delivered by the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> : - </para>

                </quote>
                <para>What did the people understand by the word "independent"? They understood, I am sure, that it referred to men who had no other god to serve but the bank; men who would be able to devote their time wholly to the service of the country, through the bank. There is not one word in the policy speech to indicate that persons outside the Public Service, or the service of the bank, would be imported into the bank in order to sit on the board. I venture to say that if any honorable senator who supports the Government can point to one word that conveys specifically to the people of Australia the idea that outside interests were to be imported into the management of the bank, the Government will have no further cause to complain of efforts by the Opposition to delay the passage of the bill. </para>

In this measure, the Government has re-written a provision that the Labour Government wrote into the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945 providing that the Governor and the Deputy Governor of the bank shall vacate office if they take any other paid employment whatsoever. That' safeguard has been thrown to the winds, and it is now proposed to import into the management of the Commonwealth Bank the champions of the private banks and of private enterprise. </para>

When the question of a Commonwealth Bank Board was under consideration in 1945, the present Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> in his capacity as leader of the Australian Country party, moved an amendment to the Commonwealth Bank Bill that the board should consist of the Governor of the bank, the Secretary to the Treasury, and six other members.

Even the most elementary student of economics knows that the note issue has nothing to do with conditioning inflation or deflation, and that it is a mere indication of a trend in the community under either of those heads. In their second-reading speeches the Attorney-General and the Treasurer have thrown away completely the point to which I have referred. Will any member of the Government deny that? Having committed a schoolboy economic howler, they have reconsidered their policy speech, and discarded it.

Cabinet was not meeting. The decision of the High Court was announced on a Thursday morning and it was reported in the press on Saturday afternoon that the then Prime Minister had decided that the banking structure of this nation was to be nationalized. It was an excellent example of one-man control. The Prime Minister acted without the approval of the party of which he was leader and further that decision was made without first seeking approval of Cabinet. let me review those statements and state the facts. As one who was privy to the decision in all its stages and as one of the few Ministers who was in the confidence of the former Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> before he made his recommendation to Cabinet, let me inform the Senate that the decision was made by Cabinet on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of that time who was also Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>- In exactly that form. The honorable senator can check the newspapers of that time if he wishes to do so. Further, the party met and considered the matter and made a decision on the 16th December, 1947. To illustrate the democratic procedures in the Labour party, I shall explain that as far back as May, 1947, just before the Parliament broke up for the winter recess, the Federal Parliamentary Labour party authorized the Cabinet, in which it had complete confidence, to take whatever steps were necessary following upon the announcement of the High Court's decision which was expected about that time. Instead of acting on that blank cheque, the Cabinet and the Prime Minister followed the democratic procedure that I have outlined, and I say that the statements by the present Attorney-General were wholly false in every particular. There was not one grain of truth in them. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>I do not suggest for one .moment that the Minister made those false statements deliberately. I rather suggest that he had been reading literature of the type that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> has been reading in the Senate to-day. The book that the honorable senator has tabled at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> was signed by himself at the top for identification purposes and is <inline font-style="italic">The Case against Socialist Labour.</inline> It is prepared by the federal secretariat of the Liberal party of Australia. An honorable senator has remarked that there is nothing at all wrong with that. All I can say is that I strongly suspect that the Attorney-General must have been reading literature of that type or he would never have fallen into such error. I invite the Attorney-General to acknowledge his error, either now or at some other more appropriate occasion in the course of this debate, and withdraw the statement that he has made on wholly false information picturing Labour's Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> as a totalitarian dictator. If the Minister accepts my suggestion and withdraws his statement, he will be in excellent company from his own viewpoint, because the Prime Minister has recently had to withdraw publicly statements that he had made which were damaging to the reputation of certain people in this community. </para>
                <para>There were three main reasons why the Labour Government embarked on an attempt to nationalize the banking system of Australia. In the first place, the Labour party believed, as it still believes, that it had the right policy for Australia, and that an institution so vital to the economy and the lives of the people of Australia as is the Commonwealth Bank should not rest in the hands of any private members or organizations, no matter how responsible they might be, but should rest in the National Parliament in the ultimate analysis. That was the first main reason and I do not propose to develop it now. </para>
                <para>The second reason was the attack made by the Melbourne City Council against the 1945 banking legislation. One honorable senator on the Government side of the chamber intimated that only one  setcon  of that act was under attack, and in fact the Leader of the Australian Country party, in the course of his separate policy speech, said, referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley-</inline>  . . his statement was deliberately intended to mislead. The 1945 bank act was challenged but in one pert only. </para>
                <para class="block">I have referred before in this Senate to the statement of claim that was filed in that case. It plainly launched an attack against the whole of the 1945 banking legislation. It attacked section 48 which required municipalities to bank with the people's bank. Let me quote clause 12 of the statement of claim filed by the Melbourne City Council. </para>

That is not the only count on which I rest. If there was any doubt about it, it was resolved when the Solicitor-General of the day wrote to the solicitors of the Melbourne City Council pointing out that the whole act was under challenge and asking on what particular points the attack was to be directed.

                <para>The third reason I give for the attempt at nationalization was the fact that when in 1945 the various private trading banks of Australia were called upon to deposit their surplus investible funds with the Commonwealth Bank pursuant to the Banking Act 1945, they complied certainly, but each one of them wrote a letter protesting against the requirements and reserving all its rights as to the validity of the law which required it to do so. These are the factors that influence the mind of the government of the day, and I say quite frankly that had the 1945 legislation, of which the present Government parties so whole-heartedly approve, except for the substitution of board control for control by the Government, been left  unassailed,  no attempt would have been made to nationalize the banks. The attempt at nationalization bore very good fruit for the Labour party. It did much to focus thought on the need for parliamentary control, the need to establish the Commonwealth Bank as a statutory central bank, the need to control the advances policy of the banks, the need to regulate interest rates, and, above all, the need to confer ultimate authority on the Parliament of the nation through the government of the day. The arguments that developed in this community - and they were fierce - following the attempt at bank nationalization, educated the Australian people, and even educated the Opposition of the day which is now the Government. Honorable senators opposite are to-day giving to the 1945 banking legislation all the blessings in the world, except that they want to substitute board control for control by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, we are very happy. Our only regret is that the present Government parties did not see the light a little earlier and thus save a great deal of litigation with consequent detriment to the lawyers of the country. To show the compete conversion of the Government parties, let me remind the senator of what their leader, the present Prime Minister, said in 1945 when Labour's banking legislation was before the House of Representatives. On the 21st March, 1945, the right honorable gentleman described the whole bill as reactionary and unsound. He approves of it to-day. He also said that it would weaken the central bank; but this Government is leaving the 1945 legislation substantially as it stands. He said that there was a chance that the bill would destroy the currency; yet we find no amendments in this measure on that subject. The then  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> who now, as Commonwealth Treasurer approves of 99^ per cent, of the 1945 legislation, said on the 22nd March, 1945, that the Commonwealth Bank Bill was a revolutionary measure, a sentence of death on the private banks, that it would have an adverse effect on overseas operations, and could only lead to instability and lack of confidence. Those were the statements of the present day leaders of the Government. They simply serve to show how right Labour's banking policy was. Even in the annual speeches with which the general managers and chairmen of directors of the various banks are wont to afflict shareholders, one frequently reads the statement : " Of course, there must be parliamentary control of banking and monetary policy ". The conversion of all classes in this community is now almost complete. The pity is that that canversion did not take place in 1945. </para>

                <para>In the course of this debate there have been several facetious references to lawyers and their ability to make black appear white. Before passing from bank nationalization, I wish to refer to the decision of the Privy Council, and to furnish to the Senate a classic example of black being made white. Section 92 of the Constitution provides that trade, commerce and intercourse between the States shall be absolutely free. Those are very wide terms, and the broad effect of legal decisions, so far as I can assess them, is that whilst trade, commerce and intercourse between the States cannot be prohibited or restricted, they can be regulated. The difficulty of course is to determine at any stage what is prohibition, what is restriction, and what is mere regulation. The Privy Council addressed itself to that matter because the key section of the Bank Nationalization Act 1947, section 47, prohibited the private banks from engaging in banking operations after a certain date. I propose to read a few brief extracts from the Privy Council judgment which I consider to be informative, and I am sure will be interesting to the Senate. Their Lordships said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It is generally recognized that the expression " free " in sec. 92, though emphasised by the accompanying " absolutely ", yet must receive some qualification. It was, indeed, common ground in the present case that the conception of freedom of trade, Commerce and intercourse in a community regu lated by law pre-supposes some degree of restriction upon the individual. As long ago as 1916, in Duncan v. State of Queensland, (1915) 22 C.L.R. 556 at p. 573, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, C.J., said - </para>
                    <para>But the word " free " does not mean extra legem, any more than freedom means anarchy. We boast of being an absolutely free people, but that does not mean that we are not subject to law (22 A.L.R. 473). </para>
                    <para>Andthrough all the subsequent cases" in which sec.92 has been discussed, the problem hasbeen to define the qualification of that which in the Constitution is left unqualified. In this labyrinth there is no golden thread. But it seems that two general propositions may be accepted: (1) that regulation of trade, commerce and intercourse among the States is compatible with its absolute freedom, and (2) that sec. 92 is violated only when a legislative or executive act operates to restrict such trade, commerce and intercourse directly and immediately as distinct from creating some indirect or consequential impediment which may fairly be regarded as remote. In the application of these general propositions, in deter- mining whether an enactment is regulatory or something more, or whether a restriction is direct or only remote or incidental, there cannot fail to be differences of opinion. </para>

                <para>The bill has three main purposes; I am concerned mainly with only one of them. Clause 3 repeals the Banking Act of 1947. As a result of the decisionsof both theHigh Court and the Privy Council, that act has been completely emasculated. Those decisions say most plainly that the nationalization of banking in this country is not possible. We accept them. Therefore we offer no objection to the repeal of an act that is now merely a shell. The second purpose of the bill is to replace control by the Governor with control by &amp; board. I shall deal with that proposal at some length in the time that remains at my disposal. The third purpose of the bill relates to the capital of the bank. I am very interested in that matter, but I do not propose to say anything about it to-night. What I have to say will better be reserved for the committee stage. I merely warn the Minister for Social Services that Ishall be seeking much information on the effect of the various provisions, and the reasons for the changes that they effect. </para>

In the course of the argument that he put forward a week ago the Attorney-General made no reference to the Advisory Council.

                        <para>- That is so, but my point is that in the Advisory Council the Governor of the bank has available to him at all times an expert body that is able to tender the best advice. I accept the Minister's assurance that he did mention the Advisory Council in the course of his remarks, but I record my disappointment that he did not make plain the fact that I have just mentioned. Over the Governor of the bank and the Advisory Council is the Treasurer, who is responsible to his Government, which, in turn, answers to the Parliament, which it ultimately responsible to the people. </para>

                        <para>- Whilst I cannot detect any sound principle underlying the Government's proposal to establish a board, there are two very simple but important principles which underlie our proposal for control of the bank to be vested in a governor assisted by an advisory council. The first of those principles is that only experts should be entrusted with this all-important task. Because of the importance to the national economy of the sound functioning of the Commonwealth Bank, which is second only in importance to the National Parliament, we cannot place in charge of that institution, with all its diverse activities - its rural credits, mortgage bank and industrial finance departments, overseas functions and connexions and function as a central bank - individuals who are amateurs. That is the first principle which Labour applies to this matter. There must be expert control and management-- </para>

                        <para>- I am addressing my requests to the Minister in charge of the bill. The reason why the Government is not prepared to disclose the identity of the probable appointees is completely obvious. It knows that those individuals must be chosen from commercial, agricultural and other sectional interests. One very sinister and significant feature of the Government's proposals is that the five secret appointees will not all be appointed for five years. One of them will retire after the board has functioned for twelve months, and one more after each succeeding twelve months. Let us consider the tenure of membership of Professor Melville and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Roland</inline> Wilson. They will be taken care of by proposed new sub-section (3.), which provides - (3.) A member appointed under paragraph (d) of sub-section (1.) of this section who is an officer of the Bank or of the Public Service of the Commonwealth shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor -General. </para>

                    Wilson and Professor Melville may hold office for only a minute, because their tenure of office will be subject to the whim of the government of the day. It is all very well for this Government to toss us the names of those two gentlemen and

                    Wilson and Professor Melville, and in one minute it can whisk them from the scene and replace them with two more " unknowns ". I put it very strongly to the Senate that there are very sinister reasons underlying the provisions of the proposed new section 23, and I warn the Senate to be on its guard.

                <para>I say firmly that we do not want on the board that will control this great national institution persons whose public duty and private interest may conflict. That is something that should be avoided. Members of the Commonwealth Bank Board will have access to confidential and advance information, supplied by banks throughout the world regarding currency movements. If a member of the board has private interests, he will be subjected to a great temptation to take advantage of such information for his own gain or  the gain of his fellows. That is an aspect of the matter that must not be overlooked. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner),</inline>
                    in his second-reading speech, said the same thing, but he was very careful not to specify the nature of the knowledge and experience. Will they be men with wide knowledge and experience of, for instance, bedstead manufacture, motor-car salesmanship, money lending, and bookmaking?  The Minister did not particularize. If ever a government put itself in a false position, it is this Government, which proposes to appoint a board consisting of ten members, to say to the two top men that if they engage in ally other employment they must vacate their offices, and to say to the other seven members, " You can run loose in industry and make what you like as long as you toddle along now and then and direct this great institution ".

                <para>The Attorney-General claimed that the tabling of papers in both Houses of the Parliament in the event of a dispute would give parliamentary control of the aspect of banking or monetary policy on which the dispute arose. He said, and I agree with him, that if a conflict occurred between the government of the day :nd the bank, it would be on an issue of outstanding interest and of paramount importance. It would be a <inline font-style="italic">cause</inline><inline font-style="italic">celebre.</inline> It would certainly be in relation to an issue that had been considered very fully by the government of the day before the Treasurer committed it to a conflict with the Commonwealth Bank. It is certain that the Government would have consulted its supporters in the Parliament. If the government had a majority in both Houses of the Parliament, does anybody believe for one moment that, if Cabinet had made a decision that resulted in a conflict with the bank, there would be anything but complete support of the government's action by the members of the government parties? It is unthinkable that the decisions would be reversed. If the government had a majority only in the House of Representatives, which is the position that exists to-day, does anybody imagine that it would resign if we were to pass a vote of no confidence in it? We could pass them all day long, and they would bc treated by the government as though they had never been passed. How will the tabling of papers permit any independent or adequate consideration of the position by the Parliament? </para>

                <para>The point that I am about to make will, I hope, expose the sinister effect of the  provisions  of this bill. If the bill is raped in its present form a conflict will l ever como to the surface. Let us consider again the composition of the board. If is to consist of the Governor of the bank, the Deputy Governor, and the  Secretary  to the Department of the Treasury. Let me pause there. The Secretary to the Department of the Treasury will conceive it to be his duty, very properly to put forward at meetings of the board, not his private view, but the view of the  Treasurer  of the day. What is likely to be the action of the five or seven allegedly independent members, with all their private interests ? They will wait to hear what the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury has to say, because they will know that he will express the view of the Treasurer. Being dependent upon the recommendation of the Treasurer for their appointment and continuance in office, they will come in blindly behind the Secretary, not only for that reason, but also for the very good reason that they will know that he is an expert in finance. If a board of the kind proposed in this bill is established, there will be a group of members who will always be in accord with the view of the Treasurer of the day. The Treasurer will, therefore, never be in conflict with the board. Quietly and insidiously, he will ensure that his view is accepted. </para>

                <para>In the course of this debate a great deal has been said about the effects of the depression and the part that the private banks played in it. I do not propose to embark upon that topic beyond making the comment that even the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking systems in Australia reported in 1937 that the effects of the depression could have been mitigated if the banks had adopted a more liberal advances policy. That report is now out of date; it is thirteen years old. I want to point to some very significant effects of the depression upon our economy. They account for the anxiety of the Labour party regarding the possibility of another depression, and the necessity for guarding against a repetition of what occurred between 1929 and 1934. I shall refer to some vital statistics. In the year 1928, just prior to the commencement of the depression, there were 134,000 births in Australia. By 1934, the annual birthrate had decreased to 109,000, and we did not again attain the 1928 level until 1941. Between 1928 and 1934 we lost, in effect, 25,000 children a year, because a depression was in progress. Let me translate that into terms of production. One hundred and twenty-seven thousand children over fifteen years of age went into employment in this country in 1939, that is children born prior to the depression. Ten years later, however, only 102,000 entered Australian industry. The children who should have been born in the depression years are just not there. It will take until 1958 to reach even the 1939 intake of young boys and girls to the industries of this country. I come now to a matter of great significance. When the 1945 legislation was being passed through the Parliament, and, again, when the 1947 banking legislation was being considered, Parliament House was inundated by representatives of the private trading banks. They filled the lobbies and the offices of the then Opposition, which now forms the Government. One encountered them also in the hotels of Canberra. But since the present measure has been before the Parliament I have not seen one bank officer in the lobbies, and I have not heard a word of protest from any representative of a trading bank. </para>

                        <para>- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> has supplied the complete answer. Under this measure there will be no relief for them in connexion with the matters that they have been most concerned about in the past. Although they will still be under governmental control, and will still be bound to deposit their surplus funds with the central bank as hitherto, they are happy because they realize that this measure will provide the way for sectional interests to take charge of this great national institution. Here is in fact sabotage of the Commonwealth Bank, none the better because it is camouflaged and insidious. The Minister has apologized for his boards. I think he should apologize also for this measure, which is designed to enable the Treasurer of the day to escape the political consequences of feeding his ideas into the proposed partisan board. I conclude by stressing that this is the attempted " pay off " to the trading banks of Australia for their political and financial support of the parties that now comprise the Government of this country during the last election campaign. This attempted sabotage of Australia's greatest and most important institution will never come about so long as there is a Labour party to prevent it. </para>

                    <para>. -  In reference to a Privy Council matter dealing with banking, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has said that it should be judged on facts, time, and circumstances. That is the approach that must be made to this measure. It is unfortunate that in the process of discussing the bill the widest possible range of subjects has been entered upon. In their generosity, Government senators have listened to comments about matters far removed from the kernel of the matter before the Senate, in the hope that some light would be thrown upon the proposals that have been advanced by honorable senators opposite. Of course it is realized that honorable senators may address themselves to any matter before the Senate in their own way. I consider that we should adopt a straight line of attack on what is, in essence, a very simple matter. As honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber view this matter, there are two outstanding items. The first is the proposed repeal of the 1947 banking legislation. The second is the constitution of the proposed board. The 1947 legislation was a prelude to Labour's intended nationalization of banking. As honorable senators know, it met a certain fate and is in the process of going out of existence by means of the bill before the Senate. I oppose any form of nationalization, particularly the measure to which I have referred specifically, because I have had a wide experience of the working of government departments. There is a limit to what a government department can do. The Commonwealth Bank can perform a great service to the community. However, if it were to operate purely as a government department, under a governor, it would have all of the characteristics and administrative flavour of a government department, limited in its capacity to the mind of the Government.  We  all know what a great institution the Commonwealth Bank is, and we are all proud of it. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> has stated, a monopoly of pride in connexion with the Commonwealth Bank does not rest with one side of the chamber; it is shared by both sides. From a small beginning the bank grew on its merits. I shall not refer to a lot of extraneous matters. Many of us can recollect its early operations under the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, and later under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Kell. During World War I. the Commonwealth Bank saved the people of this country millions of pounds in connexion with the raising of essential loans. It again performed a similar service to the community during World War II. Obviously honorable senators opposite who oppose this measure object to change. I point out that change in ourselves, our institutions, and the method of controlling instruments of service to the community is inevitable. The Opposition contends that there should be a sound relationship of the Commonwealth Bank to the Parliament. I believe that this measure ensures such a relationship. I listened very intently to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooke,</inline> who, in travelling completely around the compass, succeeded only in complicating what is really a simple issue. Not a thread of continuity was discernible in his address. The taboos and " furphies " that have been introduced by honorable senators opposite have nothing to do with the issue before us. Time and again they have said that the matter was purely political. After all, the whole of the Parliament is political, including everything that is discussed in this chamber and in another place. No arguments have been advanced to show in what particular way that slur against this measure could be justified. Reference has been made to the administration of past governments. During <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford's</inline> address, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> referred, by interjection, to conditions that existed  30  years aero. Surely we should direct our deliberations to the conditions that now exist. </para>

                        <para>- I point out that the proposed board will be very different from the former board. Changes have been made in the light of present-day conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> declared that the private banks exist only for the pursuit of profit.What is wrong with that? Like any other private enterprise, they either make a profit and prosper, or incur a loss and fail. No changes are proposed in relation to the central banking function of the Commonwealth Bank, which has the power to control the profits of the private banks. Ample machinery exists in that connexion, and no suggestion has been made that the existing provisions should be changed. The Opposition has referred to supporters of the Government as guilty men. In my opinion the guilty men are those who have endeavoured to confuse the issue by introducing all sorts of extraneous matters into the debate, instead of confining their remarks to the essence of the measure before us, which is merely the establishment of a bank board. Many of the comments of honorable senators opposite have been irrelevant. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber could well have raised points of order about them. However, we refrained from doing so, in the hope that some useful contribution to the debate would ultimately be made by honorable senators opposite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> has said that complete nationalization could be achieved by retaining one bank only. Even in connexion with such every-day matters as the provision of bread in a community, honorable senators have witnessed the effects of the zoning system, under which one baker supplied all of the bread required in a particular zone. In many instances, although the bread supplied to them was not of good quality, the people concerned had no alternative but to accept it. Applied to banking, would the state of affairs that must accompany the existence of only one bank be any better? </para>

                <para class="block">Department. However, as it is the largest undertaking operated by the Commonwealth there might be a full debate on it at another time. Although in many ways it is an efficient organization I do not consider that it operates as an entirely perfect instrument. I am sure that honorable senators opposite will agree with that contention. The Postal Department is in the fortunate position of being able to raise its charges in order to balance its accounts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> has said that one-man control of the Commonwealth Bank does not now exist. He referred to the relationship between the Governor of the bank, the Treasury, and the Cabinet. As matters stand, the Treasurer of the day can request the Governor of the bank to carry out a certain policy. </para>
                <para>Those who argue that the present system is satisfactory, and that the Treasurer should continue to enjoy the power now vested in him, are inferentially expressing confidence in the present Government, and the present Treasurer. I am amazed at this sudden outburst of confidence in the present Administration. I should like to know how the honorable senator reconciles his position as director of several companies with his opposition to the appointment of a board that would control the Commonwealth Bank. Are we to assume that he really believes that the accepted system of company control is in some way defective, and should be varied? I believe, and I am sure that he also believes, that the method of board control of companies provides an effective mechanism of management for an enterprise in which shareholders are concerned. The Commonwealth Bank has the biggest list of shareholders in Australia; every Australian is a shareholder. Why should we notadopt for the Commonwealth Bank, which has more shareholders than any other concern, the same method of control as has proved itself in other fields? </para>

The Minister for Social Services (SenatorSpooner), whointro- ducedthebill,said that the old bank board,whichwasabolished in 1945. had encountered certain difficulties. Some of  its members, he said, had been too closely associated with the private banks. This bill provides that no member of the new board shall be a director of another bank. There has been much talk about the membership of the proposed board, but I am sure that, when the names are made public, the people will be well pleased. </para>

That money, he said, belonged to the people. T agree, but it came from them, and it had gone back to them. </para>

                        <para>- The private banks pay taxes. If the honorable senator knows any method by which they can avoid doing so, his advice will be much in demand. The Commonwealth Bank discharges an important function as a central hank, and the need for a measure of government control is not disputed. Banking is a necessary and complicated operation which affects every one in the community. Banks render a multiplicity of services, ranging from that which it renders to the man who puts part of his wages into a savings bank, to that which it renders to the merchant who buys and sells goods through the facilities provided by his bank. The banks  serve  and touch everybody in the community. </para>

                        <para>- It would be very dangerous to place so complicated and so important a service in the hands of one man. He would need the knowledge of all the gods of Olympus, and the wisdom of all the savants of all the ages to discharge his duties properly. For such a task we need a composite mind, and that can be provided only by a board. When the Commonwealth Bank is under the control of one man, it is controlled in the same way as is a government  department.  We know that, with the growth of governmental activities, serious dis advantages are associated with the system of one-man control of government departments. Indeed, many of the questions asked in this Senate are directed towards this very problem. Those who suggest that the Commonwealth Bank should be under the control of one man, and treated as just another government department, fail to realize its broad and essential functions. </para>

                <para>Clause 4 of the bill abolishes the present Advisory Council. There is no doubt that the members of the council are men of high calibre and specialized experience, but they are not permanent. They come and go. Some of them may occupy the position for only a few weeks before they are. replaced by others. Moreover, theessential weakness of the system is that I hey have no executive authority; they merely advise the Governor, who may consult one or two or more of them, then balance one opinion against the other, and form his own judgment, so that the existence of the Advisory Council does not modify the principle of one-man control. 1 hose who argue that it is better to have an advisory council than a board ignore the principle that where advice is offered there should be responsibility. Under the present system the Advisory Council has no responsibility. </para>
                <para>Clause 7 of the bill, which proposes to repeal section 9 of the act and substitute another in its stead, gives the board great freedom of action, so that it will not be hampered or subjected to direction in the formulation of policy. It also provides that, in the case of a dispute between the board and the Treasurer, the dispute shall be brought before the elected representatives of the people in the Parliament. Moreover, the new section contains the important provision - which has not previously been commented upon, so far as I know - that the dispute shall be brought before the Parliament in a memorandum prepared, not by the Treasurer, but by the board. Once the matter is before the Parliament, the Treasurer may, of course, put his case, if he believes that the policy proposed by the board is contrary to the policy upon which the Government was elected. Honorable senators opposite may  argu  e that, by the time the dispute came before the Parliament the whole question would have been already decided, and finally dealt with. That is not so. When the dispute comes before the Parliament it will be publicly debated, and freely reported in the press. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> said that if the Government of the day had a majority in both Houses nothing much would be achieved by bringing a dispute before the Parliament because the will of the Government would prevail. Surely the honorable senator must know that over and over again governments have reversed their policy, and amended or abandoned legislation, because of comments and criticism in the press. If the dispute were over a matter of importance - and only in such a case would it be pressed to the point of referring it to the Parliament - it would be. certain to receive wide publicity. </para>

                    said that the Secretary to the Treasury, who will be a member of the Commonwealth Bank Board, would have to do whatever the Treasurer told him. It is within my own knowledge that a former Treasurer once declared that when he wished to do a certain thing, the Treasury officials did not agree with him, and had offered other advice.

                    has implied that every departmental head is subject to political direction and would have to do what he was told or he would lose his job. He should know that public servants are protected by law, and that the political heads of their . departments cannot dispose of them at will. They are protected by the Public Service Board. The public servant has the right of appeal and is well protected. The political head of a department cannot dispose of his officers in the way that honorable senators on the Opposition side suggest. It is easy to use such arguments loosely, but they do not apply. I know a great deal about government departments because I have had more than five years' experience in several of them.

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> wanted to know what the bank had done that made it necessary for a board to be established. The need for a close contact between the Government and the operations of the bank is so vital that the technique of management and administration of 1950 is required and not the principles that applied in 1911 which are sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson.</inline> It is ridiculous to suggest that there is any sound objection to a board of ten. Would honorable senators reduce the number to eight if they consider that ten are too many? To reduce the board by two would be a mere quibble. In my opinion a board of ten is small for such a vital institution with the largest shareholding in Australia. I would like to see it bigger. The strange thing about the arguments on this bill is that although objection was taken to 'a board of ten on the ground that it was a big board, honorable senators on the opposite side had no objection to a Cabinet of eighteen being, as they say, the board. I take it, therefore, that their objection to the board of ten is only technical and that really they are not going to quibble about two members. After all the Governor has still considerable powers under this bill. A vote of five to five with a casting vote by the  chairman  is quite typical of similar boards. </para>
                <para>All big enterprises have boards, each with a managing director. In this case the Governor of the bank is equivalent to a managing director. All companies limit the powers of their governor or managing director. The power of the Governor of the bank is limited in that the board has control. I am amazed at the strenuous objection of the Labour party to the board system. I invite honorable senators to consider the organization of the unions of this country. I am a strong believer in trade unions and belong to two of them myself. Does the secretary or the  president  run a union? No fear ! In New South Wales, the unions have a  president  or a secretary and a management committee and they have a certain interlocking, but in case there is any misdemeanour by the secretary, the union organization have a trades and labour council which might be termed a board- </para>

If honorable senators opposite return me the courtesy that I extend to them, I shall he pleased with that reciprocity. If they do not extend that courtesy, I name them as discourteous.

It is a very necessary organization and I am not criticizing it, hut in the operation of unionism which honorable senators opposite espouse and which I support, the unions have the equivalent of a board system. There one reaches a level similar to that of a bank board. I do not know whether the honorable senators on the other side would accept one-man control of all the unions of this country. </para>

                        <para>- There is a close analogy. The services supplied by the bank and by unions of this country are essential. I do not think that any reasonable person could object to a bank board for the national task that it has to do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> in dealing with the matter before the chamber referred to the second-reading speech of the Minister and he picked out a paragraph which he said meant violent and sudden changes in the operation of the bank. The fact is that it is not a violent change, and the mode of election of the board and the change of the personnel provide for a continuity that will avoid violent change. If the whole of the board went out concurrently, then it is conceivable that there could be a complete change in the board either by the government in office or the succeeding government, but the provision for one member to retire each year is a sound one and should allow reasonable continuity of policy. That is a method used by many authorities throughout the world. Local government authorities, particularly in Great Britain, adopt the principle for that purpose. </para>

                <para>To say that there is no need for change merely because the Minister has said that there is a considerable measure of harmony and co-operation at present between the banks generally and the Commonwealth Bank carries no weight at all.

                    <para>To some extent its difficulties arose from the fact that the Governor of the bank was not chairman of the board. This tended to divide responsibility. </para>

                <para class="block">In the present bill, the method to be established does not separate the Governor from the board. He is to be the  chairman  of the board and that is correct. </para>
                <para>As one who may be called an expert in certain fields of service, I was interested in the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> that it was necessary to have experts governing these matters and that experts must come from within the government service. The essential thing is that appropriate men shall be obtained from within the government service as proposed in the bill and that in addition there shall be outside men -to create a balance. Government by experts is always dangerous government. The experts should always be balanced by laymen so that what I shall term the mind of the average fellow is expressed. If honorable senators do not subscribe to that view, all the members of the Parliament should retire because this is a law-making assembly. Honorable senators are making laws for the lawyers. "Would they like the lawyers to make the laws for them? With all respect to honorable senators on both sides of the chamber, it would be an unhappy state divorced from reality if that were the position. Experts are frequently divorced from reality. Therefore to suggest that only experts should be placed on this bank board denies a principle in which all should share, that there must be a balance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> spoke of the members who are to be elected to the board. There is no suggestion of mystery because five have not been named. The rotation proposed is a great advantage, but honorable senators opposite claim that this i9 only a sinister move. It is amazing how a straightforward and simple proposition can be invested with an aura of mystery. That seems to be the particular forte of honorable senators on the other side. They have said that anybody occupying a government position would hold it only at the pleasure of the Government. The normal practice in the Public Service of the Commonwealth and of the States has been followed. Officers hold their positions at the pleasure of the Governor-General in Council. I agree that we should take advantage of the services of experienced officials of the Public Service but the opinion that, once appointed to the Commonwealth Bank Board, a man should sever all other connexions cannot be supported. For instance, the specialists from the Public Service would soon cease to be specialists, because they would lose their contact with governmental operations. They would cease to have any value on the board as representatives of complex governmental machinery as against purely banking machinery. The proposal to appoint the three men named in the bill, and the other two that have been named in the Minister's secondreading speech is most practical. . </para>
                <para>References to the past have predominated in this debate ; but let us look forward. Judging by the remarks of honorable senators opposite, they hope soon to be back on the treasury bench. If their hopes are realized, they will be able to make whatever changes they believe should be made in this legislation. In other words the administration of the Commonwealth Bank proposed in this legislation will not be inflexible or unchangeable. The need for change according to circumstances is recognized in this measure. Honorable senators opposite have wasted many words telling the Senate that appointees to the Commonwealth Bank Board will be men who have or have had some political affinity with the present Government parties. That charge is most amusing when one remembers that the Labour Government appointed as conciliation commissioners, charged with the duty of deciding industrial issues, men who had been closely associated with the Labour movement. </para>

                        <para>- I was referring to most of the appointees. I have no doubt that honorable senators opposite could name an odd one who was not in the category that J have mentioned. The issues now before the Senate are clear. The bill proposes to remove from the statute-book the Banking Act 1947, and to re-introduce for the Commonwealth Bank the best type of administrative control and policy direction that it is possible to have. I believe that the bank board will serve the peo de of this coun try, through the bank, in a most effective way. The specialists on the board will be balanced bv representatives of the outside community, who will cont:n"e their normal activities just as the Public Service members will continue theirs. The proposal must commend itself to any one who looks honestly at the problem of controlling this great bank of which we are all so proud. If honorable senators genuinely desire to see an efficient and capable organization, competent to deal with the problems with which it will be confronted, they must support the bill in its entirety. </para>

                    (Western Australia) [10.201. - I take this opportunity to say how disappointed I am as a Western Australian at the Government's failure to include a representative of that State in the Cabinet. For the first time since 1904, Western Australia is without representation in the Cabinet. Lest I be charged with infringing; standing orders, I point out that my authority for linking this subject with banking is contained in the report of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems. I propose  to quote from that report, not the words of a Labour man, but the words of a former Australian Country party member of the House of Representative,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline>
                    P. Abbott. In his reservation to the commission's report,

                    <para>While I am generally in agreement with the recommendation that the limitation on the field of choice of directors of the Commonwealth Bank Board should be removed, I feel that the Government should appoint one director who is resident in the State of Western Australia. After listening to the evidence given in Perth I have come to the conclusion that the problems of that State are in many respects different from those in the Eastern States. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">No State in the Commonwealth suffered more in the depression years than did Western Australia. The inclusion in the present Cabinet of such substantial representation of New South Wales and Victoria, to the total exclusion of Western Australia, is to be deplored, and, as I have said, is unprecedented. Surely amongst the Western Australian members of this Parliament there are men whose experience, perhaps in the State Parliament of Western Australia, has fitted them for Cabinet rank in this Government. </para>

It is of no use for honorable senators opposite to say that we should not go back into the past. My mind involuntarily goes back to World War I., when the private trading banks made huge profits, because they were not subjected to any limitation or control. Those who borrowed money from then) on mortgages were even invited to borrow more money on further mortgages so that the banks could make more money. I Jo not think that that statement can be denied. Then during the depression, despite all the statements that have been made that the banks did not have anything to do with the depression, it must be obvious to any one that they did not assist the country to overcome its difficulties. Mention has been made of the part played by the Scullin Administration during the depression, and I shall quote  from a book written in 1933 by Leslie Jauncey, Ph.D., in which he stated - </para>

However, the  point is that, whilst we know whom the previous governments appointed to control the Commonwealth Bank, we do not know whom the present Government proposes to appoint.

                <para class="block">In that statement, the Minister complimented the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and the Advisory Council, and conceded that they had achieved remarkable success and had even obtained the co-operation of the trading banks. Yet it proposes to establish a board that will take away the power of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. Because of the occurrence of the recent war, the government of the day was able to override the former Commonwealth Bank Board on various matters, and it compelled the associated trading banks to do certain things. It told the private banks that a limitation would be placed on the profits that they made, and that all profits in excess of certain sums had to be placed in a special account with the Commonwealth Bank. As a member of the Government which imposed that restriction I have a very real appreciation of the reasons why it did so. Before the war our economy was still somewhat depressed and there were 300,000 people unemployed. The Curtin Administration realized that a lot of money would be circulated amongst the community because of the war, and in order to prevent inflation it determined to prevent the trading banks from amassing excessive profits that would be reinvested immediately. That decision was unpalatable to the banks, and because of the attitude that they adopted it became necessary for Labour to introduce the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945. The present Government has now seized the opportunity to introduce this bill in order to defeat that legislation. The real point is that during the recent election campaign the banking legislation of 1945 was not placed in the forefront of the antiLabour parties' campaign. Although the Banking Act 1947 had been declared invalid some months before the election, the anti-Labour parties made it the spearhead of their attack on Labour during the campaign. I know that in the State ofWestern Australia which I represent many bank employees went around among the people telling them that if Labour were returned to office they would be deprived of their employment in the trading banks. I heard the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher,</inline> who said that people who had approached the Commonwealth Bank for financial accommodation were refused such accommodation by that institution and had had to go to a trading bank to obtain assistance. That is the sort of propaganda that was circulated by bank officers during the recent election campaign. </para>
                <para>It is significant that a man's views will change according to the fluctuation of his personal fortunes, and I propose now to read to the Senate the views expressed in 1935 by the present Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> when he was merely a supporter of a previous anti-Labour administration. In fairness to the honorable gentleman I admit that he did not speak on the present bill when it was being debated in the House of Representatives, but since he is a member of the Government he must be taken to approve of the measure.

                    <para>I do not advocate the institution of an inquiry that might be used asthe basis of an attack on the banking institutions, nor doI wish to loose a tirade against the monetary and banking systems that obtain to-day. There is, however, a doubt inthe minds of an overwhelming majority of the electors of this country as to whether our banking and monetary systems have kept pace with our social evolution and industrial progress. It is necessary that an inquiry should be conducted by the very best brains available, by people who are uninfluenced by any pre-conceivod desire to nationalize everything, but yet are free from any undue reluctance to interfere with institutions which have demonstrated their ability to influence government policy, and to direct the whole course of our economic life. There is not one of us who is notaghast at a condition of affairs, in which production, increased beyond the dreams of our forefathers, exists side by side with dire want many of our people, even the verypeople who are producing in such abundance, areill-fed and ill-clad. Faced with this progressive efficiency of production, our firstthought turns to a reduction of working hours. But as that wouldhave such an adverse effect onthecosts of production of ourexporting industries we arc forced todismiss it as an immediate solution of our problems.Itiswrong thatmaximumefficiency of production should coincide with minimum purchasing power of our people. Any economic system which prevents us from achieving the greatest measure of industrial progress is detrimental to our social welfare. Many trained thinkers claim that our banking system, as it exists to-day, is either wholly or partlyresponsible forour present condition. Some believe that the system is fundamentally wrong, while others maintain that it has merelylagged behind ourindustrialprogress. </para>
                    <para>If  it is wrong, the sooner we establish theright system, orimprove theexisting one. the better for us all.  If,  however, itis proved that the existing banking and financialsystem is not in any respect responsible for theprevailing widespread want and unemployment, that fact, should be established, so thatwe may relieve our banking institutions from the suspicion under whichthey now rest in the mind of so many people. We want to achieve the very best system possible, and as any banking system must depend for its efficiency on that intangible quantity,public confidence, the sooner thedoubts ofthepeople aresetat rest the better. This problem cannot he solved by a decision ofpoliticians; it must be investigated by. trained experts in whom every  one  hasconfidence, and thenwe mustaccepttheir recommendations.

                <para>Isuggestthat we shouldinvestigate the question whether our national bank is acting on sufficiently competitive lines. I direct attention to thefirst Commonwealth Bank Act, passed in 1911,which sets out the purposes to be served by the nation's bank. The intention of the Parliament that foundedthat institution was that itshould carry on the general business of banking; and no later Parliament has expressed a contrary intention. Thepolicy of the bankboard, however, either with orwithout the concurrence of theGovern ment. has been to refrain from full and normal competition with thetrading banks. </para>

This is the first occasion on which I have made use of it in the Parliament, and I wish to make it clear, as I did to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> that I did not receive it from the censorship authorities. I deplore the fact that some members of the associated banks attributed dishonest motives to the Public Service of this country. The memorandum is dated the 5th November, 1941. I do not intend to read all of it. I shall content myself with quoting extracts from it. The first is as follows: - </para>

                    <para>With all this in mind, I had come to the conclusion that something definite must be done bythe Banks, but I was forestalled at a recent meeting of the Banks by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McConnan</inline> (National Bank) making thesame proposition.  His  idea is that something in the nature of an expanded"Sound Finance League " witha properly equippedstaff including a competent publicist and an economist of note should be heavily subsidized by the </para>

This body would publish articles and broadcast them <inline font-style="italic">through the Press</inline> everywhere, by radio, etc. It would enter into any controversy - newspaper or otherwise, and by extensive propaganda, endeavour to educate public opinion on sound lines. The idea is that it should be purely in the national interests - our selfish interest ls interlocked with this </para>

                        (Australasia) was opposed to the idea, and stated that our strength had always lain in our silence. This was obviously absurd, as our silence has been taken by many to be guilt or an absence of facts and arguments to rebut the allegations levelled against the Trading Banks, and such incursions into newspaper controversy as has been made by various General Managers has done more harm than good. Our silence otherwise has merely enabled the radical thinkers and politicians to do what they liked with us. We have been inert, and in a sense deserve what we have got, but even ut this late stage much can be done.

                    <para>The cost may be £20/£30,000 a year or even more, but spread among the Banks this is nothing if it means our survival as independent Trading Banks and the education of the electors on lines which we think are right.

                    <para>The organization necessary to parry out the scheme would need to be carefully designed. Directional publicity officers, journalists, lecturers, radio experts, and accomplished exponents of banking, all would find their place, in part or wholly, in such a scheme. </para>
                    <para>The cost would be virtually the price nt advertising, justified, not only in the interest nf the community, but also is preserving and increasing the business of the banks. </para>
                    <para>Above all, such a scheme skilfully carried out would build up a solid* spirit of public relationship few governments would venture to destroy. " The prestige of the King rests upon one or both of two things - the Sovereign right of power and the hearts of the people." The Future of the banks depends on one or both of two things - the good favour of government and the confidence of the people. Failing the former it must cultivate the latter. </para>
