            <para>His EXCELLENCY was pleased to deliver the following Speech: - </para>
            <para>Gentlemen of the Senate, and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives : </para>
            <para>You have been called together to consider matters of importance to the welfare of the people and the development of the Commonwealth. </para>
            <para>I welcome this opportunity of congratulating you upon the continued prosperity and progress of the country. It gives me great satisfaction to note that Australia is attracting increasing interest and recognition within the Empire and amongst the nations of the world. &#34;Within the next few weeks a fleet of the Navy of the United States of America will pay a second visit of peace to these shores, and will receive at the hands of the Government and people of Australia a welcome commensurate with the ties of&#39; common interest and mutual esteem&#39; which unite our peoples. </para>
            <para>The revenue in the financial year now closing has exceeded the estimate. This,&#39; combined with careful administration in&#39; expenditure, will result in a substantial surplus. The embargo on the export of gold from Australia has been withdrawn.&#39; This course was adopted simultaneously&#39; with action in Great Britain, and has already beneficially affected the trade of the Commonwealth by stabilizing the exchanges. War loans amounting to &#163;68,000,000 fall due in December of this year. Measures are being taken to ensure that the obligation will be met with the least possible disturbance to the country&#39;s finances. </para>

            <para>In connexion with the.

            <para>Recognizing the importance of civil aviation in. the country districts, my advisers have taken steps to extend the existing services.. </para>
            <para>The report of the. royal commission appointed to advise upon the method of assessing war pensions has been, issued: You were doubtless pleased to observe that the findings .of the commission were favorable regarding the provisions of the act and its administration. In continuation of the Government&#39;s policy, repatriation benefits have been further increased. </para>
            <para>Consideration has been given to the problem of the more effective occupation of the northern parts of the Commonwealth, and the full development of their latent resources, having in view the ultimate establishment of a new state or states in North Australia on a self-governing basis: It is proposed to&#39; submit a measure for the appointment of a North Australia Commission. The measure will be framed to permit of full, cooperation on the part of adjoining states. </para>
            <para>My advisers are pleased to report considerable advancement in connexion with schemes for national and. developmental railways. </para>
            <para>The permanent survey of the proposed extension of the Northern Territory railway to Daly Waters has been completed, and the construction of the large bridge over the Katherine River is- well advanced. &#39; </para>
            <para>An agreement&#39; subject to the ratification of the Commonwealth and the South Australian Parliaments has been arrived at with the South Australian Government. By- this- agreement, the Commonwealth undertakes to build a. railway northward to- Alice Springs, the- route to be- at the option of the Commonwealth. The collection of &#34; the necessary data with regard to the alternative routes is approaching completion. Proposals will be submitted&#39; to you as soon as my advisers are satisfied as to the better route. </para>
            <para>Action has been taken towards the carrying out of the scheme for the provision of a uniform railway gauge by the commencement in both states of the construction of the Grafton-Kyogle-Brisbane railway.

Reports received from the Commission as to the results of the recent floods indicate that the programme may need alteration. An estimate of the minimum staff necessary to enable the central administration of the various departments to function at &#39; Canberra on a permanent basis has also been -prepared, and the Commission &#39;has advised on the accommodation that will be required. These reports and proposals will be referred to the Public Works Committee. </para>

            <para>My Ministers have -given consideration to the heavy annual loss in production caused by the rabbit and dingo . pests. To enable landholders to obtain money on easy terms to erect . vermin-proof fencing, a scheme for loans&#39; to the states will be submitted to you. </para>

            <para>My Ministers have given careful consideration to the operation and effect of the existing tariff upon primary and secondary industries, and to the investigations which have &#39; also been made by the Tariff Board.

            <para>The Export Control Boards for dairy produce and dried fruits have been constituted under the provisions of the legislation of last session.

            <para>My advisers have given earnest consideration to the Draft Protocol drawn up at the Fifth Assembly of the League of Nations, and submitted to the members of the League. Whilst anxious to extend as far as practicable the principle of the pacific settlement of disputes, they are of opinion that the acceptance of the Protocol would have accentuated existing obligations without achieving the objects, aimed at. My advisers decided not to recommend the Protocol to Parliament for approval. The Governments of Great Britain and of other self-governing parts of the Empire have also determined not to ratify the Protocol. </para>
            <para>My Ministers, after consultation with the Governments of the states, have made a new migration agreement with the Government of Great Britain. Under this the British Government and the Government of the Commonwealth are making generous interest concessions on moneys advanced to the states for projects  calculated to promote development, encourage the establishment of new industries, and stimulate land settlement.

            <para>The royal commission appointed to inquire into and report upon public health and the operation of the laws of the Commonwealth and States in regard thereto is still pursuing its investigations. As soon as possible after the report of tha commission has been received. my advisers will submit proposals to you for more effectively safeguarding the health of the people. </para>
            <para>My Ministers will, among other measures, submit bills dealing with life insurance companies, power alcohol bounties, nationality, lands acquisition, and patents. A number of bills amending existing legislation, including the Land and Income Tax Assessment Acts, will also be introduced. </para>
            <para>My term of office as Governor-General of the Commonwealth will expire at the beginning of October next, and I take this opportunity of expressing my deep . regret at the severance of ties which have bound me in close affection to this country and its people, and my thanks to the past and present members of the legislature for their uniform courtesy consideration, and assistance. </para>
            <para>As the representative of His Majesty; I have observed with the greatest satisfaction the spirit of steadfast loyalty to the Throne and Empire which is a distinguishing characteristic of the people of Australia. Its future prosperity, and the welfare and happiness of its people, will ever be matters of deep concern to me, and I shall share your pride in its future achievements. </para>
            <para>In the earnest hope that Divine Providence may guide your deliberations,, and further the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth, I now leave you to the discharge of your high and important duties. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am sure honorable senators will agree with me that it is quite proper that the Commonwealth should publicly express, through this Parliament, its sympathy with the people of New Zealand in the death of their late Prime Minister. He died, as honorable senators are aware, on the evening of the 10th May, leaving behind him a fine record of public service. He was leader of the Opposition in the Dominion Parliament from 1903 to 1912, and was Prime Minister from the 10th July, 1912, up till his death. I may be permitted to .sketch briefly some of the principal events in his great career. He attended a number of Imperial Conferences and War Cabinets during the years 1916, 1917, 1918, and onwards, and received the freedom of London and other cities in Great Britain and Ireland&#39; as a tribute for services which he had rendered to the Empire. In 1915 he formed the National Government in New Zealand for the more vigorous prosecution of the war, and at its close he attended the Peace Conference at Versailles and signed the Treaty of Peace on behalf of New Zealand. He attended the Imperial Conference in 1923. At his death, in addition to the position of Prime Minister, he held the portfolio of Minister of Finance. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey</inline> led a strenuous public life. Shortly after his taking office in 1913 came the world crisis of 1914, and in the subsequent years of the war his great courage, loyalty, and statesmanship placed him in the first rank of overseas statesmen. We know how, under his leadership, New Zealand entered wholeheartedly upon its duty in the Great War.  His  message to the Mother Country on behalf of New Zealand has become memorable - </para>

                    <para class="block">The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey</inline> took a firm stand when -the interests of the Dominion demanded it. Prom his refusal to allow the New Zealand troops to sail without adequate protection, right through to the scene at Versailles, where he affixed his signature as Prime Minister to the first Treaty of Peace to which a Dominion was a party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Massey</inline> played his part as the representative of a people who were paying the price, and were, therefore, entitled to be heard.  His  attitude was the same when dealing with the British Government on matters affecting the economic position of the Dominion. The appearance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey</inline> at the various Imperial and War Conferences was welcomed by the British Government. &#34; A robust Imperialist of the practical type,&#34; the London <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> called <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey,</inline> and added, &#34; He has played at the Peace Conference the role which every one expected from so staunch a patriot. We do not remember a single occasion on which the head of the National Government of New Zealand has failed to speak worthily on behalf of the splendid Dominion which sent to Europe over 100,000 gallant soldiers, whose war record is surpassed by none.&#34; These .&#39;are neat and well-merited commendations from a great newspaper. Solidity, staunchness, straightforwardness, and honesty recommended <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey-</inline> to the people of the British Empire, and through him the Dominion was represented by the characteristics which appeal strongly, to the British race. He was the real and effective leader of the Dominion during the dark years when New Zealand and the Empire most wanted an example of tenacity and staunchness, and, irrespective of party, his services in that respect have been wholeheartedly acknowledged in the Dominion, and his loss deplored. He was a firm believer in co-operation between New Zealand and the Commonwealth in all matters of common concern. During his term  as Prime Minister, .several commercial agreements were concluded . between New Zealand and .Australia, thus encouraging the spirit of co-operation between the two countries. New Zealand, and the Empire generally, have lost a great dominion leader, and a robust, unequivocal patriot. Because we in Australia were in close touch with -our sister Dominion, we realize what .a .great loss his death is to her people, and I ask the </para>

                    <para class="block">There is in the minds of all of us in connexion with this motion a deep sense of personal loss, but before dealing with that I should like to place on record the services which the late senator rendered to Australia in his capacity as &#39;a member of this Chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> who died at Sydney on the 14th October, 1924, was elected, as a representative of New South Wales in the Senate, at the general elections . in 1910, and again in 1914. He was Temporary  Chairman  of Committees in 1913,  Chairman  of the Select Committee on the Fitzroy Dock in 1913, a member of the Select Committee on the Mount Balfour (Tasmania) Post Office in 1915, and a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts from September, 1917, to October, 1919. At the general elections in 1919 he was defeated, but was again elected to the Senate for New South Wales at the general election in 1922, taking the place of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Garling,</inline> who had been chosen by the Parliament of New South Wales to fill a vacancy in December, 1921. He was a member of the Select Committee that was appointed to inquire into the case of Warrant Officer Allen in 1923, a member of the Royal Commission on National Insurance in 1923-24, Temporary  Chairman  of Committees in 1923- 24, and a member of the Select Committee which inquired into the case of J. P. Dunk in 1924. But whilst the late honorable senator undoubtedly had a great record of public service, I think all the older members of the Senate feel his loss the more because of the close personal touch we had with him. He was a likeable man - a manly man - with a high sense of public duty. As the records of the Senate show, even in the last year of his life, when already premonitions of coming dissolution were making themselves apparent to all who knew him intimately, he remained steadily at his post.  His  sense of duty was such that he continued to make the long journey to and from Sydney every week in order to attend in his place in the Senate, notwithstanding that his health was endangered thereby. We know that one of the contributory causes of his death was the fact that he felt impelled, despite his ill health, to &#39; carry out at the last Eight Hours Demonstration in Sydney, certain duties which, on account of his long association with trade unionism, he regarded as being among the most, if not the most, important he was called upon to discharge. I am confident from what I have heard that his response to the call of duty on that occasion hastened his death. He was an upright, conscientious man, whom every one could respect, no matter how widely divergent their political views might be, and he found a place in the affections of all honorable senators in a way that few of us are able to do. We deplore his death, and we extend to his widow and family our heartfelt sympathy. If those qualities that made him so much a friend to all of us have caused us a deep sense of loss, how much greater must be the loss felt by his widow and family. It is with a sense of personal sorrow that I submit the motion, and at the same time bear testimony to the great public service rendered by this sterling man. </para>

                        <para>.- The time that has elapsed since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> passed over enables one to speak of him without that deep emotion that would have affected one in &#39; doing so immediately after his death. I desire to associate myself with all that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has said. I was, perhaps, more closely associated with the late honorable senator than any other - member of this chamber. I was returned with him to the Senate in 1910, and on all occasions found him to be as the Minister has said - perhaps one of the most conscientious men that ever sat in this chamber. He always took .his parliamentary life seriously, and would suffer nothing to come between him and the discharge of every duty he was called upon to perform. When he left his place as  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in order to act as a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees, as he often did, he pushed on with the business before us in a way that showed that he realized that it was required of him as Acting  Chairman  to see that the work of the Senate was transacted with expedition. Returning to his duties as  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition he was equally earnest and thorough in his work. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said, he was a likeable man. He was, indeed, a lovable man. He had all those natural qualities that manly men admire. He was straightforward, and outspoken. As a politician he was, in reality, a product of the Sydney Trades Hall.  His  political education, I may say, was . gained there. He loved his union, and his union loved and respected him. He was looking forward for weeks to the last Eight Hours&#39; Demonstration in Sydney, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred, for it marked the fiftieth year in which he had participated in that function. From his youth he never missed the Eight Hours&#39; celebrations in Sydney, and he had marched in the procession each year until he was 68 years nf age. For weeks he had been counting the days that would elapse before ho would be able to say that every year for half a century he had joined in these celebrations with the men in whose struggles for improved working conditions he had participated. In our party fighting we often, perhaps, misunderstand one another; hut no one closely acquainted with the late honorable senator for any length of time could misunderstand him., There was nothing hidden in his nature.  His  was an open, manly character. He believed that the conditions of the workers could he made better than they were, and every ounce of his energy and all his abilities were de-  voted to that end. By his death the Senate has lost a most able and conscientious member, and Australia a worthy son, while the widow has lost a husband, and the family a father of whom they were justly proud. I join with the Minister for Home and Territories in the expression of our sympathy which is to be conveyed to the widow and family. We have lost a warm-hearted friend. </para>

It was with profound regret that we learned that his great, public services were ended, and they were ended, probably, all too early by reason of his devotion to duty. . I mourn the loss of a dear and valued friend, and hope that his widow and family will be comforted by the knowledge that they have the profound sympathy of every member of the Senate. </para>

                <para>It is unique in the history of &#39;the Senate that an honorable senator, chosen by the Parliament of his state, should die, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator John</inline> Maurice Bower did, before having an opportunity to take his seat in this chamber. Because of this, many of us did not become personally acquainted with the honorable senator. I myself do . not remember ever meeting him, and am not in . a position to speak of his public service; but the fact that he was chosen by the Parliament of New South Wales to represent that . state in tha Senate, is an indication of the respect in which he must have been held there. It is extremely regrettable that a man placed in such a high position should thus . early have been stricken . by the hand of . death, . and we . sympathize with his widow and family in their bereavament. </para>

                    <para>. -  In associating myself with the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I should like to say that the &#39;late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Power</inline> was one of the brilliant. young men of the Labour . movement.  His  outstanding ability marked him out for . appointment to the Legislative Council in New South &#39;Wales, &#39;in which chamber he held his seat ably and well for some years, and on the death . of Senator McDougall- he was selected : by : both &#39;HousesofParliament in New South Wales to fill the vacancy in the Senate.He was a young man of enthusiasm, energy, and marked ability. TheSenate suffered a distinct loss when he . passed away before having an opportunity to display his outstanding ability in this wider sphere of politics. &#34;I sincerely regret &#39;his early death, and join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in expressing sympathy for the widow and family. As &#39;the &#39;right honorable senator&#39; has said, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Power</inline> was not known personally to many &#39;honorable senators, but those of us who did know him can freely say that he was one of thoseself-sacrrficing men who, &#39;un- . mindful of their own physical well-being, devote all their energies to -the service of their country, striving ever to better the  conditions of their &#39;fellows. </para>
