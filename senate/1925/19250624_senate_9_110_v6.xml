          <para>. - This is not the first intimation I  have  had of the fact that the Government has decided to regard as a censure motion an amendment moved on a Supply Bill in another place, quite irrespective of what the result may  be;  but I think the Senate will not do justice to itself, or to those who send us here, if it adjourns as suggested. There are many matters that could very easily be discussed with advantage by this chamber at the present time. Therefore, I protest against the proposal to adjourn for the reason given. </para>
