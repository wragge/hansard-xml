                    <para>. - When progress was reported last evening I was replying to the objection raised by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that my amendment would limit the choice of membership of the proposed provisional council to people resident in the Northern Territory. I stated that, on the contrary, the choice could be from the whole of the people of Australia, and I emphasized that in any democratic community there should not be. a departure from the elective system. My amendment provides for a provisional council, partly elected and partly nominated. Administrative control will still be in the hands of the Government of the day. The Minister also urged that the amendment would raise the old question of taxation without representation. I do not agree with him. I hope that the committee will give careful consideration to the proposal which I have submitted. </para>

                    <para>. - I did not speak at any length on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> amendment last evening, because I had already dealt with his proposal when replying to the debate on the second reading, and did not wish to be guilty of what might be regarded as tedious repetition. I hope the honorable senator will not think I was discourteous to him. I cannot accept his amendment. In my opinion, it is quite unreasonable at this stage in the development of the Northern Territory. Let us look at the facts as they are. The budget which has just been presented indicates that the people of the Commonwealth, not the residents of the Northern Territory, are responsible for expenditure incurred in administering the Territory. I suppose there are about 2,000 adults there, as compared with nearly 4,000,000 adults in the whole of Australia. The budget figures show that the total amount of taxation contributed by the people of the Territory is about &#163;25,000, but the deficit in connexion with Northern Territory administration is well over &#163;200,000, which sum has to be made good by the people of Australia. As the bill contemplates a much more active scheme of development, necessarily the expenditure in the future will be very much larger than hitherto. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needhampropose</inline> that the people of the Commonwealth shall find the money and allow a provisional council, to be selected by about 2,000 people in the Northern Territory, to control its expenditure ? </para>

                        <para>-Senator Needham really wants to start at what should be the second stage in Northern Territory development. At present there is not sufficient population there to carry on responsible government. We propose to attract people there, and will welcome the day when, as the result of this expected increase in population, we shall be able to hand over the government of the Territory to its residents. It is ridiculous to suggest that the time has arrived for self-government in the Territory. To ensure satisfactory development we must get the right men to control its affairs. There is no certainty that we shall get the best men by a system of popular selection. Members of the proposed provisional council might be elected from all sorts of motives - not necessarily because they were the best men for the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> I take it, would not contend that members of the River Murray Commission should be elected by the people living in the River Murray valley, and yet that commission is an exactly similar body to that proposed in this measure to ensure the development of the Northern Territory. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> will not press his amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - The reasons advanced by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> against the amendment are unsound, to put it mildly. In the  first place he does not properly state the amendment. He would have honorable senators believe that we on this side of the chamber are anxious that the whole of the members of the proposed commission shall be elected by people at present resident in the Northern Territory. That is not so, and the Minister knows it. He also instanced the River Murray Commission, as an argument against the amendment. Possibly the very best men have been appointed to that commission, but I remind the Minister that commissions just as important as the River Murray Commission have been appointed, not by Governments, but by the people of Australia. Members of the Convention that drafted the Constitution under which we legislate were elected by the people of Australia. The people of Australia were entrusted with the election of the men who, in their opinion, were best qualified to frame the Federal constitution. </para>

Whatever tha Labour party does will certainly be in the best interests of the people. No solid arguments have been advanced against the amendment, except that the time is not ripe for it. I have heard that hackneyed phrase ever since I have been in parlia ment. It was used against the extension of the franchise to the manhood and womanhood of Australia. In my opinion the time is over-ripe for the people of the Northern Territory to be given a voice in the government of their own affairs. </para>

The Minister remarked that if three representatives were appointed by the residents they would have the spending of the moneys of Australia, but I point out that it would be impossible for them to out&#62;vote the three government nominees, for the  chairman,  who would probably be a government representative, would have a casting vote. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister&#39;s argument is very weak. First of all he says that they could carry on at their own sweet will, but, on second thoughts, he realizes that he is wrong. He now says that it would be no use electing them, because they would be out- voted. My desire is to give the territorians an opportunity to take part in the management of their own affairs. I believe that they would do everything possible to select the best men available to act in co-operation with the government nominees, for they are as much interested as any member of this Chamber in the welfare of the Territory. They have waited long and anxiously for something tangible to be done for the country and its people. Who would be more interested in railway and road construction, and in water conservation than the residents themselves ? Certainly that work would be entrusted to the commission of three, to be appointed by the Government, but, after all, those men would be inexperienced in regard to the needs of the country as compared with the local residents, whose mature judgment should be of great assistance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> with his happy face and sunny smile, is very familiar with some of the distant parts of Western Australia, and he realizes that some, at least, of the residents in the outback portion of - that state know more of its needs than Ministers in charge of departments responsible for works carried on there. I have no doubt that he has found the advice tendered by the local residents veryhelpful at times. Australia professes to be a democratic community, but according to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> there are some people in Australia who are differently constituted from those in the various states, and if they were allowed to take a hand in the government of the Northern Territory, they would be extravagant with public money. What the people of the states are most concerned about is the great waste that has occurred in the Northern Territory. The most important step to take in the direction of eliminating that waste is to establish at least a semi-democratic form of government there. With a commission consisting of an equal number of government nominees and members elected by the residents, and with a  chairman  having a casting vote, the interests of the Commonwealth and of the territorians themselves would be equally conserved. </para>

                    <para>.- If anything could have shaken my resolution to vote against the amendment it would have been the speech to which I have just listened. Unfortunately for the honorable senator, however, my determination is founded upon ground which is too solid to be shaken. Until the people of the Territory are in a position to make a more proportionate contribution to the revenue which has to be spent there than is either possible or probable in the immediate future, I must favour the form of government set out in the bill. I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> for his kind and touching references to myself. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> know how much a speech like that brings home to one the everlasting truth of the lines written by a former poet-laureate - </para>

                <para>The honorable senator&#39;s kind heart is evidenced by his particularly agreeable remarks to myself.  His  simple faith is indicated by his desire and, indeed, his anxiety, to hand over to a handful of people in a very vast territory, which we hope will one day become another state, a considerable measure of control of the finances which have to be spent there, but which are contributed by persons in other parts of Australia. I am sorry that I have to announce myself to be unshaken by the eloquence of the honorable senator. I shall vote for the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>. - It is unfortunate that, no matter how strong the arguments are, that we advance against the proposals of the Government, tney appear to carry no weight with honorable senators opposite. Our words are as seed sown on stony ground. This is not because our views are feebly advanced, but solely because of pure cussedness on the part of the Government and their supporters. It is astonishing and somewhat startling to find that honorable senators opposite, who profess to be democrats, are unwilling to give the 4,000 Australians who reside in Northern Australia any voice whatever in the election of the council which will practically govern them. They will be able to exercise only a microscopic influence on this body, through the people who residein the north-east corner of Western Australia and in the western portion of Queensland, which is to be included in the proposed North Australian area. It cannot be denied that the people who live in Northern Australia know better than any one else how the money should be spent.

At any rate, they should have representation on it. Does any one imagine that the best possible commission has been appointed to control and develop the Federal Capital Territory? </para>

                        <para>- I shall content myself, with observing, sir, that the residents in the Federal Capital Territory, Papua, the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, Lord Howe Island, and North Australia should undoubtedly be given a voice in the affairs of their respective countries. No one can deny that those who control the public purse control the destinies of a country. Seeing that the residents of Papua have been&#39; given a small say in the election of the local council, I can see no reason for refusing the 4,000 people in North Australia a say in the election of this proposed commission. </para>

                        <para>- They are not asking for it. The aborigines will undoubtedly be required to work in North Australia, and I am quite prepared to say that the aborigines, as well as other people who have to do the work of the country, should not be refused a vote if they desire it. The point at issue, however, is whether or not the 4,000 Australians concerned shall be given a measure of self-government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is opposed to that. I dare say that 84 per cent, of these people are natives of this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has had some experience there, and, unhappily for himself, had impressed upon him the home truth that one cannot pass on land values taxation. He also discovered that he could not evade it. I am surprised that he is prepared to deny to these 4,000 people a voice in the government of their country. </para>

                        <para>- It was only after a good deal of agitation that the residents of the Northern Territory were given representation in the House of Representatives. They should also have a representative in this Chamber. The Minister has advanced no good reason for rejecting the amendment. The right to exercise the franchise was gained by the people only after a long and bitter struggle. It is an unfortunate fact that even yet the possession of property is regarded as a necessary qualification for exercising the franchise in local governing affairs throughout Australia. </para>

                        <para>- In New South Wales property is still considered to be of more value than flesh and blood in the election of representatives to the local governing bodies. That is also true of the other states in the Commonwealth with, perhaps, the exception of Queensland. If the Queensland local governing bodies are elected by adult suffrage, it is to the credit of that state, but I should like to know whether even there the principle of one man one vote is operative. </para>

                    <para>. - Notwithstanding the levity introduced into the debate, which is at times helpful, a vital principle is involved in the amendment I have submitted, the purport of which I do not think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has fully grasped.  His  first contention was that if we gave these people the right to elect members to the provisional council, there would be a possibility of money being wasted. That is not the object of the amendment. Even if it were proposed to give the council control in the expenditure of money, it must be remembered that those who would be elected would be men whose character could not be questioned, and who had made it possible for the Territory to be occupied. The Minister has, in effect, cast a reflection upon the intelligence and ability of worthy settlers. As regards the spending capacity of the provisional council, the Minister did not put the case clearly before the committee. Any one who peruses the amendment will see that a majority of the members of the provisional council will he directly responsible to the government of the day. The proposal is that three shall be elected by the residents in the area controlled by the commission, and three nominated by the Governor-General in Council. From, the financial point of view, there is a further safeguard, as the  chairman  will be a nominee of the Governor-General. It has also been stated that the actions of the elected representatives to the council, if this amendment were adopted, would possibly be influenced by a desire to be re-elected at some later date; but that could also be said against the members nominated by the Governor-General. This is too important a proposal to allow political bias or party feeling to intervene. It is our duty to improve the hill wherever possible, and this is one way in which that can be done. The Minister also stated that in perhaps the near future the area under discussion may be subdivided into one, two, or three states, vested with responsible government, and that under the pro visions of the bill the residents in the Territory will become acquainted with the system of responsible government. Many of the settlers in the Territory have been residents in other parts of the Commonwealth, and are already familiar with our present system, and if my amendment were adopted effect could more readily be given to the Minister&#39;s suggestion. I might have gone further, and have suggested that all the members of the provisional council should be elected ; but, realizing the difficulty surrounding the problem with which we are endeavouring to grapple, I thought it better to commence with three elected members.

                <para class="block">That provision embodies the principle I am endeavouring to introduce in clause 6. Possibly the minister will say that the advisory council will not have the direct control of the expenditure of money, but on its advice money will be spent. If the principle of a partly elected and partly nominated council is acceptable in one instance, why is it not in another? It has been suggested that when the Seat of Government. Administration Bill was before the Senate no attempt was made by honorable senators on this side of the chamber to give the residents of the Federal Territory an opportunity to elect one member of the commission. Even if such a suggestion were not then made, it is not now too late to make improvements. The council will not have the power to spend money without the authority of the Government. Elected representatives will not be chosen solely from residents in the Territory; persons resident in any portion of the Commonwealth may be elected. As the people should have the right to say who their representatives on the council shall be, I trust the amendment which has been so ably supported by honorable senators on this side of the chamber will be adopted. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment. After listening to the arguments adduced this morning, I am more than ever convinced that if the Government accepts the proposal submitted by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> it will be doing a great deal in the interests of the residents of the Territory. The franchise is valued by the Australian people, and when we grant the franchise to only one section of the people, a reflection is cast upon the whole community. The people in the Northern Territory do not enjoy the franchise, and have not the liberties to-day that they had when the Territory was under the control of the South Australian Parliament. In those days the Northern Territory sent two representatives to the South Australian Parliament, who had full voting power, and whose advice was always of great value in the South Australian Parliament. These representatives who were conversant with the conditions in the Territory were able to enlighten members of the South Australian Parliament who had never been there. Under Commonwealth control men with no experience of the conditions that exist outside the cities have been sent to the Northern Territory to administer and develop the country. If the amendment were agreed to, and three representatives were elected by the residents of the Territory, they would prove an acquisition to the commission, because most surely they would be practical men, and would voice the interests of those who live there. Who should know better than the people who live there the conditions of the Territory and its requirements ? The Government would still retain control of the administrate on, whilst at th)e same time the people of the Territory would have some voice in the government of that part of Australia in which they live. An attempt has been made to draw an analogy between this proposed commission and the Federal Capital Commission.No such analogy exists. This proposed commission will be charged with the development of one-fifth of the total area of Australia, whilst the Federal Capital Commission has the administration of a mere 900 square miles, in which not a great deal in the way of development is necessary, and from which industries will be more or less excluded. Yet honorable senators have the temerity to compare Canberra, which will be a home for the Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament and its administrative offices, with hundreds of thousands of square miles  of territory which can and will be developed if properly administered and managed ! I am pleased at the absence of a party spirit from this debate. This matter is above party politics. The Northern Territory is a most important part of Australia. Prior to federation, when practical men who understood the country were charged with its administration, a fair amount of development took place. A line of railway was constructed  through portion of it, and a telegraph line was erected from. Adelaide to Port Darwin. Since the Commonwealth has had control, - very little in the way of development has taken place. I suggest that one of the reasons for that is that  the Territory has not had a representative link between its people and those by whom it has been governed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> referred to the giving of the vote to the aborigines. He and the Government propose, by this measure, to place the people of the Northern Territory on exactly the same plane in regard to the franchise as that which is occupied by the aborigines of Australia. They will be on the same plane as restricted aliens. Although they live in a portion of Australia, they have not at present a voice in the government of Australia. They number many thousands, yet they have&#39; no more voice in the government of this country than people who do not live here. I appeal to the Government to give serious consideration to the amendment, because it has been put forward in good faith. We on this side are anxious to develop the Northern Territory. I do not doubt the sincerity of the statement that the Government, also, is anxious to develop it. What we have to decide is the best way in which that can be brought about. A commission upon which there were three men elected by the people of the Territory would, in my opinion, be more successful than one that did not have upon it any such representative. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment because of the democratic principle that underlies it. We boast of the free and broad franchise that the people of Australia enjoy, yet it appears that the Government is not prepared to extend that franchise to the people of the Northern Territory. It has been truly said that those people are represented in the Federal Parliament. That representative, however, has not the right to vote. If v.e give them a voice in the government of their country, we shall only be according them a privilege that everybody should enjoy. When the Territory was controlled by South Australia it had in the South Australian Parliament two representatives, who enjoyed the same privileges as those that were enjoyed by members representing any other part of the state. If it is right to give the franchise to the people in other parts of Australia, why should it be withheld from those who reside in the Northern Territory ? The Government would not. lose control, as it would still have a majority of its representatives on the commission; but the people of the Territory would have the opportunity to express their wishes at meetings of the commission. Who should know better than the people of the Territory the best means for developing it? We should depart from the principle of appointing to these administrative positions men who have lived only in the cities of the Commonwealth. The Government may intend to&#62; appoint men who live in the Territory, but it has not stated that that is its  intenion.  If it is,  then our argument is fully answered. We cannot expect the government of the Territory to be in the best interests of the people, unless we appoint to these positions men who have some knowledge of the country. Is the Government afraid that if it appoints residents of the Territory it will disappoint some ambitious men who now live in our cities ; or does it believe that the people who live in the Territory would not govern it rightly? Why not provide in the bill that those who are appointed to the commission must have been residents of the Territory for at least three years ? It will not be possible to achieve success if men are appointed who do not understand the conditions with which they have to deal. I desire that the Northern Territory shall progress. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the amendment. I have no doubt that the proposition of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham)</inline> is a step in the right direction. It would be deplorable were we to deny to the people of the Northern Territory the right to a voice in the government of the country in which they live. It has been said that they have a representative in another place. That is quite true ; but it must not be forgotten that he has not the right to record a vote upon any matter that is brought forward. I agree with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that it would be wise to appoint to the commission men who are acquainted with the conditions that exist in the country that they will be called upon to govern. It would be absurd to appoint men who have never, seen the country, and who know nothing of its conditions. I hope that the committee will accept the view that people now resident in the Northern Territory are entitled to a vote in connexion with its administration. When the Territory wa3 under the control, of South Australia it was represented by two members in the South Australian Parliament. If it was right then to give it parliamentary representation, it is right now to give it representation on this commission. We should do all we can to encourage the residents of the Territory to come forward and play some part in its government. I stand for the franchise. </para>

                    <para>. -Five years is certainly not a lengthy&#39; period, but as the appointment of the commission will be an innovation, so far as the Territory is concerned, and as its members will have to make good,&#39; it might be advisable to fix a limit of three years. Re-appointment should depend upon the manner in which members discharge their duties. . The period of three years is fixed in connexion with many other Commonwealth and state appointments of. this nature. There is no doubt that if the members of the commission prove, their fitness, during that period, they will be re-appointed. If, on the other hand, they are appointed for a period of five years and prove to be unfit for their duties, it may be difficult to remove them. It is not advisable to make long appointments, especially for work of this nature. There is no more reason for a term of five years in this case than in the case of members of the other branch of the legislature. Members of another place are elected for a period of three years, &#39; and they are active during their term of service, in order to make good, so that the people will re-elect them. What is good enough for a representative chamber should be sufficient for a nominee commission. The choice would not be restricted if we made such an amendment. I believe it would be beneficial from every point of view. I move - </para>

Obviously, men who would be. worth their salt are now following some business avocation, for which they are well paid, and if we ask them to accept appointments for a period of five years, with no guarantee of re-appointment, many of them will not be prepared to sacrifice their present positions. By fixing a three years&#39; term, the only men we should induce to apply for the positions would be those who had nothing to sacrifice. </para>

                    <para>. - We should not overlook the fact that members of another place have sacrificed a great deal so far as their business callings are concerned, and they are required to face the electors every three years. Surely the other branch of the legislature is at least of as much importance as the proposed commission. It seems to me that the shorter the period the greater would be the incentive to the members of the commission to make good. If they were appointed for five years they might be inclined to be lazy. The amendment is sound, and not in any way hostile. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister is given power under this clause to suspend a commissioner or acting commissioner for certain reasons specified. The clause goes on to say that within seven days after the suspension, if Parliament is then sitting, or, if the Parliament is not then sitting, within seven days after the next meeting of the Parliament, a statement of the grounds of suspension shall be laid before both Houses. In the case of the Minister suspending a commissioner and making a statement to Parliament, will the suspended commissioner have any means of defending himself ? Is there any provision in this clause or elsewhere in the bill for a suspended officer to present his case to Parliament? It would not be quite a fair thing for Parliament to decide such a matter on the <inline font-style="italic">exparte</inline> statement of the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. If a commissioner or any acting commissioner is suspended for any other than these reasons, he has a remedy at law. He is also protected by reason of the fact that within 60 days after the report of such a suspension is made to Parliament an address may be presented praying for the restoration of the officer concerned. The whole matter would be thoroughly ventilated. In my experience it has never been difficult to get a member of parliament to state any grievance in Parliament. The full facts would undoubtedly be submitted to the members of both Houses, no matter how forlorn, desperate, or hopeless the case might be. &#39; </para>

                    <para>- One cannot help remarking how readily the Minister accepts suggestions from honorable senators on his own side of the committee. I give place to no honorable senator in my desire to see the best men appointed to public positions, but I believe that we shall be more likely to attain that end by providing that the appointments shall be subject to ministerial approval. I consider that the clause should be left as it is. It is perfectly clear, and it gives the commission ample authority. </para>

                    <para>. - As the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has undoubtedly given more consideration to the measure than I have, I do not intend to press the amendment which I suggested earlier in the debate. We hope that only men of outstanding ability will be appointed to the commission, as the whole success of the scheme is dependent upon the calibre of those selected to undertake this important work. We should, however, within the limitations of the expenditure that Parliament sanctions, give them a comparatively free handto carry out their work in the way that they consider best. At present it is impossible to say what the developments will be, and there may be some reason for keeping a check over the commission in regard to the more important appointments that it may be necessary to make from time to time. We do not know what will be the effect of this system which the Government proposes to inaugurate under this bill, and it may be that this provision may hamper the operations of the commissioners. As they will be on the spot they should be the best judges of the class of officers required, particularly for ordinary routine work. I shall not press my suggestion, but will leave it to the Minister to decide. </para>

                        <para>-I do not think so. It is admitted that the members of the commission should be men of experience possessing sufficient ability to satisfactorily carry out the important duties which they are to perform, and if that is the case, they should have the assistance of a highlycompetent staff. The clause in its present form gives the commission too much power in the matter of remuneration. The amount of salary should be deleted so that the Government would have the power to determine the salary of all officers of the commission. </para>

The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has met my objection, to a certain extent by pointing out that the Government Resident is to have only matters of routine under his direction. Possibly that may be desirable in the inaugural stages, but the control of mining operations should be taken from the Government Resident and placed under the commission. The Minister previously stated that certain services, such as police, education, mines, fisheries, protection of aborigines, and other minor ones, would not be dealt with by the commission. As it has frequently been stated that the possibilities of successful mineral developments in the Northern Territory are very promising, the control of mining should be under the commission and not under the Government </para>

                    <para>. - This matter was given a very great deal of consideration. At first sight it might appear that mining matters are somewhat on a par with those relating to land, and should be placed under the control of a developmental commission. A little further consideration, however, will show that that is not so. The matters to be handed over to the commission are the maintenance and operation of railways; the construction and maintenance of roads; the erection of telegraph and telephone lines; water boring and conservation; and ports and harbors. All of those matters will involve the carrying out of definite works. The Government does not engage in mining operations; it is not responsible for the sinking of a shaft, the erection of poppet heads, or the installation of a battery. Those are the functions of private enterprise. The Government appoints mining wardens merely to administer the law. It may also subsidize a company to put down&#34; a shaft. No developmental work in relation to mining is undertaken by the Government, and it is not considered advisable to saddle the commission with a lot of mining administration. The commission will have to provide roads, railways, and water supply for an area which is considered suitable for mining development. The purely administrative services should be left to the Government Resident. We do not want the attention of the commisson to be diverted from the actual work of development to the routine work of administration. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the amendment is worthy of consideration. The Minister has stated that the control of mining involves merely administrative work, and that it would divert unnecessarily the activities of the commission. In Papua, one of the officers is described as &#34; Director of Lands, Mines, and Agriculture.&#34; I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Stanisforth  Smith. </para>

                        <para>- The commission may be called upon to add to the length of railway communication in the Territory. It would be idle for the Minister to contend that the existing railway will be the only one in the Territory. How can that country be developed if new railways, or branches from the existing line, are not constructed.- New roads will have to be provided, and that work will necessitate administration. All the other duties of the commission also will involve administration. Having listened the other day to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> stating the possibilities of mining, one wonders why that matter has been excluded from the powers of the commission. I cannot see how it would in any way hamper the commisson or divert its attention from more necessary work. I think that the amendment is a good one, and should be agreed to. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister and I look at this matter from different angles. He regards it from the bureaucratic, routine point of view, whilst I have in mind the wider aspect of development. I am thinking of the question that confronted the Queensland Government when the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company sought to construct a feeder railway from Many Peaks to the main line, and arrangements were entered into for the carriage of ore at a given rate. I am thinking also of concessions that have been made to people who initiated big mining ventures. These are important questions with which the commission should be called upon to deal. </para>

                        <para>- The Government, so we are told, is &#34; wallowing &#34; in cash. It does not know what to do with its surpluses. According to the budget statement, it is giving doles to every section of the community. I am quite certain that the commission will very soon get together a large and costly staff. If we are to have development on satisfactory lines in the Northern Territory we should not allow financial considerations to weigh with us. If, in the matter of railway construction, the commission were given authority to utilize money voted by Parliament, it should be in a position to have trial surveys made, and, if satisfied as to the route, acting of course on the advice of its expert  officers,  it should have authority to go on with the work without delay. With all due respect to the present Railways Commissioner, I think the commission should be autonomous in regard to railway proposals for the Northern Territory. We may anticipate that it will have the confidence of Parliament, and that its members will be paid salaries commensurate with the importance of their duties. Why, then, should not it be entrusted with full responsibility? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson,</inline> I am sure, would not approve of all this circumlocution in his business undertakings. </para>

                    <para>.- I listened with surprise to the remarks of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham).</inline> If there is one thing for which the National party has been condemned by the Labour party during the last few years it has been this delegation of authority to boards and commissions. On every available opportunity members of the Labour party have challenged this Government and its supporters with handing over to boards and commissions functions which, they contend, properly belong to Parliament. Now the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in this chamber suggests that the commission to be appointed to administer the Northern Territory should have full authority to build railways without reference to Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- And properly so, too. I am not prepared to hand over to a commission rights which Parliament alone should exercise with regard to the construction of railways. The suggestion of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, if adopted, would create a dangerous precedent. I am really surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> who with other members of his party has criticized the Government for having vested certain authority in boards and commissions, should now come along with what is certainly the most extravagant suggestion I have ever heard made in this chamber. I am wondering if the agreement recently arrived at between the Shipping Board and a certain industrial organization has converted the honorable senator to his new view-point. I do not know whether or not he speaks for the whole of his party, but his suggestion represents a remarkable change of front. </para>

                    <para>. -  In addition to the objections which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has raised to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> suggestion, there is this further objection. If the commission is to have authority to order the trial survey of a proposed new railwa route, and also to construct the line, it will need an extensive staff of engineers, surveyors,  draftsmen, and other officials; It may be a considerable time before it is in a position to construct a railway line, yet if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> proposal is adopted it will be necessary to keep an expensive staff together. We say that, in the interests of economy and efficiency, the work should be done by the existing staff of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. </para>

                    (Western Australia) &#91;2.431. - I wish to disabuse
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline>
                    mind of the impression that, in this matter, I am speaking for honororable senators on this side of the chamber. This is not a party measure. I am voicing my personal opinion as a member of the committee. I do not think that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline>
                    would intentionally  misrepresent me, but I should like to refresh his memory and make my position clear. I said that the provisional council should be endowed with a certain sum of money by this Parliament - I think I mentioned &#163;10,000,000 or &#163;15,000,000- and that it should have authority to go on with developmental works that it considered to be necessary.

                        <para>- The commission will have a more intimate knowledge of the Northern Territory requirements than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> or any other member of this chamber. And since Parliament will vote the money for any proposed works, it follows that Parliament will still have authority over expenditure. The objection raised by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that my proposal, if adopted, would mean the employment of an extensive staff, does not carry much weight with me. I am satisfied that, in a very short time, the commission will gather around itself an expensive staff of officials. Therefore authority to carry out surveys and road construction work will not necessarily mean added administrative expenditure. The commission will have a certain work to do. Why not give it carte blanche after endowing it with a certain sum of money for the development of the Territory? Control by Parliament can never be abrogated. My proposal would do away with a great deal of unnecessary circumlocution. </para>

                        <para>- A commission specially appointed for the particular purpose would surely <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> into matters of detail before making a recommendation to the Minister for the construction of a railway. On receipt of the report of the commission that the construction of a certain railway is desirable the Minister, under the bill, must forward that report to the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. He, in turn, makes investigations, and reports to the Minister, who must then forward to the North Australian Commission the report so received. This certainly does not appear to be a businesslike method. It will entail a lot of unnecessary expense. </para>

It would be most extravagant to require the commission to have a special staff of surveyors to report on railway and other works, for there would not be sufficient works in progress in the Northern Territory to keep them fully occupied. The Railways Standing Committee of the Victorian Parliament occupies a similar position to that of the Federal Public Works Committee. When a question is referred to the committee for report, plans have already been prepared, and Parliament is guided by the recommendations of the committee. </para>

Australia already has three railway gauges. Queensland, Western Australia, and South Australia have the 3-ft. 6-in. system in operation, New South Wales the 4-ft. 8J-in., and Victoria and South Australia the 5-ft..3-in. We shall make a great mistake if we perpetuate the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge in the Northern Territory. When the population there increases and the western portion of Queensland becomes more thickly settled, great difficulties will occur in handling traffic between Darwin by way of the Gulf and down to Bourke in New South Wales if the railway gauge in the Territory is 3 ft. 6 in. We have an opportunity now to lay down the future policy. In view of the opinions of some honorable senators on this subject I am astonished that they agreed to construct the Kyogle to South Brisbane line on the 4-ft. 8&#163;-in. gauge. </para>

                        <para>- I do; although I suppose that years will pass before many tunnels will be required there. I trust that we shall not repeat in the Territory the serious blunder that is being made at present in the Kyogle to South Brisbane line, of providing only single tunnels. While it is quite true that all proposals for railway construction in the Territory will be submitted to Parliament, they will doubtless come before us with a recommendation from the commission, and honorable members may be reluctant to depart from that recommendation, feeling that the commission is better informed on the subject than they are. I urge honorable senators to look at this matter in a broad way. I suppose that a good many Western Australians, and probably South Australians also, were annoyed that the east-west line was constructed on the 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge, but that is now the recognized standard gauge throughout the world. All the railways of the United States of America, Great Britain, France, and, I believe, Germany and other parts of Europe, are of this gauge. I cannot understand why South Australia and Victoria persist in building railways of the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge when they know that ultimately they must be converted to the standard gauge. If we at once adopt the standard gauge in the Northern Territory the locomotives and rolling-stock used on the New South Wales railway system and on the transcontinental line will be available for use there, whereas if we adopt the 3-f t. 6-in. gauge this rollingstock will not be available.

                    <para>. - I am sure the honorable senator has not contemplated the consequences of his amendment. Both the railway lines already constructed in the Northern Territory are of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. If the honorable senator&#39;s amendment were accepted and the commission desired later to link up these two lines it would be obliged to use the 4-ft.8&#189;-in. gauge. I must say that that is a brilliant proposition. I could understand the honorable senator introducing a motion for the conversion of the existing lines to the 4-ft. <inline font-style="italic">8&#189;-in</inline> gauge, but until that is done it would be foolish for us to limit all future constructions to that gauge. Another objection to the proposal is that it might seriously hinder development. The commission may consider the building of light lines of even a 2-ft. 6-in. gauge highly desirable to develop particular districts, but the adoption of this amendment would render that course impossible. The proposal is so ridiculous that I do not think I need discuss it further. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister completelyfails to realize that the work of railway construction in the Northern Territory so far is practically negligible. The scraps of line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta and from Darwin to Newcastle Waters are inconsequential details compared with the long stretches of railway that must necessarily be built in the Territory in the years tocome. No one knows that better than the Minister himself. Honorable senators generally should realize that we are dealing with an area of more than 500,000 square miles. I do not know whether it is intended to construct a line from the East- West railway towards Newcastle Waters, but Iunderstand that certain matters in relation to the route have beenunder consideration.

                    <para>.  - At present the Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the governments of the states in which cotton is grown, is guaranteeing a certain price, which is determined according to the grade of cotton. Representations have been made to the Commonwealth Government by those interested in the industry that, instead of a guaranteed price, the Government should introduce the bounty system. It has been represented that by doing so a certain amount of government control, which is necessary under the present system, could be obviated with advantage to the industry. The Government has given these representations consideration, and is sympathetically disposed towards placing the cotton industry under the bounty system, as has been done with certain other industries. </para>

                        <para>- No; it will apply only to cotton-growers. Obviously, before the bounty system can be put into operation the amount of the bounty and the conditions under which it should be paid have to be determined, and under existing legislation, an investigation must be conducted by the Tariff Board. At present the Tariff Board is working overtime conducting necessary investigations into tariff matters in relation to proposals shortly to be submitted by the Government to Parliament,&#34; and it is not possible or advisable to interrupt those investigations. It will therefore be some time before the Tariff Board can make necessary inquiries into the payment of a bounty on the production of cotton. The Government, however, recognizing that the growers require some assurance as to what their position will be, and that the planting season is arriving, has already announced, through the Prime </para>

Correspondence is now being opened up with the states concerned as to the amount of a guaranteed price, and the conditions under which it should be paid. I have no doubt that a satisfactory agreement will be arrived at with the State Governments concerned, and that the growers will be able to proceed with their planting with the assurance that a guaranteed price will be paid for the cotton produced in the forthcoming season. </para>

                        <para>- We have an open mind. Knowing as I do the representations that have been made by the growers, I am sure the proposals we&#39; are putting forward will be accepted as satisfactory. A definite announcement, however, cannot be made until the states have notified their agreement. As soon as an agreement has been reached the exact terms of the guaranteed price will be made known, and this matter of the bounty will then become the subject of inquiry. Ab honorable senators are aware, export bounties are controlled by the Department of Markets and Migration, and, therefore, the administration and work in relation to the necessary inquiries will become thu duty of my colleague, the Minister for Markets and Migration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson).</inline> Hitherto the matter has been dealt with by the Department of Home and Territories, because that department controls the Northern Territory, which is the only Commonwealth territory interested in cotton production. I can give an assurance that the Government is in sympathy with the payment of a bounty, and will have the necessary investigations made at the earliest possible moment. In the meantime it is proposed to continue the guaranteed price under certain terms and conditions, which terms and conditions have been communicated to the states interested, and concerning which I expect shortly to be able to make an announcement. </para>
