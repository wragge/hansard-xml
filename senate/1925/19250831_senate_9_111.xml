            <para>. - By meeting on Monday morning, the Senate is do&#39;-ng what it should always do, and now that we have ample time, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> and his supporters will, I hope, allow the committee to discuss the bill in a reasonable manner. It will, I think, be admitted that on Saturday honorable senators on this side did not display &#39;any desire to unnecessarily delay the passage of the bill. This clause, in common with others already passed, bears the stamp of hasty drafting. For instance, the number of peace officers to be appointed has not been limited, neither is the maximum amount of expenditure mentioned. It is contrary to constitutional procedure to vote unlimited sums of money to any government. This is an appropriation bill. </para>

              <para>- No, but it oan be appropriated under clause 2, which has -already been passed by the committee. I have no desire to delay or aggravate the Minister, but he will surely admit that a provision which enables the Government to appropriate an unlimited sum of money is unconstitutional. As the Government has acted similarly before, this proposal is not contrary to precedent, but in any such measures as this we cannot be too careful about fixing the maximum amount to be voted. I wish to give notice that I intend to move - </para>

              <para>- Because the honorable senator and his supporters have given the Government power to appropriate an unlimited amount. Under the suggested amendment I have quoted, the expenditure will be limited. It seems that the Rt.  Hon.  Stanley Melbourne Bruce, the Rt.  Hon.  George Foster Pearce, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page are becoming Australian Mussolinis, and are creating an army of men for their own ulteriormotives. No other construction can be placed upon their actions. We should be supplied with some information as to how this money is to be expended. The suggested amendment fixes a maximum, which the Government has not provided. I have asked for information as to the direction in which the money is to be expended on the appointment of peace officers, and, in a smart and effective way, the Minister replies by moving &#34; That the committee do now divide.&#34; That is the only intelligent reply that we have received to any questions asked during the discussion of this bill. &#39; I also intend to move - </para>

That is the simplest way of overcoming the difficulty or of avoiding  a  conflict with the Chair. In this instance the Government is undoubtedly committing a serious blunder. Here is a proposal to swear in certain persons before justices of the peace. Does the Government propose to appoint persons as justices of the peace in order to avert, possibly, another snub from the Premier of New South Wales who, we have been informed, has refused to allow New SouthWales officials to assist in this matter? From among my constituents I could easily supply a list of 100,000 persons well-fitted for the honour of being able to write the magic letters &#34; J.P.&#34; after their names. </para>

              <para>- It would be a ridiculous title to give any officers appointed under this measure. We all know that there is an international peace movement in progress, and that, associated with it, are some of the world&#39;s most intellectual men and women. This movement has for its objective the disarmament of the nations, and a state of peace on earth and good-will towards all men. This bill is for a totally different purpose. It will prevent industrial peace. No one can, by any stretch of the imagination, say that the need for these proposed &#34; peace &#34; officers exists. Consider what an extraordinary position would be created by their appointment. There are police officers in all the States of the Commonwealth. Why then should the Commonwealth Government appoint &#34;peace&#34; officers to carry out duties of the same nature? One would be called a &#34;police&#34; man, and apparently the other a &#34; peace &#34; man. How ridiculous it would be when they would both be doing the same kind of work. In any case, we should have some information as to the number of &#34; peace &#34; officers to be appointed and the periods of their appointment. Why should there be a blank in the clause? Are honorable senators who support the Government prepared to vote for a clause under which &#34;peace&#34; officers may be appointed for any period? We should not speedily pass legislation that may enable the Government to appoint a considerable army of peace officers for any period that it chooses. There is another aspect of the matter. Those who are appointed will not be allowed to leave the force unless they give three months&#39; notice of their intention to do so. The Government apparently intends to make permanent appointments. I hope that the Minister will state the number of appointments that the Government has in view, and the remuneration which each man will receive. </para>

              <para>- You, sir, have permitted me to make a passing reference to certain blanks in the clause. The oath is merely an incidental matter, but the period of appointment is all-important. I, of course, admit that these officers must take an oath before they will be able to carry out their duties. That having been done, an arrangement will be entered into between the Government and the appointees respecting the period of appointment and the salary that they are to receive. We are entitled to have information upon those matters. </para>

              <para>- That explanation does not satisfy me. A similar statement was made respecting another force that was brought into existence by a previous Government. We were then led to believe that only temporary appointments were to be made, but this has become a permanent institution. If this Government is again returned to power it will make a permanent institution of the force that it is. proposed to appoint under this bill. I strongly object to that. </para>

              <para>- Honorable senators supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> canjudge for themselves as to the usefulness or otherwise of his answer. The sum of &#163;9,000 is provided on the Estimates for the maintenance of Commonwealth police. I understand that 36 of these officers are located in New South Wales. Why could not they be used if what the Government desires is, as we are told, simply to serve a summons? Why is there need to pass this bill, and so to establish  a  new department? My whole intention, as a member of this chamber, is to conserve tha people&#39;s money, and to prevent waste. I think I may truthfully say that I am more careful about the expenditure of public money than I am about the expenditure of my own private money. </para>

              <para>- If you, sir, decide that  it is unparliamentary, I withdraw it. The Government is looking round for some means by which it may escape the just .condemnation of the electors. It deserves condemnation, for it has failed in everything it has touched, except, perhaps, in its efforts to assist its friends. </para>

I was pointing out that its past conduct justified me in adopting that view. It must have some reason for pushing forward so hurriedly with this measure.

              <para>- But surely some limit should be stated. I have suggested 100,000. Perhaps the Government would prefer the limit to be 1 per cent, of the population of each State. It may think that it would be better to say that 1,000 officers should be appointed in each State. Apparently, however, the only speech that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> can make is: &#34; I move that the committee do now divide?&#34;  His  opportunity for making even that motion will soon be gone. I assure him, however, that when the Labour party is in possession of the Government bench it will, at least, respect the rights of the minority. It will permit the minority to discuss its proposals. </para>

If I entered into an agreement to do certain work, I could not be dismissed until I had done certain things. I would not be allowed to leave my employment without giving clue notice and submitting a reason for so doing. That would constitute a reciprocal arrangement, but under paragrapha reciprocity is impracticable. Surely all the protection must not be on one side. The paragraph is one on which we should be enlightened by a member of the legal fraternity, and perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> will be willing to explain its meaning. Another clause provides that peace officers cannot resign without the permission of the Attorney-General. They will have to work under whatever conditions may be imposed. </para>

          <para class="block">My attention has been drawn to the statement made recently by a gentleman holding a high military and public position that those concerned in this industrial dispute were going to &#34;get it in the neck.&#34; Australians are a peaceloving people. Therefore, when we hear  this  talk about giving it to the democracy &#34; in the neck,&#34; we might very well feel concerned if arms are permitted men who, under this measure, may have to carry out the orders of officers unrestrained by parliamentary authority. I wish I could get honorable members opposite to view this situation in the light that I do. For a number of years certain people have had an exaggerated idea of the strength of communists in Australia. They are suffering from a condition of hysteria, and imagine that the communists in this country constitute a danger to the Empire. I stand behind no one who threatens or wishes ill to the British Empire. Neither&#39; can I stand behind a government which, startled by rumours that are groundless, legislates in this hysterical manner. May I remind honorable senators opposite of what happened during the last State elections in New South Wales. The communists, led by a gentleman of notoriety, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#34;</inline> Jock &#34; Garden, who, I may add, is not the wildeyed agitator with pistols in his, belt and knives sticking out of his boots that some people would have us believe he is, but, on the contrary, is an exPresbyterian minister of the gospel- </para>

              <para>- Much depends on the view taken concerning the action of a man while in the service of the department. The proposed peace officers should not be armed, because so many people believe that peace to make it stick should be &#34; druv in with bagonets &#34; as Lowell said. I was about to explain what happened at the last State elections in New South Wales, when &#34;Jock&#34; Garden led his communists into the political arena. They presented candidates for&#39; the  waterside seats - the strongest of the Labour divisions - and also the coalfield seats. I have not the exact figures, but I can state definitely what happened. </para>

              <para>- My amendment seeks to prevent the Government from arming this proposed peace force, and I wish to give my reasons. If I am allowed to pursue my line of . argument, in all probability 1 shall not occupy even the quarter of an hour allotted to me by the Standing Orders. I have stated that there is an exaggerated fear of the communists in Australia. I believe that this fear of revolution from any action which the communists may take is entirely without foundation; that it exists only in the minds of people who suffer from hysteria. Unfortunately, they have become the victims of confidence trick men. </para>

              <para>- Every leader of labour has had to submit to the vilification of people who ave opposed to labour. As I have already stated, at the last election in New South Wales, the communists, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garden,</inline> contested a certain number of selected seats where democracy is most firmly entrenched, and the fact that the twelve candidates representing communistic principles polled less than 800 votes should be a sufficient guarantee that no danger need be apprehended in Australia from that source. It is as well that the Government should know that a certain person has been receiving money from the employers&#39; organizations by pretending to disclose conspiracies that may lead to revolution. Men of the type of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> should know this; they should be brought to realize that the confidence trick men are exploiting another source of income. </para>

              <para>- If there is anything in these! allegations about revolutionary schemes dangerous to the community, the most effective course for the Government is to make a full statement to Parliament and take the people into its  confidence.  No section of sensible men is going to be led off the track of constitutional reform by specious pleas of wildeyed agitators with some proposal for a short cut to reach the  millenium.  There is no graver danger to a democracy than the creation of an armed force. I am afraid - perhaps I am becoming as nervous over this bill as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and his colleagues have become over the alleged threatened danger - that unless some satisfactory explanation is forthcoming as to the need for this extraordinary proposal, grave trouble may confront the Commonwealth. As the Minister would not accept my proposal to limit the proposed force to 100,000 men, we may assume that there is to be no limit to the number constituting the force, and, therefore, I warn the Government to refrain from arming it. We have gone through many stirring times when feeling has run high, but with the exercise of a little patience and a little toleration, we have got back to normal again. Some people would like the Australian democracy to move forward smoothly with no harsh words and no clashing of interests. I would not. 1 prefer that a democracy, whilst climbing to a higher social plane, should be active, virile, and forceful. </para>

              <para>- Exactly. For that reason, we should prove to them that democracy, secure in the justice of its claim to govern the people, can beat them with its own methods. To meet them with their methods, is to admit that one of our bulwarks - constitutional government and the enforcement of the laws by the properly constituted courts of this country - has failed us. I refuse to admit that, and that is why I want to restrain the Government from arming this new force that it proposes to call into existence. Surely honorable senators opposite do not believe that they must blindly follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I have not often a kindly wordto say of the right honorable gentleman, but because of my long association with him, I make bold to congratulate him upon his capture of the enthusiastic and unquestioning support of the whole of his followers.

              <para>- No fear. I would not say anything offensive of the men whose support I wish to gain. When I returned to this Senate, after a short absence, I found that what was formerly a doubtful, questioning support by those who follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had been turned into a loyal, unquestioning support. Apparently honorable senators opposite are now prepared to say, &#34;We will stand with our eyes bandaged and our mouths open waiting for anything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> may care to give us, whether it be agreeable or disagreeable.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is to be congratulated upon his illustration of the conquest of mind over matter. Ill-advised though it may be for the Leader of the Opposition to say anything nice of the Leader of the Government, . I take this opportunity to express admiration of his skill in having so overcome the scruples of his followers that, instead of being questioning supporters, they now do his bidding unquestioningly. </para>

              <para>- If this legislation has not been designed to punish those men, the Government should be condemned for permitting that rumour tobe so widely spread. If, on the other band, summonses have been or are to be issued against them, the Government should have taken steps to ensure that their- case was not prejudiced before it was brought on. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> in his calm moments, must realize how &#39;wicked it is to traduce any man who has been charged with an offence. That is getting right away from the principle that underlies the British system of justice. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> name indicates German, descent, but Carlyle has said that Scotsmen are nearly all of German descent. Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> com.es from Scotland or anywhere else, he is taking up a most un-British attitude when he desires to have men condemned and convicted before they are tried. We, on this side, have always been held up as the representatives of a section of the community that is un-British. I admit that I place Australia so far ahead of other countries that sometimes that charge may appear to have been reasonably levelled against me. But I have never yet advocated for an Englishman, a Scotchman, or an Irishman, a law different from that towhich I was prepared to submit myself. We want to follow all that is good in the British Constitution. </para>

              <para>- The position ought to be fully stated to you, sir. It arose after the committee decided to divide on the clause. Possibly I contributed to the disorder, if such it may be termed, by rising to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman</inline> for permission to move an amendment in the shape of a new clause before the division on clause 6 was taken. The  Chairman  ruled that I could not move the new clause at that stage, and I resumed my seat. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh</inline> then rose and inquired whether he could ask a question or move an amendment. I venture to say that the  Chairman  is mistaken in thinking that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh</inline> did not resume his seat when called to order. </para>

At that stage questions of any kind are not&#39; permissible, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McHugh</inline> or any other honorable senator persisted in attempting to ask them or to interject he was disorderly, and the  chairman  was justified in reporting him.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">This clause&#39; will test the feeling of the committee as to whether any person should be deported without a trial by jury. The bill itself is an attempt to undermine Magna Charta, the great buttress of British liberty for the last 700&#39; years. There is no guarantee that within the next six months there will not be a Labour Government in office. If laws are now enacted to punish labour leaders, honorable senators who pass them cannot object if, when our turn comes, we use those laws to punish anti-union people. Nothing is more inclined to degrade Australia in the eyes of the world than legislation of this kind. I want to prevent this Government, just as I would prevent any government of which I had hopes of being a member, from trying to undermine that bulwark of liberty, trial by jury. I do not know why some people should become incensed at the actions of leaders of unions. The struggle that is now taking place is simply a dispute on British ships which happen to be in Australian waters. The seamen on those vessels are resisting an attempt to reduce their wages by &#163;1 a month. Honorable senators opposite are always most ardent in their desire to participate in any attempt to reduce wages. If there are people in this country whose actions are calculated to injure its trade and commerce, and to prevent the maintenance of peace and good order, they ought to be punished, but not in a way which is contrary to the principles of British law. It is said that certain individuals are objectionable. I have been termed a wrong-doer, although I claim that my chief aim in every action I have taken in the industrial and political field has been for the good of the community. It is not an offence to resist a reduction of wages. I venture to say that if any proposal were made to reduce the salaries of members of the Commonwealth Parliament we should fight most vigorously to defeat it. I measure every man by my own bushel. British seamen, who  were being paid &#163;9 10s. a month, find that their wages have been reduced to &#163;8 10s. a month. What do the old-time labourites, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid, Senator Plain, Senator Lynch,</inline> think of such a proposal ? They were more intimately associated with the industrial struggle than I have ever been. The part I played was small compared with theirs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was one of the wildest leaders of the industrial section in his day. No matter how far he may have fallen from grace, there was a time when he found favour in the eyes of the unions because of the enthusiasm with which he espoused their claim for better conditions. The other day he justified some of his earlier conduct by saying that the conditions obtaining then warranted any attack on them. Do not the conditions obtaining to-day warrant an attack upon them? Compare &#163;8 10s. a month, which the seamen are getting, with the wage <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was getting as a waterside worker in days when the cost of living was very much lower than it is to-day. </para>

              <para>- Men to-day display more intelligence. The work a man does is commensurate with what he gets. . If he is not getting a living wage, he cannot be expected to do a fair day&#39;s work. If he is not getting a wage with which he can maintain himself and his family in accordance with the best conditions of his class, I do not think it is fair to ask him to slave himself to death. The motto of the working classes is &#34; a fair day&#39;s work for a fair day&#39;s pay.&#34; The working classes are not selfish. They are taxing them-&#39; selves to the extent of &#163;40.000,000 a year in order to encourage manufacturers in Australia. </para>

I am asking that before any man is sent out of &#39; this country he shall have the right to a trial by jury. Honorable senators opposite claim to be the props, stays, and supports of the Empire.

              <para>- Yes, and apparently with great vim. I do not care who was responsible for the statement, &#34; Once an immigrant always an immigrant &#34; may be the position in the eyes of the law, but I repudiate the sentiment. A British-born citizen of Australia, being a citizen of the Empire, should have the same privileges and rights, no more and no less, than a citizen of the Empire born in Australia. This is a sentiment that will hold the Empire together. The refusal of Australia to trade with Great Britain, and now this refusal to give Britishers &#34; the privileges they have enjoyed since their birth, is in the spirit that makes for independent states and the disintegration of the Empire. </para>

              <para>- I repudiate entirely any sentiment of that kind. I repudiate any man who attacks, directly or indirectly, the Empire of which we form a part. I object, also, to this whittling away of rights and liberties of Britishers. I object to this proposal to deport a Britisher who has been resident, in Australia for so many years, has married in Australia, and has had children born to him in Australia. This attempt to put him on a different footing in the eyes of the law from an Australian-born citizen is an Empire-wrecking proposal. Honorable senators are supposed to be calmly deliberating on the policy of the Government, and, apparently, they intend to agree to a proposal that will make for tyranny in administration, which is worse than the tyranny of the law. Imagine Senators Lynch and Plain voting for a measure under which they, as British-born citizens of Australia, men who have done something for Australia, could be arrested, and without trial in a properly constituted court of justice, could be deported and the children born to them in Australia left behind parent- less or compelled to go into exile with them. This is the last time, as far as I am concerned, that I shall attempt in this measure to preserve that uniformity of conditions between Britons and Australians, which I think it is the duty of this Parliament to preserve. </para>

Fortunately, on occasions like the present, the press of this country is prepared to report some of the remarks of honorable senators on this side. A clause such as I have moved should certainly be embodied in the bill, as we have a right to know to what extent the revenue of this country will be. liable in order to carryout  this hysterical legislation.

              <para>- Everything. I am not like honorable senators opposite who, parrot-like, repeat the arguments of their leader. I want to embellish the arguments that have already been advanced. When I was interrupted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> I was saying that for many years I was under the impression that any person born in the British Empire had a right to go wherever he chose in that Empire, but I now find that as soon as any portion of the Empire detaches itself from Great Britain, one of the first things that it does is to assume the right to say who shall, and who shall not, enter or remain in its territory. To that principle I am bitterly opposed. I contend that I have as much right in Australia as any one who was incubated in this country. </para>

              <para>- The clause which I have moved deals with the financial aspect of this important question.&#39; We, as representatives of the people, have a duty imposed on us to see that lie revenue of the country is not drawn on to excess to carry out this legislation. What is the cause of this hysterical legislation? Has it been introduced because some British seamen have gone on strike? Is there any trouble with the Australian seamen? Have the police in the various States refused to do their duty? Is it necessary that a special Commonwealth police force be organized and superimposed upon the police forces of the States? There is no justification for the action of the Government, From my study of this measure, it appears that it is proposed to clothe these so-called peace officers with very extensive powers. The number to be appointed is problematical; there may be thousands of them. Is it intended to entirely supersede the police forces of the States? If so, the Government ought to give us some indication of its intention. The members of the police forces in all the States are capable of performing the duties of their office. Yet we are told by the Leader of the Government in the Senate that a new Commonwealth police force is necessary. Is that because the work which they will be required to do is of such a despicable, reprehensible, and contemptible character? </para>

              <para>- I was under the impression that my remarks had reference to that clause.. This clause gives no indication of the expense that will be incurred by building up a new police force to carry out work that has previously been very efficiently done, excepting possibly in the one instance of issuing new summonses under a measure that was recently passed. The existing Commonwealth police force, as far as I_ know, has been prepared and willing to carry out its work in an efficient manner. We have had no evidence whatever from the Minister, and are not likely to get any, that the police force of New South Wales refused to do its duty. This Government is not prepared to trust the police forces of the various States. It wants a new force to be, I suppose, a replica of the force that was established under the War Precautions Act, and some members of which, I believe, are yet in the service of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- We should be very careful that we do not enact legislation which would probably be most detrimental to the people of this country. To my mind, the introduction of this bill is a most condemnatory indictment against the police forces of the various States, which apparently for years past have satisfactorily carried out the work of the Commonwealth. A police force is now <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be organized, ostensibly to make effective the deportation provisions of the Immigration Act. </para>

          <para>SenatorJ. GRANT. - It is the bounden duty of the members of this Parliament, who have the power to impose unlimited taxation upon the public, to see that the revenue so collected is not needlessly expended. I am convinced that this legislation is opposed by 99 per cent. of the people, and that the establishment of a new police force will be a wicked waste of our slender financial resources. We have a right to know from the Minister how many officers it is proposed to appoint. Is it not a fact that the members of the Commonwealth police force now number about 40, of whom 35 are in New South Wales ? There is no necessity whatever to appoint more members to that force. Since the Government, without any rhyme or reason, has determined to appoint a new police force, we have a right to know what expense it will entail. When I introduced a small bill the other day, proposing to exempt a number of widows from the operation of the estate duties taxation, I received no support from the Minister. </para>

          <para>That the following newclause be inserted :  - 8a. Peace officers appointed under the preceding clause shall not take action against any person resident in Australia unless under warrant issued by the High Court of Australia. </para>
          <para class="block">In my opinion clause 8 gives too much power to any peace officers appointed under this measure. I have a very vivid recollection of the Commonwealth Police Force which was established during the 1914 conscription campaign. Officers enrolled in that body visited, without warrant, the houses of citizens at 2 or 3 o&#39;clock in the morning, frightening women and children, merely because they suspected that certain persons had transgressed the war precautions regulations. Large and competent police forces exist in all the States, and they are quite capable of seeing that law and order are preserved. There is no necessity to appoint a new police force. </para>

              <para>- I am not endeavouring to do that, but I desire to submit one or two arguments in support of the new clause that I have proposed. The  good sense of honorable senators on both sides should cause them to admit that some provision of the kind is necessary. I regret exceedingly that the proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was not accepted by the committee. I have no doubt that clause 8 and the preceding clauses are a distinct contravention of the principle of trial by jury. Having been brought up to believe that trial by jury is one of the greatest principles embodied in the British Constitution, I enter my emphatic protest against any attempt at its abrogation. </para>

          <para class="block">If this clause is inserted in the bill, the workers of our community who are seeking to settle this dispute will have a reasonable opportunity to achieve their object. The Government has shown, by its incompetence, that it is not fit to manage a fish-shop, let alone use the tremendous powers that will be conferred upon it if this bill is. passed. By the 1st January, 1927, the people of this country will have placed a different government in power, for I have no doubt that when an opportunity is afforded them to express their opinion of the total failure of the present administration in practically every direction they will be emphatic. The Government, by including the deportation provisions in the recently-passed Immigration Bill, indicated quite clearly that its deliberate intention was to cause industrial strife. Leaders in the industrial movement in Australia, who are not cloaked with anything like the authority and power of the Government, are working strenuously to settle the British seamen&#39;s dispute, but the Government, by this proposal to appoint policemen, is endeavouring to. bring about a revolt. It is worth recalling that during the recent Australian seamen&#39;s dispute not one worker committed an offence that would justify his prosecution in a law court. The same is true of the workers concerned in the present dispute. If the Government really desires this dispute to be settled it ought to &#34;keep off the grass.&#34; I am quite satisfied, however, that, with malice aforethought, it desires to extend the trouble. Even those who may not believe that can hardly disagree with me when I say that it has adopted the best possible course to achieve that end. Its policy during the last month or six weeks is calculated to antagonize every worker in the country. It apparently desires to tie up not only the British and Australian shipping, but also all foreign vessels that come here. I invite honorable senators who consider that they represent the farmers to bear in mind that the result of this must be that all our primary products will be left on our piers and wharfs indefinitely, and  will not reach the world&#39;s markets. Even at this late stage I ask the Government to abandon this policy, which is inciting the workers to revolt. In spite of the persistent endeavours of the Government in this direction. I am hopeful that the reasonable, experienced, and courageous leaders of the industrial movement in Australia will settle the British seamen&#39;s dispute as effectively as they settled the Australian shipping dispute a few weeks ago. The officers who will be appointed in pursuance of the provisions of this bill are described as peace officers. In my opinion, they could be accurately called Nationalist political organizers. This measure is the meanest form of political propaganda, and, as I have said previously, it is additional evidence of the absolute incompetence of the Government. </para>

          <para class="block">I am asking the Senate to adopt this course, because in the committee stages of the bill honorable senators were denied a reasonable opportunity to give expression to their views. Throughout the discussion in committee we were up against the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> That the committee do now divide.&#34; Nevertheless I am optimistic enough to hope that even honorable senators who, by their support of the Government, so consistently prevented free discussion in committee, will yet see that there is some merit in the amendments which I desire to submit. This bill should have had the treatment usually accorded to other measures passed by this Parliament. There can be no need for hurry now. If we are to believe reports in the evening newspapers the offenders, whom the Government are so anxious  to bring before the board, have already been served with summonses. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has maintained an air of secrecy about the whole business which I fail to understand. Perhaps I should be pleased that he has been so anxious to pass a law which may deprive him, after the next election, of the companionship of such distinguished ministerial colleagues as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neville</inline> Howse and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten.</inline> As for Senators Plain and Lynch, they may pay the penalty of their attack upon union leaders if the electors of Australia a few months&#39; hence declare that they will not tolerate legislators who supported measures of this kind. We can, of course, understand the irritation that must have been caused to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce, Senator Pearce,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page through having to accept British-born people as Cabinet colleagues. When the Government came into office it was boasted that all its Ministers were Australian born. It was a purely Australian government. But there has been a change. Whether this change was due to the capacity of, or, shall I say, intimidation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten,</inline> who had .captured the National Association in New South Wales, I cannot say, but it can no longer be claimed for the Cabinet that it is Australian through and through. </para>

              <para>- If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> had had an opportunity to consider the bill at length, you would realize, as we do, that these peace officers are to be appointed to give effect to another measure. Surely I am not out of order in showing that if we pass this bill, the purpose of which is to give effect to the deportation law, it may create a great number of vacancies in the Senate and the House of Representatives by the deportation of gentlemen who hitherto have been regarded as good citizens. The motion for the adoption of the report, I take it, covers every clause of the bill, and therefore offers more scope for debate even than the motion for the third reading of the measure. I desire the bill to be recommitted for the amendment of certain clauses and the addition of others which, in my opinion, will prevent British-born citizens of Australia from being deported. The Minister has made no statement as to the number of peace officers to be appointed under this bill. I endeavoured to limit the number t&#187; 100,000, but the Minister, by his silence and opposition to my amendment, is determined, apparently, that more than that number may be appointed. I also endeavoured in committee to prevent the Government from arming these peace officers, but the Minister and Government supporters, it would appear, are prepared, if necessary, to give effect to the threat uttered by the distinguished soldier in another place, who said that the persons concerned were likely &#34;to get it in the neck.&#34; What does this mean ? It means, of course, that, if necessary, the Government will &#34;lay out&#34; the democracy unless they bow the knee to gentlemen who, &#34;dressed in a little brief authority,&#34; are for the time being governing this country. It is a sorry day for Australia when the Government of this country is composed of men who are prepared to force through legislation of this character. For over twenty years this Parliament has maintained the reputation of being able to manage the affairs of this country in accordance with principles to which the people of Australia have been accustomed. One such principle is that in the eyes of the law all men are equal. The administration of justice has never been contaminated by making the judge on the bench a party to conviction. </para>

              <para>- If the bill be recommitted I propose to submit amendments which will have the effect of insuring a perfectly fair trial for all persons who may appear before the board. I am anxious that justice shall be administered without favour to every section of the community. I should like the  Govenment  to postpone the consideration of the measure until the authorities ascertain whether it is true that the gentlemen whose scalps they are after have been already served with- summonses to appear before the board appointed specially to convict them. On Friday night there may have been some reason for the sitting of the Senate on Saturday, and on Saturday night there may have been some reason for an adjournment until to-day to pass this new-fangled legislative experiment of first formulating a charge against certain persons, and then appointing a board to convict them. </para>

              <para>- I am sorry that in my haste I did not fully state my proposed amendment, which is to the following effect :- &#34; That peace officers shall not molest, arrest, or interfere with any one in this country unless they have had a trial by jury.&#34; This projected amendment, I hold, gives me the right to discuss the principles of the measure. I realize, of course, that it may be most objectionable to supporters of the Government to have to discuss in Parliament these secret methods of governing, which will have the effect of depriving Australian citizens of their rights under the Constitution. This bill is for the purpose of raising a force to give effect to their nefarious intention. I moved an amendment to limit that force to 100,000 persons, but the Ministry and its supporters voted against it. Surely, if these men are to be peace officers in the same way as are the police officers of the States, 100,000 men would be sufficient for the purpose. Time after time I have asked the Leader of the Government in this chamber for information on that aspect of the question, but without result. In this legislation I see an attempt to try and bring about secretly what the Government dares not attempt openly. An attempt is being made to establish a secret police force, composed of men who may be armed. I want this bill recommitted in order that I may again appeal to the calm judgment of honorable senators opposite. Hitherto honorable senators have been dragged at die heels of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> like dumb driven cattle. Those honorable senators have been led away by the eloquence of their leader. I have never heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> speak so eloquently as he did on Saturday and has done to-day. Moreover, the honorable senator has not departed from the one theme - &#34; I move that the committee do now divide.&#34; </para>

              <para>- I am sorry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that for the moment I overlooked the difference between the Senate and the committee. It must be painful to you, sir, to hear me refer to what occurred in committee, because such statements must shock the susceptibilities of any man who has any sense of decency left in him. I certainly shall obey your ruling, and shall not persist in bringing this objectionable matter before the Senate. The Senate is too dignified a chamber even to know of such discussions. Because these things have happened, and debate stifled-even  discussion of the most reasonable amendments having been refused - surely it is competent for us, having returned to the Senate, to move amendments that will give us the opportunity to let the Senate know that there are certain things in connexion with the bill that we consider should be discussed, and for which we desire that it be recommitted. I am now speaking without any deep feeling so far as the bill itself is concerned. I realize that when the methods that we have experienced during the last day or two, not only in this Parliament, but throughout Australia, are being adopted by the Government, it is a clear indication of the Government&#39;s incompetency and incapacity, and of its knowledge that it is discredited in the eyes of the people, and is looking for some means of avoiding defeat at their hands. In- its extremity, the Government has not been above degrading Parliament in an endeavour to get out of its difficulty. </para>

              <para>- I think that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> will agree that this bill is complementary to another measure. In Another place a Minister admitted that it had been introduced to punish certain individuals. The Government has not only taken out summonses against those individuals, but it has endeavoured to condemn them in Parliament. If I say that the bill should be amended so that these peace officers may not molest, arrest, or interfere with men because they were born in Great Britain and not in Australia, that the officers - supported by the Government - may not put their hands on the shoulders of an Englishman, Irishman, or a Scotchman, under conditions under which they would not be permitted to lay their hands on the shoulders of an Australian, surely that is permissible? </para>

              <para>- I availed myself of the opportunity to attack those aspects of the bill that appeared to me to  Vie  the most pernicious. In another place, to which I am not allowed to refer, a detailed discussion of the bill was denied me. Having been denied my rights there,  I  lake this opportunity in the Senate to move that the bill be recommitted to discuss those aspects of it which I consider to be most objectionable. I consider it to be objectionable to call into existence a body of peace officers, and to arm them with warrants that can only be served upon one small section of this community. The population of Australia is 85 per cent. Australian, the remaining 15 per cent, being composed of persons who are British-born or of other nationalities. Why should 85 per cent, of the people permit a body of men, who are to be called peace officers, to be appointed to serve writs or summonses upon the 15 per cent., while they themselves are allowed to go free because they have been born in Australia? </para>

              <para>- I suppose, sir, that you are doing your duty as you see it, even as I am doing my duty as I see it. I have indicated one of the amendments which I propose to move, namely, that these peace officers shall not treat a person born in England in a different manner from that in which they shall treat Australian-born citizens. I shall now indicate an additional amendment, namely, that these officers shall not be armed. Surely, if they are to be peace officers there is no occasion to arm them! Recently, when a Labour government was in office in Victoria it discovered that, secretly and silently, a Victorian Tory government had armed certain citizens. In dealing with a measure of this character, we surely can expect the Minister to say whether it is intended to arm these officers, and whether they are to be authorized secretly to draw the sword, or to shoot down Australians, and, if so, under what conditions. An amendment of such importance should be considered. I have asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to deny that that is the Government&#39;s intention, but he has not denied it. If that, is not the intention, why does he not say so ? If the Minister will say now that it is not intended to arm these officers, that they will not form a secret organization, I shall be satisfied. We have been told that this bill is the result of discussion between the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archdale</inline> Parkhill, an organizer of the National Federation. The Prime Minister did not deny that. I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to say whether he discussed the situation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archdale</inline> Parkhill. </para>

              <para>- He merely asked for proof of the statement. Another amendment that I shall move provides that when a summons is drafted, even though it has not been served, the Government, who formulates the charge, shall be prevented by law from trying by public utterances to prejudice the case of the person whom it intends to bring before the secret board. In this Senate and in other places the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> have tried to discredit <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Walsh and somebody else. One stinging statement was to the effect that Tom Walsh was the worst citizen that had ever been in Australia. It would appear that in the opinion of some people his actions are even more atrocious than the misdeeds of brutal murderers and molesters of children. What can be thought of Min isters sworn to administer the affairs of this country who first issue a summons and&#39; then try to discredit the person against whom it is issued before he is brought to trial? I wish to put in the bill an amendment to prevent that kind of thing. I know that, we can do nothing to interfere with the privileges of Parliament, but this is the first time in my long parliamentary career that T have known a government to set out to prosecute a person, and to condemn him by public utterances before he is brought to trial. </para>

              <para>- This bill cannot be considered .apart from the Immigration Act. I venture to say that this extraordinary sitting to-day is due to the fact that a State government would not carry out certain work for this Government. The Peace Officers Bill has there fore been introduced. I could understand its introduction in a time of crisis, when the business interests of this country were threatened. I realize that the task of the British shipping companies in reducing the seamen&#39;s wages is being made very difficult, and that this Government is most anxious to help the British shipping companies. Honorable senators opposite are lining themselves up with Inchcape and Company to bring about a reduction of &#163;1 per month in the wages of British seamen. </para>

              <para>- The Minister is most careful in his statements. I heard him to-day, in committee, make at least twenty harmless speeches, every one of which was - &#34;I move that the committee do now divide.&#34; .This Government is so anxious to assist the British shipping interest that it has introduced a bill with the object of appointing officers, the number of which is unknown. Can I, therefore) be blamed for imagining that the Government is acting in collusion with Inchcape and Company? No special legislation was introduced when the Commonwealth Government Shipping Line was held up. Why is there any necessity to introduce special legislation now that British ves&#34;sels are held up? The Ministry should inform the Senate and the public of its intentions. We should know if this new force is to be armed, and whether it is to be used to &#34;bull-doze&#34; the unions. All we know is that the whole of this mighty force is to be used to arrest Tom Walsh and Jacob Johannsen, who are the elected leaders of the Seamen&#39;s Union. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and I re-  pudiate  any statements of that kind. I hall always repudiate any sentiment that -aims at interference with or injury to any portion of the British Empire. J cannot but conclude that a secretly armed organization is to be formed to assist the power-holding classes to crush unionism and its aspirations. The most dangerous thing to have in existence is a suspicion of wrongdoing when wrongdoing does not exist. If there is wrongdoing, and the offender shows that none was intended, the matter ends there, but a grave suspicion of wrongdoing iD the minds of the community cannot be readily removed. The press of this country have deliberately enlarged upon the dangers of communism. I pointed out in committee that about a dozen&#39; communist candidates stood at the last New South &#34;Wales election, and polled Jess than 800 votes. That surely shows that their influence in this country is very small. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has deliberately tried to misrepresent me, but I have been so long in this Senate and in the public life of this country that I am not afraid of mud thrown like that sticking to me. I have on more than one occasion offered my opposition to any pro-, posalof  any section of the communists to act on other than constitutional lines. The Labour party, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was at one time a distinct ornament and useful member, has always stood solidly foi constitutional methods and procedure. If the Minister thinks that I stand for revolutionary methods, and would be a party to any measure that takes from Britisher&#39;s the privileges handed down by &#187; Magna Charta, or that takes from Australians that clear charter of liberty given under the Commonwealth Constitution, all that I can say is that he has grown weaker than I have ever known him to be. The Labour party is not fighting for the communists, but against the degradation of this Parliament through having such measures as this put on the statute-book. We are now fighting for further consideration of this bill, realizing that governments are strengthened by wise measures and weakened by unwise legislation. If the Minister reads the newspapers he will see that the unions have been fighting Walsh and Johannsen, but persistence in legislation of this nature will drive them into one camp. It may not be very detrimental to the interests of the community to have Walsh and Johannsen fighting for revolution, which they believe in, but this bill, side by side with measures already adopted by the Government, will prove a greater menace to the liberty of the people than all the revolutionary agitators in the country. Liberty will be at an end when citizens are liable to be arrested by these peace officers and brought before a board appointed to convict them. All that the Labour party says is that citizens shall not be molested unless they are to be given a trial by jury. Of course, there are other aspects of the bill with which we desire to deal. We want to know what the board will cost, and what wages will be paid to the peace officers. It is reasonable to contend that Parliament should determine the expenditure necessary, andthat the payment should not be made merely on the Governor-General&#39;s warrant. Whether the force is to be great or small, Parliament should be consulted as to any necessary disbursement of public funds, for it has always enjoyed that prerogative. I wish the bill to be amended so that the Government will be required to make known exactly how much is to be spent on this force, by laying on the table a list of the men enrolled, and the salaries to be paid them. I ask this, not for my own benefit, but as one who claims to be a protector of the public purse. I foreshadowed an amendment limiting the expenditure to &#163;25,000,000, and I suggested that the number of the force should be limited to 100,000. The committee showed its disapproval, and I saved honorable senators&#39; time by not moving amendments to that effect. Honorable senators opposite have an exaggerated idea of the Government&#39;s powers if they think that this matter will be left to the will of the Governor-General. They will find that they are making a serious mistake. They may proceed on these lines for six months, but next April they will have to face the electors, who will remind them that they supported this bill, although the Government refused to state how much was to be expended under it, and Parliament was denied an opportunity to consider the cost with a view to either increasing or reducing it. I can imagine <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> saying that Tom Walsh threatened the community with a revolu tion, and Parliament was forced to adopt strong measures. The electors will reply - &#34;If any persons were acting against the peace, order, and good government of the country, the proper thing for the Government to do was to prosecute them in the courts of the land. This Government has been in office for two years and six months, and I have not heard of its haling any of these persons before the courts. There may have been a few trivial charges brought against them, but I think that the prosecutions have generally fizzled out. Now an alteration in the whole principle of the law is proposed. Although the Opposition realizes that it cannot prevent the passage of the bill, it intends to make it as difficult as possible to give effect to a measure that differentiates between a citizen born in Great Britain and one born in Australia. I want Australians to be first in all things, on their merits, and not because of special privileges conferred upon them by Parliament. I stand here to-day as the outspoken champion of the British Empire. I want to see British people held together by bonds of love and sympathy, and I wish to prevent this stupid Government from passing a law which will differentiate between Britishers. </para>

              <para>- He gave evidence upon oath in a court of law that his name was Jacob Johnson. Whatever his name may be, surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is broadminded enough, to know that, great as the British Empire is, there are decent men belonging to other nations. 1 daresay that we should find in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> home a photograph of William of Holland. 1 do not desire to reflect upon the House of Brunswick, but nobody is in the habit of taking exception to those whose name was Wettin  and is, I think, now changed to Windsor. Whether a man is a union secretary or not he is entitled to respect. I have great respect for union leaders.  They always have to bear the brunt of the criticism levelled at their unions, and many a time they have to advocate, proposals with which they personally disagree, for the simple reason that they are loyal to the men who put them in their positions. If some of these men have conducted themselves as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> suggests, why has this wicked Government not brought them to justice before? It is one thing to punish wrongdoers, but it is. an entirely different matter to devise un-British ways of bringing them to book. I merely ask that the bill be recommitted, so that we may reconsider clauses 1 to 8, and have an opportunity&#39; of proposing certain additional clauses, so that the courts of justice will be open to Australians and Englishmen alike. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> particularly, will bear in mind that the high respect in which the courts of Australia are -now held is due to the fact that the judges have acted fairly as umpires, pointing out what the law is, but not participating in the verdict. This board and these peace officers will be partisans, and how can the board&#39;s verdicts be received with respect? Such a proposal can only minimize respect for the law in the minds of all right-thinking men and women. </para>

            <para>. - I second the motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has not had sufficient time to set out fully the reasons why the bill should be recommitted, and I desire, therefore,, to give additional arguments in support of his contention. I find that the power to appoint peace officers, instead of being given to the Minister for Home and Territories, is to be delegated to the Attorney-General. In New South Wales I understand that the appointment of the police force is exclusively the function of the Chief Secretary. In that State every possible step is taken to see that the men appointed to these responsible positions are fully qualified by reason of both age and physique to discharge their duties efficiently. Under this bill, however, it is proposed to give the Attorney-General the appointment of these men, and he is to be clothed with power to delegate his powers to some unknown . authority. I should like to see the bill recommitted for the purpose of amending clause 2, with a view to removing from the AttorneyGeneral the power that it is proposed to confer upon him to appoint these officers, and to invest that power in the Minister for- Home and Territories. It is a proper function of the Department of Home and Territories to attend to the internal affairs of the nation. These proposed appointees will have to carry into effect the provisions of&#34; an act that was recently passed by the Parliament, and they ought to possess special qualifications. No provision is made in the bill that they shall pass an examination, or possess any qualification. The Senate . passed recently a measure dealing with the salary of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. No hesitancy was shown when it came to specifying the salary that he should receive. The Northern Australian Bill also provided that the members of the proposed commission should receive a salary up to, but not exceeding, a certain sum. There is no such provision in this bill. The salaries of members of- </para>

          <para class="block">Parliament and officers of the Public Service are well known. Why should there not be a schedule to the bill setting out the conditions of appointment, and the salaries of the proposed peace officers? It is intended merely to give the AttorneyGeneral the power to appoint these men and pay them any salary that he thinks fit. I strongly condemn a policy that will lead to the singling out of any individual for special treatment. All men in Australia should be subject to the operation of the same laws. These officers will have almost unlimited powers, and their duties will be of a very responsible character. At present 85 per cent. of the population of Australia is native-born. Why should that 85 per cent. arrogate to itself the right to&#34; deal in a more drastic way with those who are born outside Australia than with those who are native-born. Why should we blazon forth to the people of Great Britain the fact that if they come here they will not be treated in the manner in which Australians are treated? That is clearly set out. </para>

              <para>- There is another reason why I desire that the bill should be recommitted. When a member of the Public Service wishes to resign he does not experience very great trouble in doing so. If he hands in his resignation, or if he is discharged, his connexion with the Public Service abruptly ceases. This bill, however, proposes that no peace officer shall be at liberty to resign his office, or to withdraw from the duties thereof, unless expressly authorized so to do by the Attorney-General or the person thereto authorized in writing by the Attorney-General, or unless he gives the Attorney-General or the authorized person three months&#39; notice in writing of his intention to so resign, or withdraw; and any peace officer who so resigns or withdraws without such previous permission or notice shall be guilty of an offence for which the penalty is &#163;50 or imprisonment for three months. Such a provision should not be countenanced for a single moment. When the bill is recommitted, I propose to move an amendment under which appointees will have the right to resign on giving 24 hours&#39; notice. A member of this Parliament can resign at a moment&#39;s notice. One did so recently.  His  resignation was placed before the  President,  and accepted immediately. The position of a member of this Parliament is very much more important than that of a proposed peace officer. </para>

The clause will not give members of this Parliament an opportunity to know what the Government is doing. The Executive is appointed to carry out the work of the Parliament, but at the same time Parliament should know what is is doing. </para>

I could understand that there was some measure of reason in the Government pressing forward this bill if there was any sign of a serious or grave industrial dispute in Australia, but that is not so. I would suggest, therefore, that the bill be shelved. I do not like to anticipate trouble, but I feel sure that the passage of a measure of this description will cause an industrial disturbance No honorable senator desires that. I do not wish it to be thought that honorable senators on this side of the chamber have opposed this bill because they countenance anything in the nature of industrial disturbances. </para>

              <para>- We have opposed this bill because we object to any interference with our British liberties. Our existing law courts and machinery for the administration- of justice are quite sufficient to deal with any persons in the community who break the law. We object to the creation of tribunals such as that constituted under the provisions of the Immigration Act. If the Standing Orders had permitted me to do so, I should have moved to insert the words &#34; this day week &#34; instead of &#34; this day six months,&#34; for I believe that the dispute to which the Government intends to apply the machinery which will be created in pursuance to the provisions of this bill will in a week&#39;s time have been amicably settled. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> stated this afternoon, the industrial leaders in Australia and Great Britain are working hard to achieve that desirable end. It is well within the memory of honorable senators that, notwithstanding the aggravation caused by the introduction of the Immigration Bill during the Australian seamen&#39;s dispute, a few weeks ago, our industrial leaders were able to effect a peaceful settlement of that trouble. I believe that their efforts will be equally successful in the British seamen&#39;s dispute. In view of the professions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that he desires to maintain industrial peace in Australia, I cannot see how he can do other than accept the amendment. Apart from that, however, we ought to postpone further consideration of this bill for the reason that the Government has given us no information whatever as to the number of men it proposes to appoint, nor the salaries it proposes to pay. These are important aspects of the subject. This morning&#39;s press informed lis that the Government was determined to force the passage of this bill, irrespective of whether the British seamen&#39;s dispute was settled. Why should it be necessary to have a measure like this on the statute-book when there is no need for it? Wise and sound advice has been sent to the British seamen to obey the orders of their executive. Knowing all this, why should not the Government accept my amendment? The trouble will be disposed of within  a  few days. I want again to refer to the threat which, according to the press, has been made by Ministers, that, whether the dispute is settled immediately or not, they will, go ahead with, the enforcement of the deportation provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. Evidently, any person not Australian-born who takes part in any industrial trouble is to be sent out of Australia. But, if that is done, Ministers cannot avoid being themselves the creators of industrial strife. We are also told in the press that the board appointed under the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act held a meeting yesterday, which was Sunday. I believe that before hearing any evidence it has made up its mind to deport certain persons from Australia. But that will not be the end. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> whether any resident of Australia can be deported on a decision of this board without having the right to appeal to the highest tribunal in the land. </para>

              <para>- I am anxious to prevent this bill from going through hastily. My reasons for seeking to postpone the third reading I can briefly state. The most important reason is that we should refuse to be panic-stricken and driven into a state of hysteria merely because the Government of the day happens to have got into such a state. Another reason is that what is happening outside is not as serious as the Government thinks it is. Endeavours are now being made to bring the strike of British seamen to a successful termination . Another reason is that the Government has not seen fit to tell us what expenditure will be entailed in administering this measure. We have had nothing hut a general statement from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that whatever expenditure is necessary will be incurred. Parliament should not be asked to come to a decision blind-folded in this way. 1 should like first of all to be told what it will cost the country to embark upon something which may be and is, in my opinion, unnecessary. We should have an indication as to the number of Commonwealth police officers, or, to give them the more dignified term, peace officers, likely to be appointed. We should know what  their  standing will be, and who they are. We should be told if they are to be recruited from the public service. Will the Government call upon certain members of the public service to undertake this work at the risk of losing their positions, or their chances of promotion, if they refuse? Will the members of the police force created in 1916 be used for this purpose? If those men are to be employed, we should know who they are and what remuneration they will be paid. </para>
