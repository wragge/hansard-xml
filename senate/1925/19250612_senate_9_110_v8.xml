The wool shown in the Australian Pavilion at Wembley, 1924, consisted of scoured wool, and wool in various stages of manufacture.

The fleeces sent Home last year were exhibited in dustproof glass cases, and were in excellent condition, and no replacement this year was necessary. The exhibit this year is a much improved one upon that of last year. </para>

                                <para>- The results so far obtained by the Commonwealth Dried Fruits Control Board under its scheme of marketing Australian dried fruit in Great Britain are satisfactory. The question of increasing the amounts now paid by way of advances under the Export Guarantee Act is under consideration by the Dried Fruits Control Board. I may add that under the act it is not the function of the Government to increase the advances. The question has been submitted to the board, which is giving it careful consideration. </para>

                        <para>The matter is still the subject of litigation. Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh obtained leave from the Full Court of New South Wales to appeal to the Privy Council against the order made by the Supreme Court granting leave to the Commonwealth to enforce judgment. The Commonwealth appealed to the High Court against leave to appeal to the Privy Council being granted, and the High Court granted the appeal. Messrs. Kidman and Mayoh are now petitioning the Privy Council direct for special leave to appeal, and the Commonwealth is opposing such leave being granted. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to congratulate the Government on its administration during the recess, when many developmental works were proceeded with to the advantage of the people of the Commonwealth. I also commend the Government for its adoption of a comprehensive programme of legislation based on broad and democratic lines as disclosed in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. The financial year is about to close, and never in the history of the Commonwealth has the position been so satisfactory. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so, and I shall prove my assertion later. The Commonwealth and State Savings Banks&#39; deposits are a true reflex of the financial position of the masses, and not of that of the wealthy class, who, as the honorable senator well knows, use only the cheque-paying banks. The statistics contained in the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book</inline> reveal that the position regarding the percentage of the people who have credit balances in the Savings Banks is unprecedented in Australia, and unparalleled in any country. </para>

                        <para>- The returns show that no less than 64 per cent, of the  total men, women, and children of Australia have credit balances in the State Savings Banks, as distinct from other banks. When the Labour party was in power nothing like the same percentage of deposits obtained. The credit balances in the Savings Banks amount to &#163;172,000,000. Since the advent of the Nationalist Government the figures respecting the number of depositors, the gross amount deposited, and the average amount deposited per head, have increased enormously. It is as well that that is so, because were the people not so prosperous they might be misled, and return to power at the next election a party pledged to socialism, and driven by outside organizations. </para>

                        <para>- The supporters of some honorable senators would like nothing better than to see a  revolu-&#34;  tion in Australia. The Labour party is pledged to socialization of industry and the means of production and exchange. The people of Australia are well educated, sensible, and good thinking, and they do not want socialism, communism, or bolshevism, the last mentioned being the greatest curse that has arisen in the history of the world. Bolshevism is much worse than was the world war. One only needs to read the unbiased reports as to the conditions existing in Russia to realize the terrible plight of the people. Those conditions have been investigated by men representative of all countries, classes, and political beliefs, and they one and all hold up their hands in horror at the state of Russia owing to the advent of bolshevism. </para>

                    <para>For five months I have studied the distress and agony of the Russian people. I hare learned to know the ignominy of these butchers. To appreciate it one must have seen the sufferings of the Russian people, heard that endless moan that resounds from the Pacific Ocean as far as Poland, the moan of an enslaved and martyred people. One must hear the tragic . appeal which reaches us incessantly from a country of terror and death. I have travelled through their moribund villages and their ruined countryside. I have been in their dungeons. I have seen the ditches in which they have shot their victims. I have seen the misery of the multitude and the luxury of the rulers. </para>

This should be sufficient to convince misguided sympathizers with bolshevism that the movement is one of the cruellest of autocracies, and should be condemned by all who are real democrats working for the uplifting of mankind. I should not have introduced this subject had it not been that exception was taken to some of my remarks on Empire Day. At the State schools and colleges at Geelong I and other public men on that day gave some patriotic speeches, in which we spoke of the history of the Empire.

I do not know whether or not to call the communists the supporters of honorable senators opposite, but they do support the platform of the Labour party. Before the advent of bolshevism, Russia was one of the largest producers of grain in the world, but the Russian people are starving to-day, and the Soviet Government increased the price of wheat against the workers of the world by going into the market some months ago and putting up the price to 7s. a bushel. Russia used to be able to supply the people with cheap grain. War is bad enough, but communism and bolshevism are worse. </para>

                        <para>- The people of Australia will never change as regards loyalty - they will always desire Australia to remain within the British Empire. There is nothing surer than that. I hope that the honorable senator who interjected is not so misguided as to think that the people of this country have any desire to be anywhere except within the Empire. The Government is prepared to &#34; do its bit &#34; in upholding and defending the White Australia policy. What did the Labour party in Great Britain do whilst it was in power ? One of the first acts of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald was to scrap the proposal to construct the naval base at Singapore, which is absolutely essential to the safety of Australia and New Zealand, and the protection of our trade routes in the Pacific Ocean. All experts agree that Singapore is the throat of the Pacific. The building of a base there was agreed to by the Washington Conference, the delegates to which realized that it was intended to be used for defensive purposes, and not for purposes of aggression. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald, who with his party was quickly kicked out of office in Great Britain, did not care a hang for the White Australia policy. He said that he did not believe in it. </para>

                        <para>- A &#34; faked &#34; letter be jiggered ! Surely the honorable senator has more common sense than to believe that? The first act of the Labour Government in Great Britain was a condemnation of the White Australia policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald said that he would not spend a farthing upon the base at Singapore. That action was not taken because he and his party were pacifists, and would not spend any thing upon defence. They were prepared to adopt the selfish, insular policy of spending millions upon an air force to defend the British Isles; but for Australia, New Zealand, and other parts of the Empire, they did not care a fig. They condemned holus bolus the White Australia policy, and declined to lift a finger to assist us to maintain that policy, which this Government is determined, shall be maintained. To that end an excellent defence policy has been formulated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Graham</inline> says that the letter which was responsible for the downfall of the Labour party in Great Britain was a forgery. That party would have liked to prove that it was a forgery, but, on the contrary, it was proved up to the hilt that it was a genuine original document. I am surprised that any honorable senator in this great democracy should by word or action favour the attitude of either the Russian Soviet or the Labour party in Great Britain, which was so anti-Australian in all its dealings. That Government not only flirted openly with Russia, but also plotted secretly to lend that country millions of pounds at a time when everybody knows it owed the British Empire millions of pounds that it had not the slightest intention of repaying. There are in this country persons who favour the repudiation of national debts. This Government is prepared to do its share towards maintaining the policy of a White Australia. It realizes that the Navy must be our first line of defence. Australia has a coastline of just on 12,000 miles practically undefended. It is one of the richest and most tempting prizes in the world. Any person who loves his country must be ready to defend it. The Government has a definite policy. </para>

                        <para>- Defence and immigration to enable Australia to be defended and developed. Apparently, honorable senators opposite do not believe in defence. Realizing that the Navy, must be the first line of defence, the Government has let a contract for the construction of two 10,000-ton up-to-date cruisers, which the terms of the Washington Treaty allow Australia to have. So successful was the Government in the matter of cost that it was able to save &#163;1,500,000 by building&#39; both cruisers in Great Britain; and owing to this saving it proposes to build two sea-going submarines, and, also, in Australia, a seaplane carrier, and to subsidize the Government of the State of New South Wales in the building of a floating dock at Newcastle. In the development of aviation generally the Government has very rightly decided to encourage civil aviation, of which great use can be made. Civil aviation has been assisted in Western Australia and western Queensland, where it has been responsible for the carriage of mails, and the saving of a great deal of life in the remote portions of the state which lack medical conveniences and the ordinary means of communication. The Government intends to continue to encourage the expansion of civil aviation and the air force generally, and has spent a large sum at Point Cook. The Government further believes that it will be in the best interests of the people to create the nucleus of a highly-trained land staff in all its branches. It is not desirable to maintain a large standing army, but it is essential to have the nucleus of a highly-trained staff in case Australia should be attacked at any time. We have admirable material with which to raise a splendid army  that was proved by the deeds of the sons of Australia in the last war. The Government, and every right-thinking person in the community, naturally abhors war. It is a terrible thing, and I pray that it will not again be witnessed in any part of the world, let alone in Australia. But it would, nevertheless, be unmanly to neglect to prepare for defence. Not only is the Government training experts in all branches of defence, but it is also providing employment in the factories that have been established for the manufacture cf small arms, ammunition, gun carriages, and everything that is necessary for defence. </para>

                        <para>- It astonishes me that the honorable senator does not ask, &#34; Why do you have a defence policy ? &#34; There are a lot of people who wish to forget the war. The mothers, wives, and sweethearts of the 60,000 magnificent Australians who gave their lives and of the 100,000 odd who returned to Australia crippled and broken in health, in order  that  we- who remained behind might live in security, are not likely to forget the war. There are too many people who are preaching &#34; Forget the war.&#34; </para>

We must be in a position to defend this country should it be attacked. I should like honorable senators opposite to enunciate their defence policy for the benefit of the people of Australia.

I have worked in industries alongside Australian workmen and those of other countries, and I would give the preference to the Australian workmen. I admire his ability.

                        <para>- The plant required for rolling armoured plates is totally different from that used for rolling plates for merchant ships. By spending up to &#163;1,000,000 to install a mill to roll armoured plates, we could, in Australia, build the hulls. But that represents only half the cost of the cruisers. The other half of the cost goes in equipping the vessels with guns and scientific instruments, which, even in the Mother Country itself, can only be supplied. by two firms there. If it had been possible to build these cruisers in Australia, and thus afford employment, and establish an industry, I would have been one of the first to say, &#34; Never mind the &#163;1,500,000 that would be saved to the taxpayers of Australia by having them built in Great Britain. It is better to establish a shipbuilding industry in Australia.&#34; But I realized that the building of cruisers of this description in Australia would not establish any industry in Australia, and would not afford any considerable employment. The Government has, I think, taken the right course in spending the &#163;1,500,000 it has saved by having a seaplane carrier built at Cockatoo Island, and by subsidizing the Government of New South Wales to build a dock at Newcastle. Firstly, it has safeguarded the interests of the White Australia policy; secondly, it has had regard to the interests of the taxpayers of Australia; and, thirdly, it has taken steps to afford employment to as many people as is possible under existing circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- We are assured by the Government that it will be built in Australia. Honorable senators opposite do not appear to like the true position in regard to these contracts, and the policy of the Government being made known. They slur over the great saving of money that will be effected. They conceal the fact that it is impossible to equip and build the cruisers in Australia, and that had it been possible to do so, only 15 per cent, of the material used in their construction could have been drawn from Australian sources. The building of warships is not an industry we want to establish in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am surprised that any honorable senator should point the finger of scorn at the British Navy or the British Government&#39;s method of building warships. The British Navy has proved to be the most efficient in the world&#39;s history. It is almost entirely responsible for Australia&#39;s immunity from attack. It has made the waterways of the world free to all nations. It has protected the trade routes. It has protected Australia for 150 years. It is protecting the honorable senator to-day. </para>

I do not think that the honorable senator wishes to infer that the British builders will not build our cruisers efficiently, and that the vessels will not be up Jo specification, or delivered promptly. If we&#39; had spent another &#163;1,500,000, and built the cruisers ourselves - if we could have done so - would the hulls have been delivered up to time, and according to specifications? And if they had not been, who would have been penalized? </para>

                        <para>- We have already had the experience of the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide,</inline> which was obsolete when she was launched. We cannot afford&#39; to take that risk again with due regard to the interests of our White Australia policy. We want these cruisers &#39; built according to the specifications of our experts, and we want them delivered on the due date. If they are not built in accordance with the specifications, or are not delivered on the due date, clauses in the contract provide for heavy penalties on the contractors. Suppose, on the other hand, the cruisers were built in Australia, at Walsh Island or Cockatoo Island Dockyard, which both belong to the people of Australia. We should penalize either the Government of New South Wales, or the people of the Commonwealth, if we inflicted penalties on either Walsh Island or Cockatoo Island Dockyard for the late delivery of the cruisers, or for a departure from the specifications. It is impossible to predict when any work can be&#34; completed in Australia as things are going to-day, and so long as the anions are misled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Walsh or by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johannsen,</inline> or Johnson, or whatever he calls himself- </para>

                        <para>- These men do not want to give employment; they want to cause unemployment. They want to set up the class hatred and disruption which they preach day after day. They are friendly with the bolsheviks. They want bloody revolution. That is why these foreigners are in Australia. I am surprised that any democrat of this country, should directly or indirectly raise his voice in defence of men who cause so much unemployment and consequent suffering to the wives and children of men who are anxious to work if they are allowed to do so. The Labour Government in Great Britain, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald, did not care two straws about the position of Australia. Surely the official Labour party of today has not scrapped the ideals of the old Labour party, which, with its constructive policy, was, in my opinion, one of the best parties we ever had in Australia. It gave us the Australian Navy. It gave us also a fine system of compulsory military training for our youths. War or no war - I pray to God we never will have another - it is good, physically and mentally, for the youths of any country to have military training. I am an Australian through and through, and a warm supporter of a Government that is Australian through and through. This is the first truly Australian Government in the history of the Commonwealth. With the exception of one who was recently appointed, Ministers are all Australian born. </para>

                        <para>- That is not a fact. They are Australians through and through, and many have fought for this country. Has the official Labour party abandoned the ideal of a White Australia? We know that their future leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> has pronounced himself entirely in favour of the influx of Italians into northern- Queensland. They make good unionists, he says, so he does not see why any restriction should be placed upon their introduction. What has become of the old Labour party and its ideals? The policy of the present Labour party, if it has a policy at all, is destructive of all that the old party stood for. The present Labour party gave wholehearted support to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ramsay</inline> MacDonald, the Leader of the Labour Government in the Old Country, notwithstanding that he had openly expressed his hostility to the White Australia policy. Surely the present Labour party is not going to throw that overboard. Surely it intends to support some constructive policy for the defence of the Commonwealth. It is not the slightest use for a handful of people, such as we are, in a vast country like Australia, to declare for a White Australia policy unless we are prepared, if the occasion arises, to defend it like men. At present we have a coastline of about 12,000 miles practically undefended. Will any honorable senator say that we do not want a Navy, an Air Force, and the nucleus of a highly-trained land force, as well as establishments for the manufacture of arms and munitions? Does the Labour party, as at present constituted, believe in defending the White Australia policy? </para>

                        <para>- As the result of the Washington Conference. We were in honour bound to do that, in order to prevent the threatened race in the construction of warships. Other countries have done likewise. We were very well represented at that Conference by the Leader of the Government in the Senate at the present time. Do honorable senators suggest that instead of sinking the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> we could have hidden that vessel somewhere and have pretended that we had sunk it in conformity with the decision of the Washington Conference? All the other nations that were signatories to the Washington Treaty have scrapped similar capital ships. Apparently the official Labour party is prepared to scrap the White Australia policy, and has no intention of defending this Australia of ours. </para>

We believe in singing the &#34;National Anthem &#34; and honoring the Union Jack. Apparently they believe in the &#34; Red Flag &#34; song, and look upon the red flag with favour. </para>

                        <para>- I should say it was hell, not harmony. Surely there is nothing in the &#34;Red Flag&#34; song that can appeal to freedom-loving Australians? And if members of the Labour party are striving for harmony - if they want to sing in the dining room or in their own party room - let them sing the &#34; National Anthem&#34; instead of the &#34;Red Flag,&#34; which is an insult to the great bulk of the people of Australia and to this Parliament. I know that, individually&#39;, honorable senators opposite are ashamed of the incident. Individually they are a fine lot of men, but collectively they seem to be misled. I am sure that, if they consulted their own feelings, they would apologize to the House for insulting other members, and all those who attend to our wants in this building, as well as the sentiments of every right thinking person in the community, by singing the &#34; Red Flag&#34; in this building. I am sorry that this matter has been raised, but I feel it my duty to say what I think. If there is one thing that I glory in it is the integrity and unity of the British Empire. I honour the Union  Jack.  I stand for the National Anthem, but 1 abhor the red flag and all that it means. The red flag and those foreign agitators who are rampant in this country are a curse to the workers of Australia: These foreigners are holding up industry on every hand, and are throwing thousands of people out of work. The Australian workman only wants to be left alone, and to have the opportunity to work for his wife and children. </para>

I do not believe for a moment that the honorable senator who has interjected has sympathy for anything that is anti-British, and I remind him that the red flag is a symbol of all that is opposed to the spirit of freedom enjoyed under the Union Jack. The honorable senator knows this, and he and his friends one day will be sorry. If the electors knew what was happening here honorable senators opposite would never &#39; be returned, because the great masses of the people of Australia are absolutely loyal. They do not want <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh, Mr. Johannsen,</inline> and the other foreign agitators who are battening on the workers. They want to work for the good wages that are waiting for them under the best conditions in the world, and they want their women and children to enjoy that prosperity which is within the reach of all in this the freest country in the world. </para>

Reports, which have never been contradicted, com9 to us that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. and Mrs. Walsh</inline> were married, under the red flag, and that their child was born under the same emblem. These agitators and communists are ready enough, whenever it suits them, to claim the protection of the Union Jack. They profess to be pro-British whenever it suits them, but when it comes to marriage and the dedication of their children, they turn to the red flag. But enough of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walsh.</inline> He is a curse to the working-class people of Australia. The workers have nothing in common with the red flag, nor have they, or honorable senators opposite, any sympathy with Walsh or Johannsen, but they are misled by outside organizations, which in turn are being undermined and riddled by communists and bolsheviks from foreign countries. </para>

We are glad that the royal commission considers that the returned soldiers have been well treated. We know that Australia has treated them more generously and better than other countries have treated their soldiers. The amount of money spent on the repatriation of Australian soldiers up to date amounts to &#163;150,000,000. I want to impress upon the public, and upon honorable senators, that I am not a soldier. One country &#34; rag,&#34; said to be edited or partly owned by a Labour member in another place, insinuated that I was a one-legged man masquerading in the State of Victoria as a returned soldier. Although I am not a returned soldier, I am, nevertheless in close touch with the Returned Soldiers&#39; Associations. I admit that we have treated the returned soldiers generously, but I shall never be satisfied that we have treated them well enough. It is absolutely beyond our power to repay them for their services. Although we have done so much for them, there still exist anomalies, which I am determined, as far a3 it be in my power, to straighten out.Senator Hoare. - There are a good many anomalies. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the honorable senator will reply to my remarks later. It is the bounden duty of honorable senators opposite to say whether they are in favour of the continuation of the White Australia policy, and whether they prefer the Red* Flag to the Union Jack. Many of the anomalies that I have brought before the Repatriation  Commissioners  have been righted, but I am not yet satisfied. I am not content with the treatment of the partly-blinded soldiers, on whose behalf I intend shortly to lead a deputation to the Repatriation Commission. I am also concerned with a deputation of limbless soldiers to meet in Geelong next Monday. These men admit that they are better treated than are the soldiers of other countries, and they know perfectly well that they have received greater benefits from the Nationalist Government than they would have obtained from any other Government. Tom Walsh, anti-Britisher, and his satellites refused to permit the loading of foodstuffs for our men at the front. These agitators would do the same thing to-morrow if our boys were still fighting. I am prepared to do all I can to assist those men who during the years of war suffered unadulterated hell in the trenches fighting for those of us in Australia who  could  not do our bit. </para>

                <para>The Commonwealth Government is anxious to- develop the northern parts of Australia. It has realized how material it is that something should be done to increase the population in that area. Active steps are being taken in this direction, and it is hoped that the states will co-operate. Money has already been expended in building roads and railways, and this work is giving employment to a large number of people. </para>
                <para>Respecting the construction of the north-south railway, I favour the eastern deviation both for developmental and defence purposes. Such a railway would open up better country, and link up with the railways of New South Wales and Queensland, running west and northwest. From a defence point of view it is utterly absurd to construct a line through the dead heart of Australia, although I admit that the Macdonnell Ranges comprise a. handful of good country. If it were necessary to defend the Northern Territory from, invasion, a direct route through the Territory would be useless. Adelaide would be the starting point, and troops, guns, and munitions would have to be transported there before being dispatched to the Territory. On the other hand, the eastern deviation would permit of troops, guns, and munitions being poured into the Territory from Rockhampton, Townsville, Newcastle, Sydney and Melbourne, and, in fact, from any part of the eastern states, where nearly all of our population is. </para>

                <para>Good progress has been made with the development of the River Murray. Enormous sums have been spent on developmental works. Several locks have been built, and it has now been decided to increase the height of the  Hume Weir so as to conserve a greater expanse of water, and at the same time to generate electrical power from the spill-over. The  conservation and distribution of water are vital factors in the growth of Australia. , </para>
                <para>This Government was the first to make a road grant of &#163;500,000 to the states. When the budget is brought down I hope that the grant will be increased to &#163;1,000,000. I am strongly in favour of road development, because good roads are a national asset. They enable the settlers to get their produce to market, and, when necessary, can be used for defence purposes. I regret that any unemployment should prevail throughout Australia. The Federal Government has provided a lot of work on railway and road construction, and by giving the states large sums of money for road development; but in this regard, I want the amount to be at least doubled. Most of the unemployment is due to strikes brought about by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Walsh and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johannsen.</inline> The hold-up of shipping really means the hold-up of industry. The workers of Australia lost last year, owing to strikes, nearly &#163;1,500,000 in wages. The agitators by their actions have almost strangled the shipping industry and more especially the Commonwealth Shipping Line. Has not Tasmania been ruined by strikes and the consequent falling off, year by year, of tourist traffic? </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing of the kind. For some Sundays past I have, with the kind assistance of a representative of one of the Melbourne newspapers, taken the trouble to investigate privately the unemployment problem. I have not yet completed my investigations, and shall therefore not say too- much about them. I regret to say that the men to whom I 3poke admitted that a large section of them were unemployable. They would not take work, especially in the country, where it is often very difficult to get work done. I do not say for one moment that there are no genuine unemployed. There are such cases, and T am sorry for them. It is the duty of the people of this democracy to find employment for men and women who are willing to work. A lot of work of a developmental character yet remains to be carried out in Australia. Honorable senators opposite must be fair. They know that many unemployed refuse to work in the country. I recently spoke to a man in the Booth Memorial Hall who admitted that men had been there for four years ; but I met some fine men there. </para>

The Government is assisting the unemployed through the charity organizations and other societies, but I am not satisfied with the handling of the situation. The Unemployment Bureau is not efficient and up to date, and there are too many registry offices making a living out of people seeking employment. I know of a case where a man was charged 7s. 6d. in taking a job at Orbost. The railway fare there and back was &#163;4, and the employment only lasted three weeks. The next registry office to which he applied charged the man another 7s. 6d. for sending him to a job at Warracknabeal. It is incumbent upon us to provide work for all who are willing to labour. 1 should like to see a committee of public men appointed from both sides of Parliament to investigate the problem and submit a practicable scheme. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and, as a farmer, I deplore the fact. I am cutting them on my own farm, but outside my fences these thistles are seen in millions. I recently travelled hundreds of miles in the great wheat producing state of South Australia, and the country seemed overrun with  stinkwort.  Australia could afford to spend millions of money if it could get rid of the blowfly pest in sheep. The producers are now worse off than formerly to the &#39;extent of from &#163;4,000,000 to &#163;5,000,000 per  annum owing to the destruction of sheep and lambs by blowflies. Dozens of my clients and friends have given up their merino studs because they cannot compete with the fly pest. I am acquainted with men who had over 50 per cent, of their sheep struck this year, and on my own farm over 20 per cent, of the sheep were attacked. I have seen the animals eaten by the maggots in two days. Day after day during the autumn we were catching the. sheep and dressing them. I do not know of any preventive of the pest. All one can do is to try to kill the flies, as is done in South Africa, where every dead carcass that can be found is poisoned, so that the flies are killed in millions. If we could get the people of Australia to work together and strive to increase the productivity of the country, instead of fighting amongst themselves, it would be better for the whole community. The total number of sheep in the Commonwealth has dropped from 106,000,000 to 80,000,000. The figures have been as low as 76,000,000, showing a decrease of 30,000,000. It will be very difficult to build the flocks up unless the awful blowfly pest can be coped with. All such pests cause an immense amount of non-reproductive work on farms and stations. With the money spent on water conservation, boring, the sowing of grasses, and the clearing of timber, Australia should be capable of carrying 150,000,000 sheep. The wealth that would be created thereby would be enormous; but the figures are going down instead of up, and I principally blame the blowfly pest for this serious position. </para>

                <para>Splendid work has been done by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department in the extension of telephonic and telegraphic communication, especially in rural districts. It is the duty of every Government to pursue a developmental policy in the country, for we must make the conditions of life on the land as comfortable and attractive as possible. Under the regime of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson),</inline> the Department has spent a vast sum of money, and spent it well. It has entered into a contract for the erection of a beam wireless&#39; station. - <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Extension of time granted.&#93;</inline> - I applaud the Government for what is being done in erecting wireless stations outback. Free wireless communication has been provided for ships trading with Australia, and this will be a great boon. The ship on which I returned from South Africa was unable to obtain wireless news from the Commonwealth, although I, as a loyal Australian, was thirsting for information about my own country. The captain told me it was too costly. All the wireless news we got came direct from Europe, and there was nothing about Australia. Now the Government has removed &#34;this disability, and it is also duplicating the Pacific cable - a splendid work. I am surprised that honorable senators opposite are not generous enough to admit that the Government has done well, but when they realize how much has been accomplished in the recess, and what is proposed for the future, they will be impelled to acknowledge the Government&#39;s creditable record. </para>
                <para>The Tariff Board is, I believe, doing good work. It is investigating every case on its merits. I am a protectionist, but not a rule-of-thumb protectionist. I wish to see every case considered on its merits. Such protection as is necessary should be given to every industry that is efficiently managed. This Government has adopted that attitude, but it is not willing to spoon-feed industries that are inefficient by placing a high protective wall around them. Some people are constantly asking for higher duties, although a high tariff wall must increase the cost of living. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that it is the intention of the Government to place a total embargo upon the importation of sugar into Australia. I do not favour that policy. I realize that it is necessary to give adequate protection to the sugar industry, which is a very fine industry ; but I am not in favour of total prohibition. Those people who make a great fuss about the price they have to pay for sugar should realize the excellent position in which they stand compared with the inhabitants of some other countries. Recently, with other honorable senators, I visited South Africa. We were surprised to find that, despite the fact that the average rate of wages paid to the workers in the sugar industry in South Africa amounted to only from 8s. to 10s. a week, compared with an average of 25s. a day in Australia, the price of sugar was no lower than in Australia. The Queensland sugar fields are so much better managed,&#39; and their machinery is so much more efficient, that the price of sugar paid by the consumer in Australia is no greater than is paid by the consumer in South Africa; and the South African sugar is very inferior to that which is refined in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The inefficiency of their machinery is the cause. I formed the opinion that cheap black labour led to inefficiency, and I returned to Australia more firmly convinced than ever that the policy of a White Australia is a correct one. I understand that the jam-makers and&#39; other manufacturers who purchase sugar in comparatively large quantities are given special concessions by the Government. Whilst I am not able to support the proposal to place a total embargo upon the importation of any commodity, I do not think that the consumers have very much to complain about in the price that they are asked to pay for sugar. When the tariff was last under consideration in this Senate, I opposed increases in many of the items. Honorable senators who were then in this chamber will remember that I opposed the granting of an increase to the textile industry. I did so because just previously a royal commission had shown&#39; that the average profit of the manufacturers in Australia over a- period of years amounted to 33 per cent. Naturally, I did not consider that, with the great advantages&#39; which the Australian manufacturers possessed in regard to first choice of the beet and greatest variety of wool in the world, they at that time required extra protection. I spoke and voted accordingly. But since then the conditions have very materially changed. I do not want honorable senators to think that I have altered my policy simply because, in the belief that the textile industry would be a profitable one, and should be built up until it became the greatest of our secondary industries, I, in my enthusiasm - perhaps somewhat misguided by the commission&#39;s report - invested in four or five country woollen mills. I assisted in their formation and flotation, thinking that it would be a very good thing for Australia to provide employment in the country towns for the sons and daughters of our citizens, I knew, as all honorable senators did, that we imported about 70 per cent, of our requirements in woollen materials. That is an anomaly. I should like to see the whole of the wearing apparel of our people manufactured in Australia. I go further, and say that some of our woollen manufactures, particularly blankets, are so good that the time will come when we shall have a large export trade in them. I know that there is an opening for Australian blankets on the west coast of America, and some have already been sold there. I am anxious to assist all I can in the development of the textile industry in Australia. I want honorable senators and the public to know that I am an interested party. Therefore, when a vote is taken on this item of the tariff I shall probably not record mine. Since I opposed an increase in the duty the conditions have entirely changed. At that time the wages in the industry in Australia were no higher than they were in England. The returns and balance-sheets showed that a higher duty was not then required. </para>

I want every man and woman in Australia to be clothed with goods that have been manufactured in Australia. My motto is, &#34; Australian goods for the Australian people.&#34; I do not believe that there would be in Australia to-day any genuine unemployment if the Australian people  bought Australian-made goods instead of asking for imported goods. I am glad to say that I am clothed from head to foot with goods that have been made in Australia. They are good enough for me, and I believe they are good enough for the people of Australia. &#39; </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and it is quite good enough for any Australian. Instead of these mills having to dismiss many of their employees, they would be kept operating at full capacity if the people would only purchase their goods. The firm of Pelaco makes as good a collar as cnn be obtained from England or anywhere else. The soldiers&#39; mill in Geelong turns- out tweeds, serges, and rugs that are equal to those manufactured in any other part of the world. The trouble is that the majority of the people, but particularly the women, when they go into a shop, say, &#34; I want the imported article.&#34; </para>

At last I went to the firm of Capon and Montgomery. I was told they had not that- particular hat, but I was shown all sorts of other hats. I said, &#34; I want an Australian-made hat.&#34; At last they showed me a hat that was Australian-made. I bought it for 25s., and am very pleased with it. I looked inside the hat, but there was nothing to show that it had been made in Australia. I said, &#34; That is not fair to the manufacturer, or anybody else.&#34; Theshopkeeper said, &#34;If we put inside that hat Made in Australia,&#39; we would sell only about five where we now sell 50.&#34; Members of all parties must preach the slogan, &#34; Australian goods for the Australian people.&#34; If necessary, legislation- must be introduced to make it compulsory for articles to be stamped to show the origin of their manufacture. </para>

                <para>The Government of Great Britain has granted preference to certain Australian products. That is the result of the excellent work which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> did whilst he was in England. It will be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds a year to the producers in Australia. I think we should give every credit to the Prime Minister, who very worthily represented Australia. The Government has appointed an Export . Control Board to ensure the better .packing and marketing of Australian produce. That is very necessary, particularly in regard to the packing of Australian fruits. I believe that this board of experts will do good work, which will result advantageously to the producers and packers. </para>
                <para>The agreement which the Prime Minister has made with the Government of Great Britain in connexion with immigration is, I think, one of the most statesmanlike things that have ever been done for this great country. Australia will be loaned &#163;34,000,000 on the most favorable terms. The Commonwealth Government, in turn, will lend that money to the states, which hold most of the land, upon terms that will make possible the development of Australia and the settlement of people upon the land. I hope that the states will take full advantage of this wonderful loan. If they do not work in the closest co-operation with the Federal Government, by placing people upon the land and assisting them in every way, it will be deplorable. </para>

                        <para>- As not much more than 10 per cent, of the land of Australia has been alienated, there is a great deal- still available for them provided they can get it at a reasonable price. I do not believe in buying land at any price for returned soldiers or migrants or any one else. The Commonwealth Government has made a most advantageous arrangement with the Imperial Government for the loan of this vast sum of money for the development and settlement of Australia. It has a keen and definite progressive immigration policy. It recognizes that Australia is a huge, rich, and dangerously empty country, and that if we want to maintain it as a White Australia we must materially and quickly increase the population. We do not know what the policy of the Opposition is in that regard; we do not know whether they are in favour of immigration or not, but it seems to me, at any rate, they put every obstacle in the way of our own kith and kin coming from the Mother Country and settling here. When people of our own blood come here they have great difficulty in getting into the unions. They are called all sorts of names. They do not get that welcome they should have in a country to which they have as much right to come as we have to be here. Of the population of Australia 98 per cent, is directly descended from British stock. The Government is paying attention to the rather sudden temporary influx of migrants from Southern Europe, and has announced its intention of bringing in legislation to maintain the existing proportion or quota of people of pure British blood. In that regard honorable senators opposite are in an awkward position, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> formerly Labour Premier of Queensland, has given a very hearty welcome to the entry of Italians into Queensland in unrestricted numbers. I am surprised at honorable senators seeking to impose restrictions upon the entry of people of our own. kith an.d kin when we want them here to help us to defend and develop Australia. An increasing population makes it easier to develop the country and protect it, and also tends to lessen the burden of. debt upon the people. </para>

The present Government is passing more legislation and doing more good for the working people of this country than the Opposition has ever been able to do. The provisions of the Arbitration Act need tightening up, to assure the people of the country who want to work continuous employment and continuous means of communication by land and sea. I have referred already to the tremendous disadvantages suffered by Tasmania, a state that none of us should twit.  It has equal representation in this Senate with other states, but it has suffered terrible disabilities owing to strikes in the shipping industry. These strikes are always engineered at a time when the severest blow can be struck at Tasmania, just in the summer season when the people of that state rely so greatly on the tourist traffic. I cannot understand why the island should be singled out in this way by the strike leaders in the shipping industry. The extraordinary, autocratic,, mad actions of these men hit Tasmania in the height of the tourist season. </para>

                    <para>. - I objected to this notice of motion being treated as formal because, in my opinion, the former practice, under which honorable senators had an hour and a half for lunch on Fridays is preferable. An hour is too short, especially on Fridays, when many honorable senators have business to attend to or constituents to meet, and require time during the luncheon adjournment to do so. If we were called upon to sit here considering legislation till 1  o&#39;clock,  an adjournment of one hour only would mean a very hurried meal for those who have public business to transact. The curtailment of the luncheon hour is inconvenient to many honorable senators&#39;. It is quite true that the adjournment at 3.30 p.m., instead of 4 p.m., suits the convenience of those honorable senators who have to leave earlier in the afternoon to join a boat or travel by rail to their own states, but I suggest that it would, be a comparatively easy matter to arrange for pairs to enable them to get  away. </para>

                        <para>- I have been whip on this side of the Senate for about six years, and  I  know that pairs have seldom been refused. As far as I know, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cox</inline> has not been inconvenienced in this way. But, apart from this consideration, I think the old system is the better one. An honorable senator does not require an hour and a half for lunch, but work which accumulates sometimes, can be attended to during the luncheon adjournment on Fridays. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the sessional order, as amended last session, will stand. It is a decided convenience, at all events to honorable senators from Tasmania, to be able to leave at 3.30. Whilst the Opposition have, generally speaking, been ready enough to grant pairs, honorable senators on this side of the chamber desire to be in their places until the conclusion of the business of the Senate for the week. It is not satisfactory for them to leave this chamber when very important business may be under discussion. Out of consideration for the Tasmanian members, as well as for those who have to leave for South Australia, I hope that the Senate will adhere to the satisfactory arrangement made last session. </para>

                    <para>. - I  do not think Queensland has been considered in this matter. Honorable senators from that state cannot return to their homes for the week end.  I  did not rise to voice objection to the time allowed for luncheon hour on Fridays, but to direct attention to the hour fixed for the dinner adjournment on the other days of sitting. The Senate rises at 6.30 for dinner, and resumes at 8 o&#39;clock. This may be convenient for those who take their meals here, or who live in proximity to Parliament House, but it does not suit those who may be living some distance away, and who wish to visit their homes.  It  would be very much better if the Senate adjourned at 6 o&#39;clock, and resumed at 7.30 o&#39;clock. </para>

This leaves a big gap between the 1 o&#39;clock luncheon adjournment and the evening meal. I realize that unless, the other House fell in with the proposed altera tion the whole of the meal arrangements in the refreshment room would be upset. However, I move as an amendment - </para>

                <para>I do this because a motion of censure has been submitted in another place, and the debate is now proceeding. I hope that, before the date fixed for the resumption of Senate business, the censure motion will have been disposed of. In view of the possibility of the debate dragging on, I would have liked to invite the Senate to take a longer adjournment, because I . know honorable senators object to be called back, and then to be met with another motion for adjournment. But I am hoping that by the date named in the motion another place will have settled its differences. It is essential that  a  Supply Bill and a Loan Bill be passed before the end of the month, and we shall thus be left with a week to consider them. These two bills must be passed before the end of the financial year, and it is therefore necessary for the Senate to re-assemble the week after next. </para>

                        <para>.- I take this opportunity to bring before the Senate a question that yesterday I put before the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, and the answer that I received to-day. It relates to the withdrawal of licences from those who hitherto held licences to sell postage stamps. The question I asked reads as follows : - </para>

                    <para>The Minister&#39;s answer was &#34; No, the action taken by the Department is being carefully watched, so that public inconvenience shall not arise.&#34; I recently received from a resident of Tasmania  a  communication in which he states definitely that the portion of the town of Ulverstone known as Ulverstone West, on the west side of the Leven River, is from J mile to over 1 mile distant from the post office. The storekeeper at Ulverstone West for years held a licence to sell stamps. Recently the licence was withdrawn, and the residents there are now compelled to travel upwards of a mile to the post office to obtain stamps. I, therefore, cannot reconcile the answer made by the Minister with the information that I have received. Evidently a proper investigation was not made, since considerable inconvenience is being caused to the public at Ulverstone West. I have other but not so acute instances of the inconvenience caused elsewhere by the Department&#39;s action. I shall be glad to supply the Minister with particulars of the case to which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>. -  I endorse what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has said as to the inconvenience that has been caused by this action on the part of the Department. I brought a similar case before the notice of the Postmaster-General, and his answer was far from satisfactory. In Rockhampton there is  a  firm of booksellers whose establishment dates from the early history of that town. It is a reputable firm, and has sold postage stamps for years. It was the practice of many ladies to purchase their supplies of stamps at this shop, but now that privilege is denied them. After earning hundreds of thousands of pounds for the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, this firm is now deprived of commission on the sale of stamps. I would point out that tobacconists&#39; shops that are open at night are licensed to sell stamps, but ladies who wish to buy stamps have no wish to enter these premises occupied by men smoking, and with, perhaps, other objectionable features present. This question should be reconsidered with a view to restoring to the firm mentioned the licence to sell stamps. </para>

                        <para>. -  I wish to. invite the attention of the Minister for Home and Territories to a position which has arisen in New Guinea regarding the sale of the feathers of the birds of paradise. It has been represented to me - and the representation is quite in accordance with fact - that while persons in the Mandated Territory under our control are debarred from dealing in the plumes of birds of paradise, others across the border, in Dutch territory, deal in them without restriction. In fact, we are protecting the birds of paradise in the area under our control, while our Dutch friends across the border are reaping substantial revenue therefrom. I suggest to the Minister for Home and Territories that he investigate this matter with a view to repealing the legislation at present applying to the Mandated Territory, so that the residents there may enjoy the same privilege as that enjoyed by the residents of Dutch New Guinea. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to state, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> that it must be obvious that unless we allow the wholesale destruction of birds of paradise, the prohibition on the collection of plumes must continue. The natural beauty of the bird makes it essential that it should be protected. We deplore the fact that the Dutch are not enforcing a similar prohibition in their territory. In view of the extent of New Guinea, I should imagine that the proper protection of the birds io our area will prevent them from becoming extinct. After all, birds seems to have a wonderful knowledge of protected areas. This is very noticeable in the case of wild duck, which during the shooting season are seen in hundreds near the city at such places as the ponds in Queen&#39;s Park, Moonee Ponds, and the Botanic Gardens. I have no doubt that birds of paradise have a similar instinct of self-preservation.No good reason has been shown why the prohibition should bo withdrawn. </para>
