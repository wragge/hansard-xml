                <para class="block">This is a short bill in which provision is made to increase the salary of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner from &#163;2,000, as provided in the original act, to &#163;3,000. It does not necessarily mean that the present Commissioner will receive the higher remuneration, but in view of the importance of the works under his control, which I shall shortly enumerate, it will be admitted that it will be necessary in the future to pay a higher salary in order to secure the services of the best man available. Under the act passed in 1917, the maximum salary of the Commissioner was fixed at &#163;2,000, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> was appointed to the position of Commissioner in that year at that salary. Prior to his appointment as Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> was engineerinchief, and since then he has continued largely to exercise the functions of engineer-in-chief, as well as to carry out the work of Commissioner. Since 1917. the responsibilities of the position have largely increased. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> is also military director of railways under the War Railway Council, the chief adviser to the Commonwealth Government on all Australian railway matters, and  chairman  of the Uniform Railway Gauge Council, now considering the question of a uniform gauge between Sydney and Brisbane, which work is to cost &#163;3,500,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> is responsible for the construction of Commonwealth railways, and also for the conduct of those now in operation throughout Australia.. Railway assets to the value of approximately &#163;12,000,000 are under his control. From the 1st January, 1926, the working of the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway, now under the control of the South Australian Railways Commissioners, will be undertaken by the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner. The railway mileage open for traffic under the control of the Commissioner will then be approaching 2,000 miles. Apart from railway operations, many questions of importance, such as those relating to new railway proposals, their bearing upon strategic questions, and their effect generally upon the development of Australia arc considered by the Commissioner. A very heavy programme of railway construction is now under the consideration of the Government, and the magnitude of our railways operations may be gauged by a reference to the estimates for the year ending 30th June, 1926, now before Parliament. Apart altogether from the ordinary maintenance of railways, it will be seen that over &#163;2,250,000 is being provided on the estimates for the current year alone for capital works and new railway proposals. An extract from the loan estimates shows that provision is to be as follows: - </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">With the responsibility devolving upon the Commissioner, and having regard to the decreased purchasing power of m&#39;oney since the present salary was fixed in 1917 the Government consider the present remuneration inadequate. The salary of the present Commissioner has been reviewed by Cabinet, and will be adjusted as may be necessary. This  measure, however, relates only to the position of Commissioner, and not to the individual. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> whose term of engagement has been extended, does not retire until towards the end of 1927, when it may be very difficult to obtain the services of an officer with the requisite qualificalions. In these circumstances, Parliament may be asked to approve of the payment of a still higher salary than that now proposed. Honorable senators may be aware that during the last few years the salaries of the Railways Commissioners throughout Australia have been largely increased. In New South Wales. Queensland, and South Australia, &#163;5,000 per annum is being paid to the chief commissioners, and salaries approaching &#163;3.000 per annum are paid to some of the assistant commissioners. In the commercial world high salaries are paid to those in control of commercial undertakings which do not possess anything approaching the assets and trading possibilities of any one of our Australian railways departments. As the Commonwealth develops, the business of the Commonwealth railways will increase, and the Government, therefore, confidently asks the Senate to provide for the payment of this maximum salary of &#163;3,000 per annum. </para>

                <para> - The Minister, in moving the second reading of this bill, stated that the proposed memorial was to be erected on the slopes of Mount Ainslie, in the Federal Capital territory. I know of no more appropriate place for the erection of a memorial to Australia&#39;s valiant  dead than the capital city of the nation for which they surrendered their lives. I believe that already in the hearts of the Australian people there is an inextinguishable memorial to those men of the Australian Imperial Forces, who faced the foe on the shellswept crests of Gallipoli and the blood-soaked fields of France. Every nation should perpetuate the memory of its gallant dead in the very best possible way. I am not saying that the proposed memorial is the best way in which we may perpetuate the memory of Australians who lost their lives in the Great War; but I understand that the money for the memorial has been raised by public subscription, and through the activities of members of the Australian Imperial Forces. . The proposal is worthy of the approbation of the people. I support the bill, because it is an attempt to perpetuate the memory of those who fell, and particularly because living comrades of the dead men request that we should provide a building in which to house the .relics of the Great War. I support it, also, because it is the desire of those who subscribed to the various funds that the money should be devoted bo the purpose indicated.

            <para> - As one who has been closely in touch with the development - of the Australian War Museum since its inception in 1917, I welcome this bill, designed to provide for the establishment of an Australian national war memorial for the preservation of its collections. The success of the museum is due very largely to the enthusiasm with which the idea was adopted by the men of the Australian Imperial Forces. There was the keenest rivalry between the units to secure worthy representation in these national collections. Many gifts were made in the names of the fallen by- their comrades or relatives. Australia is, therefore, in a fortunate and unique position in having a memorial which was created by the men and, I may add, the women, whose achievements it is intended to honour. No one who has inspected the collection in Melbourne or Sydney can have failed to be impressed with the fact that emphasis is rightly laid on the human factor. The relics, pictures and models all record incidents illustrative of the self-sacrifice, courage, fortitude and initiative of the men of the Australian Imperial Forces. These qualities count for as much in peace time develop&#39; ment as they do in time of war. For this reason the collection must always be a powerful inspiration to Australians of the present and future generations. I may be permitted at this stage to recall one or two incidents which came under my personal notice during the war, illustrating the extraordinary courage displayed by men of the Australian Imperial Forces. On the 7th August, 1915, following the landing at Suvla Bay, an attempt was made to capture the heights known as Sari Bair. A party of Australians, attacking from a certain portion of the old- Anzac line, succeeded in reaching the third enemy trench. The operation proved very costly and their numbers were so reduced that they were hard put to it to keep the enemy off. They were in an angle of the trench, and were being bombed from all directions. Their situation was rapidly becoming extremely desperate, as they were running out of bombs, so they signalled to their comrades in the old original line acquainting them of their difficulties. In a very short time one of their comrades was observed to jump out of the old trench and run across &#34; no man&#39;s &#34; land with a sugar bag full of bombs for his Australian mates in the captured enemy trench. I may add that this&#39; area of &#34;no man&#39;s&#34; land was covered by the enemy with both rifle and machine-gun fire, and had a bullet struck one of the detonators in the bag, the man would have been blown to pieces.  His  clothes were practically shot away, bub, fortunately, he escaped unhurt.  His  action was the most gallant I have ever seen. On the same day, in an adjoining section known as Walker&#39;s Ridge, a man was wounded, and fell over a precipice, lodging on the side of a hill just below.  His  comrades on a point known as Pope&#39;s Hill, saw the wounded soldier, and noticed that he was moving. Accordingly one of them rushed down -Pope&#39;s Hill along the gully, up the side of Walker&#39;s Ridge, and brought the wounded man back to safety. All this happened within 200 yards of and in full view of the enemy. For some reason the enemy - either because they were so surprised that any man should have the audacity to attempt such a daring feat, or else because they recog- nized  his gallantry, and were chivalrous - did not fire at this Australian soldier who was rescuing his comrade. Quite recently, also, I heard an English officer, who commanded one of our divisions during the war, tell of an incident that came under his notice at Pozieres, in France, where the Australians made their first offensive. The attack had succeeded up to a certain line, but it was thought necessary to continue the advance. Accordingly, a message had to be sent to the various units in the line. Across the road over which the runners had to travel with the message a very heavy enemy barrage had been put down. One runner noticed, when he came to this road, that several of those who had preceded him had been killed. One of the instructions issued to them was that a message had to be carried in the right hand breast pocket, and as every runner wore an arm band,, any who fell were thus easily distinguishable from their fellows, and would be searched for the message to ensure its delivery. Thinking that it would be essential to draw attention to the fact that he carried a message, this runner, when he saw his dead comrades, took the message from his pocket and held it in his outstretched hand. Ha attempted to cross the road when he considered that there was a slackening in the barrage, *but he also, unfortunately, was killed. He was found lying in the road, having dropped forward with the message held aloft in his hand. These are instances of the wonderful courage shown, and great sacrifices made, by men in the interest of their comrades and their units. It is our bounden duty to see that the names of these men and their great achievements are not forgotten. I can conceive of no better means of ensuring that than this proposed Australian war memorial, with its great hall of memory, on the walls of which will be engraved the names of the 62,000 Australians who died as the result of the war. Those men who fell believed that Australia was destined to be the greatest and best country in the world. They cannot make her so now. Those 62,000 of the very best we had are out of the struggle. They lie on the battlefields in foreign lands. As long as the world lasts the name of Australia will be forever present to all who pass over those foreign fields and hillsides. It cannot pass away. Lying there in their thousands, they have fixed it. They can Fever finish, the fight which they began for Australia. But we and our children can do it for them. This memorial, containing their names and the relics of their great achievements, will be a constant reminder of our responsibility to their memory - our responsibility to make Australia the great nation they believed she could become. It cannot be said that the people of Australia do not want these relics and records. That was convincingly demonstrated by the facts which the Leader of the Government
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline>
                supplied in his speech last Friday - facts which were based not only on the splendid attendances at the Museum in Melbourne and Sydney, but also on the distribution of relics throughout Australia. Only a few days ago, on behalf of a certain town in Queensland, I made a request for some war relics, which the Museum had great difficulty in satisfying; so keen has been the demand, that practically all tha available relics have been distributed. From a sentimental and an historical point of view , the collections are priceless. They are also of great intrinsic value. It is, therefore, most desirable that they should be provided with suitable and adequate accommodation at the earliest practicable date. The appointment of a board of management, with a permanent and legal status, to advise the Minister, as proposed in this bill, is a step in the right direction, and will, I am sure, facilitate the establishment of the memorial. Honorable senators are, doubtless, aware- of the value of a special fund to an institution such as a museum, enabling it to take advantage of opportunities which occur of acquiring suitable exhibits. An outstanding example of that fact is, of course, the Felton Bequest, which places the Victorian National Gallery in a most enviable position in regard to the acquisition of works of art. The fund referred to in this bill will similarly strengthen the position of the war memorial in the acquisition of exhibits that would not be available other than by purchase. I am glad to see that the bill makes provision for the fund to receive donations and bequests, as I feel sure that the object of the memorial and the uses to which the fund will be put will appeal to Australians who are interested in keeping green the memory of the Australian Forces, and may, therefore, be glad of the opportunity to assist financially. In this way the fund may be increased to a considerable amount, returning a substantial income, which will enable the Minister and the board of management to develop the memorial in a worthy manner.

                    <para>. - The bill has my most cordial support. One cannot help being struck with the fact that in almost every town and hamlet in Australia &#39; war memorials have already been erected as an appreciation by the inhabitants of the deeds of those who made such tremendous sacrifices for the people of Australia. Although I speak only for South Australia, I feel quite sure that in every other State also, when the. Government, decided to distribute to local bodies certain war trophies, the difficulty was not&#39; to secure their acceptance, but to cope with the demand by the various districts, through their local governing representatives. To-day, in addition to the memorials that have been erected in public thoroughfares and parks, practically every town in Australia exhibits in a public building some trophy commemorative of the deeds of the Australian soldiers, who performed such a wonderful service for Australia and other countries overseas. Instances of heroism such as those related by General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Glasgow are constantly being multiplied. It must be a source of gratification to the people of Australia to know that the Government intends, at the earliest possible moment, to establish this memorial at the national Seat of Government, and there display the wonderful collection of trophies . which it possesses. I am confident that the people of Australia will never view those exhibits with other than feelings of pride and admiration. In addition to housing the trophies and other evidences of the wonderful ability and daring of the Australian soldiers, this memorial will have upon its wall the names &#187;f those gallant men who made the supreme sacrifice in the interest of Australia. If the building offered no other attraction, it would draw to it thousands of people who will regard it as a shrine sacred for all time. The bill requires no word of commendation. I have not the slightest doubt that the object which &#39; underlies it has the cordial endorsement of every man and woman in this country. The sooner the building is erected, and the trophies placed in it are made available to the people, the better they will be pleased. I cordially approve of the bill. </para>

The present board has formed a number of subcommittees, one of which is the. finance committee, of three members. As  chairman  of the board. I should like to say that I am under a heavy obligation to that committee for the fine work it has done. It is really the active section of the present board, and does practically all the routine work. If .occasion should arise for the new board to delegate its powers, it may be trusted to do so wisely. It is not intended, of course, that one man shall exercise all the functions of the board, but it might be desirable, in certain circumstances, to vest such authority in one man to. do work in a particular state.. Otherwise it might be necessary for a sub-committee, or even the full board, to visit the state to do what is needed. The clause is inserted for convenience in administration. </para>

A sum of money was earned some time ago by a cinema exhibition which was the property of Ohe board. No other authority had any claim upon it, and the Minister, with the concurrence of the Treasurer, paid it into this fund. The money did not belong to the taxpayers; it had not been raised from them : it was raised by the soldiers. This paragraph provides that any moneys raised or earned by the board in the future shall be paid into the War Memorial Fund. The Treasurer is brought into the matter as the guardian of the Consolidated Revenue. The Minister, as  chairman  of the board, will naturally desire that all possible moneys shall be paid into the memorial fund, but a question may arise as to whether particular sums ought not to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue. The Treasurer will be a party in determining any question of that kind. </para>

The bill lays down very rigid lines upon which the boardcan operate, and it is thought only right that it should have control of the disposal of the fund, provided, of course, it is disposed of within the purposes set out in the bill. If men of character and ability are to be asked to serve on the board they must be given a certain amount of autonomy. The Government is not anxious to allow the board to have merely the power of recommendation, especially when it has to conform to the conditions upon which the bill will allow it to expend money. </para>

                    <para>. - I congratulate the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, on having continued the practice he initiated when he first assumed office of presenting the budget very early in the session, thus giving Parliament an opportunity to review the Government&#39;s proposals, and the expenditure in which the Commonwealth will be involved long before the money isspent. I hope this commendable practice will be continued by his successors, because it has been my experience that the budget is usually presented to both branches of the legislature at a time when the greater portion of the money set out in the Estimates has been spent, so that all criticism of the Government&#39;s proposals, no matter how severe it may be, is futile. It is not my intention to deal exhaustively with all of the Government&#39;s proposals in this year&#39;s budget. I have chosen a few to comment upon. In his speech the Treasurer made the very interesting statement that during the last financial year the total amount made available for the reduction of the public debt of the Commonwealth was &#163;5,500,000. It is a laudable ambition to reduce the public debt. I do not believe that the task of wiping out the public debt should fall entirely on the present generation, but I regard it as imperative that those who are living to-day should make some effort to reduce it as far as they can. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Page</inline> has been Treasurer for three years. I believe that he is now in his last year of that office. </para>

The net debt was &#163;335,371,000 in 1922-3. It was &#163;335,197,000 in 1924-5. I admit that during the period the Commonwealth borrowed &#163;15,000&#187;,000 to help the States, but the statistical table .1 have quoted does not coincide with the Treasurer&#39;s assertion that &#163;5,500,000 has been set aside for the reduction of the national debt. The Treasurer also stated that &#163;1,500,000 has been appropriated from revenue for the reduction of the public debt. During the year under review a profit of &#163;1,278,000 was made from the note issue, but the Treasurer does not state whether the profit from this source has been devoted to the reduction of the national debt. When the Labour party introduced the note issue, it was decided that the profits from that source were to be devoted to the reduction of the public debt, but I have looked in vain through the figures to ascertain whether any of the money set aside by the Treasurer for the reduction of the national debt has or has not been obtained from this source, or how the profit, of &#163;1,278,000 obtained from the note issue has been disposed of. Whilst I recognize the necessity of gradually reducing our obligation in that regard, the present generation should not be wholly responsible. </para>

                        <para>- I admit there should be proper control over the expenditure of the money. Although the amount allotted to Western Australia was comparatively small, the operations of the state authorities were restricted because the act deals only with main roads. In the south-western portion of Western Australia, where the State Government is engaged in the group settlement system commenced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Mitchell, when Premier, and continued by the present Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collier),</inline> hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent in settling migrants on the land. The State Government has been faced with numerous difficulties, but it is gratifying to know that the conditions have improved, and the settlement should prove a great success and an example to the rest of Australia. In the district to which I refer, the federal authorities determined that a certain road was not a main road - that it merely connected one group settlement with another. </para>

                        <para>- No. The Federal Government representative was adamant. I am not altogether blaming the federal authorities, but what applies to Western Australia is equally applicable to other States, as was instanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes a few days ago. Under the present method the group settlement system in Western Australia is experiencing great  difficulty. I trust that the vote for main&#39; roads Will not only be increased, but that the Government will introduce an amending measure under which money can be expended on roads other than main roads which are being used for developmental purposes. If that is done, the objective sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> B. Hayes will, to a great extent, be achieved. I do not wish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thompson</inline> to think that I am opposed to federal supervision, but as the advice of the State Public Works Department is, in most cases, accepted by the federal authorities in respect of Commonwealth works, its decisions in these in-, stances should be accepted. </para>

For the financial year 1913-4, the expenditure on naval and military defence was estimated at &#163;2,960,000; in 1924-5, it was &#163;4,400,000, and for this year it is slightly more. One naturally wonders why our defence expenditure should be practically double what it was in. 1913-4. In 1914 we were involved in a world shambles, and we have now to pay the penalty. As the bill we have justdealt with sets out, we are about to erect a memorial to the 60,000 Australian dead who fought, and fought well, in that great world conflict. We were told that it was to be a war to end all war; but it has not ended war; nor has it led to a decrease in our defence expenditure. Our defence expenditure has not decreased in consequence of the last war, and we are not alone in that respect, as all the allied nations who were involved in that great international upheaval are now spending more money on defence than they were in 1914. </para>

                        <para>- I have borne that factor in mind, and maintain that we are spending more money on defence than we were eleven years ago. In this, as I have said, we are not alone. Our allies in the great war are also spending more money on defence than they were in 1914, notwithstanding that the purpose of the Washington Conference was to bring about disarmament. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who represented Australia at that conference, returned, he told us that, as far as the Pacific was concerned at all events, there was security for at least ten years. But what has been the good  of that disarmament conference ? It is true that certain naval vessels were scrapped by the nations represented at the conference. In Australia, we sank our leading capital ship_, and other allied nations took similar action, but, to-day, the shipbuilding yards of practically all countries are busily employed building bigger capital ships. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that, but it is a fact that various nations are -busily employed arming themselves to the teeth. The war, which was supposed to end all wars, did not achieve its purpose. A war is in progress iii Morocco at the present time. Did honorable senators read an article in the press recently, disclosing the cause of that trouble ? It might be wise, even now, for the British Government, following the example set by the late  President  Hardin? Qf the United States of America, to summon a disarmament conference. There would surely be a representative gathering of the nations, and perhaps something of a practical nature might be achieved to put a stop to this continuous increase in armaments, which is going on despite the existence of the League of Nations. I would be the last to decry the usefulness of the League. So far as its limitations will allow, it is doing good work. Unfortunately, it is a league, not of all the nations, but of some nations, and therefore its authority is, to some extent, circumscribed. </para>

I make one exception. The report of the Public Accounts Committee, which has been inquiring into munitions supply, discloses that the Munitions Supply Board is doing excellent work to make Australia self-contained in defence. </para>

                <para>I welcome the somewhat tardy recognition of the claim made on behalf of our old-age and invalid pensioners for an increase in pension payments. I note, however, that the Treasurer&#39;s intimation of an additional 2s. 6d. a week comes, as it were, on the eve of an election. In 1919, when I was appealing to the electors of Western Australia to return me to the Senate, I said that if the Labour party were returned to power it would authorize an increase of 2s. 6d. a week. At that time the pension was 15s. a week. There was another increase of 2s. 6d. a week in 1922. It follows, therefore, that if Labour had been returned in 1919, our old-age and invalid pensioners would have been drawing this promised increase of 2s. 6d. long ago. Whilst I welcome the. statement in the budget speech, I remind the Senate that it is the result of pressure from members of the Labour party inside and outside of Parliament. There is another anomaly to which I desire to direct attention. I do not blame the present Treasurer, or his predecessors. The act should be amended. To put the position clearly, let me quote an article which appeared in the Western Australian <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> of the 14th August last, commenting on a letter which I received from the Commissioner of Pensions - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Under the law the Commonwealth is liable to pay 17s. 6d. per week to the aged or invalid who substantiate their claim for a full pension. </para>
                    <para>Should a pensioner enter a home, hospital, or asylum, however, the Commonwealth suspends the pension absolutely for 23 days, and pays to the pensioner a pension of but 3s. per week thereafter. </para>
                    <para>Then, as &#34; an act of grace,&#34; it pays to the authorities of the institution in which the pensioner is being cared for an allowance of 10s. 6d. per week for the pensioner&#39;s maintenance. </para>
                    <para>On the transaction the Commonwealth makes a profit of 4s. per week out of each pensioner who is in residence in a public institution. The joke is that the Commonwealth provides none of these: institutions, which generally are maintained by the States. </para>
                    <para>As the payment which the Commonwealth makes to charitable institutions - the so-called &#34;act of grace &#34; - is said to total about &#163;100,000 a year, it is seen that some 3,663 pensioners arc&#34; involved. If these 3,663 persons were not in a charitable institution the Commonwealth&#39;s pension bill on their account would be &#163;166,166 instead of &#163;100,000 plus the 3s. a week - a clear saving to the Commonwealth of &#163;38,005 per year. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>When a pensioner becomes an inmate of a charitable institution, payment of his pension is suspended in accordance with the requirements of the law, as set out above. After he has been an inmate for 28 days, however, he becomes entitled to a pension of 3s per week, and the department takes the necessary action to make payment. In addition, an amount of 10s. 6d. a week is paid by the department to the authorities of the institution as an act of grace for the pensioner&#39;s maintenance. The department is, however, under no obligation whatever to make these payments, and it would be quite legal to discontinue them at any time. I may mention that the amount so paid to charitable institutions for the maintenance of pensioners amounts to approximately &#163;100,000 per annum. As the amount of pension which may be paid to inmates of institutions is fixed by law at 3s. per week, it will be seen that it is not possible to authorize the payment of an additional 4s. per week. If such payment were authorized, the Commonwealth would be involved in an additional liability of approximately &#163;50,000 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- I am never afraid that any ground upon which. I tread will give beneath my weight, which is not so great that I should be likely to sink. Let me clinch my point. The Commonwealth Parliament, by its law, has said that an invalid or old-age pensioner who is able to prove his claim to a pension shall receive 17s. 6d. a week. If a pensioner becomes an inmate of a charitable institution in a State he gets only 3s. a week, whilst the State receives 10s. 6d. a week for maintaining him. On each of such transactions the Commonwealth profits to the extent of 4s. a week. </para>

If I am here when that bill is being considered by the Senate I propose to suggest an amendment to remove the anomaly to which I have re- ferred. I pass on to the question of immigration. </para>

                <para>I come now to the question of immigration. I notice that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> said in his budget speech that last year &#163;206,000 was spent out of loan by way of advances of passage money, landing money, and medical fees to assisted immigrants. Let us compare the action of the Treasurer with a statement that he made when he was a private member. In 1921 <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, discussing the budget which had been delivered by one of his predecessors in office, said - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>He proposes to spend from the loan funds, instead of revenue, &#163;162.000 on passage money for assisted immigrants, which, under no consideration can be considered a charge against loans. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I shall not discuss the question whether the expenditure of loan money in assisting intending immigrants can or cannot legitimately be charged against the loan fund. I content myself by showing the change that has taken place in the opinion of the Treasurer regarding that policy. </para>
                <para>I wish to devote a few minutes to the subject of the tariff. I expected an amending tariff bill to be brought down concurrently with the budget, but we are still awaiting a move by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> in that direction. It is high time that something was done. The threat of an amendment of the tariff has frequently been made, but it has not yet materialized. I have heard it prophesied for at least two sessions. Anticipating it, importers have rushed goods into Australia from other countries. I do not say that they have definite information as to the date when the bill is to be brought down, nor do I say that the revenue has been defrauded as a result of the largely increased imports. I do not know whether the proposed amended duties will increase or reduce the tariff. If, however, there is to be an increase on important items, the revenue will suffer to a very considerable extent. Any government contemplating an amendment of the tariff laws should keep its intention as quiet as possible. </para>

                        <para>- Either the Tariff Board or the Government should decide definitely what is to be done. When the amending bill does come down I do not know whether it will show the Government to be a &#34;Pro-trade&#34; or a &#34; Freetectionist &#34; Government. The present Cabinet consists of two elements. It has a pronounced freetrade element, as well as a pronounced protectionist element. Which will dominate the new tariff proposals I do not know. The attitudie of the Government on fiscal matters reminds me of a story I heard many years ago of a candidate for election to the Queensland Parliament, when freetrade and protection were really the only issues before the electors. At the conclusion of an eloquent address, this man was asked, Are you a freetrader or a protectionist?&#34; He replied, &#34;I am.&#34; That is the position of the Government.

                <para>SenatorNEEDHAM. - I am not afraid to avow my fiscal creed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene</inline> piloted the last tariff measure through the House of Representatives, and he didit well, but I have been forced to wonder many times since then whether it was really a protective or revenue tariff that was adopted. If it had been really protective we should not have received such tremendous duties through our Customs Department. My own belief is that it was a revenue tariff. </para>

                <para> - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> can, without much trouble, find my views in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> If he does not care to look there, I assure him that if he will be patient he will be informed on the matter when the Government&#39;s tariff proposals are before us. I wish to make a few remarks respecting the need for the payment of a bounty on gold. I am not particularly partial to the bounty system, bur if any industry in Australia requires and deserves a bounty, the gold-mining industry does. Western Australia produces about 70 per cent. of the gold output of Australia. Last session a bill was passed which helped the industry to some extent, but further assistance is essential. In consequence of the embarrassment caused to the industry during the war through the Government commandeering the gold output, and the much lower grade ores. that are being worked now. the Government should see that adequate assistance is given to it. It would be well advised to introduce a measure to provide for the payment of a bounty on gold produced in the Commonwealth. The gold-mining companies of Boulder pay &#163;750,000 per annum in wages to their employees. If a bounty were offered for all gold produced, the mining companies would be able to work lower grade ore than is now possible. In a pamphlet entitled : <inline font-style="italic">The Gold Bonus; Opinions and Comments Thereon of the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia Incorporated,</inline> the following appears with regard to the gold production of the state in 1923 :  - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>In this state the gold production amounted to &#163;2,105,483 from 781,769 tons of ore treated; and the number of men employed in producing it was 5,347. The goldflelds towns of this state are practically isolated, and it is therefore easy to learn what is the proportion of people who live in the neighbourhood of the mines, and depend for their livelihood upon the mines, as compared with the number of men actually working on the mines. Wefind that the proportion is at least six to one. If we multiply 5,347 by six the result is 32,082. The value of the state&#39;s gold production divided by this figure shows a production of &#163;65.6 per head for the year. </para>

                        <para>- So far as Western Australia is concerned, there is every possibility of two or three other Kalgoorlies being found. However, the existing mines in Western Australia are working on very low-grade ore, which it is very costly to work, and, as other Australian industries are being encouraged by bounties, I think the Government should bring down a bill to grant a bounty to the gold-mining industry. </para>

            <para>That the Senate do now adjourn. </para>
            <para>I am hopeful that we shall have a Supply Bill and a Loan Bill before the Senate next week. These are bills which it will be necessary for the Senate to pass at an early date; but they must, of course, be dealt with in another place before they reach us . Another place has to consider the Estimates and certain tariff amendments, and an Arbitration Bill is also to be brought forward. It is obvious that 35 senators can pass legislation at a much greater rate of speed than can 75 members in another place, so that when we dispose of the Supply Bill and the Loan Bill next week, and possibly one or two other small measures, it will be necessary for us to adjourn for some time to enable another place to catch up to us. The fact that this is inevitable is not a reflection on the Senate, as some journals regard it. It is merely an indication that, because it has fewer members, it is more expeditious in passing legislation than is another place. If the programme  I am now indicating is carried out, we ought to be able to have an adjournment which will be sufficiently long to enable honorable senators whose homes are not in Melbourne to spend some time in their own States. It is very inconvenient for honorable senators from distant States to be brought to Melbourne to attend a few sittings, and then for the Senate to adjourn for a week or two. </para>
