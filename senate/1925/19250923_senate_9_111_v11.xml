So far as I am aware - and I have not yet had a copy of this bill - the measure is one demanding very grave consideration, particularly by the Senate. Since a dissolution is imminent, it is indecent on the part of the Government to attempt to pass legislation of this character.

                        <para>- Then the fault is my own, since I arrived in Melbourne only to-day. The Government is going to the country, and I venture to say that we are all heartily glad of it. It does not affect the financial position of retiring honorable senators whether the election takes place in October, November or December, or even next January, since their term of office does not expire until the 30th June, 1926 ; but, surely, if the position of the Government is so serious that it feels the necessity for a further expression of opinion by the people, it will see that it is indecent to pass any legislation at all prior to the election. There was a time when- the mere fact that a censure motion, that it was feared might affect the fate of the Government, had been submitted in the other branch of the legislature, was regarded as sufficient to warrant the Senate's adjournment. In the present case, however, the fate of the Government definitely hangs in the balance, and still it proposes to pass legislation before appealing to the people. Such a procedure is unheard of. Talk about constitutional government 1 What could be more unconstitutional than for a ministry that has relinquished the reins of government to attempt to pass legislation on the eve of an election? Only one measure should be submitted - a bill to grant Supply to carry on the necessary services of the country. </para>

                        <para>- On the eve of the election this Government proposes to add half a crown a week to the income of a very desirable section of the community. That of itself is an indication of the extent to which the Ministry is prepared to go on the eve of an election. It might he possible, although I hardly chink so, for Australia to be cursed with a more inept government than we have at present. </para>

                        <para>- That is purely a matter of opinion. If any ten men in the community were casually selected I do not think it would be possible for them to have less ability than the present Ministry has shown. I suppose that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce),</inline> judging by his statement in another place, has approached the Governor-General. I can imagine his saying to  His Excellency,  ' ' I cannot carry on. I desire your consent to dissolve both houses of Parliament, and I wish to be permitted to make an announcement to that effect to the country." It is easy to imagine such a conversation as that. I can also imagine  His Excellency  replying, "Why? You have a majority in both Houses. In the Senate you have 24 supporters as against twelve senators in opposition. In the House of Representatives there are 46 anti-Labor members and only 29 Labour members. Surely, if there is any danger threatening the country, there is no occasion for a dissolution now." </para>

                        <para>- I do not suppose I shall be here longer than Friday next, but if I cannot discuss this question I do not desire to remain after this evening, because the question of expediency is urgent. But let me proceed. I am endeavouring to imagine the conversation that took place between  His Excellency  the Governor-General and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> which furnished the reason for this motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders of the Senate to-day.  His Excellency,  I have no doubt, asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> for his reasons for asking for a dissolution, and I can imagine <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> replying - " I wish for a dissolution because there is in this country a dangerous element that must be driven out of it." Following this statement, I can imagine  His Excellency  asking - " Why have you not dealt with this dangerous communistic element in view of the fact that for the last two years you have been in command of a majority in both Houses? Why have not they been brought before the courts, and adequately punished? Why do you wish for more power?" </para>

                        <para>- I shall go over to Tasmania, and argue that question with the honorable senator during the next month or two. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> I imagine, told  His Excellency  that there were two parties in this country, one of which was controlled by criminal political leaders. This, we know, has been alleged by both the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page. And this has been advanced as one reason why the Government should obtain further power.  This, I imagine, was the story told to  His Excellency  by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> and now "Loyalty to the King" is in the forefront of the Nationalist platform. This, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> declares, is one reason why there should be a dissolution. Could anything be more disloyal than for any political party to make loyalty to the Throne an issue of a" heated election campaign'? </para>

Is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, one of them?"

Then I can imagine  His Excellency  saying to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce.</inline> - " If you believe there is in this country an element threatening law and order,' why do you propose to go to the people, and leave the country to the mercy of a lawless section of the community? According to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John"</inline> Monash, you have not even a Mills bomb to throw at the mob if an attempt is made to raid Melbourne." And, of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> to avoid further embarrassment, would declare to  His Excellency  that the position had become so serious that his advice to the Governor-General was to grant a dissolution.

                        <para>- My leader's challenge was responsible for this move by the Government to dissolve Parliament. The pressure of public opinion became so great that the Prime Minister was obliged to accept the challenge. When this chamber adjourned a week or two ago, we were informed that we should not be recalled for three or four weeks. We are now back after an adjournment of only one week. It is possible that when he interviewed the Governor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> said he was determined to fight the communists, who polled only 800 votes against Labour candidates at the last New South Wales elections. That is about the only party' that the Government candidates will be able to beat in the forthcoming contest. I wonder if the Prime Minister informed  His Excellency  of the real reason for a dissolution. I wonder if he told the Governor-General, " in confidence, that the Coalition Government, in which one party was pulling one way and the other in another direction, had proved a failure, and that he wished to appeal to the people to return a Government capable of governing? All this talk about the communistic danger is merely for the purpose of covering up the ineptitude of the present Government. I see no reason, however, why the Senate should not conduct. its business in a dignified manner. If the Leader of the Senate proceeds along those lines, he will receive no obstruction from me. On the contrary, I shall render all the assistance possible to pass the necessary legislation so that we can get to the country as quickly as possible, because I believe the appeal to the people will not be a day too soon. The need for a strong government is very urgent. I believe that this appeal to the people will result in the return of a government prepared to govern Australia according to British principles. I believe we shall have a government that will insist upon every man being equal in the eyes of the law, with the right of trial by a jury of his countrymen for any offence against the laws of the Commonwealth. And because I believe that the only party which will bring about this state of affairs is the Labour party, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton,</inline> I offer no objection to the course now being taken by the Government. I shall not even call for a division on this motion; but I protest against the Government attempting to pass any legislation except the Supply Bill after the announcement of the dissolution. I question if a precedent can be found for the introduction and passage of any other measures in similar circumstances. I believe in constitutional procedure. What is now being attempted is only in keeping with the actions of the party opposite which has been masquerading as a government for the last two years. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to say a few words in support of the protest made by my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> I wish also to take advantage of this opportunity to protest against the slanders which are being heaped upon Australia and its people by the Government and its supporters. In every paper published throughout the civilized world to-day there are appearing reports that would  lead the people of those countries to believe that Australia was in a state of lawlessness. An attempt- is being made to create the impression that a reign of terror exists in Australia, and that bolsheviks, communists, and the representatives of all revolutionary elements throughout the world have taken control of the country. Extracts from the principal British newspapers are appearing in our newspapers in which comment is made upon current Australian, events. As an Australian citizen and a representative of the people in one of the  branches of our national Legislature, I desire to tell those persons responsible for such paragraphs that no such conditions as are reported exist in Australia. </para>

As an Australian, and a representative of the people, I give the lie direct to those making the libellous and slanderous statements that are appearing in the press. The Government is going to . the country in an endeavour to crush the British seamen, who have conducted themselves in a most exemplary way. Instead of the police being compelled to use force in arresting the seamen, the men have marched in a body to jail. </para>

                        <para>- An appeal is being made by the Prime Minister with the object of crushing the British seamen. What are they asking for? Merely that their monthly wage of £10 shall not be reduced. The whole power of the Government is to be used to prevent them from receiving a living wage on which to maintain themselves, their wives, and their children. I wish to repeat the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George after the termination of the war, when he said, "Victory is ours,  and England will be a land in which heroes will be able to live." Who made it possible for the Allies to achieve victory ? The members of the British mercantile marine assisted in that direction, and they are the men who are to-day fighting for their rights- </para>

                    <para>. - I can well imagine circumstances in which it would be highly desirable to support a motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders, so that the proposal before the chamber might be considered without going through the usual procedure. On this occasion, however, we are asked to suspend the Standing Orders to enable a most contentious measure to be discussed. The bill, which it is proposed to introduce, relates to the imposition of Customs duties. </para>

                        <para>- It has everything to do with it, and the honorable senator knows it. The proposal is to amend a most important act upon our statute-book, and one which affects our glorious policy of protection. The bill relates to the policy of those who are alleged to be ardent supporters of the policy of protection which is responsible for creating vast armies of unemployed, and under which the Government receives large sums in ' revenue through the Customs House. We are informed year after year by these gentlemen that Customs duties are imposed for the purpose of excluding goods manufactured in lowwage foreign protectionist countries, in order that Australian workmen may have an opportunity to produce similar goods in the Commonwealth. Those who have given the matter any consideration are well aware that the sole reason for the existence of the Customs Department and the introduction of this measure is to protect, not the Australian workmen or the Australian manufacturer, but the Australian land-owner from taxation. That principle has been followed from time immemorial, and the most illustrious exponent of it in the Commonwealth Parliament to-day is the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten).</inline> He knows that so long as the Treasury is well supplied with revenue by his department it is improbable that taxation will be levied by any .other means. That is the object behind this measure, and no doubt there will be further proposals having the same end in view. The following figures show the Customs receipts during the last few years - </para>

                        <para>- It appeared to me that honorable senators were not fully acquainted with the contents of the bill, and I was merely endeavouring to, place before them some of its salient features. If there were any particular urgency for the passage of the measure I should not object to the suspension of the Standing Orders. The week before last, at the instigation of the Government, the Senate suspended its sittings. Why could not this bill have been brought forward then, so that we should have an opportunity to discuss it fully ? This is typical of the action that we may expect will be taken in the next few days. I should not be surprised if we are frequently asked to suspend the Standing Orders in order that important measures, including another Customs Bill that is now being considered by another place, may be guillotined through this chamber. Unless no other course is open to it, the Senate should not agree to suspend its Standing Orders. Many persons hold the belief that Parliament is a place in which work is done. It is not; it as a place in which to talk. The Senate * has a very comprehensive list of Standing Orders that have been framed for the express purpose of conferring upon honorable senators the right to discuss fully any matta!- that is brought before them. Measures that are hurriedly passed .are as hurriedly repealed. We do not desire to -see such legislation placed on the statute-book. We should jealously guard our rights. I am entirely opposed .to the suspension of our Standing Orders, particularly in connexion with such an exceedingly contentious measure, that has been shrewdly conceived and should, therefore, receive from us the most earnest consideration that we can give to it. The bill was placed in my hands only a few minutes ago, and I have not yet had time to study it properly. For that reason, and others I have given, I must oppose the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - I also, protest against suspending the Standing Orders for the reason put forward by the Government. I agree with what my .Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> has said. The Government has already a mandate from the people. No other Government in the Commonwealth has enjoyed such an overwhelming majority as it has in either House. Tt ' can do whatever it likes  Yet it proposes to go to the people and ask for a fresh mandate, not because of something which has been brought about by Australians, but because something has happened in another part of the world. Some of our .kith and kin have come to Australia, saying, " We were not notified of this happening before we left our country, and we .send out an S.O.S. to you Australians to ask you to help us." </para>

                        <para>- The only legits Mate excuse the Government has in calling the Senate together a month before it originally intended to do so .is to pass Supply to enable it to carry on the functions of government during the. holding of an election. Yet now it asks us to suspend the Standing Orders to validate a schedule of Customs duties. I am a protectionist. I would impose a prohibitive tariff to enable Australia to build up its industries, and  equip  itself in every possible way to do every thing a nation requires to do for its own welfare and self-protection. But I know that this schedule imposes duties on some articles which cannot be made in Australia, and I am asked to suspend the Standing Orders to enable that stupid thing to be done. I repeat that the Government is not warranted in asking the Senate tq do anything except grant Supply. The Leader of my party in another place told the Government long ago that, although it had a majority, it was so supine, helpless, and weak, and its party was so disintegrated, that the position was unsatisfactory to the people of Australia. </para>

In the meantime, the merchant will increase the prices of his goods. For instance, the whisky merchant will increase the price of whisky by1d. a nobbier, and will charge me the increased price. If the duty is not validated later on, he will claim a rebate from the Customs Department, but I shall get nothing back. </para>

                    <para class="block">This afternoon it has been said that the Government should do nothing but seek Supply. I remind honorable senators that the Government has a duty to. perform, and that is to see ' that the affairs of the Country are carried on. The Customs Tariff Act provides that the British preferential tariff shall apply to goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom. The description " goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom " requires definition ; otherwise there Would be continual friction and confusion. The first portion of clause 2 of the bill defines the preference conditions. When preference was introduced in 1907, the Minister of the day provided a definition which stipulated that goods containing not less than 25 per cent. of United Kingdom labour or material should be entitled to receive the preference. This arrangement continued in operation until the 1st April last, when new conditions were brought into effect, and these are set out in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">a, b,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of the first sub-section of the proposed new section 151a, as set out in clause 2 of the present bill, which is introduced with a view to securing the approval of Parliament. It was found by experience that under the 25 per cent. condition, preference was having an effect quite inconsistent with that in view when the policy was introduced. Owing to the lower labour conditions on the continent, combined with the substantially increased preferences of the 1921 tariff, large quantities of semi-manufactured goods were imported into Great Britain from the continent, veneered there with a mere 25 per cent, of British labour or materials, and exported to Australia with the benefit of the preference. The result was not only to injure Australian industries by subjecting them to the competition through Britain of the cheap products of foreign countries, but also to discourage the use of British materials in Britain. During the Prime Minister's visit to England in 1923 the question was investigated. Leading British manufacturers full}' admitted the abuse which was being made of the preference concession. British manufacturers, who would willingly have used British materials, were forced by the competition of those manufacturers using cheap semi-manufactured continental materials- to adopt the same practices to preserve their business. The Australian Association of British Manufacturers sought "the views of British manufacturers. A circular was sent to 506 British firms, and 272 replies were received. Of this number 226 considered that the percentage to entitle to preference should be 50 per cent, or over. Of the 226, .179 favoured 50 per cent., 38 favoured '75 per cent., and seven thought it should be 100 per cent. The result of this inquiry throws a very vivid light on the total inadequacy of the 25 per cent, condition. It is, however, only to be expected that objections will be raised by those British manufacturers who were largely using the cheap continental materials. Briefly put, the new conditions are as follows : - A British manufacturer may import raw materials of any origin, and, provided those raw materials are not subjected abroad to any process which is being commercially performed in the United Kingdom, and provided all the additional processes necessary to convert the materials into the finished article are performed in the United Kingdom, the finished articles will get preference irrespective of the proportion of British labour and materials. If any process which is a process commercially performed in the United Kingdom is applied abroad either to the materials or in the manufacture of goods therefrom, then British labour and material will have to form 75 per cent- °f the factory cost of the finished article to entitle the goods to preference. </para>
                    <para class="block">For example, a British manufacturer may import wool. If all the processes of converting the wool into yarn or cloth are performed in the United Kingdom, the yarn or cloth will be entitled to preference, irrespective of the proportion of British labour or materials. If, however, the British manufacturer imported, say, from France, wool tops for making yarn, or yarn for making cloth, the finished yarn or cloth would have to contain 75 per cent, of British value to get preference. </para>

                            <para>- They would bo regarded as French goods. The whole object of this measure is to keep the labour within the Empire. A distinction is made in regard to Australian materials. A British manufacturer may import Australian material at any stage of manufacture and, provided he does all the rc-st of the work in the United Kingdom, the goods will get the preference. A further exception is also made. Where the goods are of a class or kind not manufactured in Australia, 25 per cent, of British labour or material will suffice to entitle them to the preference. </para>

                        <para>.- I hope that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> will consent to the ad,journment of this debate. To my mind, this is one of the most important measures that the Senate has been called upon to discuss. Any bill that attempts to interfere with the trade of Great Britain should receive our serious consideration; but, following the brief explanation given by the Minister, it is impossible for one to discuss fully the details of this measure. Since the Minister is evidently not prepared to adjourn the debate, I shall have a few words to say. The Minister, in reply to an interjection, indicated that wool manufactured into wool tops in France would be regarded as of French origin on entering Great Britain. Do we really want to trade with the Old Country? Personally, I do. I want Australia to trade with Great Britain, irrespective of any handicap placed upon her products. Remembering the conditions existing in Great Britain to-day, it is hardly fitting far anybody in Australia to prate about the Empire, and at the same time place further restrictions on British trade. I do not imagine for a moment that any member of the Commonwealth Government can solve the difficulties with which British manufacturers have to contend in holding their position in the markets of the world, and particularly those of Australia. A regulation was made some time ago requiring 25 per cent. of British manufacture in goods to which the preference was to. be extended. That margin has not proved sufficient to prevent British goods partly manufactured in other countries from coming' to Australia. For instance, the pulp from which paper is made in Great Britain is manufactured in Norway or Sweden; but we now say that 75 per cent of the labour and material used in the manufacture of paper must be British if the preferential rate is to be secured. We are not producing paper to any extent in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Why put a handicap an Great Britain now in the hope that, later on we shall be producing paper here? If ever there was a government that appeared to have an undying hostility to the Mother Country it is the present Ministry, which, by legislation, has treated Great Britain, not as the mother of the Empire, but as a country that is not entitled to an advantage of more than 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. over countries for which we have no respect. Whereas our products enter Great Britain practically free of duty, British goods are penalized to the extent of 10, 20, 30, and even over 50 per cent. on coming to this country, which Las developed under Britain's policy of free harbours and free trade. Why should we impose any handicap at all on British goods coming here? If it is found that one country can undertake a certain stage of the manufacture of a particular article, and another can complete the process more economically and successfully than any other, thus giving the public a cheaper and better article than could be otherwise obtained,- why should the purchasers of that commodity say, " Although it is the most effective method of manufacturing, we shall not let you land it here"? </para>

                            <para>- Many thousands of them, just as the United States of America, Germany, France, and Italy have under their policy of protection. Freetrade Great Britain has not solved the problem of unemployment, and every increase in the tariff in Australia has been followed by increased unemployment. The New South Wales Labour Government tells us that it has reduced unemployment in that State by 4,000 since it has been in office. But there, are still 8,000 men in New South Wales willing to work and unable toobtain it. We have a tariff mountain high preventing us from exchanging our goods with Great Britain, and we are now asked to agree to a bill to increase it. We are asked to. subscribe to a policy of ordering British manufacturers to bow to conditions, fixed by a legislature in. Australia. The vanity of governments and parliaments that adopt such an attitude ! Let us be frank; and say that we da not want Dominion or British goods, or outside goods at all, and that we want Australians; to have nothing but Australian-made goods. That would' be honest, but where would! it lead us? It would leave the primary producers of Australia without an oversea. market for their produce for the simple reason that trade between countries, resolves 'itself into an exchange of commodities. If we increase the tariff on British goods by 50 per cent, we place that burden upon all our wool, butter, wheat, hides, tallow and other primary products. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> cannot prevent trade with Britain under the existing provision, so now he says that there must be 75 per cent, of Empire labour or material in all imports from Britain, if the goods are to receive the benefit of the preferential tariff. He is determined to hamper the manufacturing trade of Great Britain in every way. I suppose the bill will be carried. It is what one might expect from this Government. I expect also that during the next month or six weeks, # candidates supporting the Government policy, will commence their election meetings with the ' National Anthem, and close with three cheers for the British Empire. It seems that they are prepared to fight, and send other people's sons to die for the Empire, but they are not disposed- to trade with the rest of the Empire. On the contrary, they support proposals that will have the effect of imposing a fine on every British manufacturer who attempts to trade with Australia. They declare that the British manufacturer must conduct his business on lines approved by the Commonwealth Government. Let us consider the position of a steel manufacturer in the Mother Country. Possibly-his raw material comes from Spain in the form of pig iron, because that is the easiest manner in which it can be transported. If, however, his raw material comes from a foreign country the British manufacturer of steel products will not get the benefit of preferential treatment in the Australian market unless there is 75 per cent, of British labour in the finished product. Some people really believe that this kind of legislation helps production in Australia, I wish I could believe it. </para>

Whether or not the Australian Labour party is whole-heartedly protectionist, I am satisfied that no Labour Government will ever follow the lead set by this Government, and attempt to cripple British trade with Australia, The sole aim of tariff legislation passed by this Government during the last two years has been to interfere with the commerical relationship of Great Britain and Australia. This measure is another iniquity - another attempt to make more difficult, the interchange of commodities between the Mother Country and Australia.

                            <para>- I have never been appreciated at my true worth. Bui let me return to the bill. I repeat that this tariff amendment is merely another attempt to strike a blow at British "trade, and that it will adversely affect workmen in Great Britain. A few days ago, evidence given in connexion with the prosecution of British seamen who are on strike in Australia, disclosed that one young man, aged 20 years, was being paid <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> 5s. a month, and another, aged 24 years, was getting <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> 15s-. a month. Counsel for the seamen elicited from a witness who was giving evidence for the ship-owners that, in his opinion, the wages were fair " in accordance with the conditions and customs of the trade." No one can seriously argue that the wage mentioned is sufficient to enable a mau to maintain a wife and family. I hold that wages should always be sufficient to permit a man to marry, and bring up children, according to a reasonable standard of comfort. It might be urged that all this is nothing to do with the bill. I say it has, because the measure is designed to strike a blow at British trade, and to the extent that British trade is adversely affected, so will wages in Britain be reduced owing to a reduction in output. If there are ten men looking for one job wages are bound to <inline font-style="italic">bo.</inline> lower than when there are ten jobs waiting for every mau. I protest against the action of the Government in intro-  during contentious legislation of this nature after the announcement of a dissolution. The Government should allow the bill to stand over until after the elections, or submit it to a referendum of the people. That would not be a costly business, because it would only involve the printing of sufficient, referendum papers on which the question could simply be stated, " Are you in favour of freetrade -with Great Britain - Yes or No?" If this were done, I am satisfied that the people of Australia, being so loyal to Great Britain, would cast an overwhelming vote in the affirmative. This Government, which preaches loyalty to the Empire, has not the courage to put this question to the electors. I have no desire to delay the bill, but I em phatically protest against any attempt to prejudice our friendly commercial relationship with Great Britain. I am not talking merely to delay this measure. </para>

When a pernicious proposal such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ogden</inline> brought forward recently is submitted, I do all in my power ' to prevent its passage. Even if I know I cannot prevent the passage of some bills to which I object, I consider it my duty to exercise all the powers I possess in an endeavour to delay their passing. If an honorable senator has any conscience at all - I do not mean a conscience that works overtime on one occasion and not at all on another - he should do his best to prevent the passage of legislation that will detrimentally affect those whom he represents. It is my most earnest desire to use my power to delay the passage of defective legislation such as this, 'which I have not had time to consider owing to the decision of the Government to go to the country with all its sins thick upon it. I can, however, merely enter my protest against the refusal of the Minister to grant an adjournment of the debate on a measure which aims a deadly blow at the manufacturers of Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- I was merely referring to it in a casual way, and showing that, although the Government pretends to be in favour of increasing the trade with Great Britain, on a recent occasion it did something which had an entirely different effect. I agree very largely with the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner).</inline> It appears to me that we cannot very well debate this question without becoming involved in a fiscal discussion. If I were satisfied that the proposal would have the effect the Government claim I would not oppose it, but I do not think it will. One of the strongest arguments used in support of federation was that under a Federal scheme State Customs barriers would be swept away. That has been achieved. Interstate barriers have now been dispensed with, but the Government, instead of facilitating trade between all portions of the Empire, is restricting it by professing to give a concession to Great Britain. So far as I can see, the preferential proposals of the Government will be of no value to Great Britain, and will be of no more benefit than the alleged concessions given in connexion with Canadian preference. In view of these facts, I intend to oppose the bill. </para>

In moving the second reading of the bill I stated that of 506 British manufacturers approached concerning the preference to be given, 272 replied. Of that number 226 were in favour of a preference of 50 per cent. and over. Of the 226, 179 supported a 50 per cent. preference; 38, 75 per cent.; and seven, 100 per cent. Under this proposal work will be kept within the Empire, and unscrupulous manufacturers in Great Britain prevented  from taking advantage of Australia's preferences. On the old basis that British goods should contain 25 per cent. of British labour or material, it was found that a number of manufacturers were operating unfairly, and an alteration was necessary, not only in our interests, but in order to protect the manufacturers of Great Britain who were " playing the game." After the most careful scrutiny of the proposal under which preference is to be given on articles in which 75 per cent. of British labour or material is used, I do not think any fault can be found with it ' What would be the use of giving preference to British manufacturers if we allowed some to secure the preferential rates in respect of products that should be subject to the higher or general tariff. As I am sure that honorable senators will not subscribe to a principle under which some manufacturers derive an unfair advantage, I trust the Senate will support the second reading of the bill. </para>

                        <para>. -  Those portions of the bill under which such extensive powers are given to the Minister should be deleted. The tariff generally is so objectionable to the whole of the people that we are always confronted with difficulties arising out of it, and those who suffer the most get the Minister or the Tariff Board, which really acts under the direction of the Minister, to relieve them of their difficulties. Those who are able to place their case before the Minister obtain relief, whilst those who suffer and pay do not obtain any consideration. In legislation such as this the powers of the Minister should be fixed, and Parliament should deprive the Minister of the right to discriminate. </para>

                            <para>- When Parliament is not in session the regulations must be laid before both Houses within a specified time after Parliament meets. Parliament itself should decide the conditions under which trade shall be conducted between twodifferent countries. Honorable senators must realize how seriously an alteration in the tariff affects importers, and such alterations should not be made by the Minister, but by Parliament. During recess the Minister has power to frame regulations that will be effective for perhaps six months. It may be that the Minister and the members of the Tariff Board listen only to one side of the case, and after having done so, regulations are framed which will be in operation until Parliament meets. In our tariff laws, we should depart from that principle. Parliament should pass the best tariff of which it is capable, and every one should work under ituntil it is altered by Parliament.

                    <para>Why should such power be given to a Minister? He may make a regulation. Some one may show that it is wrong, and he may alter it. Some one else may then come along and show that it is still wrong, and he may alter it again. For the next six or eight years there will be Labour Ministers in power in the Commonwealth, but I would not give even them this power.

                        <para>. - I support the amendment. The measure should clearly lay down what the Minister can do, and be so definite in its terms that there will be no mistaking its meaning. Probably no body of men in Australia has caused more dissatisfaction than" the Tariff Board. It is clothed with very extensive powers, and at one time could hold its inquiries behind closed doors. It is now proposed to set up another authority in the form of the Minister. Under this provision he may, without consulting anybody, frame regulations which may set aside the decisions of this Parliament. Instead of clothing the Minister with such power we should insert in the bill a provision so definite that every one will know exactly where he stands. Any one who reads the reports of the Tariff Board cannot avoid.  coming to the conclusion that its decisions invariably benefit only a small number of persons. I do not want the Minister to be clothed with such power that those who may be affected by his decisions will not know where they stand. I shall, therefore, vote for the amendment. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill gives effect to the announcement in the Treasurer's budget speech that the Government intended to increase the general exemption from entertainments tax to all payments for admission to entertainments where the charge is less than 2s. 6d. The present general exemption is1s. The present rate of tax is1d. in the first1s., where the payment for admission to a taxable entertainment is 1s. or over, and id. for each 6d. or part of 6d. by which the payment for admission exceeds1s. The present bill adheres to the existing basic rates, and accordingly provides that on the first 2s. 6d. of any payment for admission of 2s. 6d. or over, the tax shall be 2½d.., and id. for each 6d. or part of 6d. by which the payment for admission exceeds 2s. 6d.

                        <para>. - The proposed reduction in the entertainments tax has been too long delayed. The Senate has not been informed to what extent the reduction -will effect the revenue, but that fact does not disturb me. The greater the reduction the more I appreciate it, because the taxation of amusements is most vicious. It is  undoubtedly a direct tax on the poorest section of ' the community, and it was only introduced in the Commonwealth to assist in defraying the cost  of  the late war. The exemption of tickets up to 2s. 6d. is  a  step in the right direction. The bill is not too clear, but  I  take it that the tax on tickets costing 2s. 6d. will be 2½d., and that if the charge for admission exceeds 2s. 6d the tax will be 2½d., plus½d. for each 6d. or part of 6d. by which the charge for admission exceeds 2s. 6d.  I  take it also that if the ticket of admission costs 2s. 5d. it will be free from taxation. Quite recently  I  tried  to  have widows exempted from the payment of estate duty on estates up to £5,000 in value, but the Government could not see its way to agree to my proposal, mainly on the ground that the revenue would suffer. Yet it can bring forward  a  proposal to make the revenue, suffer considerably by exempting a very large section of the community from the payment of entertainments tax. This type of legislation should never have been placed on our statute-book, and I welcome its repeal, even to the small extent proposed. There are many other sources of revenue at our disposal, and we should retire altogether from the field of taxing the amusements of the people. </para>

                        <para>. - I wonder if the Minister would consider a proposal that would afford considerable relief to the musical world. I suggest that the exemption should extend to entertainments the charge for admission to which is 2s. 6½d. That would enable persons paying 2s. 6d. for a ticket to escape the payment of the tax </para>

It is hoped that the building of this very necessary adjunct to our fleet will be commenced at Cockatoo Island at  a  very early date, and that the work of construction will be completed within two years.

                <para>This measure provides for the appropriation of a further £10,000,000 for the payment of war pensions. It deals in no way with the rates and conditions of pensions, but merely provides the money to pay pensions which have been or will be granted in accordance with the conditions set out in the war pensions sections of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. When it is remembered that the war, which necessitated the granting of these pensions, broke out in 1914-15, and that the pensions of incapacitated soldiers and dependants of deceased soldiers totalled more than £129,000 in the following year, it will be seen that the Commonwealth was prompt to recognize and meet its liability in this regard. The pension bill rose each year in leaps and bounds until, in 1920-21 the maximum payment of £7,389,739 was reached. Very little reduction has been made since then, and the estimated expenditure for the current year is £7,200.000. Included in this amount is a small sum for the payment of pensions granted by the Mother Country, and for dominions, which will be subsequently recovered . </para>

                        <para>- The practice is to appropriate sums from time to time as the money becomes available, and to pay them into' the trust fund. The total number of pensions in force on the 11th of this month was 246,152, whilst the annual liability was £7,063,306. A considerable number of new claims is still being received, the majority of which are in respect of new dependants, such as newlyborn children and recently married wives of ex-soldiers who are pensioners. Up to the close of last financial year, the total expenditure on war pensions was £50,810,959. The last War Pensions Appropriation Act was passed in August, 1924, the amount of the appropriation being £10,000,000. The balance of this appropriation remaining unexpended at the close of last financial year was £3,689,765. This will barely suffice for six months' payment, and therefore, a further appropriation becomes necessary. It is anticipated that the appropriation now asked for will cover the expenditure for approximately eighteen months, and that is why the amount exceeds the annual requirement. </para>

                        <para>-  I rise to a point of order. I do not desire to prevent the honorable senator from stating any case that he may desire to bring tinder notice, but it would hardly be fair to other honorable senators if he availed himself of this opportunity of entering upon a long discussion on individual cases. I particularly mentioned, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that the bill had no bearing upon the conditions under which war pensions were paid. An opportunity to discuss the administration of the department will arise when a Supply Bill comes before us. I should think that it would be out of order for an honorable senator to discuss matters of administration on a bill that merely provides for the appropriation of a sum of money and its payment into a trust fund. It seems to me that the conditions under which the pensions are payable could be discussed more  properly  on the first reading of a Supply Bill. </para>

I am not prepared, however, to rule that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> would be out of order in bringing forward any matter relevant to war pensions on a bill which appropriates money for the payment of those pensions. To so rule would be to unduly restrict the rights of honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose for a moment to encroach upon the time of the Senate to any great extent, but a case recently came under my notice in which, in my opinion, a fair deal has nob been given by the department. I refer to a returned soldier named Carter, who lives at North Sydney. He went to the front, and had the misfortune to lose both of his legs, only a few inches of which remain. Up to the present time this man has not received the allowance  of £1 a week for an attendant, which, I understand, is payable to some incapacitated returned men. Therefore, I wish to know under what conditions this soldier can obtain that allowance. Is not a returned soldier who has had the misfortune to lose both his legs entitled to it, and why has the payment been delayed? I could bring forward a great many more cases which ought to be further investigated, but T shall content myself on this occasion by asking that the attention of the Minister in charge of  Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Neville Howse)</inline> be drawn to this case, and that the payment of £1 a week be made retrospectively. This soldier cannot walk. He has to be wheeled from place to place. The representations made by me some time ago have not induced the department to deal justly with this man. He has a wife and two young children. </para>

                    <para class="block">The object of the bill is to give effect to the promise contained in the Treasurer's budget speech that the maximum rate qf invalid and old-age pensions -would be increased to £1 per week. It is proposed that the act shall come into operation on the 8tb October, 1925, on which date al! pensions then in force will' be increased by 53. per fortnight. In order that pensioners may still earn 12s. 6d. per week without affecting the amount of their pensions, it is also proposed to raise the statutory limit of income from £78 to £S4 10s. per annum. The position will then be as under - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Thus, under the act when amended by this bill, a single man will be able to receive pension and income together amounting to £S"4 10s. per annum, or 32s. 6d. per week, whilst a married couple receiving pensions will be able to have a total income, including pensions, of £169 per annum, or £3 5s. per week. It is also intended to increase the amount of allowance which is paid to pensioner inmates of benevolent asylums and hospitals from 3s. to 4s. per week. Prior to 1923 a limited class of persons who were inmates of benevolent asylums were eligible to receive special pensions of 2a. per week only. Other inmates of asylums, and all inmates of hospitals, were ineligible to receive any pension. As a result of the 1923 amendment, all inmates of asylums, whether they were previously pensioners or not, were granted pensions of 3s. per week provided they would have been eligible for pensions if resident outside the institutions. Payment of this amount was also authorized in the ease of all pensioners who were inmates of hospitals for more than 28 days. As a result of the proposed amendment, these persons will in future receive 4s. per week instead of. 3s. The cost of invalid and old age pensions last year amounted, roughly, to £7,000,000. With the increase in pensions provided for by the- bill under consideration the total annual payment will amount to over £8,000,000. </para>

                        GRANT (New South Wales) [5.45}. - I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to dispose of the claim made by honorable senators opposite that the party which they represent was responsible for the introduction of the scheme of old-age and invalid pensions in the Commonwealth. That is not so. This matter was discussed by the executive of the Australian Labour party in New South Wales very many years ago. A deputation waited upon the late
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline>
                        Lyne, who promised that, if he. became Premier of Now South Wales, a measure for the payment of old-age pensions would be introduced. Some trouble occurred, engineered, I believe, by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman, Mr. Hall,</inline>
                        and probably the -Eight  Hon.  W. M. Hughes, who were then known fis the three "H's," with the result that the late
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline>
                        Reid was defeated, and the late
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline>
                        Lyne took his place as Premier of New South Wales. Shortly afterwards a measure for the payment of old-age pensions was placed upon the statute-book, with the unanimous support of the Labour party in New South Wales. The pressure then exerted by the Labour party was entirely responsible for the passage of that legislation.
                    </para>
                    <para>I do not object to the proposed increase to <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> a week. It could have been paid immediately it was ascertained that the Treasurer had a surplus of about £4,000,000 at the close of the last financial year. We may take it that this bill has been introduced because the Government proposes to have a general election on the 14th November. The first increased payment is to be made on the 8th October. I suppose it would be useless t.o submit amendments of a general character at this stage, but if that could be done it would be an advantage. Many persons receiving a pension require some one to look after them, but if they leave a home, of which they are the owner, to receive the attention of a member of the family who may be. living elsewhere, their pension is reduced or they are deprived of the right to collect a pension. A case came under my notice a few days ago of an old man living in his own home, who removed to the residence of his daughter for attention, but because he owned a property he was not entitled to collect a pension. I do not think it was ever intended that the act should operate in that way. As it is I suppose useless to submit amendments, I merely cite this case which is typical of many others, so that when a general amendment of the act is under consideration, cases such as these will receive, the attention of the Government. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to consider an amendment to clause 4 to leave out the word " four " and to insert in lieu thereof the word " five." As we are granting pensioners an additional 2s. 6d. per week, we should' also provide that the pensioner inmates of hospitals should receive 5s. a week for themselves. If such an amendment were adopted the hospitals would receive an additional 6d., and the. pensioner inmate would benefit to the extent of an additional ls. A pensioner has to be in hospital 28 days before the pension is payable, during which time his expenses are going on, and the amount provided is not sufficient to keep him even in tobacco. Those pensioners .who have to go to homes and hospitals should receive more than the additional ls. proposed. </para>

                        <para>. - I hope the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> will not move in the direction he suggests, because the pensioner inmate of a hospital or a home is certainly in a better position than a pensioner living elsewhere. Whilst a pensioner inmate of a hospital or home will receive 4s. to spend, I doubt very much whether a pensioner who has to keep himself will have that amount to spend on incidentals. The pensioner inmates of institutions are provided with a home and with clothing. </para>

                    <para>. - It would perhaps meet the convenience of the committee if I explained the effect of the amendments made by the House of Representatives. Only three principles are involved. In the bill, which originated in the Senate, we conferred the franchise upon British Indians. To this the House of Representatives has agreed, but it has also extended the franchise to naturalized Asiatics. That may sound somewhat alarming, but there is really no occasion for alarm, since there are relatively few naturalized Asiatics in Australia. They' consist mainly of Pales tinian Jews, Syrians, and Armenians. Beyond these there are not a great number of naturalized Asiatics in Australia. We have not been naturalizing other than these since the passing of the Nationality Act, and prior to the passing of that act, under our naturalization laws, Asiatics were excluded from naturalization. A certain class of Syrians are still ineligible ; the privilege is enjoyed only by Christian Syrians. </para>

                        <para>- With the permission of the committee, I intend to do so. I am now explaining the effect of the different amendments so that honorable senators may understand their purport. The next amendment is a rather interesting one, as- it deals with the position of members of Parliament who elect to reside in' the Federal Territory when the Seat of Government is transferred to Canberra. As it was thought that it might be held that a resident in that Territory would not be eligible to nominate as a candidate for a seat in either House of the Parliament, the House of Representatives has inserted a clause under which any senator living in the Federal Territory may, if he so desires, have his name placed upon, and retained upon, the roll for any subdisivion of any division of the State which he represents, and any member of the House of Representatives who lives in the Territory may have his name placed and retained upon the roll for any subdivision of the division which he represents. This will enable a person who lives at the Seat of Government in the Federal Capital Territory to become a candidate for either branch of the Federal legislature. The remainder are merely technical, drafting amendments, consequential upon those that I have explained. I give honorable' senators the assurance that those are the only matters that are dealt with in the message. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - The House of Representatives has madeonly three alterations to the bill that was sent to them by the Senate. Under the law, as it stands at present, any person, to be eligible as a candidate for the Northern Territory, must be an elector who is entitled to vote at the election of a member to represent the Northern Territory ; in other words, he must be a resident of the Northern Territory. The amendment of the House of Representatives makes the qualification similar to that of a candidate in any other Federal constituency; that is, he must be an elector entitled to vote at the election of a member of the House of Representatives.In future, therefore, so long as a person is an elector in any part of the Commonwealth he may be a candidate for the Northern Territory. </para>

A further amendment of the House of Representatives relates to the time for holding an election ill the Northern Territory. Experience has taught us that it is not possible, in the case of the Northern Territory, to fix the same time as is fixed for other constituencies throughout Australia, because of the long distances that have to be travelled and the slow and inefficient means of transport. The amendment provides that the elections shall be held as near as is practicable to the time fixed for other constituencies. </para>

At present there is no time limit upon the Commissioner of Taxation under that act. It is: considered there should be such a limit similar to that imposed upon the Commissioner under the 1922-1924 act in respect of assessments under that act. Many people have a strong objection to what is known as retrospective legislation!; but this bill is not retrospective in the true sense. At any rate, it is not that type of retrospective legislation about which the taxpayer has any right to complain. Parliament, thinking it desirable that the taxpayer who felt that he had been hardly dealt with by the Commissioner of Taxes, should have a board to which he could appeal from the assessment of the Commissioner, appointed such a board; but it never intended that the taxpayer should, because of a decision of the High Court regarding the constitutionality of that board, be permitted to escape from the payment of taxation justly due by him. Parliament had conferred an advantage on the taxpayer by giving him a second review of the assessment made by the Commissioner, but because the High Court held that the board thus constituted was unconstitutional, owing to the phraseology of the provisions of the act, that does not mean that the High Court also held that the taxation which the taxpayers were called upon to pay should not be paid. No taxpayer is wronged if we now validate what was originally intended to be done; that is, to give him the right to some review of his assessment. To say that large numbers of people should be allowed to avoid paying taxation which is justly due by them because the law was not quite in conformity with the Constitution, and. because a board of the kind contemplated could not be appointed in the particular way which was adopted, is a strained interpretation of what is, or is not, retrospective legislation. The Board of Appeal, between the time of its appointment and when it was declared unconstitutional, gave a number of findings, some to the advantage of the taxpayer, and some against the interests of the taxpayer, from his point of view. These findings have now to be validated. By this bill we still retain a review of the Commissioner's findings by a board of review. </para>

                            <para>- It is practically a tie between the Customs Tariff Act and the Income Tax Act. The taxation of incomes is a direct penalty on the man who renders a service to the community. The man who earns a salary, invests his money in property, or borrows other people's money, and employs it in improving homes or buildings of any description is immediately pounced upon by the Federal Income Tax Commissioner, and, unfortunately, also by the State Income Tax Commissioner. Between them, these gentlemen have succeeded in bringing about in this country such a condition of affairs that it is now clearly realized that the less work one does, or the less service one renders to the community, the less penalty one has to pay. It is a step right back into the dark ages to make even more drastic a measure which has this damaging effect upon the progress of "the Commonwealth. If, instead of amending the Income Tax Assessment </para>

                    <para class="block">Act, the Government brought down a proposal to abolish the tax, it would have my very enthusiastic support. Many people were of the opinion that it was not competent for the Commonwealth to impose either an income or a land tax, but of course they were mistaken, because the Constitution gives this Parliament unlimited powers of taxation. I think that is a good thing. This afternoon we have witnessed a very small evacuation by the Commonwealth Government of the field of direct taxation, inasmuch as it has repealed an important section of the entertainments tax, under which £360,000 per annum was collected. </para>

In my opinion the exemption should be substantially increased. I should not care to say how far I would go, but if I had my way I should not leave very much to be taxed. </para>

The general question of the imposition of income taxation, or whether a tax on incomes is good or bad, does not really arise in connexion with this measure. </para>

                            <para>- Then I suppose that I would not be in order in pointing out at this juncture a very much more effective and equitable system of taxation than now obtains. We have been assured by the Minister that the bill is intended to protect the revenue of the Commonwealth; but he did not point out that it is, in reality, a measure to rob taxpayers of rights that they have been held by the High Court to possess. Far from being the harmless and  uncontentious  bill that the Minister suggested it  was, I submit that it is of a highly contentious character. It proposes not only to upset decisions given by the High Court, but also to validate wrongful actions on the part of the Commissioner of Taxation. While I do not reflect upon the Commissioner himself, the High Court has held that the impositions sought to be inflicted by him cannot stand. Much has been said with regard to the board of appeal supposed to have been established in the taxpayers' interests; but upon appeal to the High Court it was held that that board had no legal status, and that its decisions were <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> Surely, in view of the High Court's ruling, this Parliament should not be asked to enact legislation of a retrospective character that would rob taxpayers of their established rights. </para>

My chief objection to the bill is that it mainly proposes to enable the Government to collect from certain taxpayers money which, under existing legislation, they are not entitled to pay. If it were only intended to make the measure apply to future taxation assessments it would be objectionable enough, but its retrospective nature makes it far more obnoxious than it otherwise would be. I give notice that I intend, at the committee stage, to move a new clause which, although it will not entirely meet the needs of the situation, will go  a  certain distance in the direction I desire. </para>

I am not dealing with the equity of income tax at all, although I think it is most inequitable. The question is whether Parliament should come to the assistance of the Commissioner, and, by an amendment of the act, give him authority to collect certain taxation. Instead of being penalized, these people should be complimented upon their mental alertness in showing that the Commissioner and the legal advisers of the Government, to say nothing of members of Parliament, did not understand the provisions of the measure that had been passed. These taxpayers proved that the demand of the Commissioner was illegal. </para><interjection>

                        <para>. - I am sure that the committee will not agree to the amendment. Parliament set up the board of appeal, not in the interests of the Commissioner or the revenue, but in the interests of the taxpayers themselves, and it was not until certain taxpayers had challenged the constitution of the board that the discovery was made that it was <inline font-style="italic">ultra</inline><inline font-style="italic">vires</inline> Can that be advanced as a reason why the litigants should escape taxation? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> Grant takes that view, then all I oan say is that it is extraordinary, and I hope the committee will not agree to the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> Grant contends that this action by the Government is reprehensible, because it snatches the possible fruits of a legal victory on a technicality from those persons who have been astute enough to take legal advice and lodge with the Commissioner of Taxation special expressions of their dissatisfaction with assessments, determinations, and decisions. By their appeal to the High Court they hoped to escape the tax which Parliament obviously intended to apply to them. Those who did not express their dissatisfaction to the Commissioner would still be liable to pay the tax, notwithstanding that equity would require that they should be placed in the same position as those who: hoped to succeed on a technicality. If it had not been for the fact that Parliament made a mistake in the method it adopted in an attempt to give effect to the widely expressed wish of the taxpaying public that a board of appeal should be established to review the decisions of the department of taxation the persons who now seek to escape their just liabilities, would not have had any legal opportunity to appeal to the courts. There is therefore no good reason why they should be specially catered for. as would be the case if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant's</inline> amendment were accepted. If the amendment were carried it would nullify the bill, as it would make it possible for a taxpayer to apply to the High Court for an order against the Commissioner of Taxation to refund the tax paid by that taxpayer and such a taxpayer would probably succeed in his action. That would probably mean that the whole of the income tax collected during the past three years would have to be refunded, or that Parliament to protect the revenue from such a huge loss would have to re-enact the Income Tax Assessment Act in the form in which this bill places it. That is the effect of the amendment, and I am .astonished at an honorable senator submitting such a proposal. Having these facts before it I am sure the Senate will not entertain the proposal for a moment. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened to the Minister {Senator Pearce) and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> Grant, and I am of the opinion that the only decent thing the Minister can do is to delete the provision of the bill to which exception is taken. The position is that certain persons acting within their legal rights in resisting the assessments made by the Income Tax Commissioner have had their cases decided in their favour by the High Court. Notwithstanding this, the Government say that although certain taxpayers have proved their case to the satisfaction of a properly constituted court, they will make them pay by passing this measure. The Minister does not. appear in favour of granting even moral justice, and says in effect that those .who have successfully appealed shall not escape. They are to have no  redress. Morally the Government should hand back the amount of tax collected from those who did not appeal. That should be done however costly the procedure is, and irrespective of the amount involved. If certain indi.viduals or companies in resisting what they consider an unfair charge obtained a verdict from the highest court in the country, I shall not be a party to setting aside that verdict by means of retrospective legislation. </para>

I realize that the intention of Parliament was all right, but how often is the intention of Parliament set aside by the interpretation placed upon our acts by judges of the High Court. So far as I understand the matter, the High Court has given a decision in favour of certain companies, and we are now asked to pass legislation so that these companies cannot avoid making payments which the court says are illegal. The Government has introduced a bill providing that certain individuals or companies shall pay a tax, which the High </para>

                        <para>. - I enter an earnest protest against legislation of this character. The Government, having accepted the challenge to go to the country, now comes forward with a bribe in its hands for a certain section of the community. The use that it is making of its newspaper and secret-service organizations is bad enough, but it is infinitely worse to ask a Parliament that, to all intents and purposes, is dead, to sanction action of this sort. The Leader of the Opposition in another place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Charlton)</inline> compelled the Government to appeal to the people, and, in order to honour an undertaking that he entered into, I, this afternoon, allowed measures to go through without saying one word upon them. The Standing Orders have been suspended probably half a dozen times with but one protest from me, when that course was originally proposed. This is the first that I have heard of the Income Tax Bill. The Standing Orders have been suspended, and the Minister proposes to rush it through, in order that persons who have large incomes may be relieved from the payment of a certain amount of their income tax. </para>

A man who, under existing legislation, has to pay a tax of £50, will, under this measure, Have the amount reduced by £6 5s. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> is waiting somewhat impatiently to introduce a bill, the effect of which will be that those whose incomes do not reach £200 a year will be taxed through the Department of Trade and Customs on every piece of cotton goods that they buy for their wives and children. Is that a fair thing ? We are increasing the load that is placed on the shoulders of those who are least able to bear it, whilst ai the same time we are removing a portion of the load that is carried by those who ane well able to bear it. </para>

                            <para>- When that bill comes before us I shall probably find that it will reduce the burden of those who buy largely, and increase it on those who purchase cotton goods. This measure is in reality a bribe held out on the eve of an election to the big income tax payers. The next measure that is to come before us will be found to have been framed in such a way that it will enable the Government to obtain from the poorer section of the community the revenue that it proposes to forego under this measure. I have been studying the figures relating to employees in secondary industries, and 1 find that the average wage is not greater than £3 12s. a week. Income tax is not paid by those who earn less than £300 a year. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that. Is there any reason why they should not? Earners of small incomes have been taxed at an extraordinary rate for the last ten years. Revenue had to be obtained from somewhere. The Government, however, has in all its legislation and administration considered the interests only of those who have plenty of money. The load of debt is so enormous, the interest payments so substantial, that the Government should refrain from lightening the burden of those who can well afford to pay, especially as it proposes to tax more heavily the harder working and poorer section of the community. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not intend to allow this bill to pass without offering most strenuous opposition to the continuation of the schedules upon which the income tax is collected. I have a distinct recollection, nob perhaps to the credit of members of this Parliament, of the occasion on which this idea of having a graduated scale - it was imported, I believe, from Germany - was first discussed here. I think the then Commonwealth Statistician sent this confounded thing up to ns, and we all looked very wise, but I do not think one of us understood it although we all agreed that it was just "it." Unfortunately a few days afterwards one of the Sydney University professors expressed some doubt as to the accuracy of the scale, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> reviewed his formula and sent along a fresh one. When that came before us we were no better informed than on the first occasion. We all again looked exceptionally wise, and. we agreed to apply the schedules as submitted, but I venture to say that the number of members of the Commonwealth Parliament with mixed incomes who can calculate exactly the amount of tax they will be charged by the Income Tax Commissioner is negligible. We simply pay what we are asked to pay, looking as pleasant as we can. The schedules are such that we ought to abandon them. I do not think any State in the Commonwealth has been foolish enough to adopt them. </para>

                            <para>- It is not to its credit if it has done so. Taxation ought to be imposed in such a simple way that any citizen can tell exactly what he has to pay. There are very few, if any, taxpayers who can calculate the amount of Federal income tax they are required to pay. People have either to rely on the assistance of expert agents or to pay what the Commissioner asks. I think I am correct, in saying that the staff of the Taxation Office has been seriously depleted because officers, realizing the weaknesses of the act, have set up in business on their own account, and have made very excellent incomes by piloting their clients through the various loopholes that exist in the act. It is quite common in Sydney and Melbourne and elsewhere to see on signboards the words, "Taxation Experts." A man who is paying taxation through the Customs House knows exactly what he has to pay on every item. Under our famous progressive land tax the landholders, although they do not always pay too promptly, know what they have to pay. Municipal taxation is simplicity itself. It does not matter what is the value of any property in any portion of New South Wales, it is valued by the Valuer-General at so many hundred pounds "and a flat rate of so many pence per pound is applied. The payer at once knows how much ha has to pay. But under the Commonwealth income tax method of graduated curves it is most difficult to calculate what any person has to pay. I should like to see the Government abandon this method and impose a rate of so much per pound, rising with easy breaks, say, at every £50. In that way one would be in a position to calculate the amount of tax to be paid. It should not be necessary for experts to secure lucrative employment in attending to details of assessments, and in helping taxpayers in the direction I have indicated. I shall not attempt to move tonight to have these schedules altered, because I would not succeed if I attempted to do so; but I am making these remarks in the hope that later on Parliament will insist on the adoption of a scale of tax so that he who runs may read. Another objectionable feature of the original act which I think ought to be repealed is that section which gradually but surely eliminates the £300 exemption after a person's income reaches a certain amount. </para>

                            <para>- My view is that the £300 exemption should hold right through every taxable income. However, it is not dealt with in this bill. I regret that the Government has not proposed a greater reduction in the income tax. I should hail with satisfaction the complete evacuation by the Federal Government of the whole field of income taxation. It should not- retire from the field of land taxation, but it certainly should from the field of income taxation, because the revenue from our Customs and Excise duties, which have recently been increased, is more than sufficient to meet the legitimate expenditure of the Commonwealth. It was never contemplated hy those who supported federation that the Commonwealth expenditure would' approach anything like its present enormous proportions. My opinion is that the Commonwealth should retire at the earliest possible moment from the field of income taxation and discontinue the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States. If the States like to insist on this foolish system of taxation, let them do so. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing in this bill except the proposed reduction of the tax, and, although I may differ in some respects from my leader in this regard, I welcome a reduction in the income tax. It is surprising, however, that all the bills before us, which are directly or indirectly taxation measures, are, when closely analysed, so drafted as to place the burden of the taxation proposed to be raised on the shoulders oi those who are least able to bear it. I shall not oppose this bill, but I should like the Government later to consider the desirability of altering the schedules so that every citizen may clearly understand what income tax he has to pay. </para>

Honorable senators who support that view are angry because the affairs of the Commonwealth have been managed in such a way as to make this reduction possible. Last year the Government not only effected a reduction of 10 per cent. in income taxation, but it also raised the exemption so that persons with incomes under £300 a year were not required to pay any tax. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> Grant stated emphatically that the income tax levied on individuals was passed on by them to the community. Assuming that his argument is correct, does not every section of the community benefit by a reduction in income taxation, since there must be less tax to be passed on? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> therefore should welcome the reduction. I hope that when the party on this side of the chamber returns next year ' from the election considerably strengthened, it will be able to grant even more relief to the taxpayers than is now proposed. A statement that I made some time ago will bear repetition. I pointed out that it was only because we have heavy war obligations to meet that the continuance of the income tax is necessary. The amount of tax levied to-day is not nearly sufficient to meet the interest and sinking fund payments required annually in connexion with our war loan indebtedness, and therefore there must foe some other method of raising the money required to meet our obligations. Personally, I should like to do without taxation, but as long as the need exists we must meet it like men. I hope that this will be the last time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will charge the Government with offering a bribe to the people when he knows that the Ministry is actuated by a desire to reduce their burden whenever it is possible to do so. </para>

A man in receipt of £1,000 a year is in a position to pay the present income tax. </para>

                            <para>- Of course I am a protectionist ; but it should be possible to relieve the people on the bottom rungs of the financial ladder instead of helping those who have ° already climbed to a considerable height. I realize that the desire of Ministers is to help the big man. That is why they are on the Treasury  bench. I do not go so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and say that the proposed reduction of 12$ per cent, is a bribe to the electors. I believe that the Government, when it foreshadowed this reduction, had no expectation of an immediate election. I give it the credit, therefore, of at least being honest in that direction, but I think that it was an error of judgment to make no attempt to reduce the taxation of the small man. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> had said that a certain wealthy section of the community would be benefited by the reduction <inline font-style="italic">lae</inline> would have been nearer the mark than he was. Why should we reduce taxation on one hand, and borrow millions of pounds abroad? The fact that we are constantly borrowing shows that the revenue is insufficient for our purposes. It seems unnecessary and undesirable, therefore, to reduce the present income taxation. </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate the. Government on its start to evacuate the field of direct taxation) which it entered on account of war obligations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> surely does not imagine that the people who will benefit directly by the reduction will put the money thus saved into a stocking. It will be used in industries, and will directly provide employment for the section whom the honorable senator claims to represent. We are suffering to-day through a shortage of capital for investment in industries. If one tries to borrow, even on the best security, he must pay 6 A or 7 per cent, interest. It is well known that nothing checks the expansion of industry and the provision of employment more than financial stringency. Although there may not be any individual instances of great reductions of taxation, the Government's proposal will mean a large sum in the aggregate. The money saved will not be hoarded up, but will be used at once to nourish industries, and provide work. Australia's most pressing need is a reduction of taxation, and the cessation of strikes, which, together, are responsible for the unem ployment trouble. I trust that in the next Parliament it will be possible for the Federal Government to. evacuate the field of direct taxation altogether, and leave it to the States. </para>

I quite understand the honorable senator's attitude, because he represents the wealthy section. Although he opposes direct taxation, he does not object to the indirect taxation of the poor. He does not mind what they pay for their cotton shirts and overalls, and he does not protest against the heavy payments they are called upon to make through the Customs. He has no sympathy for the worker who may feel the need of a pint of beer at the close of a heavy day's work, and has to pay increased taxation on his refreshment. </para>

The bill will not come into operation until July next, so there was no need for its introduction at this stage. In the circumstances, I can employ no other language. The bill is a flagrant and an open bribe to the rich people of this country. </para>

                <para class="block">On the 2nd day of this month a resolution was tabled in another place amending the schedule of the Customs Tariff, 1921-24, and bringing the new schedule of duties into operation as from the 3rd September, 1925. The Customs duties are now being collected under the authority of the Customs Tariff, 1921- 24, and of that resolution. As it will not be possible for Parliament to discuss the proposed amendments before the impending dissolution, it will be necessary to validate the collection of those duties by an act till such time as the new Parliament can proceed with the consideration of the proposed amendments. The object of this bill is to validate such collection. If the bill is not passed, the proposals will lapse upon the dissolution of Parliament. This would have a very serious effect upon industry, as the additional protection which has been granted to many industries by the proposals would thereby be lost; and, moreover, it would be necessary to refund the duties collected under the resolution. It is the intention of the Government to afford honorable senators an opportunity to discuss the tariff proposals after the new Parliament has been elected, and with that object in view the duration of the act has been limited to twelve months. Parliament may, however, deal with the Tariff schedule at any time. Honorable senators who have had an opportunity to peruse the schedule, will, I am sure, admit that an honest attempt has been made to rectify anomalies that have been found as a result of experience, and that the Government has . tried to place the tariff on a scientific basis. </para>

I do not drink whisky, but I would make a good deal of noise if I had to pay taxation on every cup of tea that I drink. Therefore, those who consume other beverages have as much right as I have to consideration in the matter of taxation on beverages. I thought that the Government, instead of increasing the Customs duty on whisky, might want to reduce the excise duty to give the local manufacturer some advantage. If that is not the intention,I have nothing fur-' ther to say on the matter. </para>
