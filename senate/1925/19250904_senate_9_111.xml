          <para>I thought that honorable senators opposite would regard a motion to submit a matter to the Standing Orders Committee as formal, seeing that both sides of the Senate are represented on that committee, and that any debate on the subject ought really to take place when the recommendation conies forward for adoption. I am not in a position to say that the committee will bring forward a recommendation that will prove satisfactory to either side of the Senate. However, as honorable senators opposite have not chosen to regard this motion as formal, I may explain that -what I have in mind is the desirability of the Senate adopting a standing order similar to Standing Order 262a of the House of Representatives. </para>

              <para>- It is true that that standing order is generally and colloquially known as the &#34;guillotine.&#34; Our Standing Orders 281. 431, and 433, under which, in the Senate or in committee, the motion &#34; That the Senate - or the committee - do now divide&#34; may be moved, arc most unsatisfactory. The application of the closure in this way is a most unfair method of limiting debates. We had an example quite recently of the way in which it limits debate on one side of the Senate only. &#34;When one side is anxious to put a bill through and another side is anxious to oppose it, the latter proceeds to put up what is generally known as a &#34; stone wall.&#34; It talks practically all the time, while the other side, which is in favour of the bill, is practically gagged and prevented from expressing any opinion on the measure. Therefore the operation of these standing orders is unfair, because in practice it means that the minority is able to gag the majority. On the other hand, if the &#34; guillotine &#34; were in operation, both sides of the Senate would have an opportunity to state their opinions, and the side which wasted time by putting up what is called a &#34;stone wall&#34; would lose the opportunity to state its views on the proposal under consideration. Therefore, its waste of time would recoil on itself. </para>

              <para>- No. As a time would be fixed for a particular stage of the bill, both sides would have the opportunity to speak. The  President  calls- on speakers from either side alternatively. If an honorable senator had an hour in which to speak, and deliberately wasted his time, it would recoil on his own head, whereas an honorable senator on the other side supporting the proposal would devote his hour to giving reasons why the measure should pass. The side that wasted its time would penalize itself, and&#39; not the side supporting the bill. This provides an eminently fair method of debating a measure. I take it that the Standing Orders Committee will recognize that, as there are only 36 honorable senators, a greater time could be allowed for the various stages of a bill than might be allowed in a House containing 72 members. But all these matters will, no doubt, be fully considered by the Standing Orders Committee, and if the committee brings up a report in favour of the adoption of the proposed new standing orders, the Senate can debate the merits or demerits of its recommendation. </para>

            <para>-10].- Were I blest with that chess players&#39; intellect which enables one to look ahead to the next move, I should support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in this matter. For some years we have enjoyed a certain amount of freedom in Opposition, but. now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> comes along with a proposal to prevent himself from enjoying the same amount of freedom when he in turn is in Opposition. -If I were so minded that I would seek to prevent the honorable senator from having, when in Opposition, the freedom that I have enjoyed, I would say, &#34;Thanks. You are proposing to put a weapon into the hands of the next Go&#39;vernment that will enable it to stifle debate on your, part.&#34; Is the Senate suffering from too much debate or discussion, or is there too much opposition to measures? Has the reputation of the Senate suffered in the estimation of the public outside? I am afraid that, instead of being a place where men meet to parley,  the Senate is generally unemployed waiting for business to be done in another place. It is merely putting up an appearance of being par.t of the Parliament of the country. On Monday last, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was in the unenviable position of having to rise time after time to move on every clause of the Peace Officers Bill &#34; That the committee do now divide.&#34; He did it even before there was time for any discussion on a clause. In regard to that bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was evidently following instructions received from the British Government, because, according to this morning&#39;s newspapers, questions are being asked as to the need for the action of the British Government in creating a new police force. The explanation given is that the London Police Force is not sufficient to do certain work, and that another force has been called into existence for that purpose. Taking the discussion on the Peace Officers Bill as an example of the obstruction that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has in mind, I point out that, as a matter of fact, on Saturday I did not exhaust the time allotted to me under the Standing Orders, and, as I did not feel my usual self, I did not remain in the chamber to listen to the very eloquent addresses of honorable senators supporting the Government. The debate on Saturday was reasonably fair, and did not take up more than the usual time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> questions that statement, but <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show the time occupied by honorable- senators on both sides. The debate was conducted by both sides in a way that was a credit to a chamber which was brought into existence ito. discuss legislation. Hitherto the parliamentary practice has been to permit adequate debate on every clause of a bill in committee, but when we reached that stage in the discussion of the Peace Officers Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> took steps te prevent debate. As soon as clause 1 was submitted he moved - &#34; That the committee do now divide.&#34; Similarly on clause 2, a very important provision of the bill, there was no debate. </para>

If we had been in office, and had wished to &#34;guillotine&#34; the Peace Officers Bill through, we could easily have arranged for the guillotine to fall at, 3ay, 11.30 on Saturday morning last, and by hinting to the  Chairman  of Committees that for once in his life he must be blind in one eye, and not give members of the Opposition the call, we could have prevented the expression of the Opposition&#39;s view. </para>

              <para>- Since a one-time Labour member presides over the Senate and a former Labour member is  Chairman  of Committees, I can quite understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> taking the view that a present-day Labour  chairman  might fall in with such a suggestion. As a matter of fact, however, he would not do anything of the kind. I am merely pointing to the possibilities even under the suggested new standing order, in order to show how unwise is the course proposed. For the last three years we, on this side, have had all the freedom which Parliament, in its wisdom, has preserved to us. Speaking generally, there has been fairly full discussion of the various measures that have come before the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> now tells us that we must fall into line with another place. </para>

              <para>- The Minister has indicated that we should have a new standing order to limit debate; and I am endeavouring to show that the Minister is proposing to forge chains that will cut most deeply into his own flesh when he and his friends are in Opposition after the next election. I remind the Minister that he may become responsible for the making of new standing orders, but he cannot ensure for himself and his colleagues permanent occupancy of the Ministerial benches. The people will have something to say about that. I challenge any honorable senator to point to an occasion when there was undue discussion on the Peace Officers Bill. It passed the report and third-reading stages in eight hours. Will any honorable senator declare that that was unusual? </para>

              <para>- I am aware that the Minister is always anxiously looking at the clock when I am addressing the Senate. Now he wishes to employ a new standing order to prevent me from being heard. On Saturday, without being aware of it, I spoke for 58 minutes. I admit I was running pretty close to the schedule, but I had said all I wished to say, and when we reached the committee stage I did not occupy my full quarter of an hour upon clause 1. I spoke for only about three minutes. Therefore, when the Minister, late on Saturday night, started to &#34; gag&#34; the measure through committee, I determined to employ obstructive tactics, because it is just as offensive to me to find a Minister stifling debate as it may be for the Minister to find a measure being delayed in its passage. </para>

              <para>- If ever I reach the position which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> occupy, I shall endeavour, in the conduct of the business of this chamber, to ensure to honorable senators privileges enjoyed in the House of Lords, and allow them to discuss what they like, when they like, and as long as they like, without interference from the Chair. Had I desired to waste time, either on Saturday or Monday, I could have occupied at least three hours on a formal motion for the adjournment of the Senate. I did not wish to do that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> now has in mind some new-fangled method to stifle debate. The reputation which he acquired during the committee stages of the Peace Officers Bill by moving &#34; That the committee do now divide &#34; or &#34; That the question be now put&#34; is too much for such a modest statesman. He does not wish to be placed in the same position again. A Tariff Bill will be before us in the course of a few weeks. Possibly the Minister fears that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> and I, being of the same fiscal faith, may prove troublesome, and so he wishes to be prepared to stifle discussion by those of us who are still sufficiently loyal to Britain to wish to trade with her. </para>

              <para>- I do not think there is much difference between us, except, perhaps, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> was expounding the wisdom of his political faith when I was a boy, and I must give him credit for not having changed his views. This may be one reason why, time after time, he has received the endorsement of the people in New South Wales, and why I, reflecting his intelligence, also have their commendation. I can assure those four or five honorable senators opposite who may not be called upon shortly to face the angry electors that when we are returned to power after the next elections we shall be tolerant, and allow full discussion of measures in this Senate, which is designed by the Constitution to safeguard the interests of the States. Some men come into this Parliament, remain hero for many years, and pass out of it without realizing that the function of Parliament is to discuss legislative measures, and that the business of government is to govern. Honorable senators opposite have entrusted the management of affairs in this chamber to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce, Senator Crawford,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator &#34;Wilson</inline> because, presumably, they are the most competent men in their ranks for that special purpose. If those who are selected for this business of governing fail in the proper discharge of their duties, legislative measures passed by this Parliament go for nought. Let us consider what happened in connexion with the deportation law. Its machinery was defective, so it became necessary to pass the Peace Officers Bill, but before the latter measure had received parliamentary approval the work which it was intended to do had been carried out by officials other than peace officers. Summonses had been served upon certain people. Was there any occasion to hurry ? I see in the press this morning that the New South Wales Government will resist by law any attempt to deport citizens of that State. It requires no prophet to forecast that if it takes up that attitude in earnest there will be a legal tussle for many months before the Commonwealth Government accomplishes its purpose. And yet, forsooth, the Minister practically threatens to deprive, not one member, but the whole Senate, of the right of free discussion. This is a matter that I may take the opportunity of referring to when  the Standing Orders Committee meets. My point is that if the majority on one side determines that a debate shall end at a certain time, there should be a time limit placed on honorable senators on both sides of the chamber. If we had the guillotine in operation, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and I had an opportunity of speaking on a particular measure, a serious inroad would be made upon the time permitted for its debate. What would happen then to the rights of other honorable senators? I realize that the Minister desires that the Senate shall appear to be at work, since the Supply Bill, which we all expected, has not come along. </para>

              <para>- The Minister has given us some work to do to-day, and we are now discussing the question of the further curtailment of the freedom of members of this House. But it cannot be claimed that that freedom has been abused in this chamber. If it ia felt that the existing standing orders place the right of debate into the hands of one side mare than another, let us alter them. But the Minister&#39;s proposal might result in the silencing of an honorable senator whose opinion would be of the utmost value. . Some types of representatives, like myself, perhaps, manage to force themselves to the front, but the Government&#39;s proposal might prevent an honorable senator of the reserved type from speaking, or it might convert him into a forceful man, always determined to be heard, whether he had anything useful to say or not. After the next election, I may be in a position to apply the guillotine. </para>

I know that the pearls of wisdom that I am offering honorable senators opposite are being wasted, but I point out that the effect of their action will be to gag themselves in the next Parliament. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps I would; but the proposal is so new that it shocks one&#39;s sense of decency. The Standing Orders Committee is like all other committees appointed under the system of party government; the majority predominates, and no regard is had for the fitness of the members for the positrons to which they are appointed. I am no believer in numbers alone constituting the guiding principle in the appointment of these committees. One would imagine that with a following such as I have in this chamber, I would have one supporter on the panel of  Deputy  Chairmen of Committees, but party government robs me of that right. When my beloved colleague, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> was with me, I had one, but since his death I have had none. On the Standing Orders Committee the Opposition is represented by Senators Findley and O&#39;Loghlin and myself. </para>

              <para>- Not on a committee of this kind. It seldom has any business to transact. Had I permitted this motion to pass as formal, I could have registered an attendance at a meeting of the committee. The Standing Orders, generally speaking, meet the heeds of the Senate; but the curtailment of debate, as now proposed, would be the greatest mistake a deliberative assembly could make. A majority with unlimited power should be most anxious to check a Ministry that hurries to filch the right of full debate from representatives of the people. When any problem is under discussion in the Senate, full debate is bound to lead to a better solution than limited discussion would. Just as when the evil spirit entered the herd of swine, they went headlong down to the sea, so this Government will be swept out of existence if it robs the representatives of the people of the right of free discussion. The Australian people are noted for their love of liberty and free institutions. </para>

              <para>- I say candidly that nothing could give me more pain than to see a party bearing the name of Labour curtailing debate in Parliament. If the party opposite passes vicious rules, I promise honorable senators that they will have to smart under them when my turn comes to lead a majority in this chamber. I have no hesitation in saying that the action taken in the New South Wales Parliament has my disapproval. If the curtailment of debate is wrong here, it is equally wrong there. In the Parliament of New South Wales I have witnessed scenes so exciting that perhaps for hours members were almost beside themselves in their anger on account of attempts to stifle debate. From October last until June of this year Parliament was in recess, but if we had been sitting  during that period I could have expressed every thought my brain could conceive. In discussing this motion I do not wish to exhaust the time allowed me under the Standing Orders, but having seriously and calmly explained my views I may conclude by saying that at least three of the six honorable senators now opposite are making a rod for their own backs. If I occupy the position of  President  of this Chamber, or that of Leader of the Government, it will be my duty to see that effect is given to whatever standing orders are in force. I must, however, repeat that honorable senators opposite should remember that they have a solemn duty to perform, and should not assist in depriving <inline font-style="italic">&#34;the</inline> representatives of the people of the rights which they have always enjoyed. </para>

            <para>. -  In supporting the motion submitted by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> it is not my intention to discuss the merits or demerits of any conclusions at which the Standing Orders Committee may arrive. It is a matter of regret to me that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> should have prejudged the case, <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> endeavoured to prevent the committee from inquiring into its merits. The honorable senator has wasted a good deal of time because the opinions he has expressed to-day will be repeated by him before the Standing Orders Committee, and also when the motion for the adoption of the report of the Standing Orders Committee is before the Senate, if the report is as he presumes it will be. The honorable senator has, however, taken the course which will ensure the report of the Standing Orders Committee being of the nature he fears. If the honorable senator had decided to treat the motion as formal he could then have gone to the committee and left the members of that body with a more or less open mind. The honorable senator introduced the party element at the outset. Personally, I suppose I am not what may be regarded as a good party man. </para>

              <para>- I believe there are times when I have been responsible for keeping the right honorable gentleman guessing. I do not think anything can be gained by discussing the merits or demerits of this motion. The committee is to meet, and I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will not pursue the course he said he often does, and be absent, because I feel sure that when not speaking in public his advice is of great assistance; but when speaking in public he furnishes a very interesting example of the difference between sane reasoning and rhodomontade.  His  public utterances are absolutely devoid of the sense of proportion. He has expressed opinions on this simple motion which might well have been uttered on ,an occasion when we were deciding whether we should or should not go to war. The honorable senator reminds me of a person using a 16-in. gun to shoot sparrows. For these reasons I regret this discussion should have arisen, and that the question should have been prejudged before it goes to the committee. Nevertheless I welcome the motion, and I think it will be the duty of the Standing Orders Committee to recommend some means of ensuring that debate will be more effective, reasonable, and to the point - that is the point - than it is at present. </para>

            <para>-55]. - It is the duty of honorable senators to seriously discuss matters of moment to the Commonwealth and the people of the Commonwealth. The motion now before the Senate should be seriously debated by honorable senators on both sides of the chamber. Conditions change very rapidly nowadays, and if there be any truth in the rumour I heard this morning, this Government is undecided as to whether the next general election shall be held at the end of November or during the first week of December. If there is any truth in the rumour, we should, be acting against our own interests and the people whom, we represent if we did not advance reasons why this question should not be referred to the Standing Orders Committee. The Federal Parliament was established in 1901, and for nearly a quarter of a  century this chamber, as one branch of the Federal Legislature, has conducted its business under certain standing orders. Up to the present there has been no serious protest from any member of the chamber concerning the Standing Orders under which we conduct our business. Passing reference has been made to what occurred a day or two ago. &#34;What happened? A few hours were devoted to a discussion in which members of the Opposition, as well as the supporters of the Government, took an active part. There was nothing from a governmental point of view to prevent the speedy passage of the bill; the Standing Orders under which we are already working gave the Minister in charge of the measure the fullest opportunity to curb discussion. The Minister availed himself of the opportunity, and, as a matter of fact, was so anxious to push the bill through that he did not give honorable senators on this side an opportunity of seconding the motion submitted. It is true that when the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> rose at the report stage and submitted a motion that the bill be recommitted for a certain purpose, the Minister missed an opportunity in not moving, &#34;That the Senate do now divide.&#34; Apparently he was asleep, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> Grant was allowed to second <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> motion. If the Minister had been alert, or anxious to save time, he could have prevented it. Later on he did what he had previously neglected to do, as, when the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Needham),</inline> in addressing himself to the third reading of the bill, moved a specific motion, the Minister immediately moved, &#34; That the Senate do now divide.&#34; There should, therefore, be no reason to provide additional standing orders to facilitate the transaction of business. The proposed power is too drastic. The Government, of course, cannot get the power it now requires until the Senate agrees .to the motion submitted by the Minister this morning, and later adopts the report of the Standing Orders Committee. Does any one really believe that a committee, consisting of six supporters of the Government and three members of the Opposition, will consider the question from other than a party point of view? When this </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Government appoints committees, it invariably arranges that the majority in each case shall consist of members of its own party. The members of the Standing Orders Committee are: The  President,  the  Chairman  of Committees, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan,</inline> the Government Whip; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley, Senator Foll,</inline> a Government supporter; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator H.</inline> Hays, a Government supporter; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kingsmill,</inline> an ardent Government supporter; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin.</inline> Three of those are members of the Opposition and six are supporters of the Government. If the motion is agreed to that committee will undoubtedly make a recommendation in accordance with the wishes of the Government. There is no justification for the adoption of such a standing order. Parliament has been sitting this year since the 10th of June, but the Senate has not had its time wholly occupied by any means. We had a lengthy discussion on the Immigration Bill, and an alltooshort discussion on the Peace Officers Bill ; but, apart from those measures, there has been very little debate on the proposals of the Government. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> has pointed out that if a limit is fixed for the discussion of a bill the Government supporters may monopolize practically all the time available, and the members of the Opposition may be debarred from speaking. I do not think any sensible Government would be anxious to create that situation; but I should not be at all surprised if this Government attempted to do so. It succeeded to some extent in silencing us the other day, for it prevented us from submitting quite a number of amendments that we desired to move to the Peace Officers Bill. We were told then that the Government wanted the bill to be passed as quickly as possible in order that the officers who were to be appointed pursuant to its provisions might servo summonses on certain leaders of an industrial organization in New South Wales who were supposed to be disobeying the law. But what happened ? Before the bill was passed the summonses were served by Customs officers. The statement of the Government that it was urgently necessary to place the measure on the statute-book was so much camouflage. </para>

My object was merely to make a passing reference to it to show that even cases which the Government considers to be urgent are at times not so. The Standing Orders already provide for passing legislation in an expeditious manner, and I consider that the Government should not have any greater power than it now has. For that reason,&#39; I ask honorable senators to reject the motion. </para>

              <para>- Our Standing Orders have been amended in only one important respect for a considerable number of years. Some honorable senators may recollect that on one occasion, years ago, I addressed the Senate for three and a half hours on the subject of land values taxation. It was in consequence of that effort of mine that the Standing Orders were amended and a time limit of ene hour placed upon honorable senators, with provision for an extension of time for an extra 30 minutes with the approval of the Senate. It has frequently been found necessary to grant honorable senators an extension of time. It is impossible adequately to discuss any important subject that comes before us in one hour, or even in one hour and a half. It cannot be done. The Senate suffers considerably in consequence of the manner in which opportunities for debate are limited. It is to my mind an unwritten law, and one which honorable senators ought to respect that they ought at all times to be ready to resent to the utmost of their ability any infringement of the rights handed down to them , particularly the right to discuss to almost any length any question submitted to them. The Senate ought not to have this right filched from it. There are only 36 senators, and we ought to have ample time at our disposal to discuss questions at almost any ordinary length. We have 450 standing orders at present, and in my opinion they are all needed. It is a most difficult matter for a number of men to get together to devise rules that will keep them in order, and sometimes it requires a very firm presiding officer to enforce them. Our Standing Orders are not the. haphazard work of a scratch subcommittee. They have been carefully compiled and built up year after year, and while I do not regard them as one might regard the laws of the M&#39;edes and Persians, before I would agree to any alteration of them, I would need to be satisfied that there was ample justification for it. The Minister, in proposing to refer this matter to a committee where the Ministerial party has a two to one majority, has not advanced sufficient reasons for the adoption of a standing order which may have the. effect of seriously curtailing the right of the Opposition to discuss matters. On how many occasions in the past has the Government had any excuse to curtail the right of free speech? My memory does not carry me back to any occasion on which that right has been abused. No doubt when a government develops an idea and desires to transfer it at once to the statute-book, it is somewhat inconvenient to find that the Standing Orders permit the Opposition to discuss the proposal at some length. It was very appropriately said by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> that Parliament is the place not only for work but for talk. Parliament is a place where business should be delayed and carefully considered before any expression of opinion is transferred to the statute-book. In 99 cases out of 100 hasty legislation is valueless. It is generally swept away when the hysteria responsible for its enactment has passed. Otherwise it becomes a dead letter. We have now a reasonable opportunity to discuss any measure brought before the Senate. We can speak at length on the first reading of certain bills and on &#39; the second reading of all bills. We have ample opportunity to discuss almost every detail in committee. Even on the third reading opposition can- be offered. A measure can be debated almost at length on the adoption of the report and at other stages. In future, however, with this proposal in operation, whenever the Government desires that legislation shall find its way promptly on to the statute-book, it will fix a time limit for the discussion of it. I doubt if that will be a good thing. There are numbers of ways, through the press and otherwise, in which strong objection can be taken to any proposed legislation. But it is better to have those objections stated in Parliament. We often find that even Ministerial supporters are opposed to legislation. A proposal of this kind, but in a more aggravated form has been adopted by the Italian Government. Our local Mussolini has not gone as far as his Italian prototype, who has closed Parliament altogether. That very effective way of saving debate allows him to bring his ideas into operation without any delay. We are working towards that objective in Australia, but we have, I hope, a very long way to go before we reach it. The Commonwealth Parliament is founded upon the model of the British Parliament. In . the House of Lords, unlimited time is given to discuss any matter that comes forward. To a very large extent, the same opportunity is afforded in the House of Commons. </para>

              <para>- I am not &#34;stonewalling&#34; the motion. I am giving reasons in a calm and peaceful manner for my opposition to it. I do not forget that, on a previous occasion, when I was endeavouring to re-convert the honorable senator to those principles of land taxation he previously supported, he had the Standing Orders amended; and I do not propose to permit him to have them further amended with a view to curtailing addresses from myself on that or any other subject on which- 1 choose to speak. The Standing Orders, as they stand today, fully meet our requirements. Some honorable senators may speak too long, but only on very rare occasions, and then solely to their own detriment. The Government would be well advised to let well alone. I am opposed to the proposed innovation, and I shall take another opportunity of emphasizing my objection to it if the Standing Orders Committee recommends its adoption. </para>

          <para>In June last a loan bill was passed, in which &#163;2,000,000 was provided for telegraph and telephone construction. The object of that bill was to provide for additional expenditure required last financial year, as well as to make funds available in the early part of the present financial year, so that there might be no break in the continuity of the work pending the passing of additional appropriation. The amount thus available under that act at the 30th June last was &#163;1,850,404. A special act was passed last session ratifying the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States of New SouthWales and Queensland, to convert to a standard gauge the railway between Kyogle and South Brisbane and to re-grade and re-lay the existing railway between Grafton and Kyogle. This act also gave the Treasurer authority to raise and spend, for the purposes of the agreement, the sum of &#163;3,500,000. Of this amount, it is estimated that &#163;1,300,000 will be required during the current financial year. </para>
          <para>The following are the chief items of expenditure provided in the bill: - </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="111332192509042_10_2.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>Authority is sought to borrow &#163;8,300,000 to meet the expenditure detailed in the schedule. It is impossible to state under what terms and conditions the money will be raised, and it is thought wise to provide for a margin of approximately 3 per cent. to cover discounts and  flotation charges, so that the amount remaining will be sufficient to provide for the total contemplated expenditure. </para>
          <para>Steps are being taken in the bill to lapse loan appropriations for works remaining unexpended at 30th June, 1925. Unlike the annual appropriations from revenue, loan appropriations do not expire at the close of the financial year. The result is that there is a large accumulation of live appropriations, many of which cannot now be used. For instance, there is more than &#163;800,000 of the appropriations for post-office buildings remaining unexpended. Owing to the altered method of now providing for these works in a composite vote, it is not convenient or, perhaps, legal, to use these appropriations. Moreover, it is considered that each year&#39;s loan programme should be dealt with as a whole by Parliament in the annual loan bill, and to enable this to be done provision will be made in each year&#39;s loan bill to lapse the unexpended appropriations at the begining of that year. This course is being followed for the first time in the present bill. As previously explained, the balance of the appropriation for telegraph and telephone construction granted by Parliament in June last is, being applied to the expenditure of the current year. The Loan Act (No. 1) of 192.5 is therefore omitted from the schedule of appropriations to be lapsed. </para>

            <para>. - I listened with great interest to the remarks made by the Minister. He practically told the Senate that he was not in a position to indicate the conditions under which the money to be raised under this bill will be borrowed. Before we embark on further loans we should know whether the money is to be borrowed within Australia or overseas, whether in London or in the United States of America. A. few weeks ago we were called- upon to deal with a very urgent measure, to authorize the raising of a loan of &#163;15,000,000 to assist the States. In reply to my question the Minister representing the Treasurer in this chamber indicated that negotiations were in progress, not with financiers in London, but in New York. As we know, portion of that money was raised in New York. This is a proposal to authorize the Government to borrow &#163;8,300,000. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Surely the Minister should be able to state where and under what conditions the money will be borrowed. If I were raising a loan I should certainly require to know what it was likely to cost me. The Government has got into the very bad habit of drawing too heavily upon loan funds. We are simply perpetuating the old practice, &#34;borrow and burst.&#34; I realize that if the natural resources of this country are to he adequately developed we must borrow money, but we should be quite sure that the works upon which it is proposed to expend it will show an adequate return. The National Debt Sinking Fund Commissioners in a return laid on the table of the Senate yesterday state that the national debt existing at the end of the financial year 1923-4 has been reduced by &#163;5,000,000, and that if this rate of reduction is .maintained, the Commonwealth debt will be extinguished in 50 years. Are we .going the right way about this business? By borrowing further money we are adding to our national debt. Ex-Senator Pratten, now Minister for Trade and Customs, made the following statement not very long ago: - </para>

              <para>- I have no doubt that, as he is now a member of the Ministry he would hardly subscribe to views which he expressed as a private member. I know of nothing that has transpired since his .accession to office to justify a change of opinion. He is now approving a policy which, a few months ago, he denounced so vigorously. I contend that as the trustees of the nation we should, endeavour as far as possible to meet our liabilities and provide for our requirements out of revenue. I notice that under this bill it is proposed to borrow money for the purpose of defence, but surely that cannot be described as a reproductive undertaking. Many years ago Parliament passed a Naval Loan Bill to borrow money for the purpose of establishing and maintaining an Australian Navy. This was done when the Deakin Government was in power. Labour members in the Senate and in another place opposed the passage of that measure on the ground that expenditure on defence was not reproductive, and they claimed that the defence of Australia should be provided for out of the revenue of the country. An election was held at which Labour was returned with a majority, and its first act was to repeal that bill and provide for the establishment of the Navy out of revenue. &#34;While there may be some items in the schedule of the present bill on which the expenditure of loan money is justified, it cannot be proved that the money spent on defence in the past has been reproductive. Unless a halt is called, where will our persistent policy of borrowing lead us? It is certainly not assisting in the reduction of the national debt, and I cannot see any marked benefit up to the present time as far as development is concerned. Our burden of debt is heavy already, and instead of increasing it we should try to lighten it. The measure provides for certain urgent works, and members on this side of the chamber do not intend to delay them by opposing the second reading of the bill. I point out, however, that the policy of the Government perpetuates the evil system of borrowing for works that are not reproductive. I desire to emphasize my first point that if the Government regard it as necessary to borrow money for specific works, Parliament should be informed as to the nature of those works, the source from which the money is to be raised and the interest rate that will be charged for it. It is vitally important that all honorable senators should be informed whether the money is to be borrowed within or outside Australia. </para>

            <para>. -  Instead of pursuing the old effete and disastrous method of raising money, I wish to suggest to the Minister, and through him to the officials of the Treasury, that another method of securing the necessary funds to carry on the works referred to in this bill might well be considered. The sum asked for is not very large. It is only about  &#163;8,300,000.  I do not know what the terms of the loan will be, but I presume that we shall have to pay interest at the rate of at least  5  per cent., which, at the end of twelve months, will amount to  &#163;415,000.  That interest will be gone for ever. I know that some of our alleged financial geniuses do not care about departing from what is regarded as the well-beaten and safe track, but I point out that the following of that path has led Australia into borrowing enormous sums of money, on which the public and private interest to-day runs into probably  &#163;50,000,000,  or, in round figures,  &#163;1,000,000  a week. This is a serious drain upon the people of the Commonwealth, and we should do well to consider whether some scheme can be devised to obviate it. Although the Minister may not agree with the suggestion I am about to make, I believe it to be in the best interests of the&#34; Commonwealth. Instead of the Government going to the London or New York money markets, or using the columns of the Australian daily press to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds a year in advertising for money, as was done in connexion with the conversion loan of  &#163;68,000,000,  an effort should be made to find out whether it is possible to adopt a better method than that in operation. </para>

              <para>- That method was strenuously resented when the Labour Government, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> put into operation the idea of printing Australian notes; but, despite that, one can now buy as much for a  &#163;1  note as he can for a -sovereign. The notes are easier to carry than gold, and in many respects they are more convenient. The public is satisfied to take them, and does not know to a few million pounds how many of them are in circulation. Approximately,  &#163;56,000,000  of notes have been printed, and about half that sum is held by the Commonwealth Bank. I suggest to the Minister that he have a consultation with, some of the financial experts at present controlling the Commonwealth Bank as to whether it is not possible to print an additional  &#163;8,300,000  of notes, instead of borrowing this money abroad. I have a recollection that not very long ago a very substantial number of notes were issued by the bank. If the Minister obtained possession of them he could repay to the bank  &#163;415,000  of notes annually, and at the end of  20  years  the loan would be extinguished. But under the played-out system now in vogue the interest will be paid for 20 years, and at the end of that time we shall still owe &#163;8,300,000.. </para>

              <para>- When some persons once commence to follow a certain course, they have the greatest possible reluctance to explore new avenues. Those conducting the affairs of this country, especially our financial advisers, have refused, perhaps more than any other section of the community, to seek fresh sources from which to obtain their financial requirements. Occasionally a ray of light seems to penetrate their intelligence, and they make a slight departure from the established custom, with- very good results. On one occasion, when the States were somewhat pressed financially, the Commonwealth was appealed to, and a sum of, I think, &#163;15,000,000 in notes was made available. The States are today paying interest to the Commonwealth, and so far as I can gather, nothing of a very unusual character has happened. If the Commonwealth had borrowed that &#163;15,000,000 in New York or in London, it would have been faced with an annual bill based on interest at 5 per cent., which would represent a very substantial sum, and the principal would still be owing. Nothing of. the kind has happened. On a more recent occasion, in response to very urgent representations made by those engaged in the pastoral industry, an additional &#163;5,000,000 was made available; when a financial measure was before Parliament. We were then told by certain of our exceptionally wise financiers that an inflation of the currency would mean an increase in prices, and that a number of other disastrous results would follow. Nothing of the kind has happened. During the construction of the TransAustralian railway, approximately &#163;3,000,000 was made available by the Note Issue Department, on which, no interest has ever been or will ever be paid. I have mentioned several fairly substantial sums which in the opinion of our financial experts have been raised in a somewhat irregular manner, but the arrangements have been of distinct advantage to the Commonwealth. I do not pay any attention to the repeated statements that the issue of additional notes means that higher prices are charged, because I do not think those who make such statements know what they are talking about. </para>

              <para>- I do not intend to deal with the position in Russia, and, as a fact, I am not keenly interested in what is taking place in that country. My time is fully occupied in keeping in touch with what is happening in the Commonwealth, although I endeavour to take, an occasional glance at the situation in other countries. In Germany printing presses worked at such a rate that the value of the mark depreciated to an almost negligible point. What I propose is an inflation of the note issue which would be so small that it would be almost imperceptible. </para>

              <para>- A similar statement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook when the Fisher Government issued papermoney against the gold reserve. We have not witnessed any of the disastrous effects predicted by that Government, and I do not think we ever shall. It was held for a long time that it was &#39;injudicious finance to issue paper money beyond the actual value of the gold held in reserve, but later that opinion was set aside, and the issue was increased by 50 per cent. At different periods additional paper money has been issued against the gold reserve, and, speaking from memory, about &#163;56,000,000 worth of notes have now been issued on that basis. It is true that prices have advanced, but I am not prepared to admit that the issue of paper money is responsible. Paper money merely takes the place of gold, and is more convenient to handle. If we were to borrow the amount now proposed from London or New York, we should merely be advised by wireless that the loan had been a huge success - it would be a success to those financial manipulators who usually make tens of thousands out of the transaction. A message would be received that the loan had been sucessfully  floated, and next morning the Government would proceed to issue, not- English or American notes, but notes issued by the Commonwealth Bank. Why cannot we use Australian notes in the first place instead of going through the unnecessary performance of negotiating with London or New York? We are at present converting &#163;68,000,000 of the 4&#189; per cent. loan falling due on 15th December next, and large sums are being expended in endeavouring to induce the people to lock up their money in this loan for a further period. I believe that more than onehalf of the loan has already been converted. Instead of using borrowed money to convert the whole of the bonds, the Commonwealth Bank should print an additional &#163;20,000,000 worth of notes, and invite the bondholders to collect their money. </para>

              <para>- There was no marked increase in prices when &#163;5,000,000 was made available some time ago. In the circumstances I have mentioned, the bank would have more money than it needed, and the rate of interest would be reduced. That would not be an unmixed evil, because money would be available at a cheaper rate. As I have stated, the interest we are now paying on war loan, to the extent to which the bonds were cashed, would cease for ever. We are now paying approximately &#163;20,000,000 a year in interest on war loans. Interest payments very seriously drain the financial resources of Australia. The interest bill of Great Britain amounts to &#163;1,000,000 a day, and that money has to be obtained from the people who do the work of the country, just as the money to pay our interest bill of &#163;1,000,000 a week - taking all our public debts into consideration - has to be obtained from the people who do the work of this country. If that tremendous sum can be reduced, it ought to be reduced. The scheme I have submitted is, in my opinion, practicable. If I had to handle the conversion of the &#163;68,000,000 that will fall due on the 15th December next, I should not feed, feast, and fatten the press of this country like the Commonwealth Bank is doing, in order to induce the people to subscribe to a new loan at, of course, a higher rate of interest. If the interest rate is to increase year by year, the burden of the people will become heavier all the time. </para>

              <para>- In the bad old days, a number of people were given that right, just as they were given the right to manufacture and sell spirits without let or hindrance ; but those days are gone, and I would not favour reverting to that practice. My scheme would be highly beneficial to the community. I am surprised that none of the Napoleons of finance on the other side of the chamber have offered any suggestion as to how our tremendous interest bill may be lightened. The war has been over for a number of years, but its cost appears to me to be mounting up all the time. I do not know whether the Treasury officials have been requested to give special consideration to this problem, with a view to indicating some methods by which it may be overcome; but I am certain that any proposal that will result in reducing the interest bill will be heartily welcomed by our people. I could indicate a source from which money could be obtained to pay the interest bill, but it would probably be out of order for me to introduce that subject. </para>

              <para>- I am satisfied that this subject is far too important to be treated in the usual stereotyped fashion. The members of this chamber are reckoned to be equal in intelligence to any other similar number of men in the Commonwealth, but not one of them has been able to suggest how to reduce our interest bill. I understand that in Germany the internal debt has been wiped out; but I would not advocate the adoption of similar methods here. I do not advocate the Russian methods either. But it seems to me that if the Government can issue &#163;56,000,000 worth of notes against 40,000,000 sovereigns, it could also issue another &#163;8.000,000 worth. </para>

              <para>- Then perhaps I shall be in order in discussing the proposed vote for the Health Department. I invite the attention of the Senate to the alarming increase in the number of cancer cases throughout the Commonwealth. The ravages of this fell disease are so great that the Government would be justified in setting aside a very large sum of money for the purpose of combating it. Public money, in my opinion, could not be devoted to a better purpose. The officers in either the Institute of Science and Industry or the Health Department should be empowered to take some part in the world-wide campaign that is being waged against cancer. Apart altogether from the intense suffering and the heavy mortality that this disease causes, we ought to be doing something to resist its inroads. The small amount that is being provided for the Health Department is totally inadequate. Our people would welcome a substantial increase in it. </para>

I consider also that we should repeal the regulations under which licence fees are charged to those who listen in. No such fee is charged in America, and I do not know of any reason why it should be imposed here. If it were abolished there would be a very much more extensive use of wireless. </para>

          <para>In committee we shall have an opportunity to deal with the items at length, but in the meantime I protest against the proposal to vote any sum of money to meet the costs incurred in assisting immigration. In all the States the Labour party is uniformly in opposition to expenditure in this direction, so long as we have unemployed here, and so long as the States refuse to make land available to those who would work it if they could get it. The proposal now before us to spend money in this direction needs very careful consideration. I have on previous occasions voiced my views upon this question. I am strongly opposed to the proposed expenditure. So far as the balance of the items is concerned I have no objection to expenditure on new buildings. My main objection is not to the manner in which the money is to be expended, but to the obsolete, effete, and out of date methods proposed to be adopted for raising this new loan. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline>B. HAYES (Tasmania) T2.32&#93;. - Clause 5 of the bill proposes to lapse  all unexpended balances of loan moneys up to the 30th June last, with the exception of those provided for in Loan Act (No. 1) of 1925. I realize the desirability both from a political and from a departmental point of view of reappropriating such balances. Schedule 2 of the bill practically repeals fourteen Loan Acts, and the unexpended balances of the amounts authorized by those acts will be re-appropriated for expenditure. Any one who has had any experience of a works department knows that it entails a considerable amount of work to keep an account of each of these small balances. Their re- appropriation will no doubt make the task of the departmental officers a great deal lighter. I hardly think, however, that it will get them where they expect to get, so long as they continue to make the public works year coincide with the financial year. It is only possible to do so on this occasion, because a loan bill was passed in June last. I understood the Minister to say that the Government, intended to make it a practice to lapse every year all unexpended balances. The objection to such a course is that after the 30th June of each year no loan money will be available until a new loan bill is passed, and if Parliament is not meeting in June, the department will be landed in difficulties. It will be unable to carry on works. I never could see why the 1st July to the 30th June should constitute a public works year. I have had a good deal of experience in this direction, and I have always held the view that the public works year should be the calendar year. Under such a system money is voted by Parliament in spring, and the department then has the whole of the following calendar year in which to spend it. It does not matter then whether Parliament is sitting in the middle of the calendar year or not. The department always has sufficient money in hand to carry on. When Parliament meets in the later portion of the year the amount unexpended in one calendar year can always be reappropriated for expenditure in the following calendar year. As a matter of fact, I could never quite see why the financial year should end on the 30th June. We are now compelled to vote money a large proportion of which has already been spent, if the department has not suspended operations and has carried on after the end of June. This does not matter so much in respect of expenditure out of revenue, which is, to a large extent, the same month after month, and is mostly for salaries and office expenses. In the case of public works, where the amounts vary considerably, the difficulty cannot be overcome by asking Parliament to pass supply bills. Consequently, if Parliament does not happen to be sitting in June, as was the case this year, the Works Department is likely to be placed in a difficult position through not being able to get the unexpended balances reappropriated. There should be a standard provision in every loan bill to which every one will become accustomed, providing that the unexpended balances of previously authorized expenditure are  reappropriated  on the 1st January, or any other convenient time in each year. I am quite sure the present system will not work satisfactorily. </para>
          <para>This bill contains something which I have never seen in a previous loan bill. It asks Parliament to vote &#163;4,149,596 for postal works, but it gives no details beyond stating, for instance, that 67 buildings are to be altered and 50 buildings erected in New South &#34;Wales. We have not a scratch of the pen to show what any particular item will cost. This Parliament is supposed to exercise some restraint and control over the expenditure of public money. People can always be found who will declare that money is being wasted on a work that may be under the control of the best architects in the world. Consequently, honorable senators are often called upon to defend Commonwealth works expenditure against criticism which is mostly wrong. But if honorable senators are asked what any work is costing, they cannot supply the information. They ought to be in a position to tell their constituents what money Parliament has been asked to vote for certain works. Yet here we are asked to hand over to the Postmaster-General &#163;4,000,000, to do the best he can with it, and we do not even know how much is to be spent in each State. I have no doubt that the fullest information can be obtained from the Ministers who will be in control of this expenditure, but, in my opinion, it should be given in the bill itself. I notice that the sum of &#163;808 is mentioned as the amount Parliament is authorized to spend on Commonwealth offices, Brisbane, yet there is absolutely nothing to show where or how this amount of over &#163;4,000,000 is to be spent. I have no desire to criticize the measure unduly, and I would not think of holding it up, because I have confidence in the Ministers, but I think that, in future, Parliament ought to know what it is asked to vote on, and, above all, what proportion of the money will be spent in each State. If I think that the proposed expenditure on a certain building is too much, I should have the right to say so. With the detailed figures before&#39; me, J might be able to contend that the amount provided in the bill for a particular work&#34; is not sufficient. I should have the opportunity to find out how much each work is likely to cost. Therefore, &#39; I hope that future loan bills will afford the information, that will enable honorable senators to know what the Government are doing. </para>

I fail to see why the scheme suggested should not be put into practice. I did not notice any increase in the price of commodities when it was put into practice by the Government a little while ago.&#39; No one was the poorer because it was tried. In all probability the Minister will deal with this phase of the. question when he replies. We recognize that, while there may be difficulties in the way, they should not be insuperable. The scheme was tried in the island of Guernsey very many years ago. An important public work was paid for by means of local debentures, which, as they fell due, were redeemed and destroyed. In other words, they were withdrawn from circulation. Why cannot we finance our undertakings on similar lines? The honorable the Minister intimated that he was- not in a position to say whether the money to be raised under this measure would be borrowed in Australia or abroad.

              <para>- No difference in the world, I suppose, but we say that loans should, whenever possible, be floated in Australia. The Government contends that it has paid &#163;5,000,000 off the national debt, but now we have a proposal to borrow &#163;8,000,000, so our finances have actually gone to the bad to the extent of &#163;3,000,000. </para>

              <para>- No; but I contend that much of the expenditure should be met out of revenue, and not paid out of loan. There is no justification for the expenditure, from loan money, of &#163;430,000 for defence. My memory carries me back to the time when the Federal Government of the day wished to pre sent the British Government with a dreadnought as its contribution to the defence of the Empire, and proposed to pay for it out of loan money. Fortunately, a change of Government took place. Labour decided that the best contribution to Empire defence was for Australia  to  build her own battleships and to pay for them out of revenue. </para>

              <para>- But the Labour party forced his hand. If there is one thing more than another that should  be  paid for out of revenue it is expenditure on migration, because migrants immediately contribute to the revenue through Customs duties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> pointed out that at the present rate of redemption the national debt should be extinguished in 50 years.  If  we do not put a stop to thisborrowing policy, we shall never be able to pay  off  the national debt. If the Government is not prepared to cease borrowing abroad it should be honest enough to renounce its claim to be a protectionist government, and confess that it favours the importation of foreign goods to the detriment  of  Australian industries. </para>

            <para>. - I shall be brief in my opposition to this measure, under which loan money will be expended, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> for the purpose of defence. Money required for the defence of Australia should be raised within Australia. If sufficient revenue is not at the disposal  of  the Government for this purpose, the Government should impose additional taxation. We should be patriotic enough to say that the defence of Australia is essentially an Australian financial responsibility. I rose chiefly to object to borrowing overseas, especially in view of the statement made some time ago by the present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten),</inline> that it was sound finance to raise money in Australia, even if  we  had to pay a higher rate of interest,  because  the interest payments would be made to Australians. I endorse that statement. I notice an item of &#163;330,000 for immigration - advances of passage money, landing money and medical fees  of  assisted immigrants. We know that a considerable sum of money has been advanced to assist people  to  come  to  Australia. In some cases the whole  of  the  passage money has been paid by the Government, and in other cases the migrants have been assisted to the extent of portion of the passage money required. It would be interesting and informative to know what amount has actually been advanced, how much is at present outstanding, and whether the Government has had any difficulty in getting refunds. I noticed a statement in an evening newspaper the other day by a gentleman who apparently had overheard a conversation between two immigrants. The tenor of the conversation led him to believe that, although these migrants were expected to refund the amount of the passage money that had been advanced to them, they did not intend to do so. Have the Government had any point- blank refusals in regard to claims for the refund of passage money ? W&#62; are told that most of those who have been assisted have already returned the money advanced to them. Some of them are said to be engaged on the land, and others, we are told, are in various occupations. If they are in employment they are bound by the conditions under which they came to Australia, and should refund the money within a reasonable period. I hope that the Minister will give the Senate any information^ he may have at hia disposal regarding this point. It is not business-like to go on indefinitely advancing passage money, if it is not to be refunded. I wish to know whether the Government or the officials have had any point-blank refusals on the part of new arrivals to pay back the money so advanced to them. </para>

            <para>. - I am unable to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> where it is proposed to raise the loan that the bill authorizes. It will depend altogether on the condition of the money market in Australia and abroad. I point out, however, that the Commonwealth is now floating a conversion  loan of &#163;68,000,000 for the redemption of existing war loans. It would probably be difficult, therefore, to borrow in Australia at the present time any sum in addition to that required for the conversion loan. During the past two years the Commonwealth debt has been reduced by payments of over &#163;14,000,000 in the shape of contributions in various ways to the ginkin? fund. Of course, the whole of our debt reduction has not been effected through what is known as the sinking fund, for we are paying a considerable sum every year direct to Great Britain in connexion with our war liability. It is necessary to raise money from year to year for the purpose of carrying out permanent, and in many instances, reproductive works. This year it is proposed to expend no less than &#163;6,000,000 on postal works, chiefly in the erection of telephone exchanges, and in the provision of telephonic facilities generally. This money is not to be expended as a mere speculation, but is required in response to the applications for telephones by citizens throughout the Commonwealth.- I am sure that policy is approved by honorable senators on both sides of the chamber. The applications now average over 5,000 a month, and if they are not granted there will be great complaint from every member of the Parliament. </para>

              <para>- No, because the contributions to the sinking fund are not all on the 50 years&#39; basis. In many instances they are determined according to the life of the asset for which the money has been borrowed. While money is being raised from year to year, there* ca.n.not be a very large annual reduction in the aggregate indebtedness. Nevertheless, if payments to the sinking fund are continued on the present basis, all debts will be extinguished within 50 years from the time when the money was borrowed. It is not my intention to dwell at any length on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> Grant&#39;s suggestion for obtaining this money without appealing to the public. We know that there is a limit to the amount of notes that can be issued. It depends upon the requirements of the public, and we cannot force on the people notes which they are not prepared to accept, and which the business of the country does not warrant. It may be contended also with regard to the raising of loans locally, that consideration has to be given to the amount of money required to carry on private business upon, which employment and the prosperity of the Commonwealth chiefly depend. Even if we should have to borrow in America, it does not necessarily follow that we shall hare to take goods to the value  of  the money borrowed. The money could easily be transferred to some other country from which we might be purchasing goods. When one of the States borrowed money in New York some years ago, it was immediately transferred to London ; and I understand that  Borne  profit was wade on the transaction. On the question of preference to Australian lenders, I point out that this Government has adopted that attitude. The money recently borrowed in England and the United States of America was obtained at 5 per cent., while that for which we are now asking in the Commonwealth carries interest at per cent. The information sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> as to the sums refunded by immigrants with respect to advances of passage money is not available for the moment; but I understand that, in committee, the Minister for Markets and Migration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wilson)</inline> will be in a position to supply it. </para>

I do not expect the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> to state the situation of such depots, but desire some information as to the progress of the work. There is another item, &#34;Naval bases, works, and establishments, &#163;137,410;&#34; and perhaps the Minister can state if any provision has been made for the re-establishment of the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound, seeing that experts have favorably reported on the site. There is also an item &#34;Towards cost of construction of buildings, hangars, workshops, barracks and earthworks, and preparation of aerial routes and landing grounds, &#163;126,000.&#34; As the aerial arm of defence is most important, we should have information as to what is being done before authorizing the expenditure of the amount proposed. Provision is also made for the expenditure of &#163;40,000 towards the high explosives factory at Maribyrnong. When the Public Accounts Committee inquired into the question of munitions supply it appeared that the Government was making an earnest effort to make Australia self-contained in the matter of defence, and it would be interesting to know how far the work at Maribyrnong Iws proceeded. Expenditure of &#163;10,000 is also proposed in connexion with the Lithgow Machine-gui Factory. Will the Minister state how that work is proceeding? </para>

            <para>.- In this schedule provision has been made for the expenditure of &#163;500,000 for advances to the States and to the settlors in the Northern Territory for the purchase of wire netting. The question of wire netting supplies was before Parliament some tune ago, and a bill under which financial assistance was given to the States requiring supplies of wire, netting was passed by both Houses of Parliament. I should like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Crawford)</inline> to say what States have applied for assistance, and also the amounts it is proposed to allocate to each State find the Northern Territory. I should also like to know how much has been advanced to the States up to date, apart from the amount proposed to be voted under this bill. Progress reported. </para>
