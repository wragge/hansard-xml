                        <para>- The appraisement of wool at Albany has been under consideration since the formation of the present Government, and I endeavoured at the earliest possible opportunity to give effect to a part of the decision reached by the previous Government. If the appraisement of wool is not taking place at Albany at present, it is due to the awkward situation brought about by the unpreparedness of the wool brokers in Western Australia to appraise wool at that centre; but I understand that even that difficulty has now been overcome. </para>

Due to the effect of war-time conditions on deliveries and the need for giving priority to important defence communication requirements, some little time will elapse before all the materials required for this large project can be secured. Work has, however, already commenced on certain sections, and it is hoped to undertake the main portion during the early part of 1942. The importance of augmenting the existing facilities between Perth and Adelaide is fully recognized, and the honorable senator may rest assured that the work will be completed at the earliest possible date. </para>

                        <para>Consideration has been given to the construction of the rail link between Alice Springs and Birdum. The suggested link would involve approximately 620 miles of new construction. The cost of such construction would amount to between £5,000,000 and £5,500,000, necessitating supply of upwards of 05,000 tons of steel rails, fishbolts, and in addition to approximately 1,500,000 wooden sleepers, or, if steel sleepers were used, approximately 50,000 tons of steel. The estimated time of construction is three years. In addition to the heavy capital expenditure, the work would require a considerable time to complete (apart from the difficulty in obtaining supply of necessary steel and sleepers), and consequently its value as a defence proposal to meet a national emergency that might arise in the near future, has insufficient merit in relation to other necessary projects. With the recent completion of the construction of the road between Alice Springs and Birdum, the capacity for movement over this section is equal to the maximum capacity of each of the railway sections at each end of the road, i.e., Quorn-Alice Springs railway and Birdum-Darwin railway. </para>

                            <para>. - Having had experience in various Government departments during this war, I appreciate the difficult task confronting the members of the Ministry in wartime. I am conscious of our obligations to the people of Australia. Whilst we, on this side of the chamber, have no caucus, I can assure the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> and his colleagues that we shall support all measures introduced by the Government to enable Australia to make a complete all-in war effort. I assure my friends who now hold important offices in the Ministry that the war has reached a most serious stage and that the problems that lie ahead are difficult. I sincerely trust that the Government will not shirk its responsibilities and that it will not fail to do everything possible to see that we give of our best to further the cause of the Empire. The members of the Opposition consider it to be their right and privilege to offer criticism, and very candid criticism where they think it to be necessary and where they feel that the Government has fallen down on its job. Since I was relieved of ministerial office five weeks ago I have taken the opportunity to look back and to take stock of what has been said and what has been done by honorable senators opposite. Probably, we best anticipate the actions of Governments by studying what has been said by their supporters in the past. Judging by the speeches of honorable senators opposite as recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> three charges can be laid at the door of the Government so far as its attitude towards the war is concerned, that i3, if honorable senators opposite propose to follow in the future the policies they have outlined since the outbreak of war. Perhaps I should say that these three charges can be levelled against prominent leaders of the present Government. The first is that some of the Labour party's leaders have a poor appreciation of what constitutes Australia's front line in this conflict. I do not propose to go into detail on that point; but I urge the Leader of the Senate to give to this chamber, before Parliament goes into recess, the assurance that every effort will be made by the Government to ensure that not only adequate reinforcements for the support of our divisions now in the field are made available, but also sufficient supplies of munitions, are provided. The second charge I make against members of the Labour party is in respect of their refusal of repeated invitations by the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> to join with them in the formation of a national government. Having regard to the present serious situation, the people as a whole look upon the continuance of party political warfare in Canberra as a sordid business. The right honorable member for Kooyong made repeated offers to the Labour party to assist in the formation of a national government; but in their desire to get control at all costs they have been successful, with the support of what we might describe as one or two political misfits, in securing a majority in the House of Representatives. The third charge I make against the Government is that, after having assumed office, and having been given an opportunity to formulate a policy to meet our present difficulties, it has merely brought down a budget which was truthfully described by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives as one that might win an election but not a budget designed to give Australia a 100 per cent, war effort. </para>

                            <para>- I think that we know the reason. Any one who has studied the performances of the Labour party must regretfully acknowledge that even in war-time the Labour Cabinet is ruled by the caucus, which in its turn is ruled by outside organizations. We know that when the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> as Leader of the Opposition, was invited to assist in the formation of a national government he was una'ble to come to a decision until he had consulted the Australian Labour party. Sufficient evidence is available to show that even at the party's caucus meeting, held at Canberra recently to consider a proposal to increase the rate of the invalid and old age pensions, the caucus tail wagged the party dog so successfully that the Government is now committed to honour in the first session in the New Year its election promise to increase the rate of pension to 25s. a week plus the cost of living allowance. When one studies the policy speech delivered by the Prime Minister in August, 1940, one can easily appreciate the difficult position in which members of the Government now find themselves as the result of making all sorts of airy promises prior to the last general elections. They gave those promises, as it were, in the form of blank cheques, and now they find that those cheques must be filled in and either honoured or repudiated. </para>

                    <para>During the last twelve months the Menzies Government decided to increase the rate of the soldiers' pay by adding an allowance of 7s. a week, and, in addition, child endowment was introduced. That allowance was to be paid to a wife with a family as a house allowance. The former Government also made an additional allowance of 6d. a day to the wife of a soldier without children. It proposed to pay a further amount of 7s. a week by way of deferred pay. This Government has decided to make that allowance available in the form of active pay. </para>

                            <para>- When the Prime Minister spoke recently over the air and asked people to contribute to the War loan he made many promises; and I am sure that he will honour them. We may differ in our opinions as to whether that allowance should be treated as deferred pay or as active pay. I am satisfied that the majority of the soldiers affected would prefer that the additional payment be treated as deferred pay, making a total deferred payment of 21s. a week. </para>

                            <para>- I do think that they are worth it. I have quoted these figures merely to support and justify the Fadden Government's decision that the £1 ls. should be given in the form of deferred pay. At the last general elections, the Labour party promised to increase invalid and old-age pensions to 25s. a week. Members of the now defunct non-Communist Labour party, including the two " A's " opposite, outbid their colleagues and promised 30s. a week. In view of our heavy existing commitments and even heavier future commitments in connexion with this war, this is no time to increase social services. During the five-year period from 1936 to 1941, the cost of invalid and old-age pensions increased from £12,797,726 to £17,366,335 a year1 - a difference of more than £4,500,000, and commitments in this budget will bring these payments up to the staggering total of £20,000,000 a year, which means that the increase during the past six years has been more than £7,000,000. We are informed that in a supplementary budget the Government will increase invalid and old-age pensions to 25s. a week, but I shall not say any more about that until the supplementary budget is introduced. Having regard to the cost of living allowance, and the increase of prices due to inflationary tendencies and other factors, we can appreciate what the figure will be when the war is over. The number of invalid and old-age pensioners has steadily increased from 287,235 in 1936 to 335,681 in 1941- a difference of 48,446. In view of this ever-increasing burden, the Menzies Government in its national insurance scheme provided for the payment of pensions on a contributory basis. I urge the present Government to give serious consideration to the introduction, at the earliest possible date, of a similar scheme. </para>

Imports had been cut very seriously, but the people wore not suffering unduly. </para>

This budget imposes a most vicious tax on a few people in Australia who are earning large incomes. </para>

                    <para class="block">I repeat that these vicious attacks at this stage on a comparatively few people in Australia will inflict great hardship. These persons have made commitments and have contributed to Commonwealth loans, and they are again asked to contribute to loans. It is estimated by Treasury officials that of a total of 3,000,000 persons in Australia in 1940-41 who were in receipt of incomes, only 13,600 received incomes over £2,000 a year. Throughout Australia, only 2,100 persons received incomes over £5,000 a year during 1940-41. A taxpayer without dependants with an actual taxable income of £250 a year pays in income tax only half of the amount extracted from his counterpart in Great Britain and pays only three-quarters of the rate applicable in New Zealand. On an actual taxable income of £400, Australia asks for £60, whereas New Zealand says"£70 please" and England gets £111. On incomes of £1,000, Australians pay £244, incomparison with £381 by the English taxpayer, or two-thirds. An example of the severity of the Labour Government's proposals in connexion with the higher grades of income, as compared with the United Kingdom and New Zealand, rates, is clearly shown in the table, where it will be seen that, in the lower grades, Australia receives considerably less, whilst, in the higher grades, it receives more than the comparable grades in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. </para>
                    <para>It is desirable to give consideration to the estimate of. the Treasury officials of the actual income in Australia for 1940-4.1 to which the proposed taxation measures will apply. The estimated distribution of individual incomes for 1940-41 includes incomes of males, juveniles and members of the forces, but excludes pensions. It is estimated that 2,709,000 persons in Australia, or 90 per cent, of the population, who receive incomes of £400 per annum or under received for the period under review £560,000,000, or 70 per cent, of the national income of £800,000,000. It is estimated that, the persons in receipt of £401 and under £1,000 per annum number 245,000. Their income is estimated at £145,000,000. The number of persons receiving incomes of £1,001 per annum and over is estimated at 46,000, and their estimated income is £95,000,000. Therefore, I say to my Labour friends that if the complete incomes of all of the people in receipt of over £1,000 a year were taken in taxes, the Government would not get sufficient money to balance the budget. The Government has taxed with the utmostseverity, up to 18s. in the £1, a small section of the people, and. has left untouched those in receipt of 70 per cent, of the national income. I suggest that the Government should have adopted the excellent features of the Fadden budget, which provided for the extraction on a sliding scale, from all sections of the community by way of post-war credits, of £25,000,000. </para>

The proposed collection in the nature of postwatered it was one of the best features of the Fadden budget, and before the present Government is much older it will be forced to realize that, fact. "Wages were never higher in Australia than they are to-day, and employment, figures were never more favorable. The wage-earners are enjoying better conditions now than they were before the war. I suggest that the proposal to extract, money by way of post-war credits would have been of great help to the budget and would have had a steadying influence on inflationary tendencies. Post-war credits would have been helpful to any government which had to face the grave problems that will confront Australia. </para>

Those receiving £401 per annum and under £1,000 per annum, whose income is estimated at £145,000,000, will contribute £9,500,000. Those receiving £1,001 per annum and under £1,500 per annum, whose income is estimated at £28,000,000, will contribute £4,750,000, whereas the small section receiving over £1,500 per annum, with an income of £67,000,000, will contribute no less than £25,750,000. Those figures relate to Commonwealth taxes alone.

For some unknown reason, there appears to be a desire, because a few companies make large profits, to bring companies generally to a condition in which they will be unable to make progress and in which great, injustice will be done to many shareholders. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but we should call upon all sections of the community to help in winning it. I am amazed at the unfair criticism directed against the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, particularly in view of the good work that that company has done and is still doing for Australia. A prominent member of the present Government, who represents Queensland, suggested that that company should be taken over and controlled by the Labour Government. Any honorable senator from Queensland should bear in mind the hopeless mess which the Labour party in that State made of its attempts to run State cattle stations and meat and fish shops. I am pleased to know that up to date the Government has not gone any farther with the suggestion. I desire to correct the impres- sion in the minds of some Labour men that in companies like the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited a few persons own all of the shares. I remind honorable senators that there are 20,000 shareholders in the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, and that the average holding of the10,850 shareholders in the Electrolytic Zinc Corporation Limited is under 246 shares. Out of 70,000 shareholders in the Australian trading banks, 52,000, or 74 per cent., own shares not exceeding £500 in value. [ assure my Labour friends that they are inflicting a great hardship on a number of shareholders who are possessed of very  modest means. I am at a loss to understand the objection raised to companies in Australia. When the history of this war is written, one of the brightest pages in  the story of Australia's development will be that relating to the expansion of its secondary industries. They were a godsend to Australia when our primary industries were in difficulties because of loss of markets. Who are the people that control these companies? Ninety per cent, of them are men of initiative and enterprise who have risen from the ranks of the employees. This young country needs such men. </para>

                    <para>The excessive taxation of companies which the Government proposes will do a grave injustice to some sections of the community. The Government's proposals are inequitable, when we compare the rates imposed on companies with the rates levied on other sections of the community, particularly as a number of small shareholders who look to dividends from companies as a means of livelihood will be affected.I shall not go into details, but I point out that the Federal tax on companies has been increased from 2s. to 3s. in the £1, that the State tax on companies in South Australia is 2s. in the £1 and varying amounts in the other States, and that undistributed profits are also raxed. Indeed, the tax that is paid is taxed again in the hands of the people who receive the dividends. If the Government will consider the cumulative effect of these several taxes it will find that they will inflict a serious hardship on numbers of small companies in Australia which find it essential to set aside a certain amount each year as reserves. In its desire to hit some of the big companies, the Government is doing a great injustice to a number of small companies and their shareholders. I shall deal later with the Government's proposal in respect of the reduction from8 per cent, to 4 per cent, of the allowable profits made under the War-time Company Tax. A comparison of prices charged by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited for certain main products with the prices charged in the United Kingdom is interesting.

If we consider the cumulative effect of all of these taxes, as well as the inflationary tendency of the budget, we can come ito no other conelusion than that the proposals of the Government will inflict a further burden on those engaged in rural industries who have not the opportunity to pass on increased costs. Many primary producers who are normally engaged in the export trade are in a most serious financial position because of shipping difficulties. The wheat farmer, for instance, has not only to pay for storing his wheat which cannot be shipped,, but he has also to bear any losses which may be due to weevils. The primary producers of this country will find small comfort in those five lines in the budget. </para>

I do not desire, nor have I the time, to discuss that aspect of the budget now,  but  I remind the Senate of what has happened in the past. The gap between the expected revenue and the contemplated expenditure is £137,000,000. The Government has till the end of June next to bridge the gap. It may do so by borrowing from the people, by imposing heavier taxation on .them, or by embarking on a policy of bank credit.

                            <para>- Australians war expenditure for 1940-41 was £170,000,000; the estimate for the present financial year is £221,000,000. If we are to do our utmost in this titanic struggle the Government will find a heavy financial task confronting it for the year 1942-43. The amount borrowed for all public purposes for 1940-41 was £86,000,000. This year, the amount required is estimated at £158,000,000, or £72,000,000 more than in the previous financial year. If the Government intends to rely on bank credit to bridge the gap, I foresee difficult days ahead. </para>

Undoubtedly it is a difficult problem. The Treasurer says that the Government will make provision for an equitable distribution of nonessential goods, and that ".there must be a switch-over of a very large amount of production from civil needs to war's demands ". The Government has been in office for five weeks, hut I ,see no evidence of that as yet I listened to the Prime Minister appeal for contributions to the war loan during the week that the Melbourne Cup was run. Honorable senators know that a huge sum of money passed through the totalizator in connexion with the Melbourne Cup and the racing carnival generally, and I suggest that if the Government desires to divert expenditure from non-essential needs to war needs it could not do better than follow the lead given by its predecessors, and establish a scheme of postwar credits. Having regard to our commitments and the possibilities in the future, I suggest that the Government should reconsider that matter. </para>
                    <para>All honorable senators are concerned with the difficulties that lie ahead. The Opposition is concerned and will be behind the Government in all matters directed towards an all-in war effort. After all, that is the only thing that really matters. As to other matters concerning which we may be forced to disagree with the Government, the Opposition will criticize the Government's proposals where it thinks that criticism is justified in the interests of the people of Australia who have sent us here. I say, finally, that at the last general elections sixteen members now sitting in Opposition were elected by five States, not because of any airy promises that they made, but because they told the electors that their chief concern was the maximum war effort. Our leader said then that he would not make any promises, but that, if returned, his Government would do its best to win the war and to make the land we love a place fit to live in. </para>

                            <para>.- The budget of the present Government is a document which we might have expected from the gentlemen comprising the present Ministry. Honorable senators opposite have shown, over the whole period of the war, that they are entirely partisan. Although overtures were made to them on a number of occasions to join with us in conducting the affairs of this country in such a way as to enable us to put forward a maximum war effort, all our advances were determinedly and consistently refused. Consequently, having regard to the election policy speech delivered by the then Leader of the Opposition, we must have expected that the party which now occupies the treasury bench would bring down a budget similar to that which we are considering this afternoon. The first criticism I level at. the budget is that it does not begin to measure up to the problems of the war, and for that reason I believe it was deliberately designed to mislead the people of this country. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>It is worth while to look back over the war period and to consider the varying attitude of our people towards the war. When Great Britain declared war against Germany, Australia immediately joined with the Mother Country in its declaration. I am satisfied that a. majority of the people of Australia were completely behind that action. They were willing and anxious to give of their best to bring the conflict to a satisfactory conclusion. The course of this war has been entirely different from that of the war of 1914-18, because, so far as Great Britain and the Empire were concerned, there was a lull of many months before actual hostilities commenced on a large scale. I know that it is extremely difficult for people living in this fair land, which has never had an armed conflict within its shores, to realize all the dreadful implications of war. Consequently, although the Government of the day appreciated the problems that confronted us, it was difficult to maintain an intensity of enthusiasm among the people as the stalemate on the western front continued. With the advance of the German hordes in the Low Countries and the overrunning of France, the position was revealed more clearly to our people, and again there was the urge to do their utmost on behalf of the war effort. Then, while the British forces were putting up a magnificent resistance to German aggression, and the authorities in the Mother Country were feverishly preparing to resist an invasion, the dangers that confronted us were made much more apparent. When the danger of invasion of the Mother Country appeared to have passed, there was another lull in the affairs of the war. Later, we had the magnificent victory in Libya, followed only too soon by the tragic defeats in Greece and Crete, which again stirred our people to a realization of the menace that confronted them. </para>
                        <para class="block">Later still, with the invasion of Russia by Germany, the nations of the world were thrilled by the great resistance put up by our ally against the advance of the German hordes. With the passing of time, however, a feeling is again growing up in this country that somebody else will win the war for us. I am comforted by the fact that a very large number of people in Australia really appreciate the position, and are actually giving of their best to further the success of our arms. I had the privilege and honour of being ministerial head of the Department of Munitions for a short period and I have had an opportunity to learn something of the work of the thousands of men and women in that department. They are doing a magnificent job. The war is very close to them; they know what it means, and they are doing their best to turn out an increasing volume of the munitions of war and equipment that are so badly needed by our forces. On the other hand, we cannot disguise the fact that very many people in this country seem to be still unaware of the serious position in which we find ourselves to-day. The comment made recently by the General Officer Commanding the Australian Imperial Forces in the Middle East, General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Blarney, that some people in Australia seem to be living in a carnival atmosphere, is only too true. If we need support for that statement we have only to consider what is happening in almost every part of Australia to-day. On every hand we sec an enormous wastage of time, money and energy on sport. Whilst sport is admirable in times of peace - indeed, it is due very largely to the love of our people for sport that our national characteristics have been developed - in time of war undue regard for sport is completely out of place. It is well that our people should realize that, whilst other nations are prepared to help us in this war - I have already mentioned that Russia is giving of its best to the cause ; the United States of America is also helping us to an increasing degree as the weeks go by - the cold fact is that no other nation will pull the chestnuts out of the fire for Australia and the Empire. It is our duty to-day to do our best; not only a conditional best, not only a best which connotes the maintenance of the high standards that have prevailed in Australia for many years, and to which unfortunately the members of the present Government and their supporters have given lip service but also willingness to equal what is being done by the Mother Country. Before we can approach the effort being made by Great Britain, we shall have to go without many of the things that we now enjoy. It is in this respect that I say that this budget has a misleading or doping effect on the people of Australia. It suggests to them that, whilst a small section of the community will be asked to make sacrifices, the majority of the people will not be any worse off than they are to-day. In offering this criticism of the budget, I have no desire to be unfair. I realize that the Prime Minister, speaking in the House of Representatives, has threatened that although the Government is imposing heavy sacrifices on certain sections of the community, other sections may be called to bear more of the burden. The whole point of that, however, is that whereas the budget and its implications have been made known to the people of Australia, the Prime Minister's statement, to which I have referred, is probably unknown to most of them. It seems to me that the Government has viciously attacked a small section of the people, the voting strength of which is not great, and which the Government considers it to be impossible to win away from its present political affiliations. </para>

                                <para>- I submit that it is fair criticism. I point out to the Government that the burdens cannot be borne, willy nilly, by any one section of the people of Australia, and that before this war is over, we shall all be bearing burdens and making sacrifices which at present are unknown in this country. On the question of war finance and the savage imposition of taxes on higher incomes, it is perhaps worth reading the following extract from an article written by ProfessorIles on the subject: - </para>

                    <para>For it would be possible (if it were not for the effects on production) to finance the war in such a way that the poor would not be called upon to contribute, directly to the Government, anything at all in the form of taxes or loans - as they need not if resort were had on a large scale to bank credit. This would mean that the poor could escape making payments in money to the Government. But it would not mean that they could escape the burden. Indeed, they would bear a larger part of the burden under this method of finance than they would bear under the method of direct taxation. Inflationhas the effect of skimming off part of the real incomes of wage and salary earners and of handing it over to the rich (the profit earners) so that they would in effect have the wherewithal to pay additional sums to the Government in taxation and voluntary loans. It is thus a simple matter to ensure that the rich shall have the means to " pay for the war ", by impoverishing the poor in order that they may. In advocating finance by bank credit, the Labour party would be well advised to take heed of this distinction between paying the money and bearing the burden, and in doing so to remember that inflation is incredibly efficient in producing inequality. </para>

                <para>The Government's effort is doomed to failure. Indeed, it will very seriously retard our war effort in many ways. The people as a whole are quite prepared to bear their fair share of the burden of the war. The rate of tax which the Government proposes to impose on higher incomes would bring forth no objection from me at all if increased taxes were to be spread equitably over all sections of income earners. However, the Government in its taxation proposals, as my leader has already said and demonstrated with figures, is completely out of step with the governments of other countries within the Empire. He mentioned New Zealand, which has had a Labour Government since the outbreak of war. At the beginning of last year I had the pleasure of meeting most of the members of that Government. It has no illusion as to the spreading of the burden over all sections of its people. Indeed, it has shown in no uncertain manner that it believes that the people of New Zealand, as I believe of the people of Australia, are prepared to do their utmost in the prosecution of the war. It has imposed a special war tax on all sections of its people, and I give credit to it for the general war effort it is making. It must be evident to this Government that its proposed taxes on higher incomes will simply dry up the source from which it must hope to draw further taxes in the future. We must realize that no one section of the community has a monopoly of patriotism. We cannot expect those on the higher levels of income to have more patriotism than those on the lower levels. The proposed intensive scale of taxation on the higher incomes will eliminate a very large number of those incomes from the field of taxation altogether, and, consequently, they will not be available in the futureto be taxed by this or any other Government. One of the most serious effects which the Government's proposed taxes will have on these people is that it will make them feel that an injustice has been done to them.. </para>

                        <para>- I might have expected that interjection from the honorable senator. On many occasions in this chamber honorable senators opposite, particularly the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> have uttered the canard that it is not the amount of tax that matters, but the amount that is left to the taxpayer after he has paid tax. That is a deliberate half-truth, because the amount that is left to the taxpayer after he has paid tax must be related to the individual taxpayer's commitments. It is simply fatuous to suggest that a man who is accustomed to an income of, say, £5,000 a year, to take a figure at random, has not to meet commitments far in excess of those which, say, a man who normally earns £1,000 a year has to meet. </para>

                <para>I shall now comment briefly upon the effect of the Government's company taxation proposals. We have heard <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline> from honorable senators opposite criticism of the big companies, the so-called greedy profit-makers, the great monopolies of this country. Most honorable senators opposite know the position of those companies just as well as I do. Their statements on this point are deliberately designed to mislead certain people. They know perfectly well that the bigcompanies have enabled us to achieve our present scale of production of munitions and equipment. </para>

                        <para>- Workers are employed by small as well as big companies. Unless the worker has the requisite wherewithal and direction he is incapable by his own efforts of producing the things we require; and, unfortunately, the commodities that we require in war-time are entirely dissimilar to those which we require in times of peace. Engineering capacity which is admirably suited to civil production is in many cases entirely unsuitable for the manufacture of munitions. Thus, we have had to look mainly to the large organizations to assist us in our munitions output. </para>

                        <para>- I have already paid a tribute to the workers. I said that the munitions workers particularly have an appreciation of the seriousness of our present position. I pay tribute to them, because I have some idea of what many thousands of them are doing. However, the fact remains that unless we could have got the assistance of the large organizations and, indeed, many small undertakings -I do not exclude the small concerns - we should not have achieved our output of war production. What we need in this war are munitions and more munitions in the shortest possible time, and it is to the large companies that we must look for those supplies. It is perfectly obvious that, confronted with severe and savage taxation, these organizations, in spite of their desire to do their utmost, will not be able to contribute as much to our war effort as they have done in the past. I have a knowledge of many of these organizations. They have expended large sums on equipment in order to provide our requirements of munitions, although they realize that they will not be able to recoup themselves of that expenditure when the war is over. That expenditure will be a total loss to them. Many of those organizations are following that policy, but the Government's taxation proposals will considerably reduce their capacity for this work. It seems strange that honorable senators opposite should suggest that these big organizations are most concerned about placing themselves in a f avorable position in order to be able to take the greatest advantage of the postwar period, and at the same time urge that we should develop the smaller companies and organizations. Surely they realize that whilst the Governments taxation proposals will effect the bigger companies which I have cited the new taxes will also make it impossible for the smaller companies to progress. In that way, the Government will reduce to a considerable degree the ability of the smaller companies to help in our war effort. Yet those smaller organizations have already done magnificent work. The effects of this kind of company taxation will be bad on the bigwellestablished companies which have huge reserves, but they will be worse on small companies, many of which have just altered their production methods to meet our requirements. It will be impossible for these small concerns to continue to expand in anything like the way they would have done had taxation been kept at a reasonable level. The Government would be well-advised to disabuse its mind of these false impressions. I am confident that honorable senators opposite will appreciate the position much more clearly now that they have had an opportunity to see what is being done. </para>

                <para>I wish to make a brief reference to another of the real dangers of this budget. It is extraordinary to me that the present Government, willy-nilly, has thrown overboard the previous Government's proposals in regard to compulsory loans. I had an opportunity to listen to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> in the House of Representatives when he said that compulsory loans did not build up the post-war credits but post-war debits, but obviously future debts are increased whether loans are compulsory or voluntary. Compulsory loans have many merits and advantages, and I have not yet heard from a Government supporter, either in this chamber or in the House of Representatives, a reasoned statement of valid objections to that system. Supporters of the Labour party when in opposition, said that they were against compulsory loans, but even at that time they did not say why. Now that they have taken over the reins of government, they are attempting to be consistent, but in doing so they are intensifying their war financial problems. </para>

                        <para>- If people of this country had to subscribe to compulsory loans the same amount of money as the people of New Zealand have to pay in taxes, the return would be very much more than was estimated in the Fadden budget, which was opposed by the Labour party. The Labour party in this conn- try considers itself to be an advanced Labour party. Like the soldier who thought that everybody else was out of step with him, it believes that it is the one Labour party in the British Empire which is in step, but I do not believe it, and before long honorable senators will find out that it is not others who are out of step. The refusal to introduce a compulsory saving scheme has rendered necessary the raising of extra loans amounting to approximately £20,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- The cold fact is that under theFadden. budget we had to raise by way of loans, in Australia this year, five months of which have already passed, approximately £142,000,000, including £20,000,000 for the States. Incidentally I have not heard very much from a certain Labour Premier who, when the previous Government was in office, was consistently haranguing and criticizing it for the paucity of its loan allocations to the States. I see nothing in this budget which suggests that the Labour Government will be any more liberal to the States in the way of loan allocations than was the previous Government. </para>

By the time a supplementary budget is presented, honorable senators opposite will have obtained a good deal of information which will assist them infuture considerations. Whereas theFadden budget provided for the raising of £142,000,000 in loans, the present budget provides for the raising of £158,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- The Government is more likely to fall. It is advisable that the people should know just what the position was when this Government took over the treasury bench. The Menzies Government conducted the affairs of Australia during two years of war, and in all that period, according to the latest figures available, the average increase of prices has been under 10 per cent. I mention that because it is one of the very important factors upon which the Government will be judged. It is fatuous for the Government to talk of an all-in war effort if, at the same time, it encourages rising costs and prices. Consequently, I say deliberately that this is the main factor on which the Government will be judged, and on which the success of its war effort will depend. It is hopeless to endeavour to engage in a maximum war effort if there is to be a rising pile of costs, wages and prices. The omens for the future are already not good. If reports which have appeared in the newspapers he correct - I agree that newspaper reports are not always accurate - adverse effects will soon be felt. By various -means the previous Government held costs and prices down in a way which has not been excelled in any other country engaged in this war. They have been controlled not by flatly tightening down on prices and wages, as is done in Nazi Germany, but by endeavouring first of all to control prices on a reasonable basis. Incidentally I pay a tribute to the Prices Commissioner for his valuable work,  which  I consider has been exceptionally successful. Secondly, prices and costs have been kept at reasonable levels by allowing arbitration machinery to decide industrial matters. It is reported - I speak only from knowledge gained through that report - that that system has been departed from already. We have been told that, the Government has agreed to a mutual arrangement between certain workers and employers on the question of wages, without regard for the effect that such an arrangement might have upon other classes of workers, and indeed upon the entire arbitration system. I refer to the reported agreement between the brick, tile and pottery interests and their employees. If this be the system  under  which this Government proposes to settle industrial disputes, costs will rapidly increase. Not only will there be a rise in costs, but also the effect will filter right through the whole structure of our war effort, and its cost will increase materially. The result will be the same as the effect of inflation" in any other country, namely, that the conditions of those people whom such action is designed to assist will become worse. </para>

                <para>I have no objection to increasing the rates of pensions, but I believe that the real rate of pension is its purchasing power. I recall that a previous labour Prime Minister who had avowed that he would not reduce pensions, eventually was forced to admit that it was better to reduce pensions and maintain their purchasing power than to retain the then existing rates. I draw the Government's attention to the fact that, if it travels down the easy way, not only the pensioners, but the workers generally, will be worse off than they have been, and the hardship will be felt particularly by those sections of the community whose support this Government has made violent efforts to obtain. I refer to those persons in receipt of fixed salaries. It is assumed that, owing to cost of living adjustments, persons employed under awards of the Arbitration Court can withstand the effects of inflation. Certainly they can in the early stages, but the large section with fixed incomes has not the advantage of automatic salary adjustments to compensate for increases of the cost of living, and it will suffer first from the results which I fear from the present budget. </para>

                <para>Iia ve been by reason of the fact that the financial affairs of this country during the first two years of the war were conducted with great skill. That enabled us to put forward a tremendous war effort and preserve on a perfectly sound foundation the whole financial structure of this country. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Menzies Government for its financial policy during those two years. It has to its credit an achievement that is little short of remarkable. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that interest rates have fallen is due in no small measure to the wise policy adopted by the Menzies Government. I add the fact referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> that, since the outbreak of war, commodity prices in this country have risen by only 10 per cent. That is another remarkable achievement. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> was speaking, the Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> indulged in another of those irresponsible statements to which we became accustomed when he sat on the opposition side of the chamber, but which come ill from a Minister of the Crown. He interjected " Why should prices rise at all ? " Prices have risen because costs have risen, and it is impossible to keep down the price of any commodity if the price of producing it is increasing. One of the big factors in the increasing costs that have led to increased prices is increased wages. Members of the Joint Committee on Profits have been giving attention to this matter, and have had perfectly clear proof before it that prices in </para>

                <para>What is the task with which the Treasurer is faced at present? It is no light one. It is that of how to raise the sum of £325,000,000 from 7,000,000 people, a task which two years ago would have been thought well nigh impossible. In order to provide the colossal sum envisaged in this year's budget, the contribution from the total population of Australia will be almost £50 <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> The first thing to be done by  any one who considers such a problem is to ascertain its nature, and then to proceed to administer to the community the proper medicine.

                <para>The problem confronting us is of a twofold character. We have reached the stage where we can continue the war effort upon the basis on which we all desire that it should be continued only by diverting men and machines from civil production and seeing that they are employed in the production of goods and services for war. That position is frankly acknowledged in the budget speech. The Treasurer said that, notwithstanding any increased production that could be brought about, there must be a switch over of a large volume of production from civil needs to war demands. With that statement I entirely agree.. That is the physical side of the problem. The financial side is involved in the question as to how the burden of that diversion shall be carried by the community. </para>

Those are the principles which should be followed at present by any government; but, because the principles followed in the present budget involve the very reverse of payment according to ability to pay, I am opposed to certain features of the budget to which I intend to refer. One satisfactory way of seeing that the community pays in accordance with its ability is to tax people on their incomesin accordance with the amount of those incomes. There is no fairer or more certain way of seeing that the burden is properly distributed amongst all members of the community in accordance with their ability: </para>

If the basic wage-earner, in order to meet the needs of war, is: to be forced like every other member of the community to make some contribution to the war effort, the fairest way to do it is to tax him, and not reach the same result by the roundabout, unfair and inequitable methods inherent in the present budget. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has already mentioned some phases of the problem confronting Australia. He has referred to the fact that no new burden is imposed on incomes under £400. This section of the community has an income of £560,000,000. It contains 90 per cent, of the earners of income, and comprises 70 per cent, of the national income; yet it contributes only £3,250,000 to the war effort. </para>

                        <para>- Let us compare the presentGovernment's policy with what has been done by the Labour Government of New Zealand. Out of the same fund, from the same kind of people, that Government would obtain revenue amounting to at least £56,000,000. The New Zealand system starts with a tax of 10 per cent, or 2s. in the £1. The basic wage earner - indeed, a person earning £2 a week, which is less than the basic wage - contributes £10 out of his £100 to the war effort. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I believe that that section of the community which has the use of £560,000,000 must bear its share. It is because I believe that it cannot, in fact, escape from its share of the burden that I believe that the money should be extracted from that section in the only fair way by which it can be obtained. Instead of diverting money from civil production to war activities by means of post-war credits or compulsory  loans, as the Fadden Government proposed, this Government runs away from the task altogether. It starts with a miserable contribution, for it proposes to increase taxes by only £22,000,000. Some proportion of that amount it plans to get by means of an increased sales tax. It is amazing to find aLabour Government preferring a sales tax to an income tax based on ability to pay. </para>

                        <para>- Because a particular government does a certain thing is not to say that indirect taxation is to be preferred to direct taxation. This Government proposes to levy indirect taxation, which falls inequitably upon people with large families, low wage-earners and invalid and old-age pensioners. It does that in preference to taking the straight and honest course, and saying to the man who is earning £300 a year : " Look here, old chap, it is up to you to contribute £15 a year to the war effort". The Government has resorted to this method rather than impose direct taxation; but that is not the whole story by any means. Over £70,000,000 of war expenditure is to be obtained from " we don't know where ". The Government has run away from the problem of raising that amount of this year's war expenditure. I submit that the Government is not serious when it tells the people that it proposes to raise £130,000,000 this year by way of loan. Any man who studies this problem must come to the conclusion that the Government will not be able to raise half of that sum in this way. </para>

                        <para>- If6 per cent, or 7 per cent, interest be necessary as an encouragement, then I say that it is in that section that encouragement is necessary in order to get the money. The fact is that we raised only a little over £60,000,000 by means of loans last year. I cannot see any prospect of raising anything in excess of that amount this financial year. If my prediction be correct, it means that about £70,000,000 of war expenditure will have to be provided by bank credits. In other words - and this is the important factor - at a time when, on the Treasurer's own statement, the production of goods and services for civil purposes is decreasing, the Government proposes deliberately to increase by over £70,000,000 the amount of credit available in the community. </para>

After all, it must be remembered that companies do not exercise votes. Whenever increased taxation Ls necessary it is becoming the practice to increase the taxes on companies, but governments which do that overlook the fact - and governments of all political parties have been guilty of this in some degree - that companies do not exist in reality. There is no such thing as a company that can be felt, that can be hurt or taxed. In other words, the taxes which companies pay are paid by their shareholders. When an increase of company tax is imposed by a government the principle of payment of tax in accordance with ability to pay is again departed from. If a flat rate of tax of 3s. in the £1 be imposed on a company that rate of tax is carried by every shareholder in it, whether rich or poor. The widow- </para><interjection>

As I have said, this is an inequitable method of taxing. Some taxing of companies is necessary, I agree, even if it be only to deal with undistributed profits; but in respect of the profits of companies which are properly distributed the burdens to be imposed on shareholders should be in accordance with their incomes, and the rate applied to their earnings from dividends should be the appropriate income tax rate. I take exception not only to the proposed increase of the tax to 3s. but also to the proposal of the Government to impose a vicious tax on company profits. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- The Government proposes to tax the earnings of companies in excess of 4 per cent. I suggest that that is a very low percentage of profit at which to commence to impose such a tax. The Government's proposal takes no account whatever of the varying risks associated with certain enterprises, and it accepts as a basis for the imposition of a special profits tax a rate of profit which is not very much higher than is at present obtained on gilt-edged securities. Again, the Government imposes this tax without regard to the ability of the companies to pay it. It does not, and will not, pay sufficient regard to the fact that one company may be carrying on an undertaking which involves considerable risks, and therefore should properly earn a higher rate of profit, whilst another may be engaged in an enterprise in which there is little risk. I suggest that that is further evidence of the failure of this Government to adhere to the perfectly sound principle that should guide us in our taxation proposals, namely, ability to pay. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator is uncertain as to the qualifications of Professor Copland to undertake the task allotted to him I suggest that he should read the unanimous report of the Joint Committee on Profits, to which three of his colleagues have subscribed their names, in which the members of the committee thought it proper to commend the work of Professor Copland. Having regard to the record o'f public service rendered by that gentleman, I have been a little disturbed in the last few days to hear that it is proposed to alter the regulations under which he operates at present. It is easy for the Government to suggest theoretical arguments as to why the powers of the Prices Commissioner should not be placed in the hands of one man, and how it may be better if some form of appeal tribunal were established. I commend to the Minister the old adage that the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it. This country has been well served by the form of control exercised by the Prices Commissioner since the commencement of the war. I believe that it would be a disservice to the consumers of this country - in fact to all of us - if his activities were interfered <inline font-style="italic">with</inline> at a time when the work he has to perform may be of the utmost importance indeed. It has been difficult enough to control prices in this country during these two years of war; but I believe it will be immeasurably more difficult in the future as the result of the proposals contained in this budget. It is in the financial policy such as the Government has expounded that I see the greatest danger to the price structure. Because that danger is very real to-day I should like to see in control of that extremely difficult undertaking a man who has performed such a signal service to his country during the first two years of the war. </para>

It would be a good thing psychologically for this country if the Government were brave enough to indicate that fact in its financial measures, and drive straight home to every member of the community that all of us must bear our burden, that those burdens must be borne now while the war is on, and that they are the necessary insurance premiums which we must pay if we are to retain our liberties as a democratic community. </para></speech>

                    <para>. - The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> erroneously spoke of me as the financial adviser to the Government. I assure him that Professor Copland is still the financial adviser to the Government, and that he will find that that gentleman's orthodoxy will be extended almost to any degree in order to retain his position. I shall not be the least surprised if he is prepared to accept any revolutionary monetary change in order to keep his job. The Leader of the Opposition quoted certain figures in order to show that the banks earn very little profit. The Bank of Australasia was founded in 1832 with an original capital of £200,000. In 1936, its capital was £4,500,000 and its disclosed reserves amounted to £4,750,000, whilst its reserved profits used in the business of the bank totalled £3,301,317. When we speak of company profits, and particularly the profits of a banking company, we should not overlook the degree of watering of stock that is done by these companies. The Bank of Australasia is an English company and most of its profits go to England. The value of the bank's properties is at present shown at only £200,000; but during the nineteen years preceding 1936, £2,648,496 was written off the bank's properties. Those properties are invariably situated in the centre of cities, and their value is constantly rising. The fact that in a period of nineteen years this bank has written off an amount of £2,648,496 in respect of depreciation of its premises, that is, off its profits, reveals just one way in which these companies hide their real profit. </para>

                <para class="block">I have repeatedly told honorable senators that it is impossible from a bank's balance-sheet to find out actually what profit it really makes. From 1900 to 1932, the net profits of the banks in Australia amounted to £122,351,428. The original capital of the Bank of Australasia was £200,000, and in 53 years, it has paid £6,000,000 in dividends. These are official figures which I have taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book.</inline> The Union Bank, which commenced with a capital of £140,000, has paid £8,000,000 in dividends. Consequently, bank profits are much greater than some people imagine. During the last war the banks paid up to 15 per cent, in dividends. The banks make a habit of publishing their smaller profits, but they never disclose their bigger profits. I happen to be a member of the Economic Society of England. Even at present, the banks in England are paying from 14 per cent, to 16 per cent, and the  chairman  of directors of one bank in presenting the balance-sheet, told the shareholders the bank was paying a dividend of 14 per cent, because of the fact that they were lending hundreds of millions of pounds to the Government. </para>

                        <para>- But the Leader of the Opposition said that these people are not paying tax; yet his Government increased the rate of tax on incomes by over 300 per cent. I have friends in Hobart, who complained about the increase of tax imposed by the Fadden Government. One man who paid £15 in tax in one year was obliged to pay £45 in tax the following year. Obviously, we cannot continue increasing the rate of tax on small incomes. I point out to honorable senators opposite that the Keynes plan, which the Fadden Government was prepared to adopt, was turned down by the British Government. Keynes had two schemes. The British Government refuses to use the national credit in any way whatever, just as the Fadden Government refused to do so. The Fadden Government proposed to adopt the Keynes plan in order to tax incomes of £100 and over, proposing to pay back this tax, which was to be levied in the form of a compulsory loan. Where would we get the money to pay back those loans? We have not got it now. The same observation applies to war debentures. A war bond of a face value of £1 is sold for 16s. Where will we get the money to redeem those bonds? That is the absurdity of taxation. Personally, I do not believe in taxation at all. Recently, I journeyed throughout Australia as far north as Cairns and as far west as Perth, addressing meetings, at which I showed how the war could be financed without the imposition of additional taxes. The mistake which the Fadden Government made, and I hope that this Government will not repeat it, is that it failed to realize that wars are not fought with money at all. Do honorable senators realize that 75 per cent, of taxes levied to-day are used to pay interest on previous loans? Before the outbreak of this war we were paying nearly £1,000,000 a week on back borrowing. If we realize that wars are not fought with money, we should have no need to impose taxes. Wars are fought with credit. The proof of that fact is that in the first year of this war the Associated Banks of Australia bought £07,000,000 worth of war bonds and treasury bills. That is how we fought this war during its first year; and we can continue to fight it by using credit so long as we get the credit through the right channel. If that credit came through the Commonwealth Bank we need not impose additional taxes. However, the Eadden Government imposed additional taxes last year, and it seems that we shall continue that practice because we have followed it for the last 40 years. Nothing hurts the conservative mind so much as a new idea. I propounded a few new ideas in this chamber, but they were turned down by the previous Government. For instance, I suggested, some months ago, that in order to raise revenue we should insert a clause in every Government contract to compel all contractors to finance their contracts through the Commonwealth Bank. That would only be a reciprocal business arrangement. It would tend to teach the people to use their own bank, and it would bring in hundreds of thousands of pounds a. year in profits to the people's bank. The Fadden Government flatly turned down that proposition ; I shall bring it forward again. </para>

                <para>The general  belief  is that there are three reasons, and only three reasons, why taxation is necessary. The first is that the money that the public possesses is the only source of money available to the Government to pay for the war or social services. That is a fallacy. We have not taxed the people sufficiently in order to be able to raise the money we require without using credits. The second reason is that the only way to switch the employment of labour and raw material from civil production to production for war purposes is to deprive the public of part of their incomes, so that that part of their incomes is spent by the Government. That is another fallacy. The third of these reasons is that if the public has more money to spend than there are consumers' goods to buy, inflation must ensue. I shall show that those conclusions are false; yet they were embodied in the financial policy of the Fadden Government. That they are false is proved by the fact that we have been using credit ever since the war started. I shall ask very shortly how much it cost the previous Government to tell the people that if they did not buy war bonds, the war output would be diminished. That is another fallacy. If we had an extra £1,000,000,000 in Australia at this moment it would not give us one extra tank or one extra aeroplane. That should be obvious to honorable senators. One reason why the three grounds which I have mentioned above for the belief that taxation is necessary are ill-founded is stated by the British banking journal, 77ie <inline font-style="italic">Banker -</inline></para>

                <para>In England, £600,000,000,000 worth of credit was created during the last war. I hope that we shall not follow a similar procedure. The Commonwealth Bank can lend interest-free money to the Government. Shortly after I was elected to the Senate, I asked whether it was the intention of the then Government to discuss the findings of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems before the ensuing Christmas vacation, and the reply I received was " Yes ". That was nearly four years ago, yet that subject has never been debated. If it had been discussed, the then Government's financial policy would have been revealed as being in direct opposition to the findings of the royal commission which it appointed. That is the reason why preceding governments failed to provide honorable senators with an opportunity to discuss that matter. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fadden</inline> spoke for an hour when introducing his budget, he mentioned the Commonwealth Bank only once. Just before he concluded his speech he said that there was an honorable understanding with the bankers that there should, be no great increase of profits. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fadden</inline> also said that he intended to give effect to one of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, namely that the private banks should  deposit some of their surplus reserves with the Commonwealth Bank, to protect their depositors. It has been stated that the essence of bank credit is faith on the part of the depositors that their money is safe in the bank, and faith on the part of the hankers that at the stipulated time, borrowers will return the money which has been loaned to them. That is a fallacy. The essence of bank credit is security. Money cannot be borrowed on faith. If I went to a bank to obtain money and said that I hoped that the banker would have sufficient faith in me, he would say that business could not be done on those terms. In fact <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> was once told that, when I went to a bank to borrow money and the banker asked me what security I had in the form of bricks and mortar. I got the money on that occasion, but it was not because the banker had faith in me; it was because I had the necessary security. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nash,</inline> the New Zealand Minister for Finance, was here recently and stress has been laid upon what has been done in New Zealand. The fact is that the New Zealand Government bought the bank established by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer. After the last war the Bank of England sent emissaries, of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer was one, all over the British Empire to set up new banks, ostensibly to help the financial systems of the various countries in which the new banks were to be established. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer came to Australia but he found he could not establish a bank here because we already had a people's bank - the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank has been referred to as a central bank, but actually it is nothing of the kind. The term "central bank" is misapplied to the Commonwealth Bank. A central bank is the principal bank of a private banking system, and the Commonwealth Bank is the very antithesis of that, notwithstanding the mutilation which it suffered at the hands of the Bruce-Page Government in 1924. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> on the occasion of his last visit to this country, was sent around Australia to tell us what had happened after the Munich pact, he told us about the probable enemies of the Empire. I listened to that gentleman in Sydney, but I did not say anything to him on that occasion because he said that lie intended to visit Tasmania. He did visit Tasmania and once again he told us  about the enemies of the Empire. I said, " What about the enemies within our gates?" He asked me what I meant by that, and I said, "I mean what I 3ay; what about the action of the Bruce-Page Government in altering the constitution of the Commonwealth Bank in favour of the private banks? In my opinion, that was an .act of treachery to the people of Australia ". <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> flushed ; he did not like it; but it was quite true. He was one of the enemies within our gates. We had another enemy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> who introduced an amending Commonwealth Bank bill before the outbreak of this war. The ob ject was to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act in various ways, and to establish a mortgage bank. It was proposed to establish a mortgage bank by selling inscribed stock and debentures to provide the necessary capital. At that time the Commonwealth Bank had £19,000,000 worth of assets, and its deposits totalled £1S4,000,000. The trick was this: The only people who could buy inscribed stock at that time were the trading banks-, so that, in effect, the new mortgage bank would have been under the control of the private banks. There is also another unpleasant point: Under company law, debenture holders can take over an organization if they are not satisfied with the manner in which its affairs are being conducted. Therefore, the private banks could have taken over the new mortgage bank. Fortunately there was so much opposition to the proposed legislation that the matter was dropped. That is a good example of fifth column work in this country. The aim was to rob the people of the Commonwealth Bank, which is the main asset that Australia possesses to-day. It has been said that the Scullin Government was the first administration to reduce invalid and old-age pensions. That action was forced upon the Scullin Government because of the state of this country's finances after they had been in the hands of the Bruce-Page Government for ten years. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> returned from Great Britain he found an empty treasury, an adverse trade balance of £30,000,000, and the London loan market closed to Australia simply because a Labour government was in office. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> had to look around for some new means of raising revenue because, under the present financial system, the only way any government can carry on is by continually borrowing money. The only source of money was the private banks, and as that source had been closed the Government could not carry on. That is why I want to see a change. Use should be made of the great Commonwealth Bank, which has the assets of Australia behind it. The private banks created the last depression deliberately; they can create depressions whenever they desire. A depression can be started only by calling up of overdrafts, and withholding further credit. Under the present system, the private banks have the power to do these things at any time. However, they will not have it after January next. In fact, they may not have it now. I am not quite familiar with the arrangements reached between the Government and the private banks a few days ago in Canberra, but it is said that the private banks have agreed to the new proposals. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. We have been told that the cost of living in this country has not increased to any great degree. The sales tax was introduced by the Scullin Government to meet the extraordinary position caused by the extravagance of the Bruce-Page Government. When it was introduced, it was only 2½ per cent., and it yielded a little more than £3,000,000 per annum. Under the Menzies and Fadden Governments, the sales tax was 15 per cent, and its contribution to the national revenue was £12,000,000 per annum. Now the sales tax on certain items is to be increased to 20 per cent. That affects everybody; very few items are exempt, and therefore the cost of living must increase. The sales tax is invariably passed on. Therefore it is no use saying that the people are not suffering from additional taxation impositions under war conditions. The Prices Commissioner, Professor Copland, has said that prices have risen by only 10 per cent., but I would point out that he deals only with certain commodities. A few months ago Professor Copland came to Hobart and addressed the Chamber of Commerce, of which I am a member, on the subject of price fixation. He spoke for well over an hour, and when he was about to conclude I said to him, " There is one commodity which the Prices Commissioner has not dealt with, and that is what is known as bank credit. It is created on the premises, the raw materials being pens, ink and paper. It is indispensible in modern business, yet the banks are permitted to make a profit of more than 100 per cent, on it." I realized that, as an economist, Professor Copland knew perfectly well that all costs go into prices and have to be recovered from prices. I have never seen a man so confused. I do not think he heard the case put in that way. Hesaid, " I think, senator, you will find that we shall obtain the money at a much lower rate of interest than you anticipate ". That had nothing to do with my question, but the  chairman  closed the meeting. </para>

                <para class="block">June, 1914, taxes in Australia amounted to £23,161,000, whilst in 1940, the total amount had increased to £144,397,000. All taxation increases the cost of living and lowers the standard of living. New Zealand has been referred to as a country which we should emulate, but there the average family pays £128 per annum in taxes or 41 per cent, of its total income. The result is that a workman in that dominion has to work for five months of the year merely to earn the money with which to pay his taxes. New Zealand has sold out to the private banks and is utilizing national credit to no greater degree than is Australia. That is why taxes are so heavy in that dominion. Taxes in New Zealand have increased from £5,000,000 in 1914 to £42,000,000 in 1941, an increase of 800 per cent. Indirect taxation acts like an anaesthetic for by that means taxes are taken from a man's wages without his being conscious of the fact. </para>
                <para>Interest bills absorb nearly the whole of the revenues of various ventures. The Sydney Water and Sewerage Board had an income in 1937 of £3,086,763, but interest and exchange costs amounted to £1,679,469. Whilst the various railway systems of Australia earned in fares and freights last year £12,500,000, their interest bills totalled £11,459,000. Is it surprising, therefore, that railway fares and freights are high? When the Commonwealth was established, six States federated. There are now seven States and the seventh is the State of poverty. That fact is borne out by the size df the national debt. I remarked earlier in my speech that the war  could  be financed without further taxes if full use were made of the national credit. I have cited many authorities in the past in order to show that the banks do not lend money. The greatest authorities point out that the banks are institutions for the creation of credit. The total sum held by the nine associated banks in Australia prior to the war was £14,000,000 worth of notes. The silver and copper eoin which they held was the total amount of their legal tender. The rest of the note issue was in the hands of the public for carrying on the retail business of the nation. In the first year of the war the associated banks bought war bonds and treasury-bills to the value of £67,000,000. Many financial reformers say that the powers of the banks to create credit are unlimited, but no such statement has ever been made by anybody having a right to pose as a reliable authority on monetary reform. The banks certainly do create credit. I have shown that in the first year of the war, when they had only £14,000,000 between them, they bought £67,000,000 worth of securities. How do we get into debt to the amount of hundreds of millions of pounds? There was no more currency in circulation in Australia at the end of the last war in 1918 than there was when the war started. The assertion by honorable senators opposite that we cannot carry on the present war unless the people continue to buy war bonds and war savings certificates is utterly untrue. </para>

                    said that the bank interest rate had fallen. If the banks lent £100,000,000 last year at 5 per cent, interest and could create £200,000,000 this year, they could now afford to lend money at 2£ per cent., because it would cost them no more to create £200,000,000 than £100,000,000. The fact that money is created by the banks is beyond dispute.

                        <para>- It is a fact to this degree that when I. asked a question I was informed that the first war loan of £20,000,000 was to be raised through the agency of the Commonwealth Bank in conjunction with the private banks. That loan was not put on the market as was done with a subsequent loan of £30,000,000. When I asked how much of that sum passed through the Commonwealth Bank and how much through the private banks the previous Government refused to supply the information. However, the manager of the associated .banks " spilt the beans " when he said, speaking of the patriotism of the banks, " I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that the whole of the £20,000,000 war loan was subscribed by the private banks ". That was not precisely the position, because the private banks subscribed only £14,000,000 of the £20,000,000 required. The Commonwealth had to make up the difference. The £14,000,000 which was subscribed by the private banks was created out of nothing; yet the Commonwealth pays <inline font-style="italic">Z\</inline> per cent, interest on the amount. The interest represents £500,000 a year. </para>

That statement has been made by a reliable authority. During the last war the profits of some Australian banks went up to 15 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The hanks can create as many millions of  pounds  as are required. It must be remembered that 2£ per cent, on a certain sum is equal to 5 per cent, on half of that amount. In December, 1937, Australia's national debt amounted to £1,262,911,649 Os. Id. One person in the community, who signed himself " Patriot ", was concerned about the magnitude of the debt, and accordingly he sent a Id. stamp to the then Treasurer with the object, as he said, of reducing the debt to a round figure, tinfortunately, his purpose was not achieved, because between the time that he saw in the newspaper the amount of the national debt and the time when he sent the Id. stamp to the then Treasurer, the national debt had increased at the rate of £1 13s. 4d. a second. The debt grows so quickly that it now amounts to £1,000,000 a week. It is still growing. Compound interest on that debt has got Australia into a deplorable state. Some persons in the community are forced to work five months in the year in order to pay their taxes. That is the position already when taxes have really only started. </para>

                        <para>- Inflation is the lowering of the purchasing power of the wages of the people. In South Africa efforts have been made to prevent inflation. Prices of commodities have been fixed, and heavy fines may be imposed on those who sell above such fixed prices. A man may be fined as much as £500, or given two years' imprisonment, for departing from the fixed price. In Australia persons convicted of exceeding fixed prices were fined a mere £3 or £4. </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but the fact is that they are not fined heavily. The reason is that many of the people who ought to be punished in this way find the money for political campaigns. Should the war continue for a few more years what are our taxes likely to be? Last year, the then Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eadden)</inline> introduced a budget covering an estimated expenditure of £100,000,000. This year the budget runs into £325,000,000. I emphasize that the interest on the national debt is mounting all the time. Tens of thousands of pounds have been spent in Australia to inform the people that if they do not buy war savings certificates and war loan bonds the war effort will be retarded. I intend to ask what it has cost Australia for advertisements urging the purchase of war bonds and war savings certificates. I shall tell the Senate how the war savings certificates swindle is worked. The private banks have sold certificates to the value of £14,000,000. A bank which can sell certificates of a value of £100,000 puts the amount to the credit of its cash reserves. It can then advance to the Government credit amounting to £800,000 on the strength of that addition to its cash reserves, and it can charge the Government 3£ per cent, on that sum. Do honorable senators know of a bigger racket than that? That is the kind of thing that went on with the knowledge of the previous Government. I hope that it will not continue under the present administration. No private individual may hold war savings certificates valued at more than £250, but the private banks found a way to get over that difficulty. They bought certificates in the names of their employees. These employees bought them voluntarily, on the advice of the manager of the bank. I do not know what would have happened to them if they had not taken his advice. Every fortnight an amount was taken out of their wages for the purchase of these certificates and placed in the hank's reserves. Although it is said we are fighting for so-called democracy, I maintain that, since this war started, Australia has been fighting with one hand behind its back because of the financial system under which we are governed. 'On one occasion I told honorable senators that the people who sent us here are under the impression that the 111 members of Parliament in Canberra comprise a national government engaged in the task of ruling Australia. I have told the people repeatedly that their assumption is entirely wrong and that Australia is governed by the associated banks. Under the present system no government, can carry on its functions except by continuing the policy of borrowing. The only way to pay the ever-increasing interest bill is by borrowing still more. All money comes into existence through the banks in the form of a debt. That is why we are called upon to pay such, tremendously high taxes to-day. I have spent a considerable part of my life expounding my financial theories to the people, hoping that they will some day realize what a racket is being put over them under the present financial system, and that an obligation rests on the shoulders of every member of this Parliament to scrap it. Honorable senators opposite have complained that the present budget imposes heavy taxation only in respect of incomes in excess of £1,500 per annum. They forget that the last two governments imposed tremendous burdens on those in the lower income groups and that those with small means are still being called upon to make heavy sacrifices. People have said to me, "Poor people and dole workers still appear to have plenty of money to spend at the races and with which to back their fancy at the dog race meetings". The real reason why so many working people patronize sporting events of that nature is because they hope by a chance win to have a little extra money with which to buy the necessaries of life. The bookmakers, like the banks, make the odds. My banker said to me one day " Why not work on an overdraft ".. I said " T was reading the notice on the wall outside. You are offering 2i per cent, for fixed deposits for two years. What is the current rate for overdrafts ? " He said, " The rate to-day is 6 per cent.". I said "Do you realize what percentage of profit that shows your bank? It is nearly 200 per cent.". He said "But borrowers pay only from day to day". I said, " They not only pay from day to day, they also pay all the time ". He then said "From what I hear and what I can see of you, you attend to everything but your own business ". I said " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manager,</inline> thank God, I do not owe you anything ". My idea of happiness in this life is to do exactly what I. want to do. If I give a great part of my life for the improvement of the lot of the workers, I feel that I am well repaid. Governments have been in office in the federal sphere for over 40 years, but we have never yet had a balance-sheet submitted to the country. All we get from governments is a statement of revenue and expenditure. How can we know where we stand, unless a balance-sheet is struck? <inline font-style="italic">\Extension of time granted.]</inline> Recently I submitted a balance-sheet to this chamber which had been drawn up by one of the most accomplished accountants in Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> J. Amos, an employee of the Adelaide City Council. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Amos</inline> proved - and I challenge any honorable senator to question any of his findings - that the Commonwealth Government can expend £362,000,000 a year on the cost of government and social services and still have £1,000,000,000 left with which to fight the war. Nobody seems to realize that we can lend against the productive capacity of the nation. It was estimated by the previous Government that the value of the productive capacity of Australia would reach £1,000,000,000 this year. Banks can lend only against their cash deposits and up to 800 per cent, more than the amount of such deposits, but the nation is limited only by the productive capacity of its people. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Amos</inline> gave the productive value of Australia in terms of producing units-. In the United States of America, it was estimated that the national value of each inhabitant amounted to £368. If we adopt that figure for Australia and apply it to the nation as a whole, it will be readily seen what tremendous resources are at our disposal to finance the war. We have a Joint Committee on Social Security, which has been charged with the task of recommending means by which the social conditions of the people could be improved. When that committee was appointed by the last Government, I felt that a lot, of time and money would be wasted, because it would not tackle the money question, and, consequently, could not get to the root of the trouble and make worthwhile recommendations. The bad social conditions that exist today are brought about by lack of purchasing power in the hands of the people. When it is realized that the banks have the sole right to create credit, which represents the purchasing power of the people, and that they can stop it at any time, it will be realized what tremendous power is vested in them. During the depression food valued at hundreds of millions of pounds was destroyed on the advice of so-called economists as a means of keeping up prices. It is an economic fact that prices are governed by the amount of money in circulation. If, as orthodox economists say, new money coming into circulation tends to increase prices and thus cause inflation, it must follow that the purchasing power of the people is reduced by the refusal of the banks to issue further credit, or by the; calling up of overdrafts, it must have the effect of lowering prices. A famous royal commission on unemployment and allied subjects known as the McMillan Commission was established in England and continued its researches for about two years. As a reward for his labours, the  chairman  was given a seat in the House of Lords. As long as I can recollect royal commissions on unemployment have invariably found that unemployment has been brought about, by over-production. After inquiring exhaustively into the matter the McMillan Commission found that unemployment was caused not by over-production but by underconsumption  and. that money would have to be found from some source without increasing taxation in order to protect industry and to keep the people in work. Every man who is out of work is an economic loss to the country. As soon as he gets into debt, his freedom vanishes. I have said more than once in this chamber that debt takes away individual and national liberty. Suppose I am a baker accustomed to buy flour from two or three millers. I owe one miller considerably more than the others. He says to me: " You must buy all your requirementsfrom me in the future; otherwise I shall put you through the insolvency court/' Because of my indebtedness to him I lose my individual liberty. A baker very often continues to supply poor people with bread, even though he knows that the prospect of being paid for it is rather remote. He has not the heart to stop their bread when he knows that litt!" children in the house have nothing else to eat. In that way, he runs into debt, and immediately loses his economic liberty and becomes the slave of the miller. In addition, he is compelled to pay any price the miller to whom he is indebted likes to charge. In just the same way many nations are up to the neck in debt to the banks. When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> wa Prime Minister he floated a loan on the market at 6 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. We must remember that from 75 per cent, to 80 per cent, of all loans are subscribed by the banks. Having realized that it is easy to see who fixes the rate of interest. As I have said on many occasions, interest can be paid only by further borrowing. That is why the national debt has increased so tremendously in the last few years. In Hobart recently I was interested to hear a lecturer, an economist of the Melbourne University give his impressions of a visit to Russia in 1934. Dealing with the Soviet's financial policy he said that M. Stalin had a habit of putting a. loan on the market at 6 per cent., and, when he got the money, of lowering the interest rate to 3 per cent. I point out that that practice is not peculiar to Russia. I do not know whether M. Stalin learned of it from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> or whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> learned of it from M. Stalin. I have endeavoured to give honorable senators some idea, of the mess we have got into as a result of following orthodox methods of fina.net-. The only way Australia may be saved from financial and economic ruin is bv a complete alteration of the financia  system. There should be a revolutionary change in the finances of this country. The word " revolution " means a violent departure from existing methods or ideals. A violent departure from orthodox financial methods must be brought about in Australia if this country is to be saved from financial insolvency. To continue as we are going on to-day is madness. History shows that on several occasions one man has been right when the rest of the world was wrong. One of the new economists whom I follow has said that banks do not need to have money to start at all. This man was asked to go to Ottawa to express an opinion on a bank bill then before the Canadian Parliament. He was asked how much capital a bank required before it should be given a charter to trade. To the amazement of his hearers he said, "A bank does not need capital to start business. It needs only buildings, books and pens ". When a bank commences business it invites people to make deposits with it, and when it accepts deposits it simply gives receipts for them. But a depositor is given no security that he will get it back again. If I deposit, say, £100 in a bank, the manager says. " We will pay you interest at the rate of 2-i per cent, for two years ". I say, " All right"; and I get a receipt for the deposit. On the other hand, if I wish to borrow £100 from a bank, the bank wants a guaranteed security to twice the value of the loan either in real estate, or bricks and mortar, before it will advance the loan. The banks are like the bookmakers. The latter cry the odds, and you cannot get a bet unless you take their prices. The banks make all the terms. It is useless to go from one bank to another, because they have a gentleman's agreement. Recently I was talking to the only son of a Queensland farmer who was heir to an estate of 14,000 acres.  His  father was one of the best stockmen in Queensland. In the bank-created  depression in 1929, the bank seized the whole of the 14.000 acres and the owner saw the finest milch cow3 being sold for Ils. a head. He lost the whole of his security because in the depression, which the banks created, his overdraft was called up. Later he was glad to get a job on a farm at 10s. a week. He worked at breaking in horses, and when he was injured in a fall and was obliged to cease duty for two weeks his employer stopped £1 out of his wages. That is an indication of the policy of the banking system in Australia. Is it any wonder that Professor Wadham, who inquired into the wheat industry in Australia, reported that the wheat lands of this country were mortgaged to the banks and financial institutions to the amount of £160,000,000? At that time the price of wheat was 2s. 4d. a bushel. Yet the Government of the day was urging the farmers to grow more wheat. Before this war broke out, the wool industry was in the same parlous state. The debt of the wool-growers to the banks and financial institutions was £175,000,000; and they requested the Government to pay a bonus of Id. per lb. in order to enable them to pay their overdrafts. The banks have never created Id. worth of wealth in Australia, yet they own Australia. </para>

                        <para>- They are worse than Ned Kelly. The bushranger takes the risk of being hanged, but the successful banker is admired by his shareholders. I know wheat and wool-growers who never saw a cheque for years because the banks would not finance their clip, or crop, until these were made over to them. Ned Kelly was decent compared with some of them. I do not blame the bank managers. They have absolutely no  say  in the matter. Many take their instructions from London, and London takes its instructions from the Bank of International Settlements at Basle. That bank is not subject to the law of any country. Absolute power is given to it under its charter. I do not wonder that wars continue. One has only to examine the directorates of any of the big armament firms in England, and ou it he will find  ex-admirals  and ex-generals who, from time to time, write to the newspapers pointing out how unprepared Great Britain is for war. Undoubtedly, Great Britain was unprepared for this war. I have spoken of corrupt governments. Let us see what happened in the election in which the Baldwin Government was returned to power. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baldwin</inline> was asked why he did not go on with an armament programme. At that time there was a very strong peace movement in Great Britain. He said that the Government dare not do it because it would lose the then pending election. So the first concern of that Government, as of many other governments, was to keep its place. In 1939 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montagu</inline> Norman loaned Hitler £50,000,000. He said, " "We shall have to let Germany have, the money, although we might never get it back. But it is worth £50,000,000 to support Nazi-ism ". At that time the bankers in Great Britain were afraid that communism would overrun Germany. Financially, we are fighting with one hand behind our back. When a totalitarian state makes war on a democratic state, it has complete control over the whole of the financial resources of its nation. There is no individualism in a totalitarian state. Two years ago I said that Germany was using its national credit, ever since it started the armament race. I gave figures showing how the gold reserves of the world were held in 1939. In that year the total gold reserves amounted to 14,301,000,000 American dollars. That reserve was held as follows: United States of America, 8,126,000,000 dollars; Great Britain, 396,000,000 dollars; France, 1,435,000,000 dollars; Holland, 595,000,000 dollars; Belgium, 318,000,000 dollars; Switzerland, 407,000,000 dollars; Germany, 17,000,000 dollars; Italy, 124,000,000 dollars and Japan 97,000,000 dollars. The three most powerful and warlike nations of to-day have not as much gold between them as little Switzerland; yet we were told at that time by the orthodox economists that Germany could not possibly 'arm and fight a war because it was " broke ". Germany realized that wars are fought not with money but with credit. The German system of finance is this: Clothes, food and money are rationed. It is the most perfect system of its kind in the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Schacht,</inline> the manager of the German Reich Bank, wanted to adhere to orthodox methods and to lend money to the nation through the Reich Bank. For that reason Hitler "sacked" him; but when the business people of Germany worked out a financial, system to meet the needs of the nation, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Schacht,</inline> waa given back his job. If the Government in Germany wants 50,000,000 marks' worth of guns from Krupps, it places its order with Krupps, who take a cheque for that amount. Krupps then bank the cheque, and the Government has first call on that deposit. It says to Krupps, " You have much more money now than you want ". The company must then buy Government stock to the amount of 50,000,000 marks. It is allowed interest on that amount. The system is perfect, because it does not do away with the profit motive. Krupps still get their profit. That is how Germany is financing its tremendous war machine. We cannot do that. We must depend on what the banks give to us. We do not. use our national productive capacity as the Germans do. Until our system is altered we are fighting, financially, with one hand behind our back. There are many things which we could learn from German economics and finance; but we are compelled to adopt orthodox methods. If Germany is better armed and has  a  different financial system from our own, we must devise a means in order to enable us to meet Germany on its own terms. Therefore, our best plan is to alter our financial system in order to give us the greatest productive capacity in armaments and men. I repeat that we do not need money to fight the war. What we need are credits ; but in the past we have used them through the wrong channel. If the circulation of additional money increases prices, it does not matter from which source that money comes if prices are not controlled. But we are told that they are controlled. We have been told that an increase of only 10 per cent. has. been allowed, due solely to the fact that the costs, such as freight and insurance, are increasing. However, the prices of only some commodities have not increased. One finds that the prices of vegetables and fish, for instance, have increased considerably. That is the case, in respect of everything that means food and shelter to the people. Rents are increasing, but rents do not come within the scheme of price control visualized by the Prices Commissioner. The Geelong Woollen Mills were sold by the conservative Bruce-Page Government, which also disposed of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. An amount, of £500,00.0- is still owing on the latter deal. The man  who bought the Commonwealth Line was sentenced to imprisonment for two years. Personally, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> should have got five years. By cutting out Government participation in industry the profits of private enterprise, including the merchants of Flinders-lane, can be considerably increased. That is what I mean when I refer to corrupt governments. Any one who sacrifices the interests of the people for the benefit of profit-makers is a traitor. He is the fifth columnist of to-day - the enemy inside our gates. The manager of the Canadian Government Bank, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham</inline> Towers, when giving evidence on oath before a monetary commission, was asked whether the Government bank could loan interest-free money to the Government. He replied, "Yes, undoubtedly; not only that, there is no need for the Government to repay the money to the bank. Through increased prosperity brought about by the spending of. that money, the Government is repaid indirectly, and it is a good policy to adopt ". What did our orthodox economists tell the Commonwealth Government during the depression ? The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, when governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who was a servant of the Commonwealth Government, said to the Government that unless it lowered social services and reduced salaries by 10 per cent, he would not come to its assistance. The Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems, in paragraph 530 of its report, stated that Parliament is ultimately responsible for finance and everything for the good government of Australia. The Commonwealth Bank has certain powers granted to it by statute. These powers are to be exercised in the interest of the nation. The royal commission stated that at any time when a difference of opinion arises between the Bank Board and the Government as to policy, a free and frank discussion should take place on the matter, in order to show the Bank Board where it stands. If the views of the board and the Government are still irreconcilable, the Government should say to the board that it takes full responsibility, and tell the board how to act. Why did not the previous Government use those powers? It did many things under the National Security Act. Under sec tion 42a of that act any one criticizing the financial policy of the Government is liable to arrest and punishment. That is rather severe on a man who knows the trickery that is going on in the banking system. If he mentions it he is liable to be treated as a criminal. He might be able to save the people of Australia millions of pounds in taxation, but if he says a word that is contrary to the policy of the Government he is liable to be put in gaol. When speaking from the platform of the Town Hall in Hobart, I told my listeners that under section 42a of the National Security Act I was liable to be imprisoned for what I was saying, but that I would rather go to gaol than hold my tongue. I told the people the truth. I have told the Senate the truth on many occasions, but honorable senators seem to have little regard for the truth. I have taken up considerable time in delivering this speech, and I hope that I have not been speaking only to the walls. The desperate position which confronts us today compels me to speak at great length. Things are very bad indeed. I know of many young men who have given up excellent occupations in which they had good prospects for the rest of their lives, in order to join our fighting forces, yet while they are overseas fighting in the defence of the Empire, the private bankers who stay at home seek only to increase their own dividends. In 1914 the then Prime Minister pledged Australia to the last man and the last shilling, but he did not use the Commonwealth Bank for the purpose for which it was created. He ran up a war bill of £360,000,000 by adopting orthodox methods of finance, and when the soldiers came back from the front he took their last shilling in taxation to pay interest to the hanks. That is what will happen again this time if the present system is not altered. I have high hopes that it will be altered, and that justice will be done to the men who are prepared to suffer hardships and undergo the risks of war in order that those who stay behind may live in safety and comfort. I wonder what the twoshillingsaday  English " Tommy " thinks when he reads that the Midland Bank declared a dividend of 16 per cent., due mainly to the fact that it has lent millions of pounds to the British Government for war purposes. It is time that that racket was stopped. The trouble is to get people to realize just what a racket is going on. I have travelled all over Australia from Cairns to Perth, and have addressed hundreds of meetings on monetary questions. Although I am confident that I have converted quite a number of people, the ignorance of the average man, whether he be a wharf labourer or a university graduate, is astounding. He does not take the trouble to find out just how he is being governed. Certainly he grumbles about taxation. In fact I heard such grumblings in Sydney during the past few days. Two years ago I told honorable senators that not until half their salaries had been taken in taxation would they take any notice of what I had been advocating. But it is coming to pass. Very little will be left of our salaries next year. "When we touch the people's pockets we sometimes touch their conscience, but we also touch the sensibility as to their personal interests. That is what will happen in this country before there is a realization of what we are being driven to. </para>

That is a very great tribute to the work of those governments. Commodity prices in this country have risen to a lesser degree than in any other country because of the fact that at the outbreak of war, the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> realized the necessity for adopting a system of price control. That system was introduced as one of the first acts of the Menzies Government. The suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> and supported, by interjection, by some honorable senators opposite, that the Prices Commissioner, Professor  Copland, was prepared to do anything to keep his job, is unworthy of him. I have been in frequent contact with Professor Copland since he was placed in charge of the price-fixing machinery of this country, and I think that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane),</inline> who is in charge of the department in which Professor Copland holds a position, will agree that he has done an extraordinarily good job in most difficult circumstances. It ill becomes honorable senators to make remarks of that kind about a public servant who is unable to defend himself. </para>

                <para>As long as this Government carries on the defence "programme which has been outlined, and if possible intensifies it, it will receive our support and constructive criticism. I trust that the Government will be given better support than was given to the Administration of which I was a member, not so much in this chamber, but in the House of Representatives, especially during the last six months of its existence. I say quite frankly that despite the repeated statements that the Menzies and Fadden Governments were receiving wholehearted support, during the past six months every form of irritation was indulged in by the Opposition in order to secure a change of administration. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator says that we were " torpedoed ". I would point out to him. that when the previous Government did fall it was as tie result of the assassin's knife, and not by means of a majority vote recorded against it at the polls. The Government fell because of the greed for office of certain individuals and not because of its shortcomings. I regard it as a privilege to have been a member of the Government of this country during these critical years of war, and I believe that the three Prime Ministers whom I have mentioned, can be very proud of the work done by their respective Governments. I remember only too well the state of Australia's defence at the time of the Munich pact. Under the voluntary system our home defence forces were very small indeed, and very few militia units were at anything like full strength. Our soldiers numbered 35,000. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It would have been impossible to muster that number when the men went into camp for a few days in each year. I assure honorable senators that the work of building up those forces was extremely difficult. Credit is due not only to the various governments concerned in that work, but also to the leading men of the various arms of the defence services. They had a colossal task to perform. In the earlier days they were hampered and handicapped by lack of finance, and they also had to counter a lack of enthusiasm among the people. That lack of enthusiasm was reflected in the attitude of various governments with the result that the services were starved. Then came the colossal task of building up the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, and expanding munitions production. A great deal of credit is also due to those capable men who came to the assistance of the Government; many of them in an honorary capacity. Criticism has been levelled against some of these gentlemen because they had been successful in private enterprise and it was suggested that that they came into munitions work in order to gain personal advantages. As the result of my personal contact with those men I formed an entirely different opinion of them. Many of them have thrown aside their private interests in order to give their valuable assistance to the Government, The3e are the men who were condemned by honorable senators opposite when they were in opposition. The present Government will find the services of those men very valuable, and I believe that it will be well advised to continue to avail itself of their assistance. </para>

                        <para>- No. If the people are to cut out all luxury expenditure, how can the Government secure the additional revenue that it hopes to get by increased taxes, including increased sales tax, which to a large degree is imposed on luxury lines. There is only one way in which the result that the Prime Minister desires can be achieved and that is by compulsory savings and by the compulsory rationing of certain commodities. But will the people cease to purchase luxuries merely because the Prime Minister has appealed to them to do so voluntarily? I contend that the diversion of a certain percentage of the income of individuals to the war effort should not be left entirely to their whim or grace. I believe that a majority of the people will heed the Prime Minister's appeal, but we have reached the stage where everybody in the community must play his or her part, be it large or small, in relation to the financing of the war effort. A proposal of outstanding merit in the Fadden budget was that providing for compulsory savings. If everybody plays his part in the transference of expenditure on non-essentials to war expenditure, the burden on each member of the community will be lightened. </para>

                <para>Money is more plentiful in Australia now than it has been for generations, and family incomes are larger than they have ever been before. Therefore there should be a saving of the national income, not only for the purpose of financing the war, but also in order to make provision for post-war reconstruction. Although there is every indication that the war will continue for a long time, when it is over thousands of employees now engaged in munitions factories will be forced to find other employment, and at the same time we shall be faced with the problem of providing work for the members of our fighting services who will be returning from overseas. Will that not be a time when the benefit of compulsory savings and deferred pay would prove invaluable? We give to members of the fighting services 6s. a day and 2s. deferred pay, and one of the main reasons for the deferred pay is to provide a nest-egg which will be found useful to the men on their return from the war. Therefore I see no reason why civilians also should not be called upon to accept deferred pay. Under the Fadden budget it was proposed to pay the bank interest rate on civilian deferred pay, but the returned soldier gets no interest on his deferred pay. If there was one proposal of outstanding merit in the Fadden budget it was that relating to deferred pay for civilians, and I believe that we shall yet adopt that principle. </para>

It is idle for the Prime Minister to speak to the public in generalities by referring to the necessity for reduced expenditure on non-essentials ; he should be specific. The people are looking for a lead as to what they should be called upon to do with regard to the rationing of commodities. The only practical way in which the Government can carry out its policy of transferring funds from expenditure on non-essentials to war expenditure is by compulsory saving and compulsory rationing. I believe that we shall eventually reach that stage. </para>

                        <para>- If the present Government is to retain office, it will have to do these things sooner or later. In any attempt to do the right thing in connexion with Australia's war effort it can rely on support which was denied to the previous Government. Another problem which the Government will have to face is that of providing reinforcements for the Australian Imperial Force overseas and for the other branches of the fighting services. Fortunately, the response to the appeal for men for the Empire Air Training Scheme has been excellent. Everyone in Australia is proud of the part that thi3 country is playing in the air defences of tha Empire, but I believe that we are reaching the position where we shall find that there is a serious shortage of man-power to supply necessary reinforcements to the men overseas and for the production of munitions at- home. I was glad to see that one of the first things the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> said he would do was to make a thorough investigation in regard to man-power. I believe that there are thousands of men now in exempt industries who could well be released for military service. </para>

                        <para>- Of course I can ; but I do not think that that position has been reached yet. It has been reached in some country areas, but in our cities the limit has not nearly been reached. An examination of the list of exempted occupations will reveal that there is ample scope for the release of a large number of men to join the  Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force. I regard the supply of reinforcements to our forces overseas as the most vital job Australia has to do. Honorable senators know my views in relation to military service. I am not opposed to the principle of conscription for military service overseas which has been adopted by New Zealand. Although we are proud of what Australia has done under the voluntary system, I am of the opinion that there are many merits in the compulsory system which are absent from the voluntary system. </para>

                    said that he feared that his many dissertations on the subject of finance had failed to impress honorable senators now sitting hi opposition, but a. study of the budget reveals that he has also failed to impress members of his own party. When I contemplated, the reading of the Treasurer's budget speech, I had in mind
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey's</inline>
                    repeated statement that, under a Labour Government, orthodox methods of finance would be set aside. I remembered, too, that on many occasions
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline>
                    had indulged in flights of oratory in which he advocated the introduction of a new financial system. He, too, said that under a Labour Government, the existing financial system would be changed. Nevertheless, the first budget introduced by a Labour Government was largely along orthodox lines. Obviously, members of the Cabinet, When placed in a position of responsibility, saw things differently from the way that they saw them when sitting in opposition. Unfortunately, the proposals of the Fadden budget were not, carried into effect, particularly those which required every person in the community to accept his share of the financial responsibility for the prosecution of the war.
                </para>
                <para>The Government makes a great feature of the fact that it expects to effect a considerable saving compared with the Fadden Government's proposals. It claims to have found a way by which it will be possible to 3ave £80,000 in connexion with the Department of Information. That is the only economy it can make in a £325.000,000 budget.' I am interested to know in what direction the saving will be effected, and accordingly, T have placed a number of questions on the notice-paper. Having spent seven or eight months in control of the Department of Information, I do not know of any way in which that department can still give the same service to the country and yet enable a saving of £80,000 to be made. I am aware that the Department of Information has been one of the most abused of departments; it has been the " Aunt Sally " of persons both inside and outside Parliament. I say, however, that it contains many men who have done an extraordinarily good job, Many who criticize the department do not realize how much work it does foi other departments. The present Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(,Senator Ashley)</inline> will find, as I did, that if there is a "sticky" job to be done, the Department of Information will be asked to do it. I shall be glad to know whether the estimated saving of £80,000 will be made by a reduction of the estimates of the department itself, or whether that amount represents the saving that will be made in respect of work done for other departments. The Department of Information has done a tremendous volume of work for the service departments, such as all recruiting propaganda,, war loan publicity, commercial advertising, and so on. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to know whether the contemplated saving of £80,000 will be a direct saving in the Department of Information. I wish to know also what services will be affected. I have noticed that the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> has suggested that the Department of Information should be abolished. I admit frankly that the department could be abolished, but I point out that if that were done, much of the work now performed by it would still have to be done by other departments. Soon after I took charge of the Department of Information, I discussed with my colleagues in the Cabinet and on the Advisory War Council, whether the department should continue. After consideration, both the Advisory War Council and the Cabinet decided that the department should continue to function. I think that the new Minister in charge of that department will find that much of the criticism levelled against it has been unfair. Moreover, much of the work done by it has not been given recognition, because it has been done indirectly. Other people have received the credit. Whatever may be done in an effort to save money, I urge the Minister no', to reduce the vote in relation to our activities in the United States of America, as was suggested in the press a few days ago. When the Australian News Bureau was first (established an New York, Australia was very little known to our cousins across the Pacific, ft has justified its existence in every way and has given Australia extraordinarily good publicity. </para>

                <para>A complaint has been brought to my notice in relation to the management of the small arms factory at Lithgow. Unfortunately, we have had at Lithgow a continuation of minor industrial disputes and hold-ups which have been very irritating to the Department of Munitions and very costly to the Australian war effort. I had a call some time ago from a returned soldier who was by trade a 'fitter and turner. At the time,' he was not following his own trade, but he was anxious to secure work in one of the factories doing government war work. I submitted his name to the Minister for Munitions, and he was called up to report at Lithgow, where he was given a position as what is known as a section hand. He told me that all he did was to walk about doing absolutely nothing for several days. Me asked the foreman in charge to give him some practical work. He said that, in addition to section hands, there were also the recognized foremen overlooking the work for the ordinary operatives. These foremen are called charge hands. They walk about and give advice to machinists. He was asked whether he would like to be put on a bench. When bo asked' what he had to do, he was told to fill in the time as best he could. Seeing some pipe brackets lying about, he decided to go on making some more. He had to walk several hundred yards to get the piping, then take it somewhere else to be sawn, shift it. somewhere else to be threaded, and then take it to the driller* and welders and await their pleasure. He worked an eleven-hour shift and received over £11 a week. Prior to taking on that work, his wages were about £6 a week. Although it was a Godsend to him to get an additional £5 a week, he was so disgusted that, in spite of the fact that he could have done with the extra money, he resumed his old job at about £6 a week. This man, who is a good unionist, said that the union leaders have complete control of the factory and that the foremen are helpless. The operatives on the machines have no check whatsoever on the number of articles they turn out in a day. He says that one man simply walks around ali day making sure the fire extinguishers are on the wall. </para>

Whether the honorable senator likes it or not, I shall continue to bring matters such as this to the notice of the Government in the hope that something will be done to rectify them. I trust that the Parliament will be kept in session and that there will be no rush into recess in order to stifle discussion of important matters such as this. I am naturally gravely concerned to have a report of this kind from a conscientious returned soldier unionist who is not prepared to take money for which he cannot give an adequate return. I ask the Government to investigate the matter. If this state of affairs exists at Lithgow, or at any other munitions factory, it is a clear demonstration that we are not making our full war effort. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that these charges are to be inquired into by a joint committee does not necessarily mean that I should not discuss them further. I point out that if charges of that kind made against a man occupying a high executive position in the Department of Munitions cannot be substantiated, they should be withdrawn and an apology tendered. If the charges are proved, drastic action should be taken Immediately. If they are not proved, the same publicity that was given to them should be given to their rebuttal. If the charges cannot be substantiated, 1 suggest that the Prime Minister should rebuke those colleagues of his who are prone to defame prominent men who are doing their best to serve Australia in a very difficult time. I do not propose to discuss in detail at this stage the measures consequent on the budget as an opportunity will be afforded to do so on a later occasion. I merely say now that I trust that the Government will reconsider ite proposal to combine, the. incomes of husbands- and wives for the purpose of arriving at the rate of tax to be applied to both incomes. Such taxation is aimed specifically at those who are trying to be thrifty and ensure that their families do not become a charge upon the nation after their parents' decease. I remind the Government, that there, are many wives who have inherited property in their own right. There are others, who, by their own efforts, have entered one of the professions, but who, because they happen to marry, are to be called upon to pay a higher rata of tax on their earnings than their unmarried competitors. Such taxation is a relic of the dark ages. It is taking us back to the days when a wife was a mere chattel of her husband. It is not worthy of a modern Government. I trust that the Government will review this proposal because I feel sure that when it was first made its serious, implications were not fully appreciated. </para>

Rather have they sought the easy way and as the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives said : " They have one eye on the electorate rather than both eyes on the winning of the war ". </para>

                    <para>, - I wish to refer briefly to a speech which I delivered in the Senate &gt;n the 26th June last, which has given rise to some comment. I feel that I owe an explanation to a number of officers of the 18th Battalion, who served in the last war. During my speech on that occasion I clearly stated the reasons that prompted me to refer to this matter. I met a number of officers at the Dubbo Military Camp. They had been there for twelve months training a division preparatory to going overseas. They had done the necessary training with the men, including bivouac and long route marches, and like the men they were very fit. They had served in the last war. They stayed with the Army and had obtained commissions. They complained very bitterly to me that whilst the boys whom they had trained went to the war, including a number of those who had served with them in the last war, they themselves were denied the privilege of going overseas as soldiers. Like many other diggers they felt that they were physically fit and should have been given an opportunity to go along with the boys they had trained. I said that the officers who took them away and who had just come fresh from Duntroon had not been with the men during their training. They said that they prayed for the men but not for the officers. During a speech which lasted an hour and a half I said that I had had experience in the 18th Battalion where the colonel, the battalion major, another major and several subalterns had been cashiered for cowardice. I uttered those words. Apparently it was not a charge that was " put over " the last Australian Imperial Force. I would say that probably the military system considered that they lacked judgment; that they were inexperienced and could not size up a difficult situation. However, as the term was known among the diggers, they knew that when a fellow was discharged from the Army whilst the battalion was on service he had "gone up " for cowardice. I do not want that to go abroad because I understand that a battalion had approximately 26 officers, and as, 1 believe, the 18th Battalion was wiped out four times I assume that it had at least 100 officers. I knew many of them. I do not feel that I should mention some names and not mention all of them. But I knew officers in that battalion who were game and whom nothing could stop. I should not like them to think that the seven subalterns to whom I referred included any of them. Consequently I am bound to withdraw the word cowardice ". </para>

                <para class="block">I am sad  to  say that that action was admitted by everybody to be a blunder. Many Australians lost their lives in it; and we lost the 400 acres. The article continues -  " Official records show that of 750 members of the unit engaged in the action on August 22 there were 382 casualties, of whom one-half were killed. By August 29 there were very few of the battalion left, and it was withdrawn from the line to reserve. " Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman left the unit when it was withdrawn to reserve and subsequently returned to Australia, where he was allowed to resign his appointment  on  December 14, 1915. "He was subsequently issued with the 1914-15 Star, General Service and Victory medals, ample proof that he was not cashiered." </para>
                <para class="block">Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman was allowed to resign. Because he was allowed to resign and because he was issued with certain medals I am bound to say that I cannot substantiate my statement, because I do not know what the decision of the Military Board of that time was. It appears that the board was prepared to give those medals to anybody at all. I do not want to labour the matter. However, I emphasize that many of the officers of that battalion were never in doubt. They were gallant men, like the members of the battalion who did a good job. I repeat that I cast no aspersion whatever on them. I cast no aspersion on Pritchard. He was a game man. He should never have been sent toFrance. He had been seriously wounded and his nerves were shattered. For that reason I do not think that Pritchard was a. coward. He was unable to go on and there was nothing against him for that. That is how I feel about it. I am not concerned about Chapman. I have seen men shot and wounded and have spent many nights attending to them. When I thought of that, and of the gallant men who went overseas, I felt very sad about them. I would never have mentioned the matter in ordinary circumstances. It just crossed my mind when I was thinking of the diggers of the last war who could be serving in this war, and who want to go to this war but have been denied that right and privilege. I hope that the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> will take steps to ensure that those men who served in the last war and who to-day enjoy health and strength and prove themselves to be physically fit by continuous training in military camps will have a chance to go to this war. I want nothing more than that. I believe that such men would be an inspiration to our younger soldiers under them and would command their respect because of the confidence which they would create in view of their previous experience under fire. That is my contention regarding the matter. If 1 have offended some officers of the battalion who feel that I have cast some aspersion on them I shall withdraw my statement. I do not want to offend anybody, but I am not at all in sympathy with Chapman. </para>

                    <para>. - I bring to the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Development the urgent  necessity for acting upon the recommendations made in an interim report presented recently by the Joint 'Committee on Rural Industries in connexion with the building of flax mills. The committee urged the Government to take, immediate steps to ensure that flax mills would be constructed and machinery installed for the processing of the coming season's crop. Honorable senators might not realize that the area in production this season is 60,000 acres as compared with 20,000 acres sown last season. The last season was bad whereas this season promises to be unusually good. Should that prove to be the case approximately £500,000 will hare to be provided in order to pay for the raw material alone, whilst approximately £1,000,000 will be required for the processing of that raw material. I now inform the Senate that in some areas the mills are not yet ready. The Flax Production Committee has had ample time in which to get the mills ready to handle the coming crop; but it seems that it is falling down on its job. If that is the case the Minister should, take action immediately in order to ensure that the mills are ready to handle the coming crop. </para>

                        <para>- I now inform honorable senators that at one particular place the committee has just acquired the land on which the mills are to be erected. I did not intend to go into details, but evidence has been given before the Joint Committee on Rural Industries that the mills must be ready by the end of December at the latest, in order to be able to handle the coming season's crop. If the committee has just acquired land on which to erect some of the mills this Government will require to act with greater speed than either the previous Government or the board has acted in the past. If the mills are not ready it will mean double, and triple, handling and stacking the flax in the rain. Furthermore, a demand will be made on labour for the construction of the mills in the middle of the harvesting when every available man will be required to handle the crop. I have heard much in this chamber to-day about our man-power problem. That problem in many instances is already upon us, and will become more serious in the future. All of us should realize the seriousness of the delay which will be caused if these mills are not built immediately and the necessary machinery installed in time to handle the coming crop. I hope that my remarks will be conveyed to the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> and that they will be given immediate attention, not merely because I ask that that the mills be constructed, but also because flax fibre is urgently needed in our war effort. </para>

                    <para>.- I desire to draw attention to the dissatisfaction of rifle club members in regard to the decision to withdraw their private rifles and issue them to other units. No objection is taken to the Government purchasing rifles from  owners  who have enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force or the Royal Australian Air Force, but when rifle club members have joined the Volunteer Defence Corps, now termed the Home Guard, it is contended that they should be allowed to retain their rifles. About 8,000 men have joined the Volunteer Defence Corps. These men are expert shots. They have trained themselves to become snipers, a role which, some day, the Volunteer Defence Corps may be called upon to play. About 30 per cent, of the 50,000 members of the Volunteer Defence Corps have never handled a rifle. Here is a golden opportunity for the military authorities to utilize the services of these specialists. Instead, the Government proposes to buy back these rifles and re-adjust them for use by other branches of the service. In each British Army battalion there is a section of sniping specialists armed with short rifles fitted with aperture sights. Rifle club members are identical with these sections, yet the Commonwealth Army authorities have recommended that the rifles be withdrawn from our expert snipers and handed over to others, who have still to learn to shoot straight. The rifle apparently is not considered an obsolete weapon or the Small </para>

                <para class="block">Arms Factory at Lithgow would not he turning out 1,000 a week. I shall not accept the statement that there is a shortage of rifles; it is the distribution which is at fault. I respectfully ask that the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> look into this matter more closely. Here are men who, in peace time, at little expense to the country, have qualified themselves for the task that they may be called upon to undertake. Instead of encouraging them to join the Volunteer Defence Corps the military authorities are discouraging them. Under the defence plans prepared in pre-war days, rifle club members were officially reservists, and were sworn in as such, but as this war progressed, for various reasons, the scheme never matured. Hundreds enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, hundreds were called up for compulsory service and are now on the active list of Militia units, others again were listed in reserved occupations. Prior to the formation of the Volunteer Defence  Corps many thousands of rifle club members were only too anxious to continue in the role of reservists, keeping themselves in practice and giving instruction in local centres to scores of young and middleaged men who hitherto took no interest in defence. Suddenly, all this patriotic activity ceased, and rifle clubs were put in cold storage because  no  ammunition was available. That is the position to-day, though millions of rounds are turned out weekly in our small arms ammunition factories. Seeing no prospect of serving their country as members of rifle clubs, about 8,000 linked up with the Volunteer Defence Corps. Imagine their disappointment when, instead of taking their own rifles with them, they were told that they could not do so, but must sell their rifles - specially prepared for sniping - to the Government. The whole business shows a short-sighted policy. The Volunteer Defence Corps is hampered in its training, and the enthusiasm of thousands of patriotic citizens dampened. It may be argued that the output of small arms ammunition has not yet reached the maximum required for overseas requirements and a general reserve within the Commonwealth. I am not in a position to say what these requirements are, but I do know that the amount of ammunition allotted to units of our Home Defence Army for training in the use of the Vickers machine gun, Lewis gun, Bren gun, and the rifle is totally inadequate. I shudder to think what would happen if our Militia Forces were called into action with a half-baked knowledge of the weapons with which they are armed. Is there no way of speeding up the manufacture of not only small-arm ammunition, hut also rifles. I hope that the Minister for the Army will take a stand in this matter and remove the suspicion that our Australian Army gets only what is left over. Our Army, including the Voluntary Defence Corps, must be efficient, otherwise our defence is only a sham. </para>

In its interim report, the Joint Committee on Rural Industries drew the attention of the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> to this matter, and all I wished to imply by my interjection was that the matter had been brought to the notice of the Flax Production Committee, whose responsibility it is to see that these mills are fully equipped to handle the forthcoming crop, which promises to be very heavy, and that the committee gave an assurance that the mills would be in readiness for the forthcoming crop. I agree that this matter should be brought to the notice of the Minister again.- No doubt, the Minister, in turn, will refer it back to the Flax Production Committee, which, I feel sure, will give the same assurance to the Minister as it gave to the Joint Committee on Rural Industries a few weeks ago. </para>

                        <para>.- On the 18th September last, a formal motion for the adjournment of the Senate was moved by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> in order to discuss an application by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. D.</inline> A. Craig and others for permission to establish a refinery for the treatment of crude oil, petrol, and bitumen. Serious objection was taken at that time by members of the then Opposition to the fact that the application had been rejected by the Capital Issues Advisory Board. Can the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> inform me whether that application has been renewed, and whether it has been granted by the Government? </para>
