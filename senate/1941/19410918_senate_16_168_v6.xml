                        <para>- I was accompanied by representatives of various Australian newspapers, who had been invited to visit the Netherlands East Indies and Malaya by the Governments of the Netherlands East Indies and the Straits Settlement. I cannot inform the honorable senator as to the cost of the trip, because, being a guest, I was not so discourteous as to ask our hosts what expenditure had been incurred in connexion with the visit. The invitation was extended to the whole party by the Governments of the countries visited, and I am hopeful that before long the Commonwealth Government will extend an invitation to representatives of our friends and allies in that part of the world to visit Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to draw the attention of honorable senators to the delay occasioned by the Government in. granting permission to the company in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> is interested to establish an oil refinery in New South Wales. The original application was made some three years ago. Honorable senators will recognize that if the establishment of the refinery was highly desirable in a time of peace, it is doubly necessary to establish it under war-time conditions. I am not concerned about the financial circumstances of the company. That is a matter for the Government itself, because the Capital Issues Advisory Board and other authorities can investigate it. I am, however, concerned about the necessity for the establishment of this industry for the production of petrol and bitumen from crude oil. The company renewed its application some months ago, but the request has been bandied about from cabinet meeting to cabinet meeting. During the last Parliamentary sittings this matter was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane,</inline> and we were then informed that the Cabinet was dealing with it. It was admitted by the then Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride),</inline> on behalf of the Government, that some delay had occurred, and that an injustice had been done to the company. Apparently the Government has not yet arrived at any decision in this matter, for I was informed yesterday, in reply to a question, that the matter was still before cabinet. I understand that some difficulty arose with the Capital Issues Advisory Board in relation to deferred shares in the company, but I understand that that matter has now been adjusted to the satisfaction of the Government. If that be so, I cannot understand the reason for not giving to the company permission to go ahead. </para>

                    <para class="block">The establishment of an oil refinery in Australia by this company would be of enormous assistance to both primary and secondary industries, particularly in view of the fact that petrol rationing is in operation. I do not say that some form of petrol rationing was not necessary, but I do not agree with the ruleofthumb methods which have .been adopted. Almost daily I receive complaints - and I have no doubt other honorable senators do also - of interference with industry and essential services because of inadequate petrol supplies. I have brought a number of cases of hardship before the Minister concerned, and am glad to know that many of them have been rectified. One case was that of a carrier who was carting silica, which is an essential ingredient in the production of steel. This man&#39;s supply of petrol had been so reduced that he would have been compelled to relinquish his contract had not his ration been increased. Only this week I received a complaint from a man who was carting pit timber for use in mining operations, and I was able to have his claim adjusted. These, however, are only a few of the many complaints that I have received. Petrol rationing has caused great inconvenience to men on the land situated 20 or 30 miles from a town. In some instances they do not get sufficient petrol to ena&#39;ble them to obtain necessary supplies. To-day, as the result of the war, a number of small companies are establishing their own petrol-producing plants. Last week I visited one such plant at Mittagong, involving the use of high temperature carbonization, which has been started by Peters American Delicacy Company Limited. In various parts of New South Wales and other companies are operating, but almost every conceivable obstacle has been placed in their way. I do not blame the Commonwealth Government for all the difficul ties that have been encountered for the State Government must accept its share of responsibility for what has taken place. Surely people who are pioneering the production of fuel oil in Australia should be helped rather than hindered. The Mittagong company to which I have referred pays a royalty of  1s. 9d. a ton of shale to the owners of the land on which it is operating, and a similar royalty to the lessee of the land. It also pays 4d. a gallon to the owner of the process which it is using, and, in addition, it has to pay 4d. a gallon excise to the Commonwealth Government. That tax should he abolished. That shale being used at Mittagong is of somewhat inferior quality, and will produce only about 40 gallons of oil to the ton. In this country there are enormous deposits of shale, and the people who are prepared to pioneer the production of oil from shale should be given every encouragement, as, should their efforts prove successful, the petrol obtained would be of great value to both primary and secondary industries, to say nothing of its value in the event of Australia being blockaded by an enemy. The importance of the establishment of a central refinery in New South &#34;Wales can scarcely he overestimated. I mention New South Wales because in that State and in Tasmania are the largest shale deposits in Australia. The absence of a &#39;central refinery makes it necessary for every company engaged in the production of petrol from shale to establish its own distillery at a cost probably as great, or even greater, than that of the plant required for the treatment of crude oil. The pioneers of this industry deserve better treatment than has so farbeen given to them. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators supporting the Government make no attempt to hide it. The Shell Company of Australia Limited, which is one of the major oil companies and which opposed the granting of tariff assistance to the producers of bitumen, demands cash for petrol supplied to resellers, yet I have been informed that the same company made a loan of &#163;50,000,000 to Germany just prior to the outbreak of war. Is it because the company is afraid the British Empire will lose the war that it demands cash for petrol supplied to resellers? What has been the attitude of the major oil companies in regard to the petrol rationing scheme? What assistance have they given to this nation in its time of peril? ls it not a fact that when they were asked to assist this Government and the nation by building up reserves of petrol they neglected to do so? Is it not also a fact that the intensified restrictions which have been imposed on the use of petrol to-day have become necessary largely as the result of the failure of the major oil companies to build up these reserves! The whole history of the petrol rationing scheme in Australia does not reflect credit on the Government. Is it not true that the major oil companies, which have preyed on the people of this country for many years, demanded  guarantees  from the Government in respect of any reserves which they might establish? I would have no objection to the granting of guarantees if the major oil companies had played their part in the war effort of the nation, but they have not done so. When the new cartel system was about to be formed, the major oil companies advertised extensively suggesting to their clients the advantage of storing petrol, not with the object of building up reserve stocks of petrol to assist primary producers and the industries of this country, hut in order that, when the cartel was formed, they would be able to produce figures to show that they should get a larger quota than the independent companies. Since the commencement of the war the price of petrol in Sydney has been increased from ls. 9d. to 2s. 6d. a gallon. Of that increase, the major oil companies receive 4d. Since the introduction of the rationing scheme the normal consumption of petrol has fallen from 30,000,000 gallons a month to 12,000,000 gallons a month. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I shall give some of the facts. It is admitted that the consumption of petrol in Australia, to-day is being reduced to 12,000,000 gallons monthly. That is the objective being aimed at by the Government. Various excuses have been advanced from time to time in order to justify the rationing of petrol. First, we were told that petro&#93; must he rationed in order to conserve dollar exchange. Then, the reason given was that insufficient tankers were available to bring our normal requirements of petrol to this country. At that time, however, a fleet of tankers was lying idle at Singapore. The real reason for the introduction of the present scheme of petrol rationing will possibly be revealed when a full inquiry is made into the interests which are now pushing the sale of producer-gas units. Let me analyse the increase of 4d. a gallon now received by the major oil companies. As a tanker holds 3,000,000 gallons of petrol, an increase of 4d. a gallon works out at a total increase of &#163;50,000 on a tanker of petrol. As most of these companies own their own tankers, 1 fail to see how they are faced with any additional charges in respect of transport. I admit, of course, that something must be allowed in respect of increased insurance risks, but, after apportioning &#163;10,000 in respect of that item, which is a very high estimate, the major oil companies are receiving an additional &#163;40,000 for every tanker of petrol brought to Australia. Thus, they are better off financially under petrol rationing than when they were supplying our normal petrol requirements. Further, each company does not bring its tankers to its own particular depots. For instance, if a tanker is about to arrive, say, in Fremantle, it unloads its petrol at that port whether it be Texaco, Vacuum or &#39;Shell petrol. Actually, therefore, one grade of petrol is being handled, and let me say in passing that it is a very poor grade that is now being retailed to the Australian public. </para>

                            <para>- The overhead costs of the oil companies have been reduced by 50 per cent. They have taken their travellers off the roads, and have ceased advertising. To-day, wo do not see in the press, or hear over the air, advertisements &#39; of the various oil companies, which, before the introduction of petrol rationing, were to be seen and heard everywhere. In view of this reduction of their overhead costs in relation to their increased profits, it must be admitted that the part that these companies are playing in our war effort, when the nation is in peril, is most discreditable to them. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that this matter has been brought up in the Senate to-day because, as honorable senators are aware, it is now under the consideration of Cabinet, and thus, at this juncture, I am unable to make as full and complete a reply to the honorable senator as I should like. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> made his application for protection of bitumen manufactured in this country, in the first place, to the Tariff Board. That was before the war. I can well imagine that in peace-time such an industry would probably have been very well worth fostering. In any case, in normal times, it would be a matter almost entirely for the determination of the Tariff Board, because over a long period of years governments have established the practice of accepting the recommendations of that board on matters of this kind which are referred to it for investigation. Unfortunately, however, we have since become involved in war, and what in peace-time may have seemed to be a very desirable industry, must now be examined from an entirely different angle. Further, with the progress of the war, a considerable change has taken place in the attitude of the Government towards the establishment of industries generally. That, of course, is due to the fact that, apart altogether from the economics of a project, we must now decide whether or not it is necessary in order to make our war effort as a &#34;whole more effective. Consequently, an entirely new set of conditions has arisen since this application was first referred to the Tariff Board. We are gradually, though not too gradually, increasing our war effort. Indeed, some competent people have said that, in view of our limited resources, we are working with surprising rapidity. One of the responsibilities with which this Government is charged is to decide first of all whether we are capable of maintaining at peace-time level many of the industries which have been established in time of peace. Then, we have to decide what industries that we now lack are necessary for the full development of our war effort. It is on that basis, in a general way, that the question of establishing the bitumen industry in Australia has to be considered. The honorable senator mentioned certain figures in regard to bitumen. Of course those figures were submitted before high costs were incurred owing to increased transport and other charges. I do not think that the honorable senator himself would suggest that the company could operate on the costs originally submitted to the Tariff Board. He must recognize, as I am sure the promoters of this company do, that owing to the large increase of the costs of raw material, whatever manufacturing costs might be, the price of the resultant product must be very substantially increased. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure thai the Tariff Board took into consideration all evidence submitted to it, but unfortunately this is a progressive matter, and what may be entirely correct at one point. may change very rapidly as the war proceeds. It is well known that freight charges, insurance rates, and other such costs are continually increasing as the difficulty in obtaining shipping space becomes more acute. Consequently, it cannot be suggested that bitumen produced to-day could be sold at the price originally submitted to the Tariff Board. Another point which we must consider is that the proposition is based on the assumption that the raw material would be obtained from the United States of America. That, of course, would involve us in dollar exchange liability, whereas a great proportion of the bitumen brought into this country recently was obtained from sterling countries, thus avoiding increased dollar exchange commitments. Another factor which is of some importance is that considerably less bitumen is now being used than was used in peace-time. </para>

                            <para>- That is just what I am saying. It is well that the Senate should be informed in regard to the proposition made by that person. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig,</inline> in collaboration with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> made an application for permission to form a company, he claimed that he had a tie-up with a certain Californian company for the sup ply of raw material. He laid great stress on the necessity for such a tie-up, and suggested that a company would be greatly handicapped in this country without some security in regard to the supply of raw material. Unfortunately for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig,</inline> the tie-up which he had at the time of his application has been discontinued. </para>

                            <para>- That may be the cause, but the fact remains that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> does not now have that tie-up. Secondly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> claimed that he also had a tie-up with another company named the Signal Oil Company, and I understand that that arrangement also has been departed from. It can be seen, therefore, that the advantageous position which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> claimed to be in when his application was first made no longer exists. Furthermore, it is well that the Senate should know the type of prospectus which was submitted to the Capital Issues Advisory Board along with the application. The suggestion was that it should be a company of 390,000 shares of &#163;1, which would be offered to the public, and 200,000 deferred shares of1s. Obviously that suggestion would not appeal to a competent Capital Issues Advisory Board. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever alteration has since been made, that was the original proposition. I suggest that the proposal savours very much of company flotation by promoters who are not concerned in the national interest, but rather are anxious to get a rake-off for themselves. Strong objection was taken to that aspect of the matter. The honorable senator claims that the proposal has been varied, but I have no information in that regard. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> was written to and asked to put up a new proposal, but I was informed to-day by my officers that no other proposal has been received from him. Whatever the facts&#39; may be in that connexion, the conditions which I have outlined were contained in the original proposal, and it was in these circumstances that the Capital Issues Advisory Board refused the application in November of last year. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> was not prepared to accept that refusal, and he then applied to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden).</inline> Since then, a good deal of discussion has taken place in respect, to this matter but, owing to the changed conditions in which we find ourselves in this country, what may have been desirable in peace-time may very well be regarded as completely undesirable in war-time. </para>

                            <para>- The board made a decision on the prospectus submitted with the application. I know from my experience in connexion with the establishment of munitions factories that, during this critical period, many factors occur which&#39; cannot be ignored. Owing to the extreme urgency of the situation and the continued drain on our resources, it is not possible for us to establish many factories which in peace-time might be considered desirable. For instance, the company which it was proposed to float would require a great deal of plant and we should have to look very carefully into our material and engineering resources to ascertain whether, in view of our more urgent munitions requirements, we could allow such plant to be made available. I have in mind a project which was only recently considered by the Government, and which it had to turn down completely on the score that it could not reduce- productive capacity for the manufacture of the necessary plant because the available man-power was needed for the production of munitions. Honorable senators will realize that the Government has a considerable number of projects in view, including its shipbuilding programme, which is throwing on our engineering resources a great strain, which we are trying to relieve by the expenditure of large sums of money in setting up government factories. I repeat that the matter raised this afternoon is still under the consideration of the Government. I have endeavoured to indicate to honorable senators some of the factors which must receive serious consideration before a final decision can be reached. </para>

                        <para>.-I listened with interest to the speech by the Minister for Munitions <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride),</inline> and agree that the circumstances in regard to this application are substantially as has been stated by him. When it was represented to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> that the original prospectus provided for the issue of 200,000 shares at1s. each, he said that that could be completely eliminated, because he was anxious to get on with the work. The Capital Issues Advisory Board has on three occasions authorized the issue of deferred shares by other companies. Craig had a connexion with two oil companies in the United States of America and on three trips to America he expended &#163;5,000. One of his engineers, when on his way back to Australia, travelled with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Brookes of. Melbourne, and then an application was made by the group with which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Brookes was associated in order to &#34; crib &#34; Craig&#39;s oil supply. Another application then had to be made, and, when it went, before the Capital Issues Advisory Board, there was also an application by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bertram</inline> Stevens, of New South Wales, who represented a group which 1 contend purloined Craig&#39;s brain and organizing ability by taking from him his oil connexion. In certain correspondence which I shall give to the Minister, there is a statement in a letter written to the Signal Oil Company, in which that company was told &#34; not to waste its time with Craig, because he had no political pull &#34;. The Minister will find something on the file to substantiate my remarks. </para>

                    <para class="block">Negotiations have been in progress for nineteen months, and practically every member of the Cabinet has had the matter placed before him. On three occasions, Craig was in a position to carry out his project, but under the law as it stands, a new company cannot be launched unless its formation is authorized by the Capital Issues Advisory Board.. With that legislation I am in entire agreement, but I suggest that muddling has occurred in connexion with this case during the last nineteen months. </para>
                    <para>It is claimed that Craig&#39;s proposition is economically sound. Ordinarily, the policy of this Government has been to give effect to recommendations of the Tariff Board. The fact that the board reported in favour of the proposal is one reason why the Government should grant the company&#39;s application. Another strong reason is that oil tankers are not readily available. Assuming that the application is granted, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> will have to leave immediately for the United States of America, and he could do nothing in the matter unless a supply of tankers was assured. I suggest that Craig, not the Government, must accept all responsibility in regard to tankers. I have made at least five attempts to see the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in regard to this matter, and I protest against the great difficulty which private members have experienced in interviewing the heads of rais and other governments. The  Clerk  of the Senate typed a memorandum which was sent to the ex-Prime Minister, seeking permission for me to interview him for five minutes, but five months elapsed before I was able to have a word with him. Ministers should see that their officers are instructed that senators and members at least should have priority of access to members of the Cabinet. The ex-Prime Minister undertook to consider this matter carefully. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> telegraphed to me yesterday as follows: - </para>

                            <para>- I contend that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig&#39;s</inline> proposal is economically sound. Crude oil could be obtained from America and refined in Australia, and the petrol that would be produced is badly needed in this country. The refinery could be adapted for the treatment of oil from the various oil shale fields in New South Wales. Therefore, the whole case in favour of the proposal is sound. It is regrettable that the matter has been bandied from board to board, from minister to minister, and even from Cabinet to Cabinet. There has been such a game of battledore and shuttlecock that it is not surprising that the applicant is sore over the matter. </para>

                    <para>SenatorFRASER (Western Australia) &#91;4.6&#93;. - This discussion to-day has given to honorable senators an opportunity to see the inner workings of the Capital Issues Advisory Board and also to discuss the report of the Tariff Board which inquired into the position of the proposed company. In the light of that report, which is dated the 8th May last, and of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> has said this afternoon, it would appear that the Government has attached more importance to the evidence of the major oil companies than to the statements made by the applicants. </para>

                    <para>SenatorFRASER. - If that be the only reason for refusing the application, why the delay in arriving at a decision? Is it necessary to hold up the application for several months? The reasons for not granting the application are based on evidence submitted by the oil companies. The Minister referred to deferred shares in the proposed company. If the Government were disposed to refuse the proposed company&#39;s application because of some difficulty in connexion with its deferred shares, the Government could have asked it to confine itself to certain requirements before the application was granted. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the point. I have risen in support not of the proposed company, but of a principle. 1 want to know the reason for the Government being unable to come to a decision in this matter. Senators Ashley and Keane have told us that, because of the delay on the part of the Government in coming to a decision after it had received the Tariff Board&#39;s report, this man had lost his connexion with certain Californian companies. I regard the report of the Tariff Board as the opinion of an impartial body which has no axe to grind. After reading the Tariff Board&#39;s report I am of the opinion that the Government has given undue weight to the evidence of the oil companies and has ignored certain references in the report. I wish to make it clear that I do not know this proposed company, and am not in any way connected with it; but I am convinced that the Government has left itself open to criticism because of its failure to come to a decision. I cannot see any reason why a decision could not have been reached long ago. </para>

                        <para>.- I should not have risen to participate in this debate were it not that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley,</inline> in referring to the prices of petrol since the outbreak of Avar, made statements which are demonstrably false. In days like these, it is undesirable that an honorable senator, or indeed any person, should endeavour to create in the public mind the impression that large companies - oil companies and others - are making profits out of the war, which, in fact, they are not making. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> said that since the outbreak of war the price of petrol had risen by 8d. a gallon. He conceded . that 4d. of that increase represented additional duties, but he endeavoured to have the Senate believe that a big proportion of the other 4d. found its way into the pockets of the petrol companies in the form of profits. The Joint Committee on Profits, of which I am the  chairman,  called before it the Prices Commissioner, who gave evidence on this very matter. In view of what has been said here to-day I propose to read to the Senate from the report of his evidence. </para>

                        <para>The other 4d. is due to increased landed costs in the main, but not altogether. When I refer to landed costs I mean the average increase for all importations of petrol on landing in Australia. We have had a check made. Apart from the fact that we obtained returns from the companies, we know the gold price and the general changes of the cost of tankers and freight to Australia so we know that the landed cost in Australia should be going up by a certain amount. Having checked these returns we are satisfied that they are correct, and that the increase in the landed cost is in accordance with the figures given in them. I am not at liberty to say what is the increase in the landed cost, but I may say that when we allowed the rise of 4d. last March - before which date it was 3d. - the rise in the landed cost was at least 4d. </para>

I am merely quoting from sworn evidence of a responsible officer who is employed in the very important task of controlling and fixing prices in this country. A statement has been made in the Senate this afternoon which was intended to suggest that the major oil companies got, if not the whole, at any rate the major portion, of the increasedprice of 4d. a gallon. </para>

I am still far from satisfied, and I have no intention of being satisfied until the position is cleared up. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> says that the evidence which he is reading was given in public and in the presence of representatives of the press. If the honorable senator quotes from any document it is within the province of any honorable senator to rise in his place and demand that the document from which the honorable senator has quoted be laid upon the table and become the property of the Senate. So that it may not be further quoted from, I now propose to take action under the Standing Orders to have the document impounded. </para>

                            <para>- The Prices Commissioner, and many other learned gentlemen, expressed very definite opinions in  1931  concerning the financial proposals of the then Government. Today, the same gentleman, when giving evidence before Parliamentary committees admit that they were then not right. A little while hence, we may find that the evidence submitted by the Prices Commissioner or some other expert witness before the Joint Committee on Profits are not quite right. We have had evidence from statisticians to show that the cost of living in the United States of America has risen by about  2  per cent., but American information discloses that the cost of living in that country has risen almost out of control. So great has been the increase that legislation has recently been introduced into the Congress of the United States of America to peg commodity prices. Subsequent investigation frequently proves that figures submitted by experts to prove what they regard to be facts are often incorrect. The figures produced by the Prices Commissioner show that freights form a. very large proportion of the increase of the landed  cost  of petrol. But, actually, what is the position of the major oil companies in this respect? Figures have been produced to show that freight costs of these companies have increased by almost  32  per cent. I should say, that all of the tankers that are used by the Shell Company of Australia Limited, for instance, are owned by that company or chartered by it for long periods. Thus, any increase in respect of freight is merely a book entry, and like so many book entries, is used simply to mislead the Prices Commissioner. </para>

However, in this matter it has once more run true to its form of the last few years, and has again exhibited its incapacity to make decisions, right or wrong. Ministers appear to fear that as any decision they might come to might be wrong, they should come to no decision. Consequently, we have witnessed contradictory pronouncements on all matters of major importance. For instance, contradictory statements have been made from time to time with regard to petrol rationing. The </para>

It is- a sorry day for this country, particularly in a time of war, when the Government cannot come to decisions on important matters. I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Craig  would have been pleased to have got a decision favorable or unfavorable, twelve months ago. He would thus have been enabled to save, not only considerable time, but also a large sum of money, which he has been obliged to waste in endeavouring to force a conclusion, one way or the other. The Minister has failed to justify the extraordinary delay that has occurred in this matter. His main point was that special consideration had to be given to this application. He said that even some existing industries might have to be abandoned because they might not be deemed by the Government to be essential industries. We can understand that point of view, but when we hear so much talk of a total war effort- </para>

                            <para>- The Minister said that in view of the need to prosecute our war effort to the full, even some existing industries might have to be abandoned. If the term &#34; total war effort&#34; offends the Minister, I substitute the term, maximum war effort; although I feel that it cannot rightly be described as such. The term is used purely as fodder for the newspapers. For instance, what percentage of the people one sees daily in Pitt-street and Martin-place, Sydney, is engaged in productive work? How many of them are still employed in parasitical occupations? If the Government were sincere in its talk of a maximum war effort it is time it transferred the thousands of able-bodied men and women, who are not yet engaged in productive work, to essential industries. Until it does so, it cannot say that it is making a maximum war effort. However, it has no intention of doing that, because such action would cut across the interests of certain of its friends. The Minister also said that, owing to changed circumstances, this proposed company could not now produce bitumen at the cost it originally claimed. </para>

                            <para>- But is it not also apparent that the price of imported bitumen is increasing ? And does not that fact balance the increase of the cost of producing bitumen in this country? Indeed, it can safely be said that the cost of imported bitumen will rise much more rapidly than the cost of the local product. That must be so if we take into consideration only the war insurance risk now payable in respect of imported bitumen. The Minister also said that bitumen is not used nearly so much as formerly. I agree that that is so. However, if we made a maximum war effort in the direction of constructing strategic roads, we should require twice as much bitumen as we use in peace-time. Indeed, if we constructed only the strategic road connecting Darwin with the south of Australia, as it should be constructed, we should require all of the bitumen we could import, or manufacture, to-day. The final point made by the Minister was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> had refused to give to the Government information concerning the American contacts, from whom he was to obtain crude oil if given permission by the Government to import it. In view of the fact that during the .last nineteen months, two American business interests which were to supply the crude oil were lost to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig,</inline> because of the vaccilation  of the Government in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> was justified in refusing to give that information. There was a danger that such information would be bandied around the corridors of Parliament, and other gentlemen might take advantage of it, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bertram</inline> Stevens and his friends took advantage of similar information twelve months ago. Thus, there was a danger that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig&#39;s</inline> project would have been undermined, or taken over by certain influential friends of the Government. The Minister also suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig&#39;s</inline> proposal regarding deferred shares savoured of a rake-off. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig&#39;s</inline> commercial reputation is sound. </para>

However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> has mentioned at least three cases of that kind in which the Capital Issues Advisory Board gave permission for the issue of capital. Therefore, the Government believed in deferred shares particularly, when there was no danger that the interests of the major oil companies, or monopolies, in this country would be affected. </para>

                            <para>- He said that they were demonstrably false. I maintain that no answer has been given either by the Minister for Munitions . <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride),</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> to my allegations. I still contend that, on the basis of an increase of income of 4d. a gallon, the major oil companies are making an additional profit of &#163;40,000 on each tanker of petrol arriving in Australia, that is, after allowing a sum of &#163;10,000 in respect of increased costs. However, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> pointed out, the majority of the major oil companies own their own tankers, and, therefore, are not at the mercy of the shipping companies which have sky-rocketed freights. In those circumstances, the estimate of &#163;10,000 in respect of additional transport charges is very liberal. I do not retract one word of my earlier remarks. These companies are receiving an additional profit of &#163;40,000 on each tanker of petrol arriving in Australia. On the basis of a monthly consumption of 12,000,000 gallons, that represents approximately an increased profit of &#163;160,000 a month. I do not know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> personally, he is probably better known to the Minister, and other honorable senators, than he is to me. I met him on a couple of occasions, when he supplied me with certain particulars. However, apart from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig,</inline> 1 was requested by an officer of the Government of New South Wales to endeavour to find out the reason for the delay in granting permission for the establishment of this industry. Naturally, I consider it to be my duty as a representative of the people of that State to ascertain the reason. It should be known to the Minister and to the Government. Yet, when I asked questions on this matter previously, the only . reply the Minister gave was that the Cabinet was still considering it. The Government should make a decision as soon as possible. Whether the decision does or does not favour the proposition is not the point. I want some finality in the matter, and so do those who wish to form a company. The information upon which I have based my case to-day is contained in the following statement: - </para>

                    <para class="block">In October, 1938, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> A. Craig returned from a visit to the United States of America with the object of establishing an oil refinery, having as its primary purpose the production of bitumen. Australia&#39;s requirements of bitumen total 140,000 tons per annum, and it was with the object of meeting Australia&#39;s requirements that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> proposed the establishment of the oil refinery. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> visited Canberra in October, 1938, and, during an interview with Customs officials, received encouragement in support of the establishing of the undertaking. During <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig&#39;s</inline> visit to America, he interested certain independent American oil interests, who sent experts to Australia to investigate the proposal. These experts endorsed the soundness and economics of the proposal and their principals eventually decided to subscribe half of the required capital. In the meantime the Capital Issues Advisory Board was formed, and immediate application was made to it for consent to register  a company. The fullest information was made available to the Capital Issues Advisory Board, and although no definite advice was received regarding their rejection of the proposal, it was ascertained from the then Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> that the reason for the failure to grant consent was on account of the proposition being economically unsound. The American interests, after waiting many months to get approval, were so disgusted with the delay- that they withdrew from the proposition. </para>
                    <para>A second group of oil interests in America was then interested, who despatched experts to Australia. They also agreed as to the soundness of the proposition. The principals of the second group of American oil companies agreed to find capital and provide technical assistance and make available plans for the building of the refinery. They also undertook to make ample quantities of crude oil available. </para>
                    <para>The second group of experts who visited Australia happened to travel on the same boat as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Brookes, and, as a result, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Brookes was acquainted with the mission of the American technicians. As a result of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Brookes&#39;s  interest in the proposal, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bertram</inline> Stevens, former Premier of New South Wales, was introduced to the Americans, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bertram</inline> advised that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> Craig had no political pull and therefore would never receive permission to form a company. </para>
                    <para>The American interests then called upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> and his associate in the venture, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Butters, and inquired whether they were in a position to form the proposed company. They were forced to admit that the company could not be formed until such time as consent to register was obtained from the Capital Issues Advisory Board. The American interests then decided that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bertram</inline> Stevens was the man who could get finality and an arrangement was made whereby <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bertram</inline> Stevens made an application to the Capital Issues  Advisory Board for permission to register a company along lines similar to those originally submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig.</inline></para>
                    <para>Within a period of four weeks, the application was granted, but was subsequently withdrawn when it was discovered that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig,</inline> who had made a prior application, still had his application on the file and that it had not been disposed of. </para>
                    <para>Bound about this time, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay,</inline> as Minister for Customs, referred the question relating to bitumen production to the Tariff Board for inquiry and report. The Board&#39;s report, which was presented in June of this year, after a delay of seven months had elapsed, introduced the proposals of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig,</inline> and substantiated all claims made by him. Since the presentation of the report in June last, most Cabinet Ministers have been interviewed in the vain hope that the new industry might be allowed to getunder way. </para>
                    <para>After the board&#39;s report was received a letter was written to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> from the Capital Issues Advisory Board, suggesting that he make a new application for permission to register and that the fullest information be furnished relating to the American suppliers of oil, the names of overseas firms likely to be interested in the proposal, so that the information could be made to the Oil Advisory Committee. As the members of that committee are associated with various interests associated with the oil industry, and naturally opposed to any new refinery in Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Craig</inline> declined to furnish the information sought and referred the Capital Issues Advisory Board to his original application. Had the Capital Issues Advisory Board not stopped the establishment of the refinery, production would have been commenced in November of last year, and the through-put of the refinery would have been 20,000,000 gallons of petrol per annum. Employment would have been found for 300 men and there would have been effected a saving in overseas exchange of over &#163;1,000,000 per annum. </para>
                    <para class="block">I have no personal interest whatever in this matter. &#34;My only concern is that encouragement should be given to those who are trying to alleviate hardship caused by petrol rationing. The cost of  providing retorts for the production of oil fuel from shale and coal would probably be double that of the plant necessary for this project. I ask the Government to give immediate consideration to this matter and to facilitate the inauguration of this industry in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>-  I rise to a point of order. During the period in which the  Deputy President  occupied the chair this afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> something occurred which will place a joint committee of this Parliament in an extraordinary position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer,</inline> the  chairman  of the Joint Committee on Profits, has had his copy of the evidence of that committee impounded. The file of documents contains information which he requires in order that the inquiries of the committee, may proceed. I should like to know what steps are necessary for him to regain the papers which have been laid on the table of the Senate. </para>

The various patriotic funds in Australia have been established for the specific purpose of aiding men of the fighting forces by supplying additional clothing, comforts, &#38;c, which otherwise they may have no opportunity of obtaining. It ls understood that in all principal ports in Australia institutes conducted for the benefit of visiting merchant seamen and maintained through the generosity of the public provide meals at a nominal rate and arrange for the entertainment of seamen while their ships are in port. </para>

                            <para>. - I do not desire to oppose the motion, for I am rather in agreement with it, but, in my opinion, it is somewhat invidious to select one section of the fighting services for special congratulation to the exclusion of others. Whilst I recognize their wonderful gallantry, the men at Tobruk have been relieved from time to time. Other members of the Australian Imperial Force have been through the Libyan campaign and have also served in Greece and Crete. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with the motion now before the Senate, and, whilst I recognize, that the men of Tobruk have been through hell, it seems to be not in the best interests of the fighting services to select those men for special congratulation by this Parliament. I should like a message to be sent to the whole of the fighting services, recognizing their glorious deeds and paying a tribute to them for their gallantry. </para>

                        <para>. - It has been frequently said that one of the difficulties of the Opposition arises from the fact that it is expected to oppose every proposal submitted by the Government. I have never conceived it to be my duty to adopt that policy invariably, and my brief remarks on this motion will be offered, not for opposition&#39;s sake, but because, in my opinion, I am called upon to discuss the statement presented by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride).</inline> Although I do not wish to be unkind to the </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Minister, who was faced with the duty of reading the statement prepared for him, I do not think I can be accused of using extravagant language when I say that there was little of value to any of us in the statement. Practically everything in it had already been read by us in the press. It contained certain comments, which, of course, we could not have read, .but those were merely comments by officials. It seems to me that the statement would not have <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> presented to us except for the fact that the Government had no other business to place , before the Senate. I do not object to Parliament being called together, because it had decided to reassemble not later than the 17th September, but the Government should see that we have work to do when we meet. </para>
                    <para>I was delighted, as I am sure every other member of the Opposition was, to notice that Australia is extending its reciprocal diplomatic and trade relations with other countries. That is one of the most gratifying developments in connexion with the national Parliament in recent years. I welcome the fact because I have always held the opinion that along that pathway lies an immediate better understanding of other countries and their problems, as well as a better understanding on their part of us and our problems. Ultimately, the extension of our friendly relations will result, I believe, in such a wide acceptance of the principles of democracy and democratic institutions that we sha.ll approach nearer than ever to a state of universal brotherhood, and eventually achieve the complete outlawry of war. </para>
                    <para>I was interested in some of the remarks of the Minister regarding our relations with Russia. I was pleased to note the admirable references to the remarkable fight that Russia is putting up against the common enemy. .We all hope that its efforts, together with those of Great Britain and the great republic of the United States of America, as well as the other countries that are holding out in the hope of being able to render some assistance to the cause of the democracies, will be crowned with success. Our great need at the moment is additional allies. We should not imagine that, because a country may hold a certain political faith, it cannot render assistance to our cause. We in Australia stand for the British and democratic way of life, but we have no right to criticize another country&#39;s way of life merely because it happens to differ from our own. I hope that ere long we shall see consular representatives of Russia in Australia, and that Australia will be similarly represented in Russia. We should do all we possibly can to promote friendly relations with the people of Russia, and with any other country that is prepared to join the democratic cause. While the present Government remains in office it should not attempt to fill in gaps by the introduction of statements of this kind which can be of no real value to the country. As far as the hurly-burly of politics permits, the Government should arrange that, when the Parliament is called together, business is placed before it. </para>

                        <para>. - The statement under consideration contains nothing which has not already been published in the newspapers. In presenting a statement of this nature to the Parliament, the Government should, if possible, say something in addition to what we have read in the press. Everything in the statement has been most carefully censored by officials who, although responsible to the Parliament, are privileged to know a great deal more than are members of the Parliament itself. I wish to direct attention to what is said in this statement in regard to Russia - </para>

                        <para>In this connexion, there is apparently a certain amount of misunderstanding regarding Australia&#39;s formal relations with the Soviet Union. The Government has received many representations suggesting that some specific step, such as exchange of diplomatic representatives with Moscow, should be taken to demonstrate our sympathy and moral solidarity with the Soviet Union in its present struggle. But the real position is perfectly straightforward. The King has been in diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union since 1924, and as is the case with every other European country, Australian representation in Russia is effected through the medium of the British Diplomatic and consular representatives. </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia should have direct representation in Russia. If it is considered necessary to have direct representation  in the United States of America, Japan, Canada, China and Great Britain, it follows that it will be an advantage to have direct representation in Russia rather than that our representation in that country should be through the medium of the British Diplomatic and Consular Service. Officials of that service are not responsible to this Parliament. If we allow such a position to remain unchallenged, these representatives, acting on their own responsibility and without any consultation at all with this Parliament or with the government of this country, may do and say whatever they consider fit, in the name of Australia. That is a most undesirable state of affairs, and this &#39; Parliament should not allow it to exist. Nor should it allow a statement of this kind to go unchallenged. If the British Diplomatic and Consular representatives wish to apeak in the name of Australia they should do so only after consultation with, and with the approval of, the Parliament of this country. The principle laid down here is one which Australia has challenged from its earliest days of settlement. We challenge a state of affairs which permits persons who owe no allegiance to Australia, and are not directly responsible to this Parliament, to make statements on behalf of Australia. I cannot see any justification for being satisfied with a state of affairs which means that Australia speaks only through the medium of the British Diplomatic and Consular Service. I suggest that that service represents interests which are not only different from, but in many important ways, are also in direct conflict with the interests of Australia. That is the only point in this statement to which I desire to direct attention; but it is a matter of outstanding importance. </para>
                    <para>I express the hope - it may be a vain hope - that in future we shall be told more about the war than hithherto we have been told in this Parliament. I have received communications from various sources which are most disquieting, in that they indicate that things are not going as well as ministerial statements would lead us to believe. The Government has nothing to lose by taking the Parliament into its confidence. &#34;We have had secret sittings of senators and members, but most of what we have been told on those occasions had already appeared in the press. The fact is that this Parliament is subject to the control of the censors. That may be regarded by some as a statesmanlike attitude to adopt, but it is not very helpful, and the Government has no reasonable ground for objecting if suspicion which it finds hard to allay is aroused. </para>

Of course, the Royal Commission did not use the word &#34; shall &#34;. What right has any commission to lay down the financial policy of the Government?

                            <para>- That is what the royal commission to which I have referred did. On the evidence presented to that royal commission, which was presided over by a judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia - a gentleman with a high reputation as an authority on constitutional matters - the commission reported that the Commonwealth Bank can lend money to the Commonwealth Government free of interest. The only objection to implementing that proposal is that the commission did not say that the Commonwealth Bank &#34; shall &#34; do so. That is an absurd argument. </para>

                            <para>- -The Commonwealth is spending thousands of pounds in an effort to convince the people of Australia that if they do not subscribe to war loans, the output of munitions will be adversely affected. Nothing could be more absurd. The total supply of gold in the world was estimated at, $14,000,000,000 in 1939. Most of that gold was held by the United States of America, Great Britain and France, although Belgium, Holland and other small countries held various small amounts. But theremarkable thing is that Germany. Italy and Japan had not gold resourcesequal to those possessed by the  small nnation  of Switzerland. Surely that proves that wars are not won with money. The Battle of Waterloo has not .yet been paid for. At the Loan Council meeting, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fadden</inline> made it appear that money had to be conserved in order that the war may be won. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Brown, who is a most capable man, told the Loan Council that the Commonwealth Bank &#34;can&#34; advance &#163;25,000,000 for the requirements of the States, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fadden</inline> =aid: &#34;No; we want the money for the prosecution df the war&#34;. </para>

                            <para>- The people should know what national credit really means. Unfortunately, many members of Parliament have only a kindergarten knowledge of the subject. In trying to placate both Government supporters and members of the Opposition I am afraid the Treasurer will fall between two fires. For three years I have urged that greater use be made of the national credit of this country, and I have successfully challenged members of the Government to controvert my  statements  in regard to finance generally. Only by the use of the national credit will Australia be saved from financial failure and repudiation. </para>

The cost of living has increased considerably since then. A recent award of the Arbitration Court in Western Australia fixed the basic wage in that State at &#163;4 10s. 5d.

                        <para>. - I desire to make a few remarks regarding the sustenance allowance paid to discharged members of the fighting forces and to draw attention to the unsatisfactory treatment meted out to some of these young men. Although the Government is giving consideration to this matter it does not appear to be getting anywhere. I wish to refer particularly to the plight of young men who joined the Australian Imperial Force and, after having served for a considerable time in Australia, particularly in Northern Australia, have been invalided home and discharged. They are given about a fortnight&#39;s pay and are then left to look after themselves, even though their physical condition renders them unable to work. To give the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collett),</inline> who is himself a returned soldier from the last war, some insight of the conditions under which these men exist to-day, I propose to read an extract from a newspaper report of a returned soldiers&#39; meeting which was held in Burnie recently. The report is as follows: - </para>

                        <para>At a meeting of the Returned Soldiers&#39; League at Burnie last night, concern was expressed at the plight of a soldier discharged as medically unfit after a year and 40 days&#39; service, most of which bad been spent in Northern Australia. It was stated that, because he had not served overseas, he was not entitled to sustenance, nor could he become a member of the league. He was in hospital as a result of an illness contracted while in the military forces as a member of the Australian Imperial Force, it was claimed. . . . The soldier was discharged with 12 days&#39; pay. . . . Several members said they understood that, in a recent announcement by the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> it had been made clear that Australian Imperial Force men serving in Northern Australia were on the same basis as those who served overseas. They could not understand the local case in the light of that statement. </para>

                    <para class="block">After seeing that report I made some investigations and ascertained that this man was regarded by the authorities as ineligible for admission to a Repatriation Hospital and had to be admitted to the Launceston General Hospital. Although he was very sick, he was compelled to travel across Bass Strait on a second-class pass whilst strong and healthy officers were allowed to travel first class. People complain that even sick soldiers are not allowed to travel first class because they might mix with the officers. I do not say that that is the reason why this man was given a second-class pass, but I do say that it is scandalous that sick men should be denied the best of accommodation. If a man enlists in the Australian Imperial Force and before he&#39; leaves Australia has to be discharged on account of ill health, he should be granted sustenance on the same basis as that granted to those who are discharged after serving overseas. It is no fault of the soldier that the military authorities have kept him in Australia. The Minister for Repatriation said yesterday that sustenance of ?2 a week will be paid to cx-soldiers on their return from overseas if they are discharged physically unfit and - are unable to work. Sustenance on that scale is not always paid. Recently an ex-soldier approached me and asked me if I could find him a job. He told me that he was a married man with four or five children, and had just returned to Australia and had been discharged from the Army. He was in ill health and had been advised by his doctor not to work until he had regained his strength. This man was granted a sustenance allowance of 12s. 6d. a week, on which he was expected to keep himself, his wife and his family. He said that if I could find him light work he would sooner do it and die on the job than try to exist on 12s. 6d. a week. Feeling sorry for him, I succeeded in placing him in employment in a flax mill, where his services are giving satisfaction. </para>
                    <para>During the last few weeks, income tax has been deducted from the pay of mar 1&#39;led soldiers, with three or more children, in military camps in Tasmania. Evidently the Commissioner of Taxation received from the Government instructions to take into account payments of child endowment. This action causes severe hardship. Privates with one child or two children, are not affected; but a private with three children pays from 2s. to 3s. a fortnight, whilst a man with six children pays about 10s. a fortnight. So far as I am aware, such deductions are illegal. The statement which the Minister made to the Senate yesterday may remedy the position, but I ask him to make further inquiries and ensure that all of the moneys which were illegally collected in this manner are refunded to the troops. In. addition, the men should not be under the obligation to make application to the department in order to secure refunds. Many of them probably threw away the stamps when they received them and the law provides that no refund shall he made unless the stamps are produced. .1 urge the Minister to give immediate attention to the subjects that I have raised. </para>
