                    <para>. - It is with great regret that I announce to the Senate the death in Brisbane on the 1st October of ex-Senator the Honorable John Mullan. The deceased was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Charters Towers in February, 1908, and again in October, 1909. He was elected to the Senate as a representative of Queensland at the general elections in 1913 and again in 1914, and sat as a senator till 1917. In 1913, while a senator, he was a member of the select committee on the Fitzroy Dock, and in 1914 he was a member of the select committee on the Teasdale Smith contract. In 1918, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly for Queensland for Flinders. He was a Minister without portfolio in the Queensland State Government from October, 1919, to November, 1920, and was Attorney-General for periods extending over eighteen years, from November, 1920, to May, 1929, and from 1932 to November of last year. He was a life-long personal friend of mine, and I am familiar with his career, both in the Queensland Parliament and in the Commonwealth legislature. He was a remarkable man with regard to the length and the quality of the service he rendered to Australia, and I regret his death not only because I have lost a personal friend, but also because Australia has lost a legislator who served it well. On behalf of the Senate, I extend to the widow and family of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mullan</inline> our sincere sympathy. I move - </para>

                        <para>- The question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is most ill advised at this moment. Surely he does not imagine that the Prime Minister, or other Ministers who may be called upon to deal with these matters, are ignorant of what is going on? If the honorable senator wishes to fan the flames of industrial unrest he is adopting the correct attitude. I can assure him that the Government is seriously concerned with what is taking place, and will do all in its power to end the difficulties, which have not in every case been caused by the men. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to direct a question to you, Mr. President, and with the indulgence of the Senate, to refer to the telegrams sent to honorable senators convening to-day##'##s meeting of the Senate. I direct special attention to the words ##"##for the purpose of granting Supply only ##"## which appeared in the telegram. I do not think that that was a proper notice to send out to honorable senators. How can you, Mr. President, know what business will be dealt with, as, in view of the present constitution of the Senate, other business could be brought forward? I realize that the intimation was made in all kindness, but telegrams so worded are liable to be misunderstood. It could easily be assumed that the intention was to notify honorable senators that only formal business would be dealt with. I suggest that, in future, notices to honorable senators should not be couched in such terms. </para>

The Government proposes that Parliament shall adjourn for three weeks, and on resumption the financial proposals of the Government will be submitted. In the circumstances, a Supply Bill is now introduced to cover requirements for a further two months, November and December. </para>
                    <para>The total amount proposed to be appropriated by this bill is ##£##16,221,000 under the following main heads : - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>With the exception of the Defence provision, the amounts included in the bill are based on rates of expenditure approved in the appropriation for 1940-41. In a number of isolated cases where the expenditure is heavier in the early part of the year the proportion of half of last year##'##s appropriation has been exceeded. This is done only in the cases of services which have already been approved in previous years. </para>
                    <para>The amounts in the bill sought to he appropriated -for defence and war services together with those voted in previous Supply acts, represent the sum which, it is estimated, will be available from revenue receipts for the first half of the year, after making allowance for other commitments. In addition to the Defence expenditure from revenue, there will also be expenditure from loan which will be covered by loan appropriations made and to be made. </para>
                    <para>The form of the proposed defence votes has been altered in accordance with the change proposed in the published Estimates. All the Defence votes have been consolidated in one group instead of appearing in detail as divided between revenue and loan funds. The amount of ##£##93,487,000 for Defence services shown on page 2 of the bill represents the estimated gross defence expenditure for the six months ended the 3lst December, 1941, less the amounts, approximately ##£##13,000,000, already voted from revenue by Supply Acts Nos. 1 and 2. The figure of ##£##82,604,000 represents the proportion of the gross Defence expenditure which will be charged to loan fund. </para>
                    <para>Provision is made under the head ##"## Advance to the Treasurer ##"## for a further ##£##1,000,000, being the total for the six months of ##£##6,000,000. This amount is necessary to meet services which will be covered in the main by other appropriations not yet made. In particular, the heaviest temporary charges to Treasurer##'##s advance are in respect of Commonwealth works and payments to the States, all of which will later be covered by the usual appropriation acts. Except in the case of defence and war services, no provision is made in the bill for any new expenditure. </para>

                    <para class="block">Following the practice observed since the commencement of the war it is necessary to obtain a further appropriation for war expenditure. The purpose of this bill is to obtain an appropriation of ##£##50,000,000 for war expenditure and for the raising of a corresponding amount of loan moneys to finance that expenditure. At the 30th June, 1941, there was a balance of approximately ##£##72,000,000 of loan appropriation. This will suffice to cover the expenditure of this month and part of November. It is essential that a safe margin of parliamentary approval should be available, and the present bill is designed to cover expenditure after that date for a further period within the present financial year. </para>
                    <para>It is estimated that the total war expenditure in 1941-42 from loan will be about ##£##150,000,000. At present, expenditure is averaging about ##£##18,000,000 a month on defence and war services from revenue and loan sources. Of this it is possible to charge an average of about ##£##4,000,000 monthly to revenue. Later in the financial year, when taxation collections are being received in much greater volume, it will be possible to charge a greater proportion of war expenditure to Consolidated Revenue. A schedule showing details of gross war expenditure will be found in pages 40 to 58 of the Estimates as presented by the previous Government. </para>

                            <para>- If we sell inscribed stock we must pay interest; but this Government has a scheme whereby we can obtain the money we require without paying interest. Three years ago, when I urged that the Commonwealth Bank should issue interest-free money, I was told that I was a voice crying in the wilderness. We now hope to see that done. Last night I listened to the broadcast of the big meeting held in the Sydney Town Hall, to launch the ##£##100,000,000 loan. The announcer incorrectly stated that the loan was a conversion loan of ##£##100,000,000. The fact is that whilst ##£##70,000,000 will be converted, ##£##30,000,000 of new money is required. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> tells us in its columns this morning how that money is to be raised, that is, how much has been promised already, and that the banks have kindly consented to convert all of their holdings, and are also prepared to supply any new money required. We know how the banks acquire new money. The previous Government allowed the private banks to provide almost the whole of the first war loan of ##£##20,000,000. We were told that that loan would be raised through the agency of the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks, but when I asked the ex-Treasurer how much was put through the private banks I was refused that information. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gillespie</inline> has ##"## spilled the beans ##"##. When he was speaking to the shareholders of the organization he represents and ##"## cracking up ##"## the patriotism of his bank he said that the first war loan of ##£##20,000,##'##000 was supplied by the private banks. Apparently, nothing went through the Commonwealth Bank at all. This Government is going to put the business through the Commonwealth Bank. Unless one knows how it is done it seems extraordinary that the Australian Mutual Provident Society, for instance, after putting over ##£##3,500,000 into the first loan subscribed ##£##2,500,000, and is also offering to convert all of its stock* I do not believe that any honorable senator thinks for one moment that the Australian Mutual Provident Society, big as  it is, has ##£##6,000,000 to put into war loans in any one year However, I explained this trick on a previous occasion. All that the general manager of the Australian Mutual Provident Society needs to do is to instruct the society##'##s banker to apply for ##£##2,500,000 in the loan. The manager of the bank applies for that holding, and sends a cheque for that amount to the Treasurer. On that subscription the bank draws a commission of nearly ##£##4,000. I have explained before that all applications for war loans carry a commission of 5s. per cent. The bank then holds those bonds as security for the overdraft advanced to the Australian Mutual Provident Society. It can hold as many bonds as it likes, and if it holds them long enough, it can easily transfer them. I am amazed at the small sums which some banks are converting, particularly when we have been told that they have done so much for the country. All government stock and debentures are above par. So it is easy to raise ##£##5,000,000 in government bonds. The banks send a cheque to the Treasury, and then put the bonds on the market when they can reap the enhanced value. That explains to some degree why the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney holds only ##£##1,642,000 for conversion. This year the Australian Mutual Provident Society has subscribed ##£##6,075,405 to government loans. All life assurance offices must satisfy the Government that they have the money. They have not only big revenue but also very high expenses in meeting policies as they mature. I am quite sure that this Government will not give the private banks a chance to create this ##£##30,000,000 out of nothing, and loan it to the nation at 3##½## per cent. interest. That is what has been done in the past. </para>

Of course, the bankcontrolled press can only say what it is allowed to say by the banks, and, apparently, that presshas not yet been allowed to say what I am now saying. It is extraordinary that the private banks subscribed huge sums to the ##£##20,000,000 loan, and yet, when I asked how much of that loan went through the Commonwealth Bank and how much through the private banks, I was told that such particulars could not be disclosed without the permission of the private banks. However, as we know now that the Commonwealth Bank has only ##£##6,186,000 to convert, it did not put through very much. Most of that money, obviously, is held by the private banks. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to show that, at last, heed is being paid towhat I have been saying in this chamber for three years. We shall use the credit of the nation. Even in this time of crisis, banks in England are paying dividends of from 14 to 16 per cent. The  chairman  of directors of one bank in announcing the dividend <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the shareholders said that so high a dividend was possible because the bank was lending hundreds of millions of pounds to the Government. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Simon was asked if he was prepared to alter the charter of the Bank of England, and to say who owned it, and in whose interest it was conducted, he replied ##"## No ##"##. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Kingsley</inline> Wood gave a similar reply to the same question. National credit is not being used in England as we shall use it in Australia. The Bank of England rules Great Britain, as, so far, the banks in Australia have ruled this country. The present Government will, however, alter that state of affiairs.

                    <para class="block">The cost of converting loans is tremendous. Less than two years ago, Tasmania wished to convert a loan of ##£##4,500,000. The Treasurer of that State desired that the conversion be arranged through the Commonwealth Bank, in London, but the Loan Council would not allow that course to be followed; instead, it insisted on the transactions being handled through Nivison and Company, the brokers for  the Australian Government. That procedure cost Tasmania ##£##137,000; and as the loan was of only two years##'## duration, it is probable that a similar amount will have to be paid next January for  a  further conversion. The cost of conversion works out at about 12s. a head of the population of Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>. - I have been attacked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> for something that I said apparently on the 26th June last. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> rebuked me for not having mentioned names. I will now name those whom I charged.  Colonel Chapman  and <inline font-weight="bold">Major MacDonald</inline> were sent back from Gallipoli after thelanding of the 18th Battalion on the 22nd August, 1915. Captain Hinton, the adjutant of the battalion, was sent away from the battalion after we had gone on to the desert of Egypt. I  was  present when Lieutenant Pritchard was stripped of his epaulets and cashiered by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Goodsell</inline> because he was too cowardly to go out reconnoitring. I was one of the members of the reconnoitring party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> says that he has the records, but I was a witness. The men had to get an officer from another battalion, bring <inline font-weight="bold">Major Goodsell</inline> out of the dug-out, and he was then cashiered for cowardice. </para>

                            <para>- I am telling the Senate now. After I returned from the war, I was assured by former members of the 18th Battalion that other officers were also cashiered. </para>

                    <para>If the records of the Department of the Army show that  Colonel Chapman  and <inline font-weight="bold">Major MacDonald</inline> were not cashiered for cowardice, they may show that they were charged with, say, murder, which may have been a more appropriate charge. Probably, I was kind to them. How any honorable senator who was not a member of the battalion, had no knowledge of it and none of whose friends died as the result of the action of officers of that battalion, could say that I have lied, passes my comprehension. More men passed through the l8th Battalionthan through any other battalion which left Australia and only one of them was ever charged with any offence involving dereliction of duty. That man was sentenced to two years##'## imprisonment. It was one of the greatest miscarriages of justice of which I have ever known.  His  dereliction of duty consisted of his failing, when on outpost duty, to hear an officer, who had crept upon him, say, ##"## Are you on your post?##"## Failure to hear was his defence, but he was sentenced in spite of it. Only one man of the 3,000 men in the 18th Battalion is shown by the records to have been charged with a breach of duty. Their officers, however, let them down badly. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> that I shall ask the present Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to check the accuracy of my statements and, if necessary, to have a complete investigation made of the reasons why those officers were cashiered from the 18th Battalion. </para>
