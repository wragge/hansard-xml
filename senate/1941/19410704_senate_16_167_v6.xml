                        <para>- No information has come to hand regarding the statements attributed to the Lord Provost of Edinburgh other than that which has already been published in the press. The honorable senator must realize that it would be quite impossible for this Government to send cablegrams to the British Government to ascertain the accuracy or otherwise of statements made by persons in Scotland or elsewhere. The Government has endeavoured to ascertain from the British Government whether there were any special reasons for the visit of Herr Hess to England, but no additional information has yet been received. </para>

If the honorable senator and others would care at any time to avail themselves of the various channels through which we are able to make information available to the public, the Government would welcome their cooperation. A copy of the speeches to be broadcast would of course have to be submitted for the approval of the broadcasting authorities in exactly the same way as are all other speeches broadcast. </para>

                        <para>. - The Opposition has been prepared to assist to pass legislation which the Government believed was important and somewhat urgent, but after waiting some hours for the Supplementary Estimates we have met now only to adjourn. The Government appears to have become somewhat panicky. Does not the Government know its own business?  A panic-stricken government should not remain in office, but should resign. </para>

                            <para>- That may be, but I am confident that there would have been no holding up of its legislation. It would appear now that, because of the Government's uncertainty regarding its majority in the other chamber, the passing of the Supplementary Estimates is not so important as it was said to be a few hours ago. The Government should make way for another government which will conduct the business of the country fearlessly. The Labour party has cooperated with the Government in passing legislation associated with the nation's war effort. Although the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> did not introduce the Supplementary Estimates, he made a long controversial statement which could have led to a debate extending over two days, but he was not prepared to allow the House to discuss his propaganda statement. I trust that the business of the Government will be carried out in a more orderly way in the future. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that when you call the Senate together, arrangements be made for it to meet on a Wednesday, if possible. Under the present railway time-table, honorable senators from Western Australia can be  in  their places here four days after leaving  Perth if the Senate meets on a Wednesday; but should it meet on a Tuesday, as has happened on occasions in the past, six days must elapse from the time of leaving Perth until the Senate meets. Western Australian senators living in country districts may have to spend as long as eight .days between the time of leaving home and the meeting of the Senate. When the Senate adjourns on a Friday, senators wishing to travel to Western Australia have to spend one and a half days in Melbourne, or at some other point on the journey, making the total travelling time five days to Perth, or seven days in your own case, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> When the Parliament met for only one or two periods a year, Western Australian members did not mind spending a little extra time in the capital cities, but now that it meets at four or five different periods during the year, the time occupied in travelling is more than can be spared. I hope, therefore, that arrangements will be made for the Senate to be called together on a Wednesday. </para>
