                        <para>- Six months ago the Minister for Supply and Development informed the Senate that Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited would be producing magnesium about the middle of this year. Can the Minister now inform the Senate how much magnesium, if any, has been produced? If none has been produced, has any factory,machinery, or other equipment been installed for its production? If not, have any plans been made by Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited or the Government for the production of magnesium in Australia ? </para>

The position regarding the supply of materials for the Adelaide-Perth proposal is now being examined and the honorable senator may rest assured that the work will bo proceeded with at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                    <para>The delay in the production of the final volume of the Australian official history of the last war has been largely due to the fact that the official historian was for some months employed by the Government on important work connected with the present war. He is, however, now completing the last chapter of the volume, most of which is already in the hands of the printer, and  it  is anticipated that the book will be published in December. For the information of the honorable senator it should perhaps be mentioned that the Australian . official history is, in comparison with histories of similar scope and quality, the most advanced of those of the belligerent nations of the last war. </para>

                    <para>. - Some months ago the Government made a pronouncement that a military road was to be constructed from Port Augusta to Norseman to connect the eastern States with Western Australia. That pronouncement was received with a good deal of pleasure. I understand that some progress has already been made with this work, but I recall that other main roads required for military purposes, notably the one connecting Port Darwin with the south were very rapidly completed and progress reports were issued from time to time giving details of the work. 1 trust that the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> will arrange for this important main military road to the western State to be constructed with the same expedition as was shown by his officers in connexion with other main military roads. I shall be pleased if the Minister will report to the Senate as to the progress being made with this work. </para>
