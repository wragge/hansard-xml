                    <para>This bill proposes to make several important changes in the constitution and organization of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The amendments to the act relate to the personnel of the commission, the employment of officers and servants, the powers and functions of the commission, and technical services. Before outlining the reasons for the proposed amendments, I shall, for the information of honorable senators, trace the operations of the commission since its inception. The Australian Broadcasting Commission was established under the provisions of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act of May, 1932. In order to assess the measure of success achieved by the commission or of the system set up by the act, it is necessary to study the mandate given by Parliament to the commission. The commission was directed to provide and broadcast " adequate and comprehensive programmes"and"to take in the interests of the community all such measures as, in the opinion of the commission, are conducive to the full development of suitable programmes ". It was also directed to encourage local talent, and to establish orchestras, choirs and bands in such manner as it thought desirable, but in such a way as to confer the greatest benefit on broadcasting. It was empowered, at its discretion, to issue papers, pamphlets, books, &amp;c.,and to collect news. </para>
                    <para>The act, as the quotations made demonstrate, was to provide a public service to be rendered by a comparatively independent commission. Members of Parliament stressed this idealistic aim throughout the debate on the bill in 1932. </para>
                    <para class="block">One characteristic statement was that of the present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> who said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The commission should be composed of men possessing qualities which will ensure that broadcasting will be used for not only the entertainment, but also the education of the people. It will have a potent influence on speech. That is most desirable, because slipshod speech connotes slipshod thinking: It will educate the people to an appreciation of the higher classes of music, and instruct them in literary, scientific and general knowledge. It will lend itself to the advancement of industry by disseminating far and wide those processes which from time to time science and expert knowledge are placing at the disposal of our producers. We want a national orchestra in Australia. It will have a direct and powerful influence on the character and spiritual life of our people. We want to encourage native-born talent in drama and music, both vocal and instrumental. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para class="block">The proposed commission is not to prepare a balance-sheet which is to be measured in pounds, shillings and pence. No doubt it will be expected to make broadcasting pay . . . but not by appealing to the most ignorant prejudices of the community and prostituting this new and extraordinarily scientific service to the baser instinct of the poorest, intellectually, of our community . . . This is an opportunity to revitalize the spiritual and intellectual life of the nation ... It is not an organization for selling sausages, but for the sale of ideas and the giving of inspiration. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Let us see how far these aims have been realized. First, on the practical side, it is interesting to note that during the debate on the bill in 1932, members expressed the hope that some day the number of licences would be doubled. Actually they have 'been more than trebled since the commission was appointed. In 1932 the total number of licences was 369,936; and according to the latest available return the number to-day is 1 ,268,130. The growth in the magnitude of the commission's task is illustrated by the fact that in 1932 there were twelve national stations on the air, broadcasting for a total of about 50,000 hours, and by 1940 there were28 stations broadcasting for a total of 150,000 hours. </para>
                    <para>The commission's activities extend over all States of the Commonwealth and, through the medium of shortwave broadcasting, to a number of countries overseas. Every possible type of human interest capable of communication by broadcasting has been provided in the programmes. The variety of this work may be seen by a glance at the following programme analysis given in the commission's annual report: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Music of all kinds, serious and light; orchestral, instrumental, vocal, operatic, community singing, dance music, and so on, play productions, including drama, comedy, children's plays, dramatized stories and talks, musical comedy, variety, revues, spoken transmissions over a wide range; general talks, stories for adults and children, talks on social  problems,  technical matters, science and arts,  book  reviews, women's and children's sessions, political talks, running descriptions, and talks about sport, news bulletins and commentaries, and essential services, especially for men on the land, such as weather and market reports, and religious broadcasts. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>A brief reference to the principal departments of the commission will give some idea of the development which has taken place : - </para>
                    <para>When the commission was appointed in 1932 there were no full-time orchestras in Australia. The .Sydney studios had a small band of thirteen players and Melbourne fourteen, but there was no opportunity for Australian musicians to obtain regular experience in orchestral playing. Since then the commission has established a full-time orchestra, in each State. Other permanent units include a military band, two dance bands, and two choruses. The number of players in full-time employment is now more than 2S0; 66 others are under regular engagement, and, in addition, about ISO more are engaged  frequently  to augment the orchestras during' the celebrity concert season of seven lo eight months each .year. The commission is the only organization able to give employment to resident musicians on such a scale, and in anything but a casual way. The commission also arranges individual engagements for a large number of Australian artists every year. In the year ended the 30th June, 1940, the number of engagements was 10,230, and the great majority of these were given to Australians. The fees paid in that period to overseas artists, including British, were £26,810, whilst the fees paid to Australian artists were £279,580. The commission has organized many studio and concert tours that provide valuable experience, particularly for young artists, and has brought back to this country for concert and studio engagements a number of Australian artists who have won distinc tion abroad. Auditions are held regularly in all States for all who seek engagements, and out of regard to listeners, a reasonably high standard is demanded. Artists who, although falling short of this standard at the first audition, show promise of better work, are encouraged to present themselves again at a later, date. </para>
                    <para>As part of its development work, the. commission believes that it has a responsibility to bring to Australia a reasonable number of outstanding overseas artists, and in this view it has the support of responsible Australian musical bodies and the leaders of the various  conservatoria.  These visits give Australian audiences an opportunity to hear in person some of the world's greatest artists while they are in their prime. Even more important is the valuable stimulus to Australian music and the opportunity given to Australian musicians to work and study under conductors who are acknowledged leaders in the world of music. The commission has not, however, overlooked the need to maintain a proper balance between the number of overseas and local artists. Thus, in the five years 1936-40, approximately four-fifths of the studio and concert tours organized by the commission were arranged for resident artists and Australians returning from abroad. It should also be mentioned that the fees paid to non-British .artists during the year ended the 30th June, 1940, when' offset by concert revenue, were less than 1 per cent, of the commission's licence revenue. </para>
                    <para>An important feature of the commission's work has been the organization, in addition to the celebrity orchestral concert season, of young people's concerts, at which no charge is made, and of community symphony concerts in the suburbsof the capital cities, at which all seats are available at prices ranging from ls.; to 2s. The young people's concerts havé been particularly' successful. Last year 26 such concerts were held, the total attendance being about 50,000 boys and girls from 'both State and private schools.' The commission has been active in assisting Australian composers by arranging performances of their works and by bringing them to the notice of visiting celebrity artists from' abroad. Other ways in which it contributed to the: development of Australian musical life have included co-operation with established musical bodies, assistance to musical competitions, and the arrangement of broadcasts for successful performers at the larger competitions. </para>
                    <para>When <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> commission started in .1932, the presentation of plays was in an immature stage. There was no organized attempt to secure plays specially suited for broadcasting, to educate  playwriters  for radio work, or to train players and producers. Only three States had production staffs. Many productions were in charge of announcers or part-time amateur producers. The commission set up a productions department to put this important work on a proper national basis. Special staffs were secured or trained, and organized efforts were made to secure suitable material and to train players. Higher fees were paid to encourage playwrights and to raise the standard. Radio play competitions were held. A play-reading and advising department was created to search for and develop talent by advice and otherwise. The result of this policy has not only been to bring about a great improvement in the standard of play-writing and production, but has led to a remarkable development of Australian talent. Some idea of the work involved may be had from the following figures: - Last year 750 locally written plays of all kinds were submitted. These were carefully read ; 190 were purchased, and advice was given to authors of the remainder to help them to remedy defects in .their work. Some idea of the work involved in production may be had from the fact that more than 900 plays, including serious, light and musical plays, revues, arid sketches, were put on last year. The. number of engagements given to players in these productions totalled over 8,000. </para>
                    <para>Talks cover an almost unlimited range of subjects and probably embrace every interest in the community. They cater for men, women and children, for city and country people; they deal with science, social and economic problems, art, national and international affairs, politics, books, and sport. In a great many cases they touch on controversial topics, and it is natural, therefore, that from time to time they draw protests from listeners who differ sharply from the views expressed. The commission has, however, always stressed the point that the views expressed are those of the speakers and not those of the commission ; that the discussion of controversial subjects, provided varying points of view are put by authoritative speakers, is a stimulus to thought, and an essential and valuable element in democratic communities. Indeed, this attitude towards freedom of discussion of controversial questions is not only characteristic of democratic peoples all over the world, but is also one of the features which distinguish democracy most sharply from totalitarian States. Some years ago, the House of Commons, discussing the activities of the British Broadcasting Corporation, resolved - </para>

                    <para>Later, a representative committee of inquiry into broadcasting in England reaffirmed and enlarged on this view in the following words : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>We think it important that controversial topics should continue to be discussed. If broadcasting is to present a reflection of its time, it must include matters which are in dispute. If it is to hold public interest, it must express living thought. If it is to educate public opinion, it must look upon the questions of the hour from many angles. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Last year more than 4,700 talks were broadcast. About 1,100 individual speakers were engaged to broadcast these talks. The number of talks gives some idea of the amount of work involved when one remembers the necessity for arranging for speakers and scrutinizing the scripts carefully to avoid offending against the canons of good taste or public policy. The number of speakers engaged ensures the expression of a wide variety of opinions. An important development in connexion with talks has been the organizing of listening groups throughout the country. This experiment, which is being first tried out in New South Wales, has turned out a great success. Some 70 groups have been established, embracing more than 700 people. The groups meet regularly to discuss the subjects raised in various series of taits which have been organized specially for them, although, of course, intended to interest other listeners also. The commission has encouraged Australian writers of stories both by the purchase of their works and by prize competitions. During last year 176 stories and 11 serial stories were purchased from Australian authors. </para>
                    <para>The increasing importance of news sessions has brought about almost a revolution in the scope and methods of presentation of news. Before 1936 nearly all the news sessions were State sessions, and many consisted of news read directly from a newspaper by an announcer. Since then the necessity for special writing for broadcasting has been increasingly recognized, and the news staffs have been strengthened and enlarged. The presentation of news has been improved and the sources of news have been extended. Up till 1936 the newspapers and the British official wireless service were the only sources of overseas news for Australian broadcasters. At the end of 1936 the commission arranged for a direct cable service from London to deal with events connected with the abdication of King Edward VIII. Results were successful and the next year direct cables on many happenings were received from a London representative. Later, a regular week-end cable service was arranged. </para>
                    <para>After the outbreak of war, a full time news representative was appointed in London, and the commission also secured a service from the Exchange Telegraph Agency. In April, 1940, the commissi on dispensed with the Australian Associated Press service which, up to then, had been its main source of overseas news, and purchased the right to rebroadcast any or all of the British Broadcasting Corporation's bulletins in full. For this right; it agreed to be responsible for the payment to Australian Associated Press of £3000 per annum, half of which was t.o be contributed by the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations which were thereby entitled to  rebroadcast  the British Broadcasting Corporation's news bulletins. It was then no longer handicapped by having to keep hack  overseas  news until it had appeared in ibr- newspapers. A cable service from </para>
                    <para class="block">Kew York improved still further the news service to Australian listeners. </para>
                    <para>The bulk of the Australian news is still taken from newspapers, but is now rewritten in a form suitable for broadcasting. An important addition to the service was the appointment early in 1939 of a federal roundsman with head-quarters at: Canberra. On Sunday afternoons, when'no newspapers are issued,- the commission's staff in each State collects Australian news for the evening sessions. It may be of interest, as indicating thework involved, to note that last year over 11,000 'bulletins, overseas and Australian, * were compiled by the commission's staff for broadcasting. News commentaries, of course, are the background of the news. These demand in the commentators a high degree of knowledge and experience.5 Last year over 500 locally-compiled news commentaries were broadcast, the number of individual commentators totalling about 40. </para>
                    <para>Before the commission was appointed in 1932, there were no broadcast services for school children, except for some experimental work done for a few. months in Victoria. The commission appointed special ' school broadcasts officers in most States, and was fortunate,! eventually, in securing the fullest cooperation from the State and private educational bodies throughout Australia.As a result this important branch of <inline font-style="italic">its'</inline> work has developed greatly. Last yearthe number of schools at "which scholarsregularly listened totalled 1,900, and it is estimated that -the number of children- listening to the schoolsbroadcasts was about 100,000. Subjects selected are those in the school curriculum which lend themselves tobroadcast treatment. In addition, however, to the ordinary subjects, broadcasts of national series, such as "Health and: Hygiene ", " The World We Live In ", and " Musical Appreciation " bring the voices of doctors, commentators on inter-' national affairs, and musicians, to the' schoolroom. Plays are put on from the studio by first-class artists to illustratehistory and make it live in the minds pf the students. The commission also met another great need, namely, that of children in the outback who were unable toattend ordinary schools, and were dependent on correspondence instruction. </para>
                    <para class="block">There are now approximately 4,000 such children listening to the school broadcasts. The commission has also pioneered another important development in school broadcasting, namely, audiovisual education. By arrangement with the school authorities, lantern-slides or films are shown, simultaneously with the talks, as illustrations. Reference has already been made to the valuable eductional work done among children through the medium of the orchestral concerts for young people in the capital cities. </para>
                    <para>For some years the commission has been giving its own shortwave broadcasts. During 1939-40 Station VLR in Victoria transmitted, on an average, for fifteen hours daily, and from the 16th December, 1939, when it came into operation, Station VLW in Western Australia transmitted, on an average, for thirteen hours daily. These broadcasts are given primarily for the benefit of listeners in remote parts of Australia, but they are. also heard regularly in New Guinea and some Pacific islands, and reception reports have come in from all parts of the world. Station VLW was brought into operation last December to serve, particularly, the north-west of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Northern Queensland and the islands north of Australia within this arc. Its programmes are . based on the Western Australian State programmes and national news sessions. Reception reports have been generally good. </para>
                    <para>At the request of the Commonwealth Department of Information, the commission arranged in December, 1939, to broadcast short-wave programmes to certain overseas countries. This called for additional accommodation, extensive alteration to premises already occupied, and the engagement of a staff of translators, broadcasters, and assistants with the necessary language qualifications. The new service was opened on the 20th December, 1939, by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> The transmissions were in English, French, German, Dutch, and Spanish. In April, 1940, a translation in English and Afrikaans directed to South Africa began from the Perth studios. Soon afterwards Italian broadcasts were introduced. Later the Spanish broadcasts to South America were discontinued, and some alterations were  made in the times of the European transmissions. Each programme consists of a news bulletin, a talk, and music. The programmes vary from half an hour to an hour and a half in length. The Department of Information supplies the news and the talk, the commission the translations and music. The transmitters used are VLR and VLW, owned by the Postmaster-General's Department, and VLQ, owned by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. According to reports, reception has, on the whole, been excellent, and many letters commenting on the broadcasts have come from listeners overseas, particularly from those in North America. </para>
                    <para>In addition to the special departments mentioned, the commission provides a wide range of services, such as religious broadcasts, women's and children's sessions, sport sessions, descriptive broadcasts, and recordings. </para>
                    <para>The bill before the Senate provides for an increase of the number of members of the commission. The commission now consists of five members, and this number will be increased to seven. The question of a broader representation of interests on the commission has been the subject of much consideration, and it is thought that the amendment now suggested will provide an opportunity to extend the sphere of interests of the commission. The term of appointment of the present members of the commission expires on the 30th June, 1941, and, in suggesting that the number of members be increased from five to seven, it is proposed that the appointments should take effect as from the 1st July, 1941. It is desirable that some degree of continuity of policy be maintained in such a body, and for that reason it is thought that the term of appointment of all the commissioners should not expire at the same time. The commissioners should, therefore, be appointed for differing periods. It is proposed that the commission shall consist of - </para>

                    <para>It is also proposed to modify the existing powers of the commission in relation to the appointment of officers. Section 15 of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act provides that officers and servants appointed by the commission shall not be subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, but shall be subject to such conditions, including tenure of office, as are determined by the commission. The employees of the commission, broadly, fall within two main categories - first, those whose employment is of a permanent character, and whose duties are of an executive or administrative nature, and, secondly, those whose duties are of a purely professional character. Naturally those within the second category are mostly part-time employees who are engaged mainly for programme purposes. </para>
                    <para>During the early stages of the establishment of a semi-governmental activity such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission, there were, perhaps, many advantages in permitting those charged with the inauguration and ultimate establishment of the national broadcasting service complete freedom in the selection of employees and the determination of conditions of employment. Now, however, that the commission has been operating for over eight years, and its organization has been firmly established and some degree of permanency can bo foreseen in its method of operation, much can be said in support of the view that conditions governing the selection and employment of permanent staff should conform to those prescribed by the Commonwealth Public Service Act, either by bringing that section of the staff under that act or by having appropriate regulations issued under the Australian Broadcasting </para>
                    <para class="block">Commission Act. Clause 10 of the bill provides that officers and servants appointed by the commission shall be subject to such conditions " as are prescribed " instead of, as at the present, " as are determined by the commission ". In other words, section 15, as amended, will enable regulations to be made to prescribe the conditions of employment of the officers of the commission. At present, officers of the Repatriation Commission and of the War Service Homes Commission are employed in accordance with regulations made under the acts under which those commissions are constituted. The appointment and tenure of office of officers of the Commonwealth Council for Scientific and Industrial Research are similarly governed by regulations. </para>
                    <para>Section 16 of the principal act refers to the functions of the commission. Clause 11 of the bill defines more clearly the respective responsibilities of the commission and the Postal Department in the carrying out of the provisions of the act. It also provides the necessary authority for holding public entertainments by the commission. This amendment has resulted from the doubt raised from time to time as to the legality of public entertainments held by the commission. Legal proceedings were instituted against the commission at one stage in order to prevent the commission from holding public entertainments, but the action did not reach court. </para>
                    <para>I now propose to comment briefly on the technical services associated with the national broadcasting system. As honorable senators are aware, these services are provided by the Postal Department. From time to time, however, certain criticism has been raised respecting this aspect of broadcasting, and at times some resentment has been expressed that the Postal Department should be permitted to take any part in the actual technical work of broadcasting. In order to appreciate the degree to which the Postal Department's organization and itsplant are bound up with broadcasting, it is necessary to bear in mind that Commonwealth territory covers nearly 3,000,000 square miles, with a widely-scattered population outside the capital cities. The Postal Department hasstablished telephone facilities throughout the whole of the settled portions of Australia and has trained technical staffs located in almost every town and village. It is in a position, therefore, to perform the technical services associated with broadcasting in an efficient manner and with a minimum of expenditure. More important still, it is able to make such services available at all hours of the day and night at very short notice. The provision of the technical services associated with broadfasting is so closely interwoven with the activities of the Postal Department that it \* the only authority adequately equipped to undertake this service. Any other arrangement would obviously lead to duplication of plant and personnel, and would involve enormous expenditure of time and money. In these circumstances, the Government does not propose to make any change in the responsibility for the provision of the technical services required. </para>
                    <para>It was the intention in the original actthat the Postal Department should provide all technical services in the studios at the cost of that department. Since the commencement of the act, however, many advancements have been made in technical science, and, consequently, the provisions of section 46 and 47 of the act do not define precisely the position of the Postal Department and the commission in this connexion. Provision is therefore being made in the bill to cover that and other minor points concerned with the technical services. </para>
                    <para>Clause 17 of the bill provides that " the Governor-General may, if he is satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest so to do, by notice in writing, direct the commission to refrain from taking any action in the exercise of any of its powers conferred by this act ". It is recognized that there are many advantages in allowing the commission to exercise the widest possible powers ; but in the light, of experience it is considered that occasions may arise when the Government may find it essential to direct the commission in some particular sphere of the commission's activity. It is desired that the commission shall continue to lay down its own policy, and that it shall be free from the control of the Minister </para>

                        in the conduct of the normal business of the commission. This clause has been framed with the intention that the commission shall act under the powers conferred on it by the act, and shall be subject to restraint only when any of the actions of the commission are considered to be at variance with national or imperial policy or in conflict with public interest.
                    </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators will admit thatduring the past nine years enormous development has taken place, and that, despite whatever mistakes may have been made, the Australian Broadcasting Commission has never allowed party politics to  influencee  its deliberations. I hope, therefore, that, in view of its great national and international importance, broadcasting will never become the plaything of party politics. I commend the -bill to the favorable consideration of honorable senators. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw the word " deliberate ", and say that the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> whose answer was transmitted to me through the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll),</inline> entirely misunderstood my question. In the recess I made representations to the Minister for the Army, the Minister  for  the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> for more equitable fares for soldiers, sailors and air force men crossing Bass Strait on leave. My representations were acknowledged, and it was stated that  the  Ministers concerned would confer in order to ascertain what could be done to meet my requests, but it would appear from  the  answer that was supplied to me to-day that nothing has yet been done. The position to-day is that members of the forces, Tasmanians encamped in other States and men from other States encamped in Tasmania, are discriminated against in comparison with those on the mainland who  are  encamped in mainland States other than their home States.Whereas  the  men who have to cross to Tasmania when going home on leave have to pay full fare, less 10 per cent. by air and less 15 per cent. by sea, men who go home on leave on the mainland are given concessions of much greater value. Moreover, a Tasmanian training at Duntroon has  to  pay 14s.10d. return fare to Melbourne in addition to the fare across Bass Strait, whereas a Victorian training at Duntroon is charged only 5s. return between Canberra and his home town. The men in  the  forces are equally imbued with the desire to fight for democracy and the preservation of this country and they should all, therefore, receive equal treatment. No member of the forces should be placed at a disadvantage in respect of fares merely because of geographical considerations. Discrimination, bad in any circumstances, becomes worse when one man is enabled to go on leave from a camp in Victoria to his home in New South Wales for 5s. return, whereas a Victorian who crosses Bass Strait on leave from a camp in Tasmania is compelled to pay a minimum of £3 10s. 3d. return. About 180 Victorians, in camp in Tasmania for a few months, had to pay £3 10s. 3d. each when they first went home on leave. On the second occasion, because there were insufficient second-class berths on the boat, some had to go first class and some second class. The cost of their <inline font-style="italic">passages</inline> was pooled and the fares averaged £4 3s. a head. In the few months in which those men were in Tasmania they paid about £1,300 in fares to the shipping company to enable them to see their families in Victoria. A good many of them were married men. Honorable senators will readily imagine the inroads that their fares would make into the small amount of money that would be available from their small wage on which many have to maintain homes. </para>

                            <para>- I have made that suggestion to the Government, and I. shall make it again before I conclude. Another aspect of this matter concerns soldiers from the mainland serving on certain islands. These men obtain leave for the same period as other members of the military forces, but, owing to the limited time available, and because of the infrequent boat services operating between these islands and the mainland, it is absolutely impossible for them to return from leave within the specified time. As a result, they are liable to punishment for being absent without leave. I have placed this matter before the Government, and have asked that the aeroplane services be made available to them. The council clerk at Flinders Island has written to me saying very definitely that the men are told that they cannot travel by air and must use the boat service. In reply to a question  which I asked in this chamber, I was informed that the men could travel by air, but that is not so. I do not know of any reason why they should not be granted passages by aeroplane, either free, or at rates equivalent to those applying to soldiers travelling interstate on the mainland. Why should there be discrimination against them merely because they are Tasmanians and live in an isolated portion of the Commonwealth? Surely there should be equality among all men who are serving their country. They are prepared, if necessary, to give their lives in the defence of this country, and the least that any democratic government can do is to place them all on the same basis. </para>

                            <para>- They may, for instance, allow their monthly leave to accumulate in order to go home, say, every three months. It is not fair that they should be required to pay up to ten times as much as is paid by other soldiers to reach their homes, merely because they are stationed in remote parts of the Commonwealth. That is something that should not be tolerated by a democratic government. </para>

                    <para>The 15 per cent. reduction has always been allowed. I want to know if the Minister will approach the shipping companies with a view to obtaining a further reduction, and also will he consider granting free transport, to which the sailors, soldiers, and airmen are justly entitled. </para>
                    <para>When a soldier enlists for service in the defence of his country and is prepared, if necessary, to give his life for. the preservation of democracy, surely he is entitled to some consideration. Quite apart from his final leave, he should be able to visit his home as frequently as possible. When the180 Victorians in Tasmania objected to paying their fares at Christmas time, and trouble seemed likely to develop in the camp, the Government said that it would grant them a free fare home, but it would be regarded as their final leave. Under those conditions, should a soldier be in camp for a further four or five months, he would have to pay his own fare home. I am aware that soldiers are provided with their fares home when they go on final leave. These boys are prepared to give their lives in the defence of this country, and when they areon leave surely they are entitled to free rail transport such as is available to members of Parliament. </para>
