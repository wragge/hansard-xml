        <para class="block">I could cite similar opinions from other newspapers. I was born in the Old Country, and spent my early years there. From England I went to the United </para>
        <para class="block">States of America. I landed in Australia in 1912. During my life in Great Britain I came into close contact with the people there. I have slept in work-houses and have mixed with the bottom dogs, so I have an intimate knowledge of the fearful conditions of life of many people who lived in England years ago. I slept in workhouses not because 1 was compelled to - I could always get a good bed in my own home - but because, like Jack London and others, I was anxious to meet the people who constituted the submerged tenth of Great Britain. I knew the deplorable conditions under which millions of men and women existed. They travelled from town to town and from workhouse to workhouse. If they applied twice for accommodationat the same workhouse there was a possibility that they would be charged with vagrancy and have to go to gaol. I lived amongst the people and had intimate experience of the fearful conditions that operated in those days. Even prior to this war millions of men and women were on the dole. Certainly their conditions were a little better than those operating at the time of which I speak. At least they had the dole, whereas in the earlier days people had to beg for sufficient to maintain life; they had to go from door to door and from town to town, asking their fellow men for a few pence to buy sufficient food to keep life in their bodies. Subsequently a more humane government was able to bring in measures which made it possible <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> pay these people enough to buy the bare necessities of life. I cannot understand why the Chief Commonwealth Film Censor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cresswell</inline> O&#39;Reilly, should have banned this film, which deals so strikingly with the conditions of the poor. 1 should like the Minister for Information to tell the people of Australia why the film was banned. If it can be&#39; shown in England, where the people are in the very heart of the struggle which is now being waged against totalitarianism and know what is going on, why cannot it be screened in Australia ? </para>

            <para>- I understand that such an appeal is being made, but surely an appeal can also be made to the Minister, who, I feel sure, will say, &#34; Certainly, this film shall be shown &#34;. I am strongly of the opinion that the conditions under which people live in the Old Country should be shown to the Australian public. Our boys are going overseas to fight for democracy, and for a promised &#34; new order &#34;, and we should understand something of the faults of the old order so that we may help to ensure that even in England men and women are given a fair deal and an opportunity to earn a decent livelihood. This film would be splendid propaganda, and I cannot understand why the censor banned it. 1 hope that the Minister will look into the matter and see that the people of Australia have an opportunity to witness this epic film. </para>

          <para>. - I should like some information from the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> in regard to a question which I asked in this chamber last week. I asked the Minister if he had received a report from the Commonwealth representatives in the United States of America in regard to charges which were alleged to have been made against the great aluminium combine known as Alcoa. The Minister replied in the affirmative. I am interested to know whether the allegations were correct because only one-third of the capital of the Australian Aluminium Company Proprietary Limited is held in Australia, and only one-third of the directors are Australians, the other two-thirds in each case being controlled by overseas interests which indirectly are representatives of Alcoa. I should like to know if there is any truth in the props report that representatives of Alcoa were arrested and &#39; charged by the Government of the United States of America with having engaged in subversive activities, inasmuch as they had held up supplies of aluminium needed for the British war effort. If so, what were the findings? That is a matter of great importance to Australia in view of the interest which Alcoa holds in the Australian Aluminium Company Proprieta ry Limited. </para>

        <para>Some days ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> stated that a member of the Australian Imperial Force in the Western Desert had asked him to correct publicly a statement made by the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> that no margarine was being used or had been used by the Army, and that margarine did not appear on the contract list of the Australian Force or lists of supplies from British  depot3  to Australian troops serving abroad. This statement appeared in the press on the 30th May last, and on the 6th June, it was amplified by the Minister for the Army who said: &#34;Arrangements made by the Commonwealth Government with the British authorities for food supplies to the Australian Imperial Force do not include any issue of margarine. The actual position is that the Commonwealth Government, through the Military Board, has an arrangement with the British authorities for the daily supply of rations to the Australian Forces abroad. The daily scale of rations is adhered to whenever humanly possible, but the exigencies of modern warfare and the rapid movement associated with it, carried on over extended lines of communication and, in the case of the Middle East, in extreme heat, would frequently place the British supply depots in a most difficult position in respect of the supply of butter to our forces. Only in those cases when it is impossible to obtain butter would our troops be issued with margarine, but it must be understood that this is an emergency measure &#34;. On behalf of the Minister for the Army, I now inform the Senate that the position is that supplies of butter are despatched to the Middle East on every transport which leaves Australia for that destination. These supplies are landed on arrival and handed over to British depots for distribution to Australian troops as required and when practicable. The honorable senator will readily understand that butter can be distributed to the troops only when conditions permit its transportation. Except when troops are located adjacent to suitable storage facilities, butter cannot be supplied to them in the hot weather, as it rapidly becomes unfit for human consumption, and transport difficulties frequently prevent its distribution to troops in the period which would unavoidably elapse between removal from storage and delivery in. the field. Margarine does not become unfit for human consumption under the same conditions, and the practice has been adopted of issuing vitamized margarine where, for reasons already stated, butter cannot be made available. However, butter is issued to the troops whenever it is possible to do so. </para>
        <para>I am sure the honorable senator will appreciate that climatic conditions and the exigencies of the service must frequently prevent the distribution of butter to troops in the field, which, in hot weather, must be determined by the distance of the troops from suitable storage and the  transportation facilities available. Adverse climatic conditions and transportation difficulties must frequently render delivery of butter to the troops impossible under active service conditions. At present the Department of the Army is, with the assistance of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, conducting experiments with concentrated dehydrated butter, and a quantity of this product has been issued to troops in various places to test their reactions to this type of butter. This product retains all the food value of fresh butter and without refrigeration can be stored for long periods without losing its palatability. Should this test prove satisfactory, it is anticipated that our present difficulties will he, to a great extent, overcome and that the necessity to use margarine, on occasions, as a substitute will in future be obviated. </para>

        <para>In the Parliament of New South Wales last week, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carlton,</inline> in the course of a speech in which he made a charge against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> J.

He appears to have confused the Department of Information with the Department of Investigation which is attached to either the Army Department or the Department of the Attorney-General, because no statement of any kind was secured by any one from any officer of the Department of Information, nor has that department attached to it an investigation section. I make this clear injustice to the officers of the department. </para>

          <para>. - I regret that the Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Leckie)</inline> is not present. Over a period of many months, both inside and outside this chamber, I have repeatedly asked for definite information to be furnished to me concerning the production of fighter aeroplanes in Australia, and the answer has always been that plans were in course of being completed, and that within a very few days the honorable gentleman would be able to announce details of production in Australia. I asked a question on the subject in this chamber only a fortnight ago. The Minister for Aircraft Production then informed the Senate that within a very few days he would make details available to the country. This matter is becoming more and more important as time passes. The most vital factor influencing the minds of soldiers returning from service abroad, arising from their actual experiences on the battlefront, is the need for more and more fighter aeroplanes. This country cannot be placed soon enough in full production of these most important adjuncts to our defence and a successful offensive. I should therefore like the Minister to make a definite statement at once. If the plans are not approaching completion, he should at least tell the country that the stage is not near when the production of fighter aeroplanes will be commenced. Why should he continue to hoodwink the people, by saying that within a very few days he will make details available, when it is apparent that such is not the case? I personally have been humbugged for nearly twelve months, particularly since the honorable senator in question became a Minister. A statement should be made as to whether the Government is or is not ready to commence the production of these machines. </para>

          <para>. - I thank the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> for his statement in regard to compulsory military trainees, but I am still not convinced that the proper thing has been done by these lads. The setting up of medical boards, so that men will not have to travel more than 10 miles does not overcome the difficulty. I particularly instance the gold-fields, and the centres of rural industries, where men have to travel a far greater distance than 10 miles in order to reach the nearest office at which a medical examination may be conducted.These men are losing money thereby; they are not in receipt of wages during the period of their absence in order to undergo a preliminary examination. In the light of these facts, I ask the Minister again to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender).</inline> In Western Australia particularly, men are affected in the timber country, the mining areas, and on the different farms. The Government should grant compensation in respect of loss of wages. The men do not enter camp immediately upon passing the medical examination, but have to return to their work until they are called up. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">That aspect of the matter should be stressed strongly with the Minister for the Army. I can see no reason for these men being obliged to lose their wages while engaged in the performance of a national duty. </para>

            <para>The arrangement made with the United Kingdom provides that either Government may initiate in May of any year a review of the agreement, particularly in relation to the price. In view of the great advantage conferred on Australian wool-growers by the guarantee of purchase of their totalwool clip for the term of the war and one year thereafter, and the heavy financial responsibility which will rest on the United Kingdom Government in respect of unsold stocks, the Commonwealth Government has not heretofore sought a review of the price. The right remains, however, to initiate a review in May of any future year. It is, of course, possible that, at any review, the United Kingdom Government might seek a reduction in price. </para>
