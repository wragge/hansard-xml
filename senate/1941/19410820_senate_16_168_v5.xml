          <para>- The Country party desires to be associated with this expression of regret at the passing of a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament, and extends its sympathy to the relatives of the deceased. The winning of a seat in the first Commonwealth Parliament was a greater achievement than that of being elected to this Parliament in later years, because, in the earliest days of federation, there were no party labels, and before a candidate could be electedhe required the support of a vast number of the electors in his constituency. That accomplishment stood to the credit of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ronald.</inline> I was not associated with him in political life, and had met him only on several occasions. He is probably the only clergyman who has ever won a seat in either branch of the Commonwealth legislature.Our sympathy goes out to the relatives of the deceased. </para>

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Enoggera in 1888, which seat he held until 1899, when he was appointed Postmaster-General and Secretary for Public Instruction.  In  1901, he was elected to the Senate as a representative for Queensland, and  in  that year be was a member of the Select Committee on Steamship Communication between Australia and Tasmania. He was Postmaster-General in the first Commonwealth Ministry, and held that office until August, 1903. He was Minister for Defence in August and September, 1903, and was Attorney-General from September, 1903, to April, 1904. He was also Vice-President of the Executive Council from August, 1904, to July, 1905. He retired from Commonwealth politics on the expiration of the second Parliament in 1906.

          <para>-  I had the great privilege of knowing the late Honorable J. G. Drake during the whole  of  his public life and right up till the time of his death. Although he was not associated with the party to which I belong he was always truly democratic in  his  political outlook and activities, which was something rare in the days of which I speak  -  I refer to the &#39;eighties. As  the  Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has said, the deceased gentleman was not only a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament, he was also Postmaster-General of the first Commonwealth Ministry. At the time of his death on the 1st of this month he was the only surviving member of that Ministry. Although 91 years of age he was practising his profession at the bar when  his  last illness overtook him. He was  the  oldest practitioner in Queensland, and  I  believe in the Commonwealth also. Some of us can remember his activities; they were always associated with movements for the benefit of the people. I remember well that he published a newspaper - <inline font-style="italic">TheBoomerang</inline> - which in those days was considered to be fairly extreme, although to-day itwouldbe regarded as quite respectable. It was Australian in its outlook, and in those days provided one  of  the very few outlets for the then comparatively new champions of Australia and of things Australian. It is, therefore, with feeling of great regret that I refer to his passing, although, because of his advanced age, it was not unexpected. I regard as a privilege this opportunity  to  refer to hig life, and I join with the Leader of the Senate in expressing sincere sympathy with  those  of his family who are left behind. As I have said on many previous occasions, we have  an  ever-increasing obligation to pay respect to the memory of the pioneers of Australia, who  in  this Parliament, and elsewhere, have done  so  much  to  develop this great country. </para>

He was a man of great ability, knowledge and culture. I should have liked him to speak more frequently because of hiswide knowledge of a number of subjects.
