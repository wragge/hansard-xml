                        <para>Will the Minister, for Supply and Development inform the Senate whether there is ' any truth in the allegation that the present shortage of knitting wool in Australia is occasioned by the decision of the mills, particularly the Victorian mills, to restrict the supply of that commodity to the people of Australia, possibly on account of the urgency of certain defence contracts or commitments? If so, will he take immediate steps to see that an adequate supply of knitting wool is made available to the public, seeing that the wool is originally grown in this country?</para>

                        <para>- In consequence of the decisions of the New Delhi Conference, Australia undertook to supply certain commodities for the use of its own troops, both in Australia and overseas, and ' also for British troops. The Government has been asked recently to provide 400,000 lb. of yarn a month to enable mills in India to continue the production of defence requirements. The Government has made a survey of the capacity of Australia to produce this yarn, in. order to ascertain whether yarn of the quality required could be made available, but- it is not intended to restrict the supply of that yam to the knitting mills in Australia. We believe that our first duty is to the Australian and. British forces, wherever theym ay be, and we have asked the mills to concentrate on the provision of yarn for overseas, but we believe that, when they are in full production, they will be able, not only to meet overseas commitments, but also to make supplies of yarn available for. use in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators will realize that, owing to dollar exchange difficulties, imports of tobacco from the United States of America into Australia have been severely restricted, and that Australia produces only about one-fifth of the quantity of tobacco required in this country. Efforts are now being made to import tobacco from Southern Rhodesia and other countries, and I do not anticipate that the present shortage will long continue. </para>

                        <para>. - The Opposition has just' taken certain action which is an indication of its definite policy on every occasion in the future on which a' formal motion for the suspension of the Standing and Sessional Orders shall be moved, unless the need for it be desperately urgent. Senators on this side of the chamber see no special reason for undue haste in the" consideration of this bill. We understand that the Treasury requires the measure to be passed at least before noon on the 30th June. The bill will be passed when we have finished with it. We have not had the same opportunities as members of the House of Representatives have had in recent days to discuss certain matters of great national importance which have arisen since we last met. We are here to do our duty, and we propose, as far as we can, to make it impossible for the Government in future to prevent us from doing our job as we think it ought to be done. We shall object to long adjournments, and Ave shall take every available . opportunity to see that the members of the Senate at least carry out honorablythe contract made by them with the members of the community at large to do their share of the work of this Parliament;. In the House of Representatives there is never such a. bustle in passing bills as is expected in this chamber. I admit that on some occasions measures of such urgency are brought before us that there is good reason for dealing with them with the utmost expedition.I hope that we shall be able to sort bills out for ourselves, and differentiatebetween those which should be fully debated and those which could be passed without lengthy discussion. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>On this measure, it would be easy to liberate a flood of criticism in connexion with many matters.Formyself, I do not. propose to be unduly critical of events of recent weeks in connexion with the tremendous struggle that is proceeding on the other side of the world. Some of the matters that I have in mind have been fully debated in the other branch of the legislature. I' do not intend to indulge merely in destructive criticism which might hamper the Government in speeding up the war effort. Much time could be spent in discussing, occurrences in Greece and. Crete, and many other happenings within our own borders in connexion with the administration of the various war services, but I shall not lay undue emphasis upon them. Nevertheless, I invite the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay.)</inline> to accept a. little advice from me as Leader of the Opposition, and I tender it in a friendly spirit, desiring not only to make our democratic institutions what they ought to be, but also to prove that in a democratic country parliament can be made workable even under the present difficult circumstances. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has returned from a remarkable tour. He has made many speeches both abroad and at home. By means of an address broadcast over the air; he has spoken to the people of Australia, and he has addressed! many sectional organizations whose members have assembled to hear him. Hehas also add ressed public meetings, and hasspoken freely to members of this Parliament, both in open sessions and at secret meeting of senatorsandmembers. I shall not discuss those speeches except in certain details. I shall adopt that attitude, not because the Prime Minister's remarks do not leave the way open to effective criticism by the Opposition, but because he is the Prime Minister of Australia and the leader of a Government elected under a democratic constitution. The time has long since passed for making speeches, and the people have the right to demand action. Members of the Opposition and also, I think, honorable senators opposite are anxious to cease talking and to get on with the work that is waiting to be done. </para>
                    <para>I shall make a brief allusion to the address broadcast by the Prime Minister in what I understand was the greatest nation-wide hook-up that has ever been made in this country. In. that speech, he outlined the future policy of the Government and made many promises and statements as to his intentions, many of which could with fairness be critically examined. I shall content myself by saying that one remarkable and, I believe, regrettable feature of his latest broadcast was both sinister and prophetic. It was the only definite promise that he made. He suggested that certain action was necessary, and that he would bring down certain proposals, but, before he had made his speech, one of his proposals had been implemented by action and became opera- tive next morning. I refer to his threats against the liberty and freedom of organizations of the workers of Australia. </para>

I am aware that a man at Jervis Bay was recently fined £110 for mentioning the movements of a certain vessel, but when I read that the case of the Abbco Bread Company Proprietary Limited would not be heard until after the winter law vacation, I thought that it was a reflection on this Parliament that certain persons had not been placel under lock and key long ago. That is where they should be, together with the heads of certain boot companies and others. When I began my speech, I did not intend to travel along these lines. </para>

                    <para>I do not wish to see trouble in this country. I do not want Labour members to have to plead with industrial organizations not to do things which should not be done. I do not want statements made by the Prime Minister, or any other responsible member of the Government, which, instead of creating a calm atmosphere in which the people would desire to do the things that the Prime Minister has in mind, would create an unfavorable atmosphere. I hope that the Prime Minister will remember that Australia's war effort cannot be carried out in that way, because the protection of this country depends entirely on what is done by the men whom he is threatening. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour Government in that State has speeded up, the war effort, particularly in regard to the protection of the community by means of air-raid precautions.Since its advent topower a few weeks ago, the war effort in New South Wales has been speeded up immensely.- If the Menzies Government would make way for a Labour government, it could beat the present Government out of sight in regard to the war effort. I do not want the Prime Minister and his colleagues to misunderstand the psychology of the Australian people. This nation did not come into existence by accident; it has been developed over a century and a half and as time went on our national characteristics improved, increased and intensified. Tens of thousands of people left the older countries of the world because of the tyranny and oppression practised in the land of their birth and came here imbued with the spirit of greater liberty and freedom, because there had bren developed in this country a standard of liberty and a conception of justice, that made life worth living. If the Prime Minister and his colleagues misunderstand the psychology of tire Australian people, great harm may be done. Let the right honorable gentleman and his M in is te rs realise .at' once that Australians will npt be driven. The  whole -history of. .their organizations  amply demonstrates, that. fact. I thought that wisdom would: 'suggest <inline font-style="italic">[to-</inline> the Prime Minister  that while  it .may be necessary  to  curtail  the' liberties of. the' people.- iri certain  respects, it should   not be. done in a -provocative. ;way. -There- is always another - way to. achieve, the -same 'end. That is all I am -pleading for. As the days go by, and this  .bill,  Ls.-giving .effect to what. the.. Prime- -Minister proposes to. do, he -will - be carefully watched. If regulations are conceived in a wrong, temperament,! -the Opposition- -will fight them to- the bitter- end, and take .the consequences.  At "this, juncture I propose to make -a few 'suggestions which, I think, would  be   helpful, to the Government. I trust that l ara,  not being  led into destructive criticism by. the provocative interjections of honorable senators opposite. That  is  farthest, from my mind. During the course of my speech I desire to offer nothing but constructive criticism. Every now and again proposals are made to induce the party to which I belong to abandon its attitude in respect to certain things. I tell the- Prime Minister, hi.s Government and the press, that it is hopeless for him to persist with these proposals, so I hope that we may hoar no more about them. I propose now to detail what they are. I tell the Leader of the Senate, in the hope that he will pass the information on to the Prime Minister, that there are certain things which the Australian Labour party, to which the Opposition in this chamber and the Opposition in the House of Representatives owe allegiance, has definitely and finally thrown into the discard. The first of these is a national government. Let us hear no more about it. The next is executive powers for the Australian Advisory War Council. That, also, is in the discard as long as Labour members continue to sit on the council. When the Government wants to get rid of the Labour members of the council it has merely to clothe it with executive powers. </para>

At present we are considering a Supply Bill. Before long the budget will be before us and I do not want to anticipate what it will contain. I know what was in the last budget and how it affected my account, at the Commonwealth Bank at Brisbane. Not one honorable senator in this chamber has " squealed " about it because every one knew that it offered a solution of some of our difficulties. I come back to my fourth point. I tell the Government and honorable  senators opposite that in. no circumstances can it swing on to the workers of this country, if we can prevent it. any foreign, schemes of: compulsory savings. The Government may quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keynes</inline> and other expounders of. theories for raising, money, and tell us that their, schemes must be implemented in order to save the country, but we will not have a word of it. That, also, is in the discard. Finally, no member of the Opposition, either here orin the House of Representatives, will be induced to take a political trip to London merely because the Government thinksthat it is desirable that a. member of the Opposition should see the old country in the turmoil of war. </para>

                                that all interjections are disorderly. The honorable senator wants to know if I will tell him the things that we will do. I have told him about them so often in this chamber that it should not be necessary to repeat them. One of thethingswe shall do, and what we Have done from the moment war was declared, is to continue to honour our promise to give to the Government every pound of the money it says is necessary and every power it needs to enable it to prosecute the war. Another thingwe shall do is to review carefully every piece of legislation which the Government brings down in this chamber. There will be no repetition of the past practice of endeavouring to hustle legislation through' this chamber in a few hours. I do not blame the Leader of the Senate for what has taken place in the past. I feel sure that had his wishes been consulted this chamber would not be treated in such a cavalier fashion.Members of the Government in this chamber have said to me,If you can get your boys in the House of Representatives to stop talking, we shall get the bill, without delay and youwill have plenty of time to consider it.We have nothing to do with what is done in the House of Representatives. The Government should be able so to arrange its business that the members of this chamber get an equal opportunity to examine critically every legislative proposal passed to us for consideration. As far  as  it. is humanly and numerically possible for the Opposition to do so, we shall try to eliminate the tactics of the dictator from all that is being done in the war effort, in this country. I say that because some of the things with which we are threatened are not new. The Government has not created a precedent in that regard. We have seen them all in operation in the dictatorship countries, and many others much worse than anything, ever attempted here.In the dictatorship countries unionists are gaoled, union funds are confiscated, and the  Union  leaders are shot. Nobody hasyetsuggested that, anyunionist in this country is to be shot; but it cannot be denied that the Government is gradually adopting the methods of the dictators. I am not personally afraid of any penalty that may be inflicted on any one in this country  for  doing certain things. I may not agree with the penalty imposed, but I am not afraid of it because I know that the desired resul  t  cannot be achieved by those means. If the people are told the truth about what the Government, wants,and why it is wanted, they will respond to the appeal. We cannot afford to go too far. along the wrong path; we have to ho careful. It, is very popular these times to talk about a new order. I, too, want to see a. new order. The Prime Minister has- told us more than once that he  does  not believe there will ever be a return to the old order. What the right honorable gentleman envisages as a possiblenew order, I cannot say.

                            <para>- I am afraid that my forecast of the " new order " will not be satisfactory to SenatorHerbert Hays. The remarks that I shall  now  proceed to make cannot be interpreted asbeing subversive ; every honorable senator will agree with them. I hate . war. I hate everything that war brings in  its  train. ButI know that war is only an effect.. For that reasonI hate the causeswhich make  war.  I am hopeful thatwhen the "new order" arrives, it will be of the nature, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> described  inthischamber last evening! In passing, I desire to compliment the honorable senator upon the admirable spirit and enthusiasm with which he has ventilated his ideas upon world peace. Because I know that war is only an effect, 1 analyse the causes that breed war. In the " new order " these causes must be eliminated. For that reason I am optimistic enough to believe that the democracies will win this struggle. I fervently believe the Biblical statement: " Out of evil cometh good ". Ultimately, right will triumph even though we may have to pass through many years of trial and tribulation. But when the democracies emerge successfully from the struggle, the war will give way to a " new order ", the like of which the world has never seen. Nevertheless, we are at war, which was not of Australia's seeking, or of Great Britain's seeking. It was forced upon us by a dictator who has dragged others in his train. The war has effectively divided the people of the world into two camps. One camp believes in liberty, freedom of speech and democratic principles; the other is willing and anxious to destroy those things. I quote the following paragraph from a newspaper which expresses my feelings most appropriately : - </para>

                        <para>Hitler ling a new order - one based on bloodshed, military dictatorship, and the subjugation of small nations. Mussolini has one too, the essentials of his new order being his own personal glorification and the construction of an Italian Empire, existing at Hitler's pleasure. Nearer home, Japan fondly contemplates a new order for Asia, in which the Japanese would dominate nil the Eastern races  . . Tt is to be hoped that we are not fighting merely to preserve the present order, but that we will join in the fashion, and evolve yet another brand new order, quite the antithesis of Hitler's. In it, there must be no poverty, no unemployment, no slums, no social injustice and no starvation wages. </para>
                        <para>Recently a Sunday newspaper which is published in New South Wales contained an article by a well-known writer who was congratulating a newly-born child. Addressing it by name, he said: "Rose, it is wonderfully brave of you to be born into this world ". That is true. I long for the introduction of a " new order " which will require no bravery on the part of people if they wish to fill their dwellings with happy, laughing, loving little children. I wish to see a world made fit not. only for heroes but also, for every one, men and women and above all, little children. Lest my suggestions be regarded as inadequate because they happen to emanate from me, I should like to support them by quoting the opinions of some authorities, at whom honorable senators opposite will not sneer. One of the most hopeful signs at the moment is the fact that the churches of Australia and of other countries, particularly of Great Britain, are declaring that a " new order " must be introduced. The Reverend <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ryan,</inline> addressing the congregation at High "Mass in St. Mary'3 Cathedral, stated- </para>
                        <para>The present social order was a ghastly failure in Australia and in every country in the civilized world. </para>
                        <para>I invite honorable senators to heed that remark. Whatever we-do in the war effort during the .coming months, let us not be so blinded by the present awful tragedy that we do not  forsee  an even greater tragedy which must occur when war is over, unless we begin now to plan for a better state of society. The Reverend <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ryan</inline> continued - </para>
                        <para>The failure of the social order was not accidental. It was natural and inevitable. Industrial capitalism was and remains essentially unjust. The class war and general social unrest are the Dead Sea fruit of injustice. Social justice demands just distribution of goods among the people to whom those goods naturally belong. To fail in that distribution, as industrial capitalism has failed, is a crime. </para>
                        <para>A lady addressing herself to the same subject, said - </para>
                        <para>While we plan for the destructive tasks of war we should also plan for the creative tasksof peace, and she referred to malnutrition amongst children while food is destroyed, aged people who live on a meagre pension, sick who lack medical attention, and families growing up in overcrowded slums, bag huts and unemployed camps. Our watchwords, therefore, must be co-operation, not competition; public service, not private profit. Yet to achieve our new order, we must realize that after the war "the monopolists who own the machinery of production- and distribution, who control our monetary system, who even shape our thoughts, as they also own the press and the radio", will not become converted overnight to the principles they now refuse to accept. They will give up their power only if they are forced to do so by the force of public opinion, but, as public opinion oan be swayed, it is the task of the leaders in all working-class organizations to bring unity amongst the masses, to educate them to think and act alike so that when they speak, they speak with one voice. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have read those quotations only because they epitomize successfully my thoughts upon these subjects. The words recall to my mind: speech after: speech which has been delivered in this chamber by the Opposition.How often havewe said that private profit must give way to public benefit;, that there must be no "haves" and "have nots " in. the one community ; and that we should work for the abolition, of slums, unemployment and poverty?Repeatedly, we have directed attention to the destruction of those things which the people need for health, comfort and satisfactory physical development'. To our representations the reply is invariably, given thatsuch conditions mustcontinue. But, they continue for only one reason, namely, that the present social order is based on injustice and class exploitation. The Government must plan for victory not only in war but also in the peace that will follow the conclusion of hostilities. </para>
                    <para>I shall now referto several items which come within the scope of: practical politics at the moment. On the notice paper in my name . stands a question which, I presume, will be answered some day. The, question relates to the admission into the Royal Australian Air Force and other services of women who are paid a proportion of the wages which a man would receive for doing similar work. Honorable senators will be interested to learn that the Westminster City Council has agreed tha.t women employed as war-time motor-drivers and street-sweepers shall, during a probationary period of four months, be paid 75 per cent, of the male wage and thereafter the full rate. It is unnecessary to wait for the introduction of the " new order " before adopting a similar practice in Australia. If women are pressed into service - and some of them are doing wonderful work- they should receive the full rate of pay after serving a probationary period. At most jobs to which women turn their hands, they are as efficient as men. </para>

I emphasize that, in the opinion of the Labour party, womenshould not be employed in any capacity in connexion withour war effort unless they be paid the same rate of wages aswas paid to men previously employed on similarwork. In other words,we stand for equal pay for the sexes. </para>

                    <para>The Supply Bill now under consideration calls for little comment.I am hopeful that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> will have an opportunity to enlarge upon the point which I now propose to raise. As I have already said, the Oppositionwill agree to the passage of the measure. We know that it is necessary to give the Government Supply for the nexttwo months. However, I shall stress a few facts which have an indirect, but none the less important, bearing on the financing of our war effort. The public debt of Australia at present is £1,402;000,000: That is a stupendous figure, but, of course, it will increase still further.. It represents roughly an average of £237 <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> of our population. There must come a breaking point beyond. Avhich. it will be impossible for us to go. I do not propose to discuss in detail the method by which the Governmen t is financing thewar.It is using, to some degree, each of three methods,twoofwhich are orthodox and the third unorthodox. In my opinion, it is not using the third, namely, the utilization of national credit for national needs, so much as it should. However, the point I stress is that, so far as I can see, only one section, of the community willcome out of thewar showing a profit. That section can he simply classified under the heading profiteers. I wish to know whether the Government is prepared to consider a drastic reduction of the rate of interest being paid for loans floated forwar purposes. The Government of Great Britain has just floated a loan of £500,000.000 at 2 per cent. When is this </para>

                    <para>Under the bill -we are asked to appropriate £15,141,000. , That amount is one-sixth of the sum which has already been voted by Parliament for the financial year 1940-41. The Treasurer, in his second-reading speech, indicated that, except for a small increase of expenditure on defence and war services, no new expenditure is contemplated, and that the Government does not intend to depart from its  present  policy. </para>
                    <para>I congratulate the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Poll)</inline> and, of course, the Government, upon the fact that, at last, action is being taken, although somewhat belatedly, to clear away the slum dwellings at Molonglo, and also to improve the dwellings at Causeway. As I have repeatedly raised these matters in this chamber, I am glad to see that a great improvement is now being effected. However, I cannot congratulate the Government upon its continued expenditure in respect of rentals of buildings to bouse various departments and officials of this Parliament in each of the capital cities, including Canberra. The amount expended annually in rentals of such premises would provide the interest on the capital cost of erecting buildings in 'Canberra to overcome the Government's difficulty in providing not only its own accommodation, but, also adequate housing for the people of Canberra. </para>

                            <para>- I am. aware of that fact. In certain departments, such as the Electoral Branch and the Pensions Department, the Commonwealth must maintain substantial staffs in the capital  cities.  However, the proportion of the money new- being paid for rent of leased premises which could be saved would be sufficient to pay the interest on the capital cost of new buildings in Canberra. In this matter, I object not only to the payment of rent to profiteering landlords but also the Government's breach of faith with lessees who have taken up holdings in Canberra. The Government made a very definite promise to those people when they took up leases in the Australian Capital Territory that it would do all in its power to make Canberra the capital of the Commonwealth in fact as well as in name. But it has failed to keep that promise. Every member of the Opposition in this Parliament keenly regents the removal of the head-quarters of the Pensions Department to Sydney. That is one of the most unsatisfactory decisions yet taken by this Government. Members of this Parliament generally found the existence of the head-quarters of that department in Canberra to be most convenient. Very frequently the Deputy Commissioners in the different States cannot finally decide many matters which we bring under their notice. We found that Ave could conveniently take up such matters with the head-quarters of the department during our stay here. That procedure  will  11OW be no longer possible and it will be most unfair to have members of Parliament obliged to refer such matters to the head office in the capital city of any one State. Very strong representations were made by the Opposition in an endeavour to dissuade the Government from transferring the head-quarters of the Pensions Department to Sydney. I suppose, of course, that the Minister has to obey the Government in a matter of that kind, and so we have been told that the transfer was  unavoidable.  However, Ave still hold the opinion that the old arrangement should be' continued, and I have no doubt that the time will come when we shall be able, as a government, to revert to that arrangement. </para>

                            <para>- That is the point. Let me state briefly what happened in Brisbane  when  the Cabinet met there. On arrival in that city, publicity officers surrounded Ministers with a halo of glory. However, Cabinet met for only a few hours, and then announced that certain things would be done to  the direct nd vantage of Queensland. But those decisions had 'been decided upon before Cabinet went to Brisbane. The practice of holding Cabinet meetings in the various capital cities is entirely wrong. Pt amounts to sabotaging  the National Capital, and is also an insult to the intelligence- of the electors of the State in whose capital city the Cabinet meeting, is held. </para>

                    <para>On every side in Canberra one notices congestion. Ever since I have been a member of the Senate, there has been a waiting list of 400 applicants  for  homes. Certainly, the Government is building houses, but the fact remains that the waiting list is never reduced j simply because this  job  is  not  being done efficiently. Whenever, this matter was raised in the past, the Government excused its failure to deal effectively with it by saying that sufficient money was not available. That fallacy, however, cannot be exploited io-day ; we know now that the Government can get sufficient money  for  that purpose. </para>
                    <para>I also protest very definitely against the continued encroachment upon the accommodation provided for honorable members in Parliament House. It is an insult to every member of Parliament, and particularly to senators, that Parliament House is increasingly becoming a. secretariat. I again remind, the Government that, as from the 1st July next, it will not be able to ignore our protest in matters of this kind. When the numerical strength of the Opposition in this chamber is increased as from that date, we .shall .bo able to ;insist that Parliament House be preserved for the use and:  work  of members of Parliament, which is the specific object for which it  was  built. </para>
                    <para>I ask the Leader of the Senate to make available to each honorable senator a copy of the statement which he made to-night dealing.  with  the  new  ministerial appointments and ministerial representation in this chamber. </para>
                    <para>I revert to the thought to which I was giving expression before the suspension of -the sitting. At the moment we have to be properly realistic and have to bend our efforts to the  Avar  with the hope and. prayer that it will end in our victory,  but  I stress again that the  Avar  will have  been  entirely futile if out of the ruins  Ave  are not able to build a better  world.  The working class, of which we on this side of the chamber are members and representatives, has more to lose than -any other section of tha community if this war does not,  end in  our victory. 'For the last <inline font-style="italic">i&gt;0</inline> years, at least, the working class has been developing in this country a standard of living which is. probably bettor  than  that in any other country, but  Ave  have not come  Avi.th.in  .measurable distance of what  Ave believe  to be our just rights as members of a civilized community. Not only  have Ave  standards to preserve, but  also Ave  hops that, as the years pass,  Ave  shall be able to improve those standards and bring, a better life to everybody. If the  Avar  be lost by us, we shall have lost that opportunity. Regardless of nationality, political views and religious beliefs, </para>
                    <para>Ave  must band together to seize the opportunity that to-day presents to institute a  new  social order. To-day is the only time; yesterday »has passed, and. tomorrow may never come. The truly great is he who -works each day to make a better to-morrow. That is not something said merely, for effect; it is a statement which I should like to make with the same fervour as I am using now if  it  were the last speech I had the opportunity to make. I enjoin all honorable senators, especially those opposite, to bear in mind  AA-hat  I have said and to remember that it is the duty of everybody each day to contribute towards the establishment, after this world tragedy has passed, of a  new  order in  which  there will be no unemployment, no  poverty,  no slums, and none of those things which disgrace our civilization to-day. The new order will come, not by chance, but as the result of the active participation in its establishment of every one of goodwill in the community. </para>

                        <para>.- It is in no spirit" of carping, criticism . tha t I refer to some matters connected with Australia's  Avar  effort. In. these anxious times criticism is only permissible if an improvement be sought. Many employees at the munition factories near Melbourne are concerned at the slowness- of output from these factories. I do not know whether the cause is the inclination  of  some employees to ease down, the lack of machine tools or a temporary shortage of essential  raw material; it, perhaps, is a combination of all three. It would he ungenerous not to give credit to the responsible Minister, the Director-General of Munitions and his associates for the progress made in the herculean task set them shortly after the outbreak of war. Australia has cause to be proud of them and the "overall" army, but the time has arrived when we should cease patting ourselves on the back for what has been accomplished in the production of war equipment, and cone :n tra te on a "flatout " effort, brushing aside all obstacles to that end. The. Government has the power and should use it ruthlessly. </para>

                    <para>Many times in this chamber I have advocated a fully equipped army of 400,000 men plus a powerful air force for Australia's defence. The war has now been in progress for 21 months, and the objective has not yet, been reached. Setting aside the protection of the Navy, which has a specific role to fill, I liken the defence of this country to the letter Y. one fork being in the Middle East, the other in the Near East, and the stem, thicker and sturdier, in Australia. I. include in the general term " army " the air force, as it was included in the last war. The air force is as much a part of the land forces as are tanks, armoured cars_ and artillery. Apparently no difficulty exists in the recruiting of personnel for the Royal Australian Air Force. whereas the Army, both at home and overseas, is  scarching  for men. The reason is not an insufficiency of man-power, because thousands are looking on when a man's job awaits them. The Government must accept share of the blame for the stalemate. In his broadcast speech, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> forecast an improvement. From time to time Government, spokesmen give the impression that men do not matter, and that equipment and more equipment are paramount. None but a fool would minimize the importance of adequate equipment, but the provision and development of both equipment and men must take place side by side. We were driven from Crete not only because we lacked equipment, but also because of lack of men and air co-operation. In the circumstances, air co-operation was impossible, and before this war is won there will be more occa-  910ns when air protection will not be forthcoming. Superiority of fighting equipment did not drive our splendid troops to the evacuation beaches, it was the constant stream of airborne enemy troops which overwhelmed General  Freyberg's  men. Numbers of trained and well-equipped men are essential when an important, objective has to be attained or a vital locality held. Brigadier Inglis, who was General Freyberg's right-hand man in the defence of Crete, is now in London hammering that home to the authorities. But are we never to learn the lesson? Amidst all the clamour for war equipment, no emphasis is placed on the necessity to maintain the Australian Imperial Force abroad at full strength. Of what good, is equipment if battalions are so reduced in  numbers  and so exhausted by doing, double duty that they cannot effectively use that equipment?" Australia must back up the Australian Imperial Force with men as well as with equipment. The diggers of 1941 must not be put in the same position as the diggers of 1918 of looking over a. shoulder and saying, " When will they come, where are they?" The men who brought the German  panzer divisions in Greece to a standstill, who sank the Italian cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Bartolomeo</inline><inline font-style="italic">Collconi,</inline> who are bringing the Nazi airmen down to earth, and who are defying the Germans to take Tobruk, arc the real defenders of our democracy. Some people in this country who have an anti-British outlook read of the Crete campaign and immediately claimed that it was another Gallipoli in which the British had given the Anzacs the brunt of the work. To such people I point out that during the eight months of the Gallipoli campaign the Australian Imperial Force lost 26,094 men killed and wounded, whilst the British lost 119,696. Those are official figures and may be found on page 4.04, Vol. II. of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. C.</inline> E. W. Bean's <inline font-style="italic">Official History of Australia in the War of</inline> 1914-18. They should silence some of those croakers whose whisperings are having a prejudicial effect on Australian Imperial Force recruiting. If I were asked for some of the reasons for the stalemate in recruiting for the Australian </para>
                    <para class="block">Imperial Force, I should say, first, that the constant placing on a pedestal of the " 6ver-a.ll army" whose job, important though it may be, is a sinecure compared with that of the sailors, soldiers, airmen. and merchant seamen overseas, is having an adverse effect. Secondly, crowds of men of military age are employed in the Defence Department and in the Public .Service generally. A ruthless combing out must be undertaken sooner or later. With the situation overseas so desperate, the feelings of no one can be spared. Prospective recruits ask themselves, " Why should I risk my life when these eligible men are in cushy jobs for the duration?" Thirdly, there has been delay on the part of the Government in amending the Commonwealth Public Service Act to extend to returned soldiers preference to cover the present war. The men now serving in the forces are not concerned so much with the rate of pay which they are receiving as with. obtaining an assurance that when they return some permanent occupation will bc open to them. I was pleased to hear from the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collett),</inline> who, incidentally, we are all pleased to hear has been given full ministerial rank, that the Repatriation Department has been able to place in employment the majority of soldiers now returning from overseas. ' I should like to know,  however, whether those positions are permanent. I am inclined to doubt it. Provision should be made in the Commonwealth Public Service Act to make it obligatory for the Commonwealth Public Service Board to give priority in permanent status to the young men who are now making such heavy sacrifices. No more permanent appointments should be made until the termination of the war, and young men who are now consolidating their positions in Government departments should be told that their appointments are only temporary. Lastly, there is the rate of pay of men in the lower ranks of the services. The men now overseas are serving not so much for the pay as the cause, but eligible recruits are hanging back because the Australian Imperial Force rate of pay has  not risen equivalently with the wages in Australia. The soldiers have no unions to plead and fight their cases for them. It is up to the Government to revise the Australian Imperial Force rates of pay. I am the treasurer of a fund known as the Returned Soldiers League War Service Fund and occasionally we have to pay; out £3 or £4 - in one case it was £10 - to the mother or wife of a man who is overseas, in order to make sure that the rent is paid. We should not have to do that. It is no use shutting our eyes to the fact  that recruiting has not been satisfactory during the past few months. Perhaps the Prime Minister's broadcast dealing with the desperate situation overseas and the statement of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> that operations in the Middle East are of vital importance to Australia's safety, might induce some eligible young men to realize their responsibilities. I should like the Minister representing the Minister for the Army to tell me who is the officer at Army head-quarters who has advised the Minister that an exAustralian Imperial. Force officer who is a little more than 50 years of age has no place in Australia's defence scheme. Such an officer might be too old for the Australian Imperial Force or the Militia, but. surely a useful task can be found for him. .Shortly after the outbreak of war, many middle-aged officers and non-commissioned officers were called up ostensibly for the duration of the war. They sold their businesses or arranged for them to bo carried on in their absence, but about a month ago, they were sent polite letters stating that their services were no longer required. They wanted younger men. That ' is a waste of good man-power, and I suggest to the Minister that the capabilities of every applicant should be fully considered. I am not talking now of the misfits or square pegs in round holes. I am talking of capable men whose services should be used to the limit. </para>
                    <para>I am glad to see that the Minister has called for a report on the conditions of certain garrison units which are scattered all over Australia. Some of them comprise only 10, 20 or perhaps 30 men. They are living under conditions which can hardly be regarded as satisfactory. An unlined hut with a small brazier or oil stove might have been all right on  the western front during the last war when nothing could be done about it, but here in Australia, thesemiddle-aged men who are doing a good job and will' be doing it for the duration, of the war, are entitled to the same accommodation as is provided for the Militia or Australian Imperial Force in the bigger camps. I hope that the Ministerwilllookinto that matter and. "tick off" whoever has been responsible for failing to provide better conditions for these men. </para>
                    <para class="block">There is a rising tide of public opinion in favour of the appointment of a commander-in-chief of Australia's home defence army - a man with the Monash drive and imagination, who could gather together the more orlessisolated commands and divisions, complete their training, and so make them readytotakethe field. He should be provided with a staff thoroughly acquainted with their duties. Divisions and commands are at present under the control of the Military Board. I know the multitudinous nature of the duties which fall upon that body. So far, they have done splendid work; but they have not the personal touch so necessary in welding an army into an efficient fighting force. I should say, too, that the Royal Australian Air Force should be brought under the control of this commander-in-chief. We should then be assured of co-operation between the two services should trouble come nearer to our shores. We do not want a repetition of the lack of co-operation' demonstrated in the Middle East. I suggest that the Government recall LieutenantGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Blarney to take up this duty. Hehas first-hand knowledge of modern war technique.  His  duties as General Officer Commanding the Australian Imperial Force in the Middle East could easily be taken over by either General Mackay or General Lavarack. He has a command which I regard as superfluous at the present time, that of.  Deputy  Commander-in-Chief of the forces in the Middle East. He could be far better employed in gathering together the different sections of a home defence army. The Government should not leave the matter in abeyance until trouble is upon us. There are no declarations of war in these days, and the Government should not. be caught napping. I hope that the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> will be disposed to take some little notice of these observations. </para>

                        <para>. -  I listened with interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> and I am confident that he at least understands the position. That is understandable in view of the worthy part that he played in the last war. The honorable senator who wanted to know what is wrong with recruiting, suggested as a solution the application of economic conscription to Commonwealth public servants. Apparently the idea is that employees- of the Commonwealth Public Service should be informed that their jobs are only temporary, regardless of the good service they have rendered and are still rendering to the Commonwealth. In other words they are to be marked down for slaughter or their jobs will be taken away from them. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> and the Government do not appreciate fully the real cause of the decline in recruiting. If there has been a lag in recruiting the Government is entirely responsible for it. Some years ago in New South Wales there was formed what was known as the New Guard. That body set itself up in the form of a Fascist orNazi organization. Its members believed that Hitler was the only man who could do any good for the world. The head man of the New Guard - the man who made all the bullets fired by Eric Campbell - is now the Director-General of Recruiting, Major-General H. W. Lloyd. The fanatic who wanted to upset constitutional government in New South Wales ; the man who created a sensation by cutting the ribbon at the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and was placed in an asylum for his stupidity,De Groote, is now advising the Government in regard to itsmilitary transport system. The workers of Australia remember these people and always will remember them. Theybelieve; as I do, that should Hitler win this war, he would not send Germansheretorun the country, but would- establish a. puppet government consisting of the Lloyds, De Grootes and Campbells in this country. As I said some time ago, the right place for these people is in an internment camp, and not in our military system. Until the Government is prepared to remedytlie present state of a iia i rs, the working people cannot be expected to offer their services. We on this side of the chamber arc well aware that there is a lag in recruiting; the Government has admitted it. What else could be expected in view of the fact that our troops in Greece and Crete were not fully equipped? 'We know that they had no equipment for the first six months of their stay in Palestine. They fought the campaign right through Libya to Benghazi with equipment supplied by the British Government, but, in the face of a swift thrust by the Italian and German forces, that territory was lost. Then our forces went to Greece without full equipment. Every man on the . Government side of the chamber knows that. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> said so, and the newspapers have said so. The point I wish to make is that despite the fact that our soldiers have been fighting with inferior equipment, there has been a hold-up of the supply of material for the manufacture of arms and munitions. There has been a shortage of aluminium for the building of aeroplanes, yet those in charge of our war effort are apparently prepared to allow the Main Roads" Board of New South Wales to pack the edges of its bitumen roads with bauxite, the Ore from which aluminium is produced. No attempt was made by the Government to increase the rate of production of war equipment until pressure was brought to bear upon it. by the Advisory War Council and members of the Labour party in the House of Representatives. It had not built, or even planned to build, <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> single tank, although the tank is one of the most important items of military equipment required in this war. The Government has fallen down on its job and has failed to direct the war effort in a proper manner, lt, has depended upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorpe</inline> and others of their kind to carry on, and they have not done a very good job. I trust, that the newly appointed. Ministers will make prompt decisions and put them into effect so that the welfare of the diggers will be promoted as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> has requested. In the interests of recruiting the Government should change its attitude towards members of our armed forces. I have here the case of a. man named Dunstan who served in the war of  1914-18.  It was brought to my notice by Lieutenant-Colonel <inline font-style="italic">F.</inline> S. McClean, who was an artillery officer in the last war. The Repatriation Commissioner refused Dunstan's application for a military pension, whereupon he wrote to the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collett).</inline> Some time later the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> forwarded to him a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett,</inline> dated the 12th June, 1941, which stated, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia -</inline></para>

                            <para>- TheGovernment's promises to the returned soldiers have not been kept. I have told the honorable gentleman before what the returned soldiers thinks of this Government. I have before me details of the treatment meted out to Sapper James Clarke, No. NX9187, of the 2/1 Field Company, Engineers'. Clarke left Australia as an expert tradesman, in a railway unit. He served abroad for a considerable time and then became sick-. When he entered hospital he was informed that he was no longer an expert, but an ordinary private, and consequently his pay was reduced from 7s. 9d. a day to 5s. 9d. a day, and the Government claimed from him the sum of £14 for amounts overpaid. According to his fieldcard he was then suffering from dyspepsia. When he returned from abroad he was told that he might apply to the Repatriation Department for a war pension. He lodged an application but received' the following reply from the Repatriation Commission :  - </para>

                    <para>  With reference to your claim forpayment of awar pension, you are informed that the Repatriation Board has fully considered the application but is unable to accept your condition of Gastritis as being, due to or materially aggravated by your war service. You are therefore ineligible to receive medical or pension benefits in respect thereof, but' if you so desire you may appeal against this decision. </para>
                    <para class="block">That letter was d ated the 4th April, 1941. He considers that the commission has tricked him, because he was physically fit when he enlisted, as he passed all of the searching medical tests-. He went back to the Railways Department in order to secure his former civil position, but theRailways Commissioner said that because he had enlisted without official permission his job was no longer available to him.. Then he went to the Repatriation. Commission, and claimed thatashe had no job he was entitled to receive sustenance for his wife and three children. He was told that he was not entitled to sustenance because he was receiving a pension of £1 a week for his service in the war of 1914.-18. I feel sick when I hear all this prattle about what the Government is doing for returned soldiers. I have here another case relating to A. Middleton, who served with the Army for eight months. He attended an officers' training school, where the study preyed upon his mind to such a degree that he became mentally deranged. The military authorities sent him to Broughton Hall, but they dischargedhim from the Army before they did so. On the 20th, January of this year,  Colonel M.  W. Logan, commanding officer of the Details Discharge Depot, wrote to his father in the following terms: - </para>

                        <para>With reference to your telephone conversation of to-day, it is regretted that it was found necessary to send Private Middleton to the Reception House. Apparently he is suffering from a, nervous breakdown and is not exactly responsible for what ho says according to the Regimental Medical Officer. He is very worried as to what is going to happen to his wife and children and although he asks that his wife be notified, it would probably be better if you could see her and explain the position. The sum of£116s. is due to him for final pay and this will be held by the Paymaster until 'such time as Private Middleton is lit to receive it. </para>

                    <para class="block">Middleton had submitted himself to all of the medical tests and had been passed as physically fit. He did not become mentally deranged until after he had entered the officers training school. When this occurred our so-called kindly military system discharged him and disclaimed any further responsibility for him. I ask the Minister to review this case. I understand that shortly after he was admitted to the mental hospital  Middleton's  promotion to the rank of lieutenant was approved. When he was taken to the hospital at Lewisham he mct <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bond,</inline> who was one of the three medical- officers who discharged him. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bond</inline> said : " I am sorry, old man. We thought you were malingering. You are a very sick man. I am sorry that action was taken regarding you." Morally, Middleton still belongs to the military system,  and his care should be the responsibility of the Government. I trust that his case will be reconsidered and that his wife, who is receiving only__a food allowance from the State Government, will be provided with the compensation to which she is entitled. Sapper Clarke, to. whom I referred earlier, told me that he could bring twenty cases similar to his own to my attention. I said that one case should be sufficient. I assure the Minister that if justice is not given to these men I shall bring many more cases before the attention of this chamber at an early date. </para>
                    <para>Another injustice affecting members of the Australian Imperial Force was brought to my notice in a letter which I received from a soldier now serving in Palestine. He complains that the Egyptian Government charges ls. each as postage for letters sent by air mail by members of the Australian Imperial Force. The ordinary charge levied on a field post card is 3d., whereas during the war of 1914-18 soldiers were not required to put stamps on field cards. I ask the Government to rectify this position, and I shall be pleased to hear of the steps that it. proposes to take. I shall not deal further with the deficiencies of our war effort at the present time. I shall wait in order to see what actions are taken by the newly appointed Ministers. </para>
                    <para>I wish to bring to the notice of the Government once again the case of Cap tain Conway, for nothing has yet been done about it. Honorable senators will remember that a select committee of the Senate recommended that an <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline> payment of £100 should be made to Captain Conway. When the war broke out Captain Conway offered his services at the Victoria Barracks, but he felt, from the treatment that he received, that he was not wanted. He thereupon wrote to the then Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street),</inline> who replied to the effect that there was no bias against him and that as soon as a suitable position could be found for him he would be appointed to it. No position has been found. Captain Conway has written to each new Minister for the Army, but, so far, without any success. On one occasion Captain Conway and I interviewed the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> and he said that he considered that Conway ought to receive the £100 which the Senate select committee recommended should be paid to him. We know that later <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spender</inline> denied that he had made any such statement. Subsequently, Captain Conway wrote to the Acting Prime Minister and requested that the money should be paid to him. He was told to apply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spender</inline> for payment and he did so, but without result. Seven Ministers have examined Captain Conway's submissions and always the same story has been told. Captain Conway has been treated in a despicable fashion. Certain charges against him, which appeared in his file, were ordered by General Bruche to be erased, but instead of that being done, four copies of a certain letter were put in different places in his file. Only a thin red line was drawn through the blue printing of the parts of the letter to which objection had been taken. Conway was undoubtedly the subject of a gross libel and, in my opinion, is fully entitled to the <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline> payment recommended to be made to him.

                    <para>At the suggestion of the Treasurer, the  Hon.  A. W. Fadden, the following is forwarded for your information and consideration. </para>
                    <para>In your recent letters to the Treasurer and the  Hon.  J. A. Beasley, you attempt to explain with incredible inconsistency and flagrant falsehood, what the  Hon.  Allan MacDonald described as the contemptible conduct of the Government which refused to accept a verdict of the Senate in my favour, when, as a Minister, a lieutenant-colonel, and a King's. Counsel, you are expected to respect truth and justice. </para>
                    <para>You informed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator S.</inline> K. Amour, in my presence, that the Government should comply with the decision of the Senate. Youconveyed the impression to the  Hon.  Allan MacDonald. that it was the Government and not you that refused' to honour the verdict of the Senate; and you tried to convince the Treasurer and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beasley.</inline> that. I had not suffered any injustice by falsely stating, that my grievance was imaginary. </para>
                    <para>When Minister, for Defence, the  Hon..  J. B. Chifley, investigated my complaint) he found that I had been slandered, and directed that the slanderous statements be expunged from the records, and yet you. falsely say that. I did not suffer any injustice. It would be interesting to know what you call injustice? </para>
                    <para>Later, the Senate investigated the matter,decided that my services had always been very satisfactory, discovered that the slanderous statements had not been expunged, but had been multiplied, illuminated and distributed in the records, and unanimously agreed that I should receive an appeasement of £100, which the Government declined to pay. </para>
                    <para>In the face of these facts you sabotage truth and justice in order to defeat the Senate, but truth and justice are not so easily defeated) and I draw your attention to. a statement madein the Senate last August by the Leader of the Opposition, the  Hon.  J. S.  Col lings,  who said, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia, "</inline> Conway has provedhis case time after time, and at the first opportunity Labour will see that the verdict of the Senate is fully confirmed". </para>
                    <para>Copies of this letter are being forwarded to the  Hon.  J. S: Ceilings, J. A. Beasley, A. W. Fadden, S. K. Amour and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.Falstein,</inline> M.H.R. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is clear from that letter than Conway feels that he has been treated most unjustly and that he is very incensed thereby. Surely it should be possible to find a position for this man who did meritorious service for the country during the lastwar but was denied the opportunity of going abroad when he was willing to do so. We are now told that he is too old for a job in the Army. </para>

Many of these exAustralian Imperial Force officers are only 42: or 43 years of age, and the experience that they had in the lastwar, would be invaluable to the boyswho are now goingaway, yet they are told that theyaretooold. </para>
                    <para class="block">I  had experience in the lastwar in the 18th Battalion, in which there were some old and some young officers, and it. was notvery happy: The colonel, our battalion major and another major, the adjutantandseven of: our lieutenants wore cashiered for cowardice. Such a situation is not desirable. It is unfortunate that some flunkey in the Army should be permitted to make a decision that has- the effect of preventing old soldiers; some ofwhom are majors and sonic captains, from taking the part that they desire to take in the present Avar. I should like toknow the name of the officerwho made this decision. </para>

I cannot believe that young men who are forced into the Army by a process of economic conscription will ever make good soldiers. </para>
                    <para>I wish also to make reference to the Home Guard to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> referred. The Home Guard is required to look after internees. The internees at the Hay internment camp receive about £1000 a week to which Australia has to contribute £250. These internees are permitted to post letters and parcels of up to 3 lb. free, but the diggers who guard them, for which they receive only a " dollar " a day, are obliged to put stamps on the letters and parcels that they post. Surely the Government could treat the diggers at least as well as it treats the internees. </para>
                    <para>Some time ago, on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, I referred to the supply of blue metal under an Army contract. The Minister for the Army subsequently made a statement to the press to the effect that everything was in order and that there was no need for drastic action. The Minister said that only about 30s. was involved in my complaint. Honorable senators will recollect that I stated that the orders and the receipts for blue metal were invariably signedby officers on behalf of a Ma jor Sinden. It is significant.thatalthoughtheMinister. said that there was nothing.in my complaints, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Sinden</inline> wasremovedfrom his positionshortlyafter the Minister made his press statement. Ifthere was. nothing in my complaints, why was <inline font-weight="bold">Major Sinden</inline> relieved of his responsibilities? Apparently, at some quiet moment, on a dark -night, he was just pushed out of the way. Naturally, he feels that aninjustice has been done to him. He was a director of three companies and considers that he had the requisite ability to do the job that was entrusted to him. I contend that all the circumstances of this case show that he was not given a fair deal. If only a sum of 30s. was involved, as stated by the Minister, I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Major Sinden</inline> should have been "sacked". </para>

                    <para>I remind the Senate that some time ago I asked a question regarding the Abbco Bread Company Proprietary Limited. The Minister for the Army did not reply for some considerable time, and when he did so he was evasive and made no admissions. He told the Senate that everything was in order. A censure motion was moved in the Parliament of New South Wales, and a royal commission was appointed to vindicate and whitewash the Minister of Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Treatt,</inline> who had reduced from £1,400 to £500 the fine imposed on. the Abbco Bread Company Proprietary Limited. The Federal Government then appointed a second royal commission. Yet. when I first raised the matter : the Minister for the Army saidthateverything was in order. He made the samestatement in regard to the supply of metal. The Government further announced that itintended to arraign the boot manufacturers before the court; but they have not yet been brought before the court. I wonder when action will be taken against those people! Such persons should be arrested and put in gaol like common thieves, and tried immediately. They should be put where they' would not be able to make further profits for the duration of this war. That is what would be done to a man who stole a loaf of bread in order to feed his hungry children. All the racketeers' who are" making a' fortune out of this war are left unmolested, and for that reason the public has no confidence in the Menzies Government, and there is a lag in recruiting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> should make sure of what is the cause of the slackening of munition production in Melbourne, and not leave the inference to be drawn that the employees are responsible. I have evidence which proves that men who are working in munition establishments are just about at the end of their physical resources. They have very little time off, and in many instances work twelve hours a day. Admittedly, the employees in some industries have not much to do. In fact, most of the munition annexes have had to put. men off, because they have not been able to obtain necessary supplies of raw materials. </para>
                    <para>It is said that the Royal Australian Air Force can obtain plenty of recruits. It would obtain a much larger number if those who offered their services and were prepared to proceed overseas in any capacity could be trained as pilots, air observers, air gunners or wireless operators. Many of the men who have enlisted, if without a social background, have been detailed to perform the duties of a messman, or have been ordered' to clean up the huts or do the work of a wharf labourer. They havecertainly been, given a uniform. The ordinary civilian should be allowed to do the work of a wharf labourer at a wharf labourer'srate of wage, and applications should be invited for messmen to dothe work of messmen. There are many men who cannot pass the medical test of physical fitness which would enable them to enterthe Air Force, but have the necessary qualifications for this class ofwork. Boys should not be misled into offering their services. I had occasion to make an appeal to the Government in connexion with the messmen at the Richmond aerodrome, and' I understand that' action was- taken in the matter. It is nauseating to men who are in the Air, Force to have to do this class of work. The Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> should take cognizance of the position, and. effect an alteration at the earliest possible moment. There are plenty ofmen who are- unable, because of physical unfitness, to obtain employment in a war industry, but would be prepared to engage in this occupation. The work should be carried out according to the provisions of the hotel and catering employees award or the miscellaneous workers award. Men who obtain entry into the Air Force are proud of the fact, <inline font-style="italic">but</inline> they soon lose their pride when they are asked to scrub floors or to do other work of flunkeys in offices. This is wrong. I ask the Minister for </para>

It bore a large card with the inscription "Because you would not think, we had to die ". Those words are taken from a poem written during the lastwar. Because there has been no constructive thinking since, millions more will have to die. There is no doubt whatever in my mind , that there is a power which can sway governments to its will. I believe that there is no such thing as democracy. We were told by the great Abraham Lincoln that "Democracy is government of the people, by the people, for the people ". It is not logical to contend that the people,' who are said to govern, get whattheywant. Do the people want wars?' They do not; yet we have them. Dothey want poverty, malnutrition, slums? No; yet we have all of those dreadful things, proving conclusively that. we have not democracy as we visualizeit, and that, the people are not governing: George Bernard Shaw was once asked to define political economy, or the art of government; and he said: "Political economy is the art of spendingthe national income in such a way as will bring happiness and prosperity to the greatest number of people."

That is the system which is responsible for all our economic difficulties, for poverty and for the existence of slums, and this is so because the banks can say at, any time how much money there shall be in existence. They have had this power for a long time, ever since 1694. That is the cause of all our economic distress to-day. We are told that if certain things are done they will lead to inflation. That is a meaningless expression. The word should never be used except in conjunction with two other words, " of prices ". We have a Prices Commissioner at the present time. I do not say that his efforts are wholly successful, but he is making some attempt to fix prices. When money is brought into existence by the banks it tends to increase prices; when the banks withdraw money from circulation prices decline. The banks can restrict credit and call up overdrafts, and thus reduce the Volume of money in circulation. So longastheyareabletoexercisethis power, there is no hope of improvement.

                        <para class="block">Commonwealth Bank, the Treasurer refused to tell me. Honorable senators were given to understand that they were not entitled to this information, but the manager of the Bank of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gillespie,</inline> in telling his shareholders of the patriotic efforts of that institution, said that the whole of the £20,000,000 for the first war loan had been subscribed through private banks. It is well known to those who take the trouble to find out that when the loan was subscribed no money was transferred from the banks to the Commonwealth Treasury. All the Government got was the right to draw cheques on the private banks for the various rams which they subscribed. The banks do not lend money. It is fundamental that banks are instituted for the purpose of creating credit. When the war savings certificates scheme was first introduced, the banks were confronted with a difficulty, because it was laid down that no one person could own certificates to a greater value than £250. Then the banks went into the matter and persuaded their employees to become, patriotic, and subscribe' for the purchase of warsavings certificates: It might be more accurate to say that theydemanded that their employeesshoulddoso.Thebanks stopped the cashout of their em- ployees' wages, : and at the end of a certainperiod sent,a cheque to the Treasury for that amount. I know a woman in Hobart whose two children only recently started work. This boy and girl had for a considerable time been walking1½ miles to their work and back again so that they could subscribethe amount representedby their tram fares for the purchase of warsavings certificates. When the banks sell war savings certificates over the counter, the notes or cheques tendered in payment do not reach the Commonwealth Treasury. Not on your life! That money goes into the bank's cash reserves, and a cheque for the total amount received weekly or monthly, as the case may be, is sent to the Commonwealth Treasury. A bank which sells £100,000 of certificates in this way can then lend the Government £1,000,000, because the bank is authorized to lend up to ten times the amount of its cash reserve. I honour the people who are lending their money to the Government by subscribing for war savings certificates-, but that is what happens to it: As a- matter of fact, wars . are not fought on cash, but on- credits. The difference between taxation and credit is this: Taxes must be paid in cash out of earnings or savings, whereas; credits are created. The last war is not paid- for yet. It would- have been, much better if the Government had: devoted the energy which was- expended, upon the raising of the last war. loan, upon the production of essential war equipment. Recently, I heard a professor of- economics, a most conservative man, state that the first 'task of the . Government is notto. raise money to fight' the war ; it should be to- get machines- and war materials. Until', the Government grasps that fact, it willcontinue to waste time. Several days ago I received a note from the Treasurer stating that it was- intended to withdraw permis- . sion. to erect buildings of a smaller value than £5,000, except in special circumstances. That will affect thousands of workers, and inflict great hardship. What sort of a mad system is this under which the Government goes on taxing the -people when it can get the money it needs in the form of credit from the Commonwealth Bank? Many years ago, Abraham Lincoln, the great liberator, said - </para>

                    <para>The measure was referred to the Committee on Ways- and Means-. It is evident', therefore, that I am not standing alone; In the last few years,, the people have been educated. The first State in Australia to grasp the significance of this was South Australia, in which there is a United Australia party Government. By eighteen votes to thirteen, the Parliament of South Australia- passed- a- resolution to petition the 'Governor-General- that the Commonwealth Bank be used to issue interest-free credit for the prosecution of the war, and to assist primary-productions. At my request, the Treasurer of Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dwyer</inline> Gray, placed, a similar motion on. the notice-paper, of- the Tasmanian Parliament, and it- was duly carried. Similar' action was taken later, in Western Australia; and: then, in Queens? land, and recently the Premier of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunstan,</inline> was told by the Victorian Country party, -which keeps him in office, that he should have a similar resolution passed, through, the Parliament of that State. I have an appointment- with Mr; McKell; the Premier of New South Wales, and I believe that I- shall be able to persuade him to put a similar measure through the Parliament of New South Wales. Then all the States- will be unanimous in demanding this reform. Public meetings are being held all over the country to discuss it, and the matter has been taken up by some of the most important newspapers. Recently, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> J. Kelleher, a director of the Bank- of New Zealand, said - </para>

The second is the enemy of perpetual national debt which we have never defeated: </para>

                    <para>What is the secret of Hitler's, " financial miracle " ? Here further' shocks await  us. We find a reversal of our customary rules' and practices. We are buying our financial ammunition from our enemy. . The enemies of this country, and indeed . of every country, are the private banks. They have never created any wealth, but- according to an official report, which was issued a few years ago the.)': held mortgages over the wheat lands of Australia amounting to £161.000,000. Before the war, the' wool-growers' of Australia were so burdened with overdraft and interest costs ' that' they were about to ask the Commonwealth Government for a grant of Id. per lb. on wool. At that time, they owed £175,000,000. How can any country make progress under such a financial system? We must get down to fundamentals. It is axiomatic that there is no effect without a cause. In other words, there is a cause for every effect. How can a nation of a little over 7,000,000 people meet an indebtedness of £1,400,000,000? That is. the position confronting Australia to-day. We are told that, before long Australia's war expenditure will amount to £20,000,000 a month. Does the Government" think that that amount can be obtained from the people by means of taxes? The only three ways by which money can be provided ,are first, by means of taxes; secondly, by borrowing from the private banks, and thirdly, by using the credit of the nation through the medium of. the Commonwealth Bank. I advocate the third, method. When a bill to provide for the acquisition of the apple and pear crop involving a possible expenditure of £750.000 was before this chamber I asked the then Treasurer if the Commonwealth Bank charged interest to the Government. The Treasurer did not reply to me at the time, .but, later, he said that the banks charged the Government interest at the rate of 3¾ per cent. I then asked whether that money did not go back to the Government in the form of hank profit? Of course, it did; and therefore I ark "why charge yourself interest on your own investment"? If I borrow £1 from myself on Mon,lav. what is the use of paying back 22s. 6d. on the following pay day? Yet that is what the Government is doing, and. will continue to do so long as it is dominated by the private banks. </para>
                    <para class="block">In the orthodox way of raising credits for. war purposes or public works, the Commonwealth Government sets out to raise a loan. Who subscribed to that loan? When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> was Commonwealth Treasurer, the Commonwealth attempted to float a loan of £9,000,000, but only £4,850,000 had been subscribed when the loan was closed. Subsequently, I asked how much money was subscribed through the Commonwealth Bank, and how much through the private banks, and I was informed that £3,750,000 had been subscribed through the private banks. We are paying interest on that money to-day. I have mentioned in this chamber before that the annual interest bill on the first war loan of £20,000,000 amounts to over £600,000 per annum. Why do we pay that money? It is inexplicable that the Government should continue to plunge the nation into debt year after year, thereby necessitating the imposition of heavy  taxes which the people find difficulty in providing. In order to meet demands made on them to provide interest, on borrowed money, the people are forced to deny themselves food, clothing and shelter. I emphasize that that is done in order to meet the exorbitant demands of the banks which do not lend money. That is a fundamental of banking - that they do not lend money. I have had experience of that in my own business. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> G. Hawtrey, exsecretary of the British Treasury, writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</inline> said that banks are institutions for the creation of credit, which they create out of nothing. No man can have his views printed in the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</inline> unless he is an acknowledged authority on the subject of which he writes. I suggest that the Government should do the sensible and honourable thing in carrying out its war effort, and not allow that effort to be hampered by want of money, or credit. 'We have become accustomed to speaking of money, whereas the fact is that, except in a limited way, we do not use money at all. The latest, statement issued by the Commonwealth Bank in connexion with the note issue states that the private banks together hold notes to the value of only £15,000,030. The rest of their money consists of silver and copper. It does not follow that that money belongs to the banks- because the money, in every account in credit belongs to a  customer,  not to the bank. Yet the banks have been able to buy, by means- of cheques, war bonds and treasury-bills to the value of  £67,000,000.  Although I have said these things over and. over again, and notwithstanding the high standing of authorities- whom I have cited my words must have fallen on deaf ears, because no changehas taken place. I shall, conclude by reminding the Leader of the Senate that I am still willing to show the Government how to fight the war with interest-free money. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline></para>

                        <para>. - During, the last twelve months we have listened, to speeches by various' Ministers in this Parliament; broadcasts by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and others as well as statements  in newspapers advocating an all-in war effort: I take it that this Supply Bill' has been introduced in order to finance, for- a. time, what the Government would like to have us believe is an all-in war effort. I believe that honorable senators- on both sides of' the chamber really desire' an all-in war effort in this country, but if that is to be obtained', the Government itself must give a lead to the people. It may be that the Government is-doing its- best  to bring  about that result; if so, I hope to show that its effort to that end can be improved: An all-in war effort would- involve the marshalling of the whole of our resources of man-power- and materials. It would embrace every resource at our. disposal and leave no one out. In order, to bring about that state of- affairs,, sacrifices will have to- be made; and therefore it is essential that action- be- taken to make those sacrifices as-nearly- equalas possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand'</inline> gave some reasons- why more recruits arc not coming forward. I shall give other reasons.One reason is that' the sacrifices demanded of the people are not equal. The Royal-' Australian Air Force is- urgently in- need of recruits, and therefore I submit that every encouragement should be given to men to enlist in that branch of our fighting forces. . A- young man who desires to join the Royal Australian Air Force is told that all of- his- expenses incurred in travelling to the nearest examination centre will be paid. It is true that he is provided with a railway pass, and expenses to cover one meal, but should he have to travel any considerable distance in. order to be examined, it may be necessary for him to be absent from home overnight, in which event he must pay for his own accommodation and meet other expenses which are necessarily incurred.  His  expenses are not paid until he has- been accepted. If rejected, he would ofcourse, have his return railway ticket. </para>

                    <para>In my opinion, boys who are keen to serve their country are not treated fairly. It has been the policy of' the Government to send books to every young fellow who enlists- in the Royal Australian Air Force, in order to fit him to pass certain examinations- before he is accepted; Many of' these boys are working; in fairly heavy jobs which impose a heavy strain- upon them both physically and mentally. After a hard day's work, the- strain of studying, in order to pass these examinations- may have a- detrimentaleffect upon their health, especially their eyesight. I know of some young fellows- who, because of their keenness, have strained their eyesight studying at night, whilst others have suffered nervous breakdowns. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the Army. In the Militia Forces we already have conscription of man-power. Although the young men who- are compelled to enter military camps have (constant employment up to the time they go into training; many of them have no jobs when they come out of camp. I have in mind the case of a young man who enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force: After he had been passed in Hobart he returned to his employment in his- home town for a week or two, but  when his employer discovered that he would probably be losing the services of this man within six months he engaged another man. Every week eases of this kind come under notice. When complaints about the loss of job3 through absence in camp are made to officers in the Defence Forces, one of the first questions asked is. "Have you tried to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force?" If the men have done that, and have been rejected, their officers may endeavour to have them reinstated in their former employment, but I do not know whether they would try to help lads who had not offered themselves for service overseas. Unfair treatment of this kind does not encourage young men to enlist. I support remarks by honorable senators who have said that the members of some of the recruiting staffs are not quite fitted for that work. We are told that about 1,500 <inline font-style="italic">men</inline> are lined up in a militia training camp, and an officer invites those who desire to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force to step forward. When recruits were not as numerous as one officer would like, he was heard to say: " Those of you who are not prepared to step out and join the Australian Imperial- Force to defend this country are nothing but curs, and your fathers and other relatives before you were nothing but curs ". That is the kind of statement made by recruiting officers in front of militiamen. </para>

                    <para>When adjustments of the basic wage are made, in consequence of increases of the cost of living, the increase should be passed on to members of the fighting forces as well as to employees. in industry. The dependants of a  soldier  cannot live any more cheaply than the family of a man employed in a munition factory. If the members of the Militia were called upon to fight they would do so, and, if necessary, they would sacrifice their lives on the field of battle. Since we compel mcn to serve in the defence of Australia, and, if necessary, to pay the supreme sacrifice, it would be equally fair to apply compulsion. to the wealthy, and call upon them to provide the money required to enable the soldiers to be paid and equipped with the necessary armaments and munitions. There is no equality of sacrifice if one man has to go into the firing line, and perhaps give his life, whilst another is permitted to enjoy great wealth and luxury, and is not required by law to make any sacrifice. Therefore, the wealthy should lend their money to the Government free of interest for the duration of the war, in order to finance the war effort. If they are not prepared to do that voluntarily, compulsion should be applied. It would be quite as fair to do that as to compel the wage-earners to fight or go into the munition factories. That would be far more equitable than pleading to children to give their pennies for the purchase of war savings certificates. I do not object to compulsion, provided that it is applied to all sections of the community without fear or favour, with the object of obtaining a maximum war effort. The whole of the resources of the nation should be pooled. If the Government sincerely desires an all-in war effort it will have to marshal the national resources of money, materials and manpower. </para>
                    <para>I shall agree to the elimination of nonessential industries if the Government will start at the top. Finance is needed to enable us to utilize our materials and manpower, and I claim that, in pursuance of the policy of eliminating non-essential activities, the Government should reduce the number of trading banks. In most country towns there are six to eight banks, where one would be sufficient. The number in the capital cities is much greater. I shall wholeheartedly support the Government's proposal to restrict nonessential industries if it will undertake to deal with the banks first. Most of the employees of the private banks could be more profitably employed in other directions. If the whole of the wealth of the private banks were concentrated in one bank, the Government would be in a far better position to assess the amount of credit it could issue. At present, it is absolutely impossible to get an accurate estimate of the total credit resources of  the hanks. An all-in -war effort affects practically- every industry in Australia, including the primary industries. Recently, a threatening circularwas distributed amongst the farmers of Tasmania by the  Deputy  Prices- Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnson,</inline> regarding- the fixation of. the price- of- hay. As honorable senators know, primary producers do not always get good- years-; but this- year, owing to- adverse seasonal conditions; the hay crop- has been very poor. In the circular, the  Deputy  Prices. Commissioner states- that-he has been advised- that- many farmers in Tasmania are holding big stacks' of hay on their farms waiting for the price to rise.  His  advisers supplied him with a list of names of farmers who, they said, were withholding their hay from the- market. Two or three of those whose names appear in' the list as holding 20: tons of. hay are, in fact; not holding even- a ton of hay on their farms. That proves that the information supplied to the  Deputy  Prices Commissioner was inaccurate. What right has the  Deputy  Prices Commissioner to fix in only one State the price of a rural commodity which is produced in practically every State in the Commonwealth? </para>

He contends that £5 a- ton is . far above the cost of production and that the fixed price may be considerably less. In stating that hay can be produced this year: for- £3 a ton, the Deputy' Prices Commissioner shows that he does not know the -first thing about his job. As the result, of- adverse weather conditions this year,. many- farmers have cut as little as a half, a ton of hay an acre, and- if the price of hay be fixed even at £5 a ton, they will- not make anything out of it. For  a  number of' years, hay- has brought a remarkably low price. During the lasttwo years- there has-been a heavy fall of the prices of primary products; Victorian farmers- have been selling hay for as low as £1 a ton. - In view of the fact that the crop in Tasmania- this- year is- exceedingly poor, I am at a loss to- understand why the Deputy Prices Commissioner should threaten the farmers- in this way. </para>

Although I . have made a. number of representations to that official regarding- the fixation of the price of various commodities, I have never appealedto State. Ministers because Price Commissioners are controlled by a Commonwealth Minister. The explanation may be that, the Prices Commissioner obtains advice from a committee which is approved' by a State government; but that is merely co-ordinating- assistance. ' In the opinion of Professor Copland and the  Deputy  Commissioner, Mr: Johnson, those bodies function in a. small advisory capacity for the purpose of helping the Prices Commissioner, who is authorized to' accept: or reject their proposals, according to his own judgment. </para>

                    <para>To obtain an all-in war effort, the Government must not discriminate against any particular section of the community. It. must not permit the Prices Commissioner to use his power in order to fix prices which discriminate against a State. Tasmanian farmers would not object to the fixation of a reasonable maximum price for hay, provided the </para>
                    <para class="block">Prices Commissioner also fixed a minimum price to cover the cost of production, and allow a fair margin of profit. In my opinion, maximum and minimum prices should be fixed for all commodities. Although the Commissioner fixed a maximum price for potatoes last season, he declared no minimum price, with the result that farmers received no protection when values fell to a level below the cost of production. A similar experience is almost bound to occur with hay. I protest against the fixation of a price of a commodity, unless the Commissioner is not prepared to be fair in all respects; and I strongly object to this circular, which threatens farmers if they do not comply with the order. </para>
                    <para>Yesterday, the Senate passed legislation to increase the number of Ministers of State. I wholeheartedly supported the measure in the hope that the increased numbers would relieve senior Ministers of some of their heavy duties, enabling them to pay more attention to the activities of the numerous boards and committees under their control. Whenever a new project is undertaken, the Government creates a board to administer it. More administrative responsibility should be given to the elected representatives of the people in this Parliament. Whilst I do not contend that every board and committee could be abolished, many of them could be dispensed with if members of Parliament did their job. They could carry on much of the work that is now performed by boards and committees. The services of private members on the government side of the chamber could be availed of to a much greater extent than is now the practice in' order to assist in administration. They were not elected to. Parliament simply for the purpose of selecting men who wear the old school tie to do the job for them. But it has occurred in many instances in the selection of members for boards and for fighting services. If my suggestion were adopted, private members could examine the activities of various boards, and their inquiries would obviate the necessity to appoint select committees. Many of the private members on the government side, of the chamber possess- the ability to perform such a task. Their  investigations would be not only of real service to the country but also save a good deal of wasteful expenditure. If Ministers had been given the advantage of .such assistance from private members, the appointment of a committee to inquire into the operations of the Apple and Pear Board would have been unnecessary, and I should not have been obliged to appeal to the Senate to appoint a committee to examine matters concerning the growing and processing of flax. If a private member were clothed with sufficient authority, he would have no difficulty in ascertaining whether a board was performing its functions properly and he could report to the responsible Minister any flaws in its administration. That such appointments are urgently required can be demonstrated by one illustration. Although hundreds of tons of apples have been destroyed, supplies of this fruit are scarce in Sydney, and apples are selling at 6d. each. If a private member had been empowered to inquire into the distribution and sale of apples and of pears, this anomalous position might never have arisen. </para>

                            <para>- That makes the position even worse. We also find that shortages of supplies of apples occur in the different capital cities from time to time. I again appeal to the Government to make greater use of the assistance which private members can give in checking up the activities of these various boards along the lines I have indicated. That is one means by which it can convince the people that it is genuinely desirous of an all-in war effort. </para>

                        (Western Australia) [10.31]. - I listened attentively to the remarks of

                        The explanation of the lag in recruiting which that honorable senator failed to provide, was, 1 think, given by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour;</inline>
                        and the latter's remarks should be seriously considered by the Government. When the recruiting campaign was recently intensified in Western Australia, I heard several people speak unfavorably of the officer who is in charge of that campaign throughout the Commonwealth. I cannot understand why the Government retains the services of such a man in that capacity. ,

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator; but many of the present leaders of the German army also were very gallant soldiers in the last war. 1 believe in the old saying that a leopard cannot change its spots: Despite- the fact that- General Lloyd is a gallant' soldier, as' stated -.by. the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collett),</inline> I am -of opinion that a more suitable officer can be found to direct recruiting activities. </para>

                    <para> I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> raised the subject of soldiers' pay. He remarked that the soldiers had no union. I remind him' that but for the' action- taken by the Labour party in this Parliament the soldiers' rate of pay would not have been increased. Not-only in Victoria but also in the other States; public appeals are being- made on behalf of the destitute wivesand families of men who are fighting overseas. That state of affairs must be remedied immediately, if only to remove one of the greatest obstacles to the success ' of ' the present recruiting campa ign. _ </para>
                    <para>I was very surprised to hear another honorable senator opposite criticize the poor response of Commonwealth public servants who are eligible to enlist in any of the services. This Government has given an undertaking that conscription  will not be introduced ; and I hope that it will never apply conscription by backdoor methods. The Government must not. take action along the lines suggested by the honorable senator. I do not know whether the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> is aware of many of the practices being . indulged in in this respect. We Have not yet reached the stage when we must get recruits by fair means or by foul. Instances have occurred, however, in which youths, who are under compulsory military age, have been more or less coerced into enlisting into the Australian Imperial Forces. When such, instances were brought to the notice of the Minister for the Army, he gave an assurance that he would investigate the position and take, steps to put a stop to such practices. On that point I am rather surprised -that action has not' been taken to curtail the activities of some recruiting officers who have become notorious for the tone of their public addresses from the recruiting platform. I take the following extract from the report of a speech of a recruiting officer publishedin the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">News</inline> of the 23rd June, last :  - </para>
                    <quote>
                    <para>EMPLOYERS CANAID RECRUITING</para>
                <para>Young men eligible for activeservice should not be offered employment in non-essential services, the deputy director of recruiting (Lieut-Col. Waite). said to-day; " It is ridiculous that men over 40 should be unemployed while young fellows who refuse to go to the assistance of their countrymen overseas are engaged in work that could easily be done by these older men ", he added. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Col. Waite</inline>
                    said that he planned to extend the State recruiting committee to incorporate representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, Chamber of Manufactures, and store proprietors in an effort, to get the maximum cooperation for his recruiting drive.
                </para>
                <para>Not only would this help in maintaining continual' publicity displays,he explained, but it would assist in getting the full cooperation of employers in releasing young men for service. </para>
                <para>He would like employers torefuse, and make . public their refusal, to take on new men eligible for service.  -Col. Waite,  referring to -the rate of recruiting.' said that it was difficult to make a comparison offhand with last-war figures, because the other services - air force and navy - were making a big drain on eligible manpower. </para>
                <para>Asked whether any action were being taken regarding men of military age being engaged in the various defence headquarters for clerical work that could . be done by women, Col. Waite refused to comment; but he said that if it were in his power every man in any walk of life who could bereleased for service would be. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>If the use of employers to refuse employment to men of military age is not military conscription, I do not know what is. Recruiting is being retarded for several reasons, one of which is the fact that men who enlist to fight find themselves required to do things so far removed from fighting as house-cleaning for officers' wives. The refusal of some young men. in" the Air Force in Western Australia to be menials led to their court-martial and. subsequent punishment. An error of the last war that must not be repeated in this war was the-sending to the trenches of men old enough to be the fathers of other men who had used influence in order to have themselves, classified as indispensable. The Government ought to ascertain whether men in the services are being used to the best advantage. </para>
                <para>Muchhas been said about the Greekand Crete campaigns.. I do not profess to' be a military expert, but perhaps the Minister. will remember that, before the evacuation of. Greece, I expressed the hope that the,. campaign in Greece would not culminater in a repetition of the evacuation of Dunkirk. Our forces went into action- in . 'Greece and Crete with equipment inferior to that of their opponents. </para>

After nearly two years of warfare only now has a site been selected for the building of a small arms factory in Western Australia. If it takes as long to build that factory as it did to build the military hospital in Western Australia, the war will, be over before it is finished. Whatever the outcome of the war may be, it isessential that the factory fee built with all haste. The construction of the hospital was delayed:, because unnecessary time was occupied in drawing plans and in the selection of the site. In fact, there was a battle over the. hospital site, and I was victorious. </para>

                            <para>- I do not ignore what the Minister did, but I do' say that had it not been for the Minister for the Interior taking notice of my representations, the military hospital in Western Australia would have ' been incapable of rendering the service which is expected of a military hospital. After consulting with a number of medical practitioners of high standing inWestern Australia,. I decided to make representations to the 'Government with the object of having a small swimming pool provided in the hospital grounds. As the Government proposes to placebefore us in the near future a bill dealing with physical fitness, it might have been expected that these representations would have received favorable consideration, but that was not the case. I made my representations to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> as Minister for the' Interior; thinking that he would be able- to give a decision on the subject; but I found that the matter had to be referred to the Minister for the Army (Mr: Spender). My letter to the Minister, for- the Interior read as follows - 30th May, 1941. </para>

                    <para class="block">My dear Minister, </para>
                    <para>I understand that the Military Hospital inWestern Australia will be completed at an early date and in view of that I desire to place before you a request for some additional facilities for the patients who may 'be inmates of the hospital for long or short periods. </para>
                    <para>After consultation. with. -prominent medical authorities,in Western Australia,I have come totheconclusion that an indoor -swimming pool would be of . great advantage to the patients- and' would greatly facilitate 'their recovery. In' addition, to the' medical- opinion offered, I am informed that many of the latest  types of public hospitals have installed small indoor pools which are used for treatment in certain cases. ' . "-...  - It is not necessary formeto go into the benefits that . would be derived fromthis innovation. I would, rather, leave that to a more competent authority than myself,' . but . the representations that I am making are founded on the best and highest -medical authorities I have consulted . with, and on their opinion.I am makingthese representations. </para>
                    <para>I hope thereforethat this will receive the f avorable consideration and decision ' of the Government. </para>
                    <para>On the 21st JuneI received the -following communication from the Minister for the Army : - </para>
                    <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, Fraser,</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">With reference- to your letter dated 30th May, . 1941,-' addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' the Hon.</inline> H. S. Foll, and referred by him to this Department, regarding additional, facilities at the new MilitaryHospital, Perth, I desire to inform you that the matterhas been discussed with , the . Medical Directorate, Army Headquarters. There is among medical authorities  generally, some doubt as. to the necessity of a swimming pool, and recent, investigations abroad by officers of my department definitely indicate that, where hydrotherapy . is deemed essential, excellent results for. adults are being obtained by a specially designed single bath unit. Accordingly in the Physiotherapy De- partments of all new Military Hospitals in Australia' the single unit method is 'being installed. </para>
                    <para>In view of this information it has hot been considered desirable to install an indoor swimming pool in the new hospital. </para>
                    <para>Seeing that the military authorities who selected' the original site for the military hospital in Western Australia found it necessary subsequently to alter their minds, I hope that they will also be prevailed upon to alter their views in connexion with the proposal for a swimming pool at the hospital. I am quite certain that honorable senators, generally, will agree that . the men who return to Australia from the war -should be provided with every possible comfort, in order to facilitate their recovery. I am also certain that a swimming pool would contribute to that end. I hope that the last word has not been said on that subject. The physical condition of many of the men who will come back to Australia will prevent them frombathing on our surfing beaches: For that reason also I trust  that however ' satisfactory the single-bath unitmay be in general hospitals, we shall at least have- a swimming pool in our 'military hospital. I request that this proposal be reconsidered. </para>
                    <para>I wish now to- refer to' petrol 'rationing, although the direct issue, in this instance,  'is price control. I have received from the secretary of a country . roads board in Western Australia- a letter,- dated the 29th May, which reads as follows:- </para>

                    <para> My board is in receipt of a communication  from the Shell Company of Australia Limited advising as follows: - " In the past you have enjoyed semi government rates when purchasing motor spirit, this rate being l1/2d. per gallon off list rate including pump rebate. </para>
                    <para> We now regret to inform you that we cannot continue to allow this special rate, and from the 21st March, 1341, the price of motor spirit to you, delivered in the metropolitan free delivery area, will be 2s. 3d. per gallon in drums or bulk, or 2s. 2d. per gallon bulk provided you hold a consumer's licence from the Liquid Fuel Control Board for 250 gallons per month or more. </para>
                    <para class="block"> The adjustment has been made necessary by a recent ruling given by the Price Fixing Commissioner at 'Canberra. Simultaneously with the increase in price of motor spirit by 1d. per gallon on the 2.1st March the Commissioner instructed that . all special rebates being allowed must be discontinued." </para>
                    <para>And I am instructed to make a strong protest against the said action, firstlybecause my board in common with other local authorities have conscientiously curtailed their petrol consumption in accordance, with the wish of the Commonwealth Government, . which action does not appear to offer any justification for removing local governing authorities from the semi-government rates and further the placing of the smaller authorities whose consumer's licence from the Liquid Fuel Control Board is less than' 250 gallons per month' on a higher rate than those authorities having consumers' licences for over 250 . gallons per month. ' </para>
                    <para>Thepricetothisboard at present is not as may be supposed 2s. 3d. per gallon but 2s. 61/2d. per gallon being an impost for freight, which is of course out of proportion to the actual cost of conveyance 107 miles from Perth- to Moora byrail. </para>
                    <para>My board trust -that you may review your decision to remove them from the benefits of semi-government rates and also . remove the special disability due to our lower consumer's allowance. </para>
                    <para>The responsibilities of country local authorities are just as great if not greater than the more favourably situated local authorities and my board are unable to appreciate the reason for differential treatment. </para>

                <para>It is rumoured that quite a number of internees are being releasedby the appeal tribunals. I am not in the position to -say whether 'or not those rumours are true, but I fail toseehowitcouldadversely affectthenationalinteresttodisclosethe information ' sought. If -the -rumours are not denied by. the Government,' they will' gainin strength-,- particularly since- the' . matterhasreceivedsomepublicity.The impressionwillgetabroadthatthose internees: who are possessed of funds, and: who are therefore able to brief counsel' to: ' assist them',, are able 'to obtain- their release, while' others less 'fortunately situated . remainin internment. The Government is asking the. people to make even, greater efforts to assist in the prosecution of the war, but the circulation of rumoursof this kind will not encourage the people to respond. The Government has nothing to lose by being perfectly frank. The public know that these tribunals have been established, and that appeals are being heard every day. They believe that some of the internees are being released, so there is no reason why they should not  be told how many. The Government is, by its silence, doing much to injure its own cause,. especially when the impression gets abroad that persons of enemy origin, who areunfriendly to Australia, are' being permitted- to go 'free. </para>
                <para>Senator,ARMSTRONG (New South Wales) [11.15].- I support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> regarding the chairmen of the recently, appointed parliamentary standing committees. It seems to me that the Government . is trying to placate certain members of the House of Representatives. What qualifications does the honorable member'  for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coles)</inline> possess for the position of  chairman  of the Man-power, and Resources Survey Committee ? Possibly the Government is trying to induce him to take the first,, or second or third step towards becoming a member of the United Australia party. The Opposition is seeking to co-operate with the <inline font-style="italic">Government</inline> as far as possible, and it regards the Man-power, and Resources Survey Committee as one of the most, important of all, but the appointment of the honorable member for Henty as  chairman,  when he has had no previous  experience of the work, and is not even a member of an accredited . party in the. Parliament, willlead to fraction. I may mention alsothe appointment of the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stacey)</inline> as  chairman  of one of the committees. It was common knowledge that he was disappointed because he' was not- made the Government Whip- in the House of Representatives, sothe Government is possibly seeking' to placate him by giving- him this appointment. I am. sure that the work of the committees will suffer as a result of the action taken by the Government. I hope, that it is not too late for the: Government to reconsider its decision. It should allow the: members of the. committee's' to meet and' appoint their own chairmen. </para>
                <para>I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> to the method used by the military authorities in selecting camp sites in New South Wales. The; citizens of many towns, which possess' local advantages and prior claims, cannot understand why those towns have been passed over. One such town from, which complaints have been many and. con tinuous- is Young, represented: in this Parliament by the Postmaster-General' <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collins).</inline> Military officers visited the town, and" afterwards stated' that it did. not. possess the. necessary facilities- to justify placing a camp in that vicinity.' They did not introduce1 themselves to- the local authorities; they visited the town, and nobody knew how long they stayed. or what they- did. Afterwards they made their report. They did' not state in what' way the town- was unsuitable, and the. people of Young regard ' the action taken as very unsatisfactory, particularly as at Cowra, only 27 milesaway, a military camp, to which a mechanized section is attached, has been established, besides an internees' camp for the accommodation of many thousands of persons. Naturally, there is much jealousy between towns when one is given an abundance of Government favours, whilst others starve. Those townswhich are neglected are losing- their population, and enlistments are falling off. 'Some towns are given toomuch, while others, such as Young, although possessing many natural, advantages, receive nothing. I should like the Minister for Supply and Development to bring my remarks before the Minister for the Army, with the request that the military authorities should again visit Young and consult with the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors on this, matter.  Their neglect to do so in the first instance has causedmuch local indignation, with the result that many protest meetings have been held. I am confident that if' the course which I advocate were adopted, ' much of this dissatisfaction would disappear. </para>

Therefore, the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner has no legal authority to enforce any price in respect of hay. His intervention is an indication to' the people concerned that should the price of this commoditybe raised beyond  what  is considered reasonable, hay may become a declared commodity, in'  which event  the Prices Commissioner would  have  full power to fix its price. </para>
