The matter is being followed up urgently. The action is regular, and is; in fact, necessary because mining, except within the territories controlled by the Commonwealth, is a State function, and all mining leases and conditions governing mining, therefore, come within the scope of the State authority. </para>

          <para>.- I direct the attention of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> to certain articles which appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> yesterday and to-day in which scathing references are made to the officer in command of the British Far Eastern Forces, the Chief of the Australian General Stall, the Chief of the Air Staff in Australia and others associated with our war services. I should be the last to suggest that any deficiencies in the matter of equipment or in relation to all of our war activities in the Far East should not be subject to criticism, or investigation, but I do not think that such damaging attacks should be permitted in the early stages of a campaign such as that in which we arc now engaged, when, as the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> pointed out, the initial advantage gained by our new enemy, Japan, resulted from a base, cowardly, and treacherous attack. Whether we be members of Parliament, contributors to the press, or other members of the public, if we desire that Australia should put forward its full war effort, it is unwise at this particular time to indulge in a campaign against the leaders of our land forces or our air forces, unless we are sure that they have committed blunders. If they have made Blunders, it is then the duty of the Government to act. In my opinion, statements such as those published in the press this morning have a very disturbing and a disquieting effect upon the community at this time of crisis. </para>
