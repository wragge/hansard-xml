Will he also state whether the Government recently made another large advance to National Oil Proprietary Limited?

Will the Minister advise the Senate whether the pipe line recently completed from the Glen Davis oil works to the railway line is working satisfactorily? </para>

                        <para>- The Government is not completely satisfied with the. progress made at the Newnes shale oil plant. The result has been disappointing, inasmuchas the Government had expected a greater output of oil than is now being obtained, but steps, which I believe will meet with success, are already being taken to overcome the difficulties that have been encountered. These have mainly occurred in connexion with the retorting of the shale. The Government has made another advance to National Oil Proprietary Limited to enable it to carry on the further reconstruction work which is necessary owing to the present unsatisfactory position. I was advised only two days ago that the pipe line is working satisfactorily. I was told that petrol had been pumped from it, and that there was no sign of leakage throughout the whole length of the line. </para>

There is a Field Officer j.n Tasmania whose duty it is to see that these rents arc correctly recorded for Launceston and other centres. A Supervising field Officer periodically inspects the work of the Field Officer to ensure that it is well and faithfully done. The whole is regularly reviewed each quarter by an experienced senior officer under the control of the Commonwealth Statistician. The Supervising Field Officer has just completed his regular periodical inspection of the work on collection of prices and rents in Tasmania and will confer with the Commonwealth Statistician at an early date. I will ask the Statistician to make a special examination of. the house rents of the city of Launceston in order to meet the honorable senator's wishes. </para>

Some part of the League's work is now being carried on at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, in the United States of America, and the International Labour Office is installed at the McGill University, Montreal, Canada. The work of the League in economic and financial matters and in the control of the opium traffic is regarded as of particular importance. (2) There is a wide recognition that it is necessary to maintain in being some organization for international collaboration. (3) The members of the British Common wealth were in favour of continuing financial support to the League (4) Every possible effort has been made to cut down League expenditure. </para>

                <para>My purpose in moving this motion is to endeavour to assist the Minister, the Government, the Flax Production Committee, or whoever maybe administering this industryby having a select committee appointed to investigate and report upon the production of flax in Australia. My object is to have the flax industry placed upon a sound footing, so that it will be of some real value in post-war reconstruction. From investigations which I have made, I believe that if this industry continues along existing lines it lias no prospect whatever of being established as a post-war industry. That is what I am vitally concerned with at present. I am not unmindful of how flax production in this country was rushed upon the Commonwealth Government by the British Government, nor am I unmindful of the haste with which the mills had to be erected to get the industry established. The State governments have co-operated in an endeavour to make theproject a success, and now that the industry is in operation,those who have taken an interest in its development can see quite clearly that great improvements could be effected in certain directions. We can also see that although it is hoped to increase the output by 100 per cent. next year, unless some drastic alterations are made, the whole industry will be thrown into a state of chaos. It is to avoid such an eventuality that I suggest the appointment of a select committee. I shall cite some of the deficiencies at present manifesting themselves in the production of flax - deficiencies which in due course will prevent the undertaking from becoming a successful post-war industry. I shall start by describing the layout of the mills. I realize that the Government had <inline font-style="italic">to'</inline> depend on outside advice, or in other words, upon whatever , so-called experts could be obtained. The. laying-out of a flax-producing plant' is a task for an engineer who has a. full knowledge of the industry. He should know all the processes in the .production of fibre .from flax, and without that knowledge he would not be an. experienced engineer in that sphere of industry. The various component buildings of the present" mills have been laid out in such a way that thu cost of production is excessive owing to unnecessary handling. I shall outline for the information of honorable senators some of the processes through which the flax has to pass, and the set-up of the plant generally. The. Government purchases the flax as it comes from the field. It is then stacked in paddocks either adjacent to the mills or in suitable locations nearby. It has to be loaded on lorries and carted from the stacks to the deseeding shed, and after it leaves the de-seeding shed it is dew-retted or pitretted. At present, the Flax Board is experimenting with a more modern process which will dispense with much of  this  work, but at present we are depending on dew-retting and pit-retting. After it has been pit-retted, it is taken from the pits on lorries to another shed called the drying shed, and when it has been dried, it is again loaded on lorries and taken to the  skutching  shed. From .there it is carted to the store shed. The existing plants are so laid out that constant handling and carting pf the product at its various stages is involved. In fact, the handling and carting is so extensive that the flax is very nearly retted before it goes to the retting pits. The haphazard location of the various .buildings suggests that the plan for them was prepared by throwing a handful of chips into the air and marking the places where they landed as the sites for sheds. -Had the designing engineer known the .various processes involved in the production of flax ' fibre, 'he would have laid out the buildings in such a way as to involve the minimum of handling and transport, and enough money would have been saved to build Dutch barns at the end of the mills to house practically the whole of the flax instead of stacking it in the paddocks. The flax then could have been, conveyed right through the mill without ever going ou to a lorry except, perhaps, for carting to the paddocks for dew-retting, and an enormous saving in production cost3 could have been effected. Although the mills are now established, I claim that it would be most beneficial to the industry if the various sheds were moved to their proper locations, thus facilitating more economic operation. Then we come to the de-seeding of the straw. Some of the mills have their own winnowers supplied to them by the Government, but they are not finishing and grading a perfectly clear article. After the material comes from the winnowers, it has to he graded by some private firm at so much a bushel. Some mills have not had big winnowers supplied by the Government, and are operating small hand machines. One could say that that system of processing and cleaning seed went down with the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline> many years ago. I have given only a few examples of avenues in which savings could be effected. Then we come to the temporary mills which had to be erected rapidly to aid ns for the time being. Some of these are handling as large a quantity of flax as is being handled at the permanent mills, in the face of difficulties which, to my mind, are appalling. To illustrate my point, I mention in particular the mill at Lilydale, about IS miles from Launceston. Many hundreds of tons of flax were brought to that mill, and after it was de-seeded it was taken out into the paddocks to be dew retted. Some of the paddocks are so steep that nobody could stand on a lorry to throw the sheaves off, and therefore they had to be poked off. From my experience it would be impossible for any lorry to be driven along, the sides of, and up and down, those hills in damp weather in order to load the flax.  Much  of the flax would have to be gathered and sledged to level ground to enable it to be loaded on the lorries and taken to the mill. When it is carried back to the mill most of it is  placed in another stack at the same mill-, side. It stays there for a considerable time, after which it is loaded on a lorry and taken another 37 miles on a hush road to Scotsdale to be scutched. But even the Scotsdale mill is only a temporary one, and there is the same loading and unloading across a paddock to and from the- showground sheds where the machinery has been- set up. The seed which was separated at Lilydale has to be loaded on a lorry and' carried to a winnower at Scotsdale, and' then carted the same distance back to Launceston to be cleaned, whereas it could have been taken to Launceston in the first place. It may be necessary to establish further mill's, although on a small scale, in order to save the wastage due to carriage over such a long .distance. </para>
                <para>I shall now refer to some of the other temporary mills, because I consider that honorable senators should bc made aware of what is taking place. There is unnecessary handling' in carrying the flax out of the stacks and into the mills, and it is being transferred into sheds that are unsuitable for the purpose. There are three or four handlings in getting the flax to the de-seeding plant, and three or four more in. conveying it from that plant to the lorries. Then it has to go through the same process as I have mentioned for dew retting. It is brought back, in the majority of cases, and stacked in the mill where it is left lying for some time. Then it is loaded on another lorry and taken to another mill- to be scutched. If we have to dew ret the flax, I do not see why it should not be loaded on the lorry in level paddocks and carried direct to the scutching mill. I shall now describe the process of cleaning the seed in one .of the temporary mills. One is an old brewery which. is totally unsuitable for such work. After the flax is deseeded, the seed is carried to another floor by means of a block and . rope operated by hand.. It is then cleaned by means of a small hand .winnower, after ..which it is lowered down by . means of a block and tackle to the bottom floor, and has to be sent another 30 miles along the coast to be graded. I claim that adequate machinery could be installed to not only roughly clean the .seed, but also grade it at the same time. An electric- power line runs past the mill, and, by means of a dynamo, a few cog wheels and a belt, an up-to-date winnower could be installed. This would enable the cleaning to be done on a more economic basis than' at present. Another permanent mill is situated at Wynyard, and, in ordinary seasons, it would be located in a swamp. The shed being used is totally unsuitable for a flax mill. The- prod.net has to he handled- three- or four times to be taken into the shed to be de-seeded, and it has to be handled two or three times more to be put back into the same shed to be scutched. After scutching it has- still to be handled two or three times again before it is got rid of. If this industry is to survive, it will be necessary to lay out the mills on proper lines. There is another mill at Smithton. I was so disgusted with what I had seen at the other mills that I did- not visit the Smithton mill when I was told: that the flax was handled to and f-rom the mill at Smithton by means of a team of bullocks and a wagon. That is the archaic means of transport adopted at one' of the mills that has been passed as a permanent establishment. If the lay-out of the mills were right in the first place, there would- be no need for lorries, horse-wagons, or bullock- drays to handle the flax into, the mills- and to the different sheds.- </para>
                <para>I should like a committee appointed to investigate the various phases of processing fibre from flax. At present, it is being processed in Tasmania, and in most 6f the-mainland mills by a system. of dew-retting. I understand that in England and. Ireland and elsewhere, pitretting ' is used extensively. Pits have recently been constructed at the Hagley mill for the purpose of pit-retting flax. If. this method be necessary - and' I claim that it would be of great advantage - it is time steps were taken to install" pits at the other permanent mills while  suitable  labour is available for that class of work. I contend that pit-retting offers a tremendous saving as compared with  dewretting,  and would not be so risky. If we had experienced normal weather conditions in Tasmania this year, instead of a phenomenally dry season, it is quite on the cards that we should have lost one half of the flax that was lying out to be dew-retted. If we get a break in the weather during the next few weeks, we shall lose practically the whole of the flax which is bring dew-retted. </para>

                        <para>- In a properly equipped drying shed. I desire to assist the Government to make this industry a success. My object in bringing the matter forward is toendeavour to make this a. post-war industry, and I ask for the co-operation of honorable senators opposite, as well as the assistance that I know I shall have from my colleagues on the Opposition side of the chamber. I do not suggest that dew-retting could be entirely dispensed with, but, if we could build sufficient pits, the whole of the flax could be dealt with by the pit-retting process. Which is the better method is a matter on which there is disagreement. Some claim that dew-retting is the superior process, and others say that pitretting gives equally good results. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. If the weather is too fine, or too wet, the dewretting process is interfered with, and therefore if pit-retting will produce a fibre equal to that obtained from dewretting, it would be wise to install pits for the purpose. Moreover, other means of treating the flax may be found if an inquiry were instituted. I have been informed that two decorticators have been ordered by theFlax Production Committee. Should the machines be successful, there will be no need for the retting process. I understand also that there is in Australia a gentleman who has carried out fairly extensive experiments in connexion with the decorticating of flax, but that no facilities have been afforded to him to continue his investigations. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of that information, but I believe that it is authentic. </para>

                        <para>- At this stage I do not propose to mention any individual by name. I merely say that a certain gentleman has carried out fairly extensive experiments by which fibre has been obtained from flax without either dewretting or pit-retting. I understand that his experiments proved that after the flax had passed through the decorticator there was much less bulk to handle than when other processes were employed and also that by dew-retting the fibre, for a certain period after leaving the machine, its quality was improved. Unfortunately, that gentleman has not been given charge of one of the machines ordered by the Flax Production Committee. If, as is stated, the process of decorticating flax by means of these machines is still in the experimentalstage, I cannot understand why four of them were ordered. I am amazed that this man, who has devoted so much of his time to experimenting with flax, should not have been given charge of one of the machines. Indeed until I told him that four machines had been manufactured he had no knowledge that they had been ordered. I desire the appointment of a committee in order that various phases of the processing of flax fibre and also the suitability of certain localities for the erection of mills may be investigated. </para>

                        <para>- I certainly know more about the erection of mills for the processing of fibre from flax than does  the engineer who designed the mill to which I have referred. However, I shall not criticize him now, because I want to see this industry established in Australia. The appointment of a committee would enable the layout of mills to be investigated, and would provide an opportunity to obtain valuable information from persona interested in the growing and processing of flax. At the conclusion of its investigations, the committee would be in a position to furnish a report which should be of great value to the Government, members of this Parliament, the Flax Production Committee, and all others associated with the flax industry. I do not know whether the other committees which are to he set up will deal with the flax industry; hut I urge that this investigation should begin at the earliest possible moment, particularly as Australia has been asked: to double 'its production, of flax, -and, also because persons whom the Government regards as authorities on the processing of flax have furnished information which. I know to be incorrect. One of. these supposed authorities gave the cost of producing flax in Tasmania as Â£4 10s. an acre. That statement, is ridiculous. However, it would appear that it was- regarded as correct 'by the Government, seeing that the guaranteed price for flax was fixed at Â£4 10s. an acre. I hope  {hai  the Government will, agree to the appointment of a committee to investigate this industry, which should prove of great value to Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">In view of the plight 'of farmers throughout Australia generally, I desire the appointment of a joint select committee to investigate the increased, cost of superphosphate. I am aware that in past years the manufacture of this commodity has been investigated. In 1929, the Tariff Board conducted an inquiry into the price and distribution of superphosphate, and in 1932 a further inquiry was undertaken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Gunn. . However, I am concerned not so much with what took place in the past as with what is. happening to-day. Soon- after Professor Copland was appointed Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, his attention was directed to the price of superphosphate. Professor Copland has done a good job in relation to some commodities, but I do not agree with all of his decisions. For instance, he has permitted the price of tea to be increased, notwithstanding that the companies which distribute that commodity arc paying dividends as high as 15 per cent. In dealing with superphosphate I am concerned with happenings before Professor Copland was appointed to his present position. In Western Australia, the prices of commodities before the commencement -of the war are taken into' consideration when' fixing prices, and it would appear that Professor Copland also should be -empowered to take prewar prices into consideration. </para>

That- is  a very important point. A motion was moved in the Legislative Assembly . in Western, Australia, on the 23rd October last, asking for the appointment of a select committee to investigate the price of superphosphate because, soon after the Prices Commissioner had fixed the price, a rise of 10.3. a ton was approved. Shortly after that the Commissioner approved of a further increase of 20s. a ton; but later he. changed his mind - on what  grounds I  am unable to say - and reduced the price by 4s. a ton, making the total increase since the outbreak of war 26s. a ton. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will have patience I shall tell him all I know about this commodity. The bulk of the phosphatic rock imported into Australia comes  from  Nauru, an island about 2,000 miles from the Queensland coast. It will therefore be difficult to explain the increases that have taken place by claiming that they can be attributed largely to the increase of freight rates. Neither can it be contended that war risk marine insurance enters largely into the cost of superphosphate. The waters between Nauru and Australia arc not regarded as highly dangerous to shipping. The whole question of the manufacture and sale of superphosphate was discussed at a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council last year, and on the motion of a South Australian Minister of the Crown, who is a supporter of the party to which the Leader of the Senate belongs, the council carried the following resolution : - </para>

                    <para>I have no doubt that the Commonwealth Government, through its officers, has already made some investigation of the position. Substantial reductions will have to be effected, however, if primary production is to continue as it should do in these da' s. If. as w:is stated a while ago when we were dealing with wine, the Commonwealth Government cannot, under existing machinery, instruct the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner to investigate prices ruling prior to the. 31st August. 10SB, it should make provision to do so. I am anxious to ascertain whether the ruling prices of superphosphate at the 31st August were fair or unfair. It may be that profiteering was going on then. If that is so. it would be illogical and unjust to fall ben vii v on the wartime profiteer but to allow the peace-time profiteer to continue his profiteering in wartime. Under thu Western Austin' ian legislation the State Prices Commissioner  may  investigate whether prices were fair or unfair prior to the 31st August . . . </para>
                    <para>It may bc that substitutes may bo found for some of thu high-priced imported ingredients pf superphosphates. I hope that we shall be able to produce, in Western Australia, some of the ingredients that are now being imported at a high price and in the near future may become still more expensive. Surely the Commonwealth and State Governments, acting both separately and conjointly, can do something to meet this situation. It will be foolish for us to sit back and accept these increases' of prices as inevitable. </para>

Subsequently he said that he was prepared to investigate the matter thoroughly on the lines requestedby <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willcock.</inline> Following more recent protests an investigation was made by the Commonwealth Department of Commerce. This report was forwarded to the Western Australian Government, but in spite of that the Western Australian Parliament carried a motion for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into and report upon all matters relative to the manufacture and sale of superphosphate in Western Australia. I am not in a position to say whether the price of superphosphate is a just or an unjust one; but, like the members of the Western Australian House of Assembly, I say definitely that if the Prices Commissioner has taken as the basis for his computations the price ruling at the , 31st August, 1939, his decision may , not be a just one because the manufacturers may at that time have been indulging in profiteering.Let us consider how the increased price of superphosphate affects the farmers in my own State. The latest decision of the Prices. Commissioner means that an increased annualburden of between Â£360,000 and Â£400,000 will be placed on Western Australian farmers. </para>

                <para>SenatorFRASER.- I shall deal with that later. On an average, the farmers of Western Australia use 300,000 tons of superphosphate annually, at a cost of Â£1,500,000. That figure is rapidly increasing, owing to the greater use of superphosphate for top-dressing. Reporting on the 27th September, 1932, on the superphosphate industry, the Director of </para>

                    <para>It is of interest to record that in 1913-14 when the price of rock was approximately Â£2 7s.6d. per ton, of sulphur Â£418s.6d. per ton, and ofbags6s. 7d.per dozen, the list price of 17 per cent. water soluble superphosphate was Â£4 7s.6d. per ton. Just after the war, the price of raw materials increased considerably, and the price of 17 per cent. superphosphate went up to Â£6 3s. per ton. In 1931-32 with rock costing an average of Â£25s.10d. per ton, c.i.f., and sulphur averaging Â£7 10s. per ton,landedin store, Melbourne, and withbags at an average price of9s. per dozen, the list price of 22per cent. superphosphate (20.5 per cent. water soluble) is Â£415s. per ton for terms, and Â£4 10s. per ton for cash. The price of Â£4 10s. for 20.5 per cent. water soluble is equivalent to Â£3 14s.8d. per ton of 17 per cent. water soluble. In 1913-1914 there was no difference between terms and cash prices. </para>
                    <para>The figures indicate that although there has been an increase in the cost of raw materials (excepting phosphate rock) since 1913-14, the price of superphosphate to the farmer has decreased by 14.70 per cent. </para>

                <para>I emphasize that the resolution of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into this industry was adopted with full knowledge on the part of that chamber of the representations made by the State Government, and the resolution of protest adopted by the Australian Agricultural Council as well as the representations made by the Premier of Western Australia and the investigations already made by the Commonwealth Government into the industry. All of those phases of the matter were carefully examined. There can be no doubt that the growers are not satisfied with the present position. They demand a Commonwealth inquiry. Should such an investigation prove the Prices Commissioner to be in the right, no harm will be done. </para>

                <para>SenatorFRASER. - As I have already stated, the Minister for Lands in Western Australia pointed out that the Prices Commissioner is not empowered to inquire into conditions existing prior to the 3lst August, 1939, in order to ascertain the profits then made. The present dissatisfaction of the farmers is aggravated by the fact that a further increase of price is contemplated.- Tn these circumstances it is desirable that the fullest possible information should be furnished regarding existing stocks of phosphate rock in this country. The farmers are entitled to be assured that unfair profits are not being made. They cannot shoulder a further increase of price. To-day many farmers not only in Western Australia but also in other States, are in serious financial difficulty. Many of them are on the verge of bankruptcy; they are simply holders of properties for the banks. An inquiry by a select committee of this Parliament would also disclose whether or not the present scale of shipping freights is fair. </para>

                        - T think that is his name - who is the son of the founder of the Pivot Company in Victoria, The concern was established in 1927 as a farmers' company and worked on the basis that anything over cost, was rebated to the shareholders. A farmer there is entitled to a ton of super phosphate for every share he holds. Evidently they have gone into the matter very closely because I notice that when our superphospte  - it had a 23 per cent, content - cost us ?3 12s. (id. per ton, the Victorian farmers were paying ?2 17s. per ton net. That represents a difference of Jos. Gd. per ton, or nearly 30 per cent. For the five years from 1934 to 1939 the company sold superphosphate at under ?3 per ton to its shareholder -farmers in Victoria. To-day the Commonwealth Price Fixing Commissioner has forced the company to increase its price to ?4 IBs. per ton, less 5s. per ton for cash, which is the same as the rate charged in Western Australia.

That statement has not been contradicted. The price of superphosphates was increased, first, by 10s. a ton and later by 20s. a ton. Apparently the Prices Commissioner was not sure of the basis on which he awarded the latter increase, because shortly after it was announced he reduced the price by 4s. per ton. Thus, the price of superphosphate has increased by 26s. a ton over the pre-war price. I again warn the Government that many primary producers in Western Australia will be driven off the land if the price be further increased. Whether the representations </para>

                        <para>. -  Honorable senators will recall that when I moved this motion  at  the end of last year, I was given leave to continue my remarks. On the eve of: my term of office as a senator I wish to be quite frank with the Senate. I shall not press this matter to a conclusion  at. this stage,, but I wish to .place certain factors on record, because I hope- that whether this motion be or. be not passed - after all that does not matter, so much - I shall perhaps,, with the friendly attention and. assistance of my fellow senators, have been privileged to sow a small seed that, in time may grow into an important plant, of which they themselves, and all the world, will be proud. All I ask in this motion is that this Senate shall make a very strong declaration to the world that all loT:.ers of freedom - democratic countries, and: particularly  tks  British family of nations - will at the conclusion 'of this war absolutely refuse to- accept a so-called peace which does, not ensure absolute security against a recurrence, of the dreadful evils caused by war that is devastating the world to-day. That is all I wish, to do., If honorable senators analyse this long motion they will, find that that is all it means. But it does purport to make .a suggestion based on our. own constitution and on the constitution of our American cousins; it does attempt to point .out that the real road to world security lies- in, the application of the Federal principle to any world body that may be set up after the war. It is unthinkable that at the conclusion of hostilities every reasonable man in the world will not bend his might towards the attainment- of a solution of this pressing problem. We thought wehad a solution in the League of. Nations. Some people say that the .League of Nations failed"; I have never said that. I 'believe that from the very weaknesses, errors, and mistakes of the League of Nations, we should derive the necessary lessons to eliminate the deficiencies that made aggression" possible, and thus bring to successful fruition the good, work that was started, by the League. At least, the League of Nations did establish for us the ideal of world collective security, and I want this Senate to proclaim to the world that we shall' cling steadfastly to that ideal. This afternoon, I asked a quest-ion which was answered by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay).</inline></para>

                <para class="block"> I believe everyone will agree with that sentiment, but may I call the attention of the Senate to what I think was 'fi stronger expression by a very great manwhom we all admire for the sterling work he has done in hurling defiance at the Germ&lt;an tyrants. I refer to FieldMarshal Smuts, Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa. The question was also raised in the South African Parliament as to why that Government was paying a contribution towards the upkeep of the League of Nations. The following is a report which contains the declaration of  Field-Marshal  Smuts: - "Many deep thinkers are still convinced that the only hope of salvation for the world lies along the League road", said the Prime Minister, General Smuts, announcing a vote of Â£25,600" for the League of Nations. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Since then,  there  ha.ve been several opportunities to bring this motion before honorable senators, but I trust I shall not be charged with . laxity or want of enthusiasm in that respect. I remind my colleagues that when those opportunities did present themselves, major international crises were occurring and we could not have devoted our minds completely to the consideration of other matters. I am not in the least bit perturbed about that,, because -as many honorable senators recollect, some time ago a motion was passed in this chamber with the support of the Leader of the Opposition- <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> and most other honorable, senators, twenty-one of whom are still members- of this chamber. Twenty-one senators signed the constitution  of a body which we carried on in a mild way, and through which we sent material to many parts of the- world. Literaturewas sent to the Foreign Relations Committee of the American Senate and to the corresponding body of the House of Representatives in that country. It was also sent to many members of the British House of Commons, and honorable senators ' opposite will  be  pleased to learn that 'amongst the recipients there were about 7.0 members of the Labour party. Encouraging expressions have come from many parts of the world, and although no specific motion, may he carried now, I am thankful for the privilege of acting for my country in this Senate 'by putting forward this  ideal.  I am not concerned with, whether or not this matter culminates in a specific resolution, because, as I havesaid, we have sown a seed which I think, will grow more and more in the minds of men and women throughout the world as we come to. the closing stages of this unhappy and disastrous struggle. </para>

                    <para>.A similar motion has been moved on so many occasions that it has almost become stereotyped procedure. I desire to know the reason for such a motion being moved in connexion with this measure. Does the Government intend to impose the " guillotine " whenever it considers such action necessary, or is the measure really urgent? Since I have been a member of this chamber I have never heard reasons given in support of such a motion. I am prepared to consider any reasons given for regarding this measure as urgent, but if the motion is only a matter of form and no good reason is advanced for such haste, I shall not support it. I submit that every bill placed before us should be considered on its merits and ample time afforded for debate. No legislation should be hurried through the chamber unless it is indeed an urgent measure. I do not know what attitude my colleagues on this side of the chamber will adopt in regard to the motion now before the Senate, but unless the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> is able to give good reasons for its introduction I shall challenge it and every similar motion whenever it is submitted without any explanation of its urgency; I desire the honorable gentleman to know that I am not here merely to act as a rubber stamp in order to meet the convenience of the Government; but if the Government says that legislation should be passed quickly in order to assist the country's war effort, I am prepared to give favorable consideration to any request for its speedy passage. </para>

I agree withSenator Cameron that bills shouldnotbe rushed throughwithout good reason,but I believe that, the objects sought to be achieved by this bill are important and urgently necessary.

                    <para class="block">This bill is designed to amend the Ministers of State Act, under which the permissible number of Ministers of State provided for in the Constitution has from time to time been increased. The number of Ministers allowed by the  act  is eleven. That number was increased to twelve by a regulation made under the National Security Act in October last, but the statutory maximum number of Ministers is eleven. That will explain to honorable senators why the increase authorized by this measure is to be from eleven to nineteen instead of from twelve to nineteen Ministers. The actual number of Ministers now is not twelve, as provided for by the regulation, but sixteen, because there are four Assistant Ministers. The post of Assistant Minister in, the Commonwealth administration was devised about 30 years ago. </para>
                    <para>It is desirable that every person who sits incabinet should sit there as a Minister of State with specific responsibility for some department of State, and with accountability to Parliament for theway in which he administers that department. Consequently, it is desirable to abolish the post of Assistant Minister and to provide that each man who is  a  Minister shall be a Minister of State with responsibilities for a department of State. As I have said, we now have sixteen Ministers, four of whom are described as Assistant Ministers. It is proposed to establish special ministerial responsibility for three war activities which seem to he of sufficient importance to warrant it. I take them in no particular order, hut they are, first aircraft production, secondly civil defence, including in particular air raid precautions, and thirdly the problem of the re-organization of civil resources. The last mentioned is an extremely difficult problem which will involve a great deal ofcontact with various organizations of civil production throughout Australia. Each of those matters is so important as to warrant a special ministerial department. </para>
                    <para>It is not proposed to provide that, instead of sixteen Ministers of State there should be nineteen, each to be remunerated as a full Minister, because the extra cost would be excessive. The proposal is that there shall be such addition to the ministerial salary pool as will provide for twelve Ministers of State, whowould be remunerated as full Ministers of State are now remunerated, and; instead of four Assistant Ministers, seven other Ministers of State with their own responsibilities, each to be remunerated on the basis on which Assistant Ministers are now remunerated. The total addition to the Cabinet fund would not be very great. </para>
                    <para>Certain rearrangements of the Cabinet business will be made, and it is hoped that this will make the handling of that business more effective in the future. The Ministers of State Act now provides' for the appropriation of Â£18,600 per annum for the payment of Ministers ofState. It is proposed to increase that appropriation to Â£21,250. </para>
                    <para>It is not designed by this measure to increase the salary of any existing Minister. The whole purpose is to secure three additional Ministers, who would, under the existing scheme, be called Assistant Ministers,but who, under the new scheme, will be given special responsibilities for those particular departments of State. </para>
                    <para>SenatorCOLLINGS  (QueenslandLeader of the Opposition) [8.11].  -  This bill is an exceedingly simple one and all honorable senators On this side of the chamber have known of its contents for some time. It is intimately associated with Australia's war effort and, therefore, </para>
                    <para class="block">I believe that it should be given a speedy passage through the Senate.I should not be prepared to adopt that attitude in all circumstances, but this measure follows the lines indicated in the Prime Minister's <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> recent broadcast speech, in which he said that it was essential that ministerial responsibility, especially in respect of certain important war departments, should be more evenly distributed. We on this side agree with that statement. At times we have complained -I believe, with justification - that some things which ought to have been done were not being done, and that other  things  were not being done as expeditiously as the situation demanded. There was talk of red tape, bottle-necks, and so on. As this bill is designed to remove some of those obstacles, and to enable the nation's war effort to be accelerated, its passage through the Parliament should not be delayed. I approve of the bill as a whole, but I am particularly pleased with one aspect' of it. It has always seemed to me to be unfair that the pool of ministerial salaries should be! limited to a certain amount, and that although Ministers are supposed to receive a certain salary, they maynot,infact,receivethatamount. I donotkonwwhatarragementsare madeforthedistributionofthemoney in that pool,andIdonotwanttoknow, butIsubmitthatifaMinisterisquali- fiedtodohisjob,andisdoingitsatis- factorily,heisentitledtothefullsalary forthatjob.Ishouldresentanarbitrary cutofmyremuneration,andIresentany interferencewithacontractenteredinto forthepaymentofanyspecifiedsumto aMinisterofState.Ifitisnecessaryto appointAssistantMinisters-andit wouldappearthattheirappointmentis necessary-theirsalariesshouldbeaddi- tionaltotheamountrequiredtopaythe salariesofMinistersofStateinaccor- dancewiththecontractsenteredinto withthem.Theadditionalamountof  Â£2,650tobeprovidedunderthisbillis  notworthtalkingabout,ifweare now togetabetterservice.Wecan agree to that without any qualms of conscience. The LeaderoftheSenatein hissecondreadingspeechtolduswhat the Prime Minister saidintheHouseof Representatives.I express my thanks to the honorable senator for having supplied members -of the Opposition with a copy of the Prime Minister's second-reading speech as soon as it was available. It is all to the good that we are to have these three war effort departments so shared out that their problems will get more complete and more rapid attention. When the new Ministers are appointed, we should be able to get from the talking stage to theaction stage with as little delay as possible.Nobody would say that it is not a good thing that aircraft production should be investigated and speeded up. If this bill will have that effect I am sure that the Opposition will be satisfied the right thing is being done. Our civil defences, particularly air raid precautions, are badly in need of attention. A very big -job is being done in Queensland in that connexion under the guidance of the State Government. A good deal of the speeding up of air raid precaution work in New South Wales is accounted for by the recent change of Government in that State. The fact remains, however, that there is a great need for the tightening upforour civil defences with special emphasis on preparation for trial blackouts, and the provision of air raid shelters. If this bill effects an improvement in that direction, we shall be more than justified in passing it. The same remarks applytothedevelopmentofourcivil resources and civil production.

                        <para>. - I agreeintotothat the Government should be assisted in every way possible to organize a total war effort. A total war-time effort means at the very least that all who are capable should bear an equal share of the burden, and that nonessentialindustries should not be allowed to operate to the detriment of the war effort. At ajoint meeting of senators and members of the. House of Representatives, I asked what was intended to be done in that direction, and I was sup- . plied with an answer which did not convey any idea of the intentions of the Government-. We are asked to say now, in effect, that we accept in good faith the promise of the Government that it will do all that we think it should do. Although we have had  22  months of war, many of the things that should have been done have remained undone. For example, it has been said that there is a scarcity of labour necessary for building operations required so urgently for defence purposes. At the same time, however,, we find, that in almost ever.y capital city and country town of any importance in Australia palatial buildings of all kinds are being erected, absorbing the labour power and materials that should he used for defence purposes. That has gone on. ever since the war started, and it is going on today. .We are asked in this bill to 'agree to the appointment of additional Ministers. If it could be shown that' the work that should be done is being done, and if we were given the assurance that further efforts would be, made in the. directions that are so necessary, we could acquiesce- in the passage  of this bill ; hut that is not the position. In every capital city and country town in 'Australia we- find services being duplicated and multiplied in every direction. If appropriate action were taken an enormous amount of . labour-power and, -millions of pounds- worth of materials could heutilized to far better advantage. In company with fellow senators and members of another place', I visited the Small Arms Factory at Footscray and found, to my amazement, that many machines in the key machine shop were idle. I asked the manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Statton,</inline> what was the reason for that, and he said that private enterprise was taking-, his key men. In other words, the Munition Department is being sabotaged by private enterprise, and the Government is doing, nothing to help it. That is the only construction that I could place upon his words. I asked him if I wore at liberty to mention his name in this matter, and he consented. That ia why I mention it now. I sought' to ascertain the reason for this. The only answer that suggests itself to my mind is that private enterprise has so much capital invested in non-essential .and  luxury  industries that it is not prepared to make the sacrifice that is so necessary unless it can he actually .forced to do go. That is the position that has existed in England. If honorable senators read the reports that come from other sources, they will .find that for all practical purposes the British Government and private enterprise supporting the Government have been virtually bombed into acquiescence' or to improving on their war effort. </para>

                            <para>- The object of the bill is- said to expedite, our war-time effort, and for. that purpose it. provides for the appointment of additional Ministers. I am endeavouring to show that, with all the. power at- their disposal, Ministers have, not, up to date, done what they should have done. It has been said that, we have made a good joh of our war-time effort. I agree that it is. good up to a point; but it is not' as good- as it should be. Thousands and thousands of men and millions of pounds worth of: material could be used to far better advantage than they are being used to-day. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has' said that Ministers should be paid their full salaries. I agree ; but what is that salary ? Is it in excess of their requirements? If it is, I suggest that it should not be. paid. If it is just sufficient for their requirements, then' it should be. paid, However, at this time, when people are: going' from door to door asking men. and women to make contributions to all sorts of funds, such as comforts funds, it is incumbent on members of Parliament to be prepared to make some sacrifice.. I do not think it is quite a legitimate proposal in time of war that, if additional Ministers are appointed, they should be paid in excess of their actual needs. I do not know what Ministers actually receive, but I assume their remuneration is much in excess of what they actually need. In these circumstances, I. do not believe that the people should be called upon to provide the additional amount required to meet the Government's proposal in this bill. </para>

                    <para>A t least in a time of war Ministers should bear in mind that our men at the front are receiving only 5s- a day, and that' the purchasing- power of that sum is con- siderably less to-day than it was during the last war, and during the South African War of 1901-1002. They should also bear in mind "that the purchasing power of those who are engaged in the manufacture- of munitions' is considerably less than, it was before the outbreak of  the war. When 'the people are being  asked to make sacrifices Ministers should be prepared to set a, good example.

                            <para>- The honorable senator will remember that when we were discussing the last budget proposals I " urged that no man, or woman, receiving less than Â£500 a year should be taxed until all persons in the community in receipt of more than that sum were taxed to the degree by which their income exceeded that figure. If that were done, the Government would have so much move purchasing power at its disposal, and could use that money to far better advantage than it is- being used at present. I do not advocate that people should at all times be obliged to live according to their bare needs; but in a time of war, not only members of Parliament but also all persons receiving considerably in excess of Â£1,000 a year should be prepared to accept the very least on which they can live. Until that is done we cannot claim that we have' equity -of sacrifice, or that  we are organizing a total war'.effort. Consequently, a bill of  this kind which does  not make provision for that sort- of thing should be opposed. Any member of Parliament -'iri receipt of Â£1,000 a year should be prepared to serve in. any capacity, either as a Minister, or as a member of a committee, without any additional remuneration- whatever, provided it can- be shown that he is not being put to any additional expense while working in those capacities. I am not suggesting for' one' moment that any member of Parliament, or any person outside, should unnecessarily make himself or herself a martyr; but I urge that members of Parliament should, so far as it is humanly practicable, set an example to the nation in this respect. If we propose to continue to pay salaries to Ministers at the same rate as before the war, plus all of the allowances they have hitherto received, and- at- the same time, we tell the people that they are to be reduced to the lowest possible, minimum, we are  not ' setting a good example. We "know that prices' are rising, and that every 'increase of prices reduces the purchasing power of those upon whom the prosperity of the nation principally depends, namely, the workers in the factories, and our soldiers in battle. If we are sincere in preaching equality of sacrifice, and in urging the greatest possible war effort, we should be the first to set an example to the people whom we desire to follow us. </para>

                        <para>. - I approve the measure. On this occasion, however, I cannot refrain from remarking that throughout the history of the Country party, even at a time when that party had six or seven members in this chamber and the Government was entirely dependent upon their assistance to secure the passage of legislation through the Senate, on not one occasion when a new ministry was being formed has a member of the Country party in the Senate been offered a portfolio. As I am on the eve of relinquishing my seat in this chamber, honorable senators will admit that 1 have no axe to grind in this matter. I direct these few remarks to the Government as a healthy reminder which, if it "cannot be acted upon at this juncture, will,. I hope, be borne in mind in the future. This is a matter to which, in all fairness to members of the Country party, the attention of the Government should be drawn. </para>

                        <para>. - I direct the attention of the Government to the action taken recently by the Public Trustee in Darwin. A man named Webb, who resided at Perth, a carpenter by trade, went ito  Darwin,  where he was killed on Saturday, 21st September last. Although  eight months- have elapsed since his death, his estate has not yet been, finalized by the authorities. On the 4th February of this year, his widow received a letter stating that Ids tools had. been sold for Â£9 and *hat his clothes were in the hands of *he Public Trustee. Honorable senators will agree that no qualified carpenter would travel anywhere without a good set of tools. Certainly a carpenter would not contemplate buying tools in Darwin and paying unusally high prices- for them even if they were available there. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webb's</inline> widow and his father lave informed me that he had a full kit of tools, including two big planes valued at 37s. 6d. each, several smaller planes, four saws,- and a tool case valued at 25s. The tools were sold by the Public Trustee  at Darwin without the permission of the man's widow, who was his next of kin. That is a very wrong practice. The Public Trustee had no right to sell the tools without first obtaining authority. I contend that the powers of the Public Trustee  in' this respect should be cur- * Sailed. The secretary of the union to which the deceased belonged in Western Australia wrote to his widow saying that the tools were supposed to . be sent from Darwin to Perth. I understand that a carpenter offered <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. "Webb</inline> Â£25 for the kit. A statement received from the office of the Public Trustee in Darwin relating to the estate of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webb</inline> said that on the 12th October the following goods had ï¿½n sold by auction at the prices stated: - </para>

The excuse given was that all the tools were not there. Who is to know that the tools were not there? The man was killed and his tools should have been sent back to  hi3  relatives without any delay.

                        <para>. - I desire to bring to the notice of the Government two matters, one of which relates to petrol rationing. There is a large number of settlers in Western Australia, and no doubt in other States, who are on small holdings situated from 5 to 25 miles from a railway. Some of them have no horses, and they depend for their transport on small utility trucks or old cars. I appeal to the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride)</inline> to see that, in implementing petrol rationing, every consideration is given to such people. A friend of mine who has a small property carrying 200 or 300 sheep has been left to manage the holding by himself, because his sons have gone . to the wai*.  His  only means of transport is an old car which he .uses in travelling over his property and to obtain his supplies from the railway siding several miles distant. There are many such cases, and while I would certainly  not argue in this chamber in favour of special consideration being given to people in the cities who can easily travel by tram, rail or bus, I contend that the man on the land who depends for his living on managing his holding efficiently should be given sympathetic treatment. Even if the city people have no petrol at all for pleasure the small farmer with an old car or utility truck should receive sufficient to enable him to run his property efficiently. Many of these people cannot afford to install producergas units while, in some cases, the vehicles are of too low a horse-power to permit the use of such units. When I was in Western Australia recently several such cases were "brought to my notice by members of the Western Australian Parliament. 1 hope that whatever policy the Government may pursue in regard to restricting the use of petrol, greater consideration will be given to farmers owning small .properties. </para>

                    <para>I should like to deal also with the price of superphosphate. In doing so I shall not, refer to the motion that my colleague from Western Australia so ably and properly introduced into this chamber to-day, because I should be out of order in so doing. As honorable senators are aware, since the outbreak of war there has been an increase of 2Gs. a ton in the price of superphosphate. Co-operative companies iu Western Australia have issued circulars advising wheat-growers and others to .buy superphosphate at once and lay in a reserve supply for next year, because the price will increase considerably, possibly by Â£2 a ton. - That is all very well for those comparatively few settlers who have the necessary financial resources to place their orders, now, .but the great majority of our settlers are living from hand to mouth. They are oppressed by ever increasing costs of production and they had great difficulty in paying for the small quantity of superphosphate that they were able to buy this year at the increased price. They are not able to order next year's supply now, and I should like to know what the Government intends to do about the matter. Does it intend to. -carry the increased price of superphosphate, or does it intend to ask these people, who cannot alford to pay for next year's supply- now, to submit tamely to paying an extra Â£2 a ton? That may be all right for the people on some of the richer lands in the eastern States, but m udi of the settlement in Western Australia is on comparatively poor land, which without superphosphate is unproductive. It is the duty of the Commonweal.rh Government to do justice to these people. As I mentioned in a question this afternoon, a lead has been given in New Zealand,  where  the Labour Government has carried the whole of the increased price of superphosphate since the outbreak of war. In' addition, I understand, that superphosphate and other artificial manures are carried free on the government-owned railways, reliance being placed on increased production to make the railways pay. I am not asking the Commonwealth Government to do that, but surely an administration of which the Country party is an integral part - a party which exists for the pur- , pose of protecting the interests of primary producers - should not be less solicitous of the interests of men and women on the land throughout Australia than is the Government of New Zealand. I trust a. quick and favorable decision will be given in this serious matter. As the Government of New Zealand has carried the increased .cost of superphosphate since the outbreak of war, surely the Commonwealth Government should not do less for the primary producers of Australia. It is the clear duty of the Federal Country party to insist on this being done. </para>

                        <para>.- All honorable senators will agree that one of the best means of propaganda tq-day is the proper use of the cinema or talking picture. I saw an excellent picture that was recently released by the Department of Information called " The Defence of </para>

                    <para class="block">Tobruk". The photography was  excellent,  and the commentary all that could 8&gt;e desired. If this picture is distributed through the ordinary channels, a long time will elapse before it will be seen throughout Australia, and I suggest that a large number of copies of the film should be made to enable the various picture theatres to exhibit it within the next fortnight. The best time to appeal to the ' public for support is when public interest is at its height, and I suggest that the defence of Tobruk is a matter now occupying a prominent place  in  the thoughts of the great majority of 4he people. The picture shows the defences of Tobruk as built by the Italians -and also its defence by the Australians, lit gives a good idea of the country in which our men .are fighting, and of what they have to defend. It also furnishes an excellent representation of the conditions  Hinder  which they live. Photographs of army 'bakeries show how the troops are fed. There is an excellent photograph of Tobruk Harbour. A picture of the arrival of mails indicates how great is the appreciation of the men of the letters received from home, and this is all good propaganda. In my opinion, the best feature of the film is that which shows  an  air raid on shipping on the harbour. The raid was successful, the bombs falling around a ship and sinking it. The bring-  ing down of an enemy aircraft is also depicted. The Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">((Senator Foll)</inline> might give consideration to. the production of a large number of these films and their distribution throughout Australia, so that they could <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> exhibited within the  next  fortnight. . </para>

According to any reading of recent press reports, the price of this commodity has been increased, by Sd.. per lb. since the declaration of  Avar.  The reason given is that increased charges are made for tea over.seas and increased freight charges are imposed. I accept that explanation, but I protest against the whole of the in- creased charges being passed on to the consumers, because rents, rates of interest and profits have not been reduced. It may he said that the Prices Commissioner has mot power to reduce rents, rates of interest and profits, hut this is a matter to which the Government should give consideration. The larger the number of men who leave Australia for service overseas, the smaller is the quantity of tea consumed, and where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Prices Commissioner that a trader cannot carry on at the pre-war rate of profit, the price of tea is increased. If there is to he equality of sacrifice, and if landlords and wholesalers and retailei'3 are to bear their fair share of the war-time burden, the exorbitant rents charged for shops used- for the purpose of retailing tea and other commodities should be reduced, the interest rates" charged by banks should be reduced, and, in fact, all charges recovered through the price of tea should be reduced. The. Prices Commissioner, however, is maintaining the <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline> for the landlord, the financier, and the wholesaler and- retailer of tea, and the whole of the burden is being passed oh to the consumer. If the Government considers that the workers should give up the right to strike it must do something in respect of the right to profiteer. We cannot allow progressive profiteering, and at the same time maintain industrial peace. To the extent that these charges are passed on, and the purchasing power of the workers is reduced both directly and indirectly, the Government is primarily responsible for any industrial strikes and disputes that may occur. In a time of war, increases of prices cannot be justified. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with wages in a moment or two.' I am assuming that it is true that the increases of the price of tea are passed on, but the Government is placing the whole of. the burden on the consumers, and particularly the consumers who cannot pass on increased costs. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> that any increase of wages  i3  nullified almost simultaneously by increases of commodity prices. We are told that increased prices must be charged when wages are increased, but, even if the basic wage' were increased to Â£10 a week to-morrow, the increase would at once be met, under existing conditions, by increased prices, and the wage-worker  would not be able to purchase any more loaves of bread, pounds of meat or fruit, or suits of clothes or housing than before. In terms of commodities and in terms of gold the basic wage is no higher to-day than it was when it was originally fixed at Â£2 2s. a week. That sum would purchase at that time the same quantity of food and clothing as could be bought for Â£49s., the basic wage of to-day. </para>

                    <para>The position with regard to tea is similar to that regarding potatoes and other commodities where the growers are able to obtain prices sufficient to compensate them for the labour involved in their production. I suggest that the Prices Commissioner should take that matter into consideration. I do not suggest for a moment that he has the power to do wha should be done, but the Government should do what the New Zealand Government, is doing. It pays to the growers the maximum price that would enable them to live decently and pay their way, while at the same time they sold their products at the minimum price. Of course, there would be a balance to be made up. </para>

                            <para>- From the Consolidated Revenue. A man receiving Â£1,000 a year would contribute more to the Consolidated Revenue than a man on the basic wage. He should, in dutybound, assist the wage-earner and the potato-grower to carry on. I had the temerity to say that the whole process of price fixing was a fraud and a farce and I repeat that, because it will remain so until the Government deals more equitably with the matter. The industrial peace that we wish to maintain and the relationship which is necessary for the organization of a total war effort can be established only by the Government giving sympathetic consideration to this problem. If the Government says that extra charges should be passed on to the workers, thus reducing their purchasing power, we shall not do what should be done in the direction of organizing the war-time effort. </para>

It may be that a man pays Â£1 a week for a house, but should he sub-let certain rooms, thereby allowing two families to occupy the house, he may receive 30s. a week for it.

                        ("Western Australia) {9.20 ] . - I wish to clear up some misunderstanding which has arisen out of a statement which I made in . this chamber on the 2nd April when I directed attention to certain matters affecting universal trainees under the Defence Act. Men called up under the compulsory provisions of the Defence Act to undergo a preliminary medical examination frequently lose a day's pay, or a portion of a day's pay, without receiving any compensation. In some instances these men have to travel into country centres for examination and lose time from their work. Workers in the timber industry and others in outback places should not be penalized in that way. I ask the Minister to see that these men are compensated for the losses incurred by them in complying with the Act.

                    <para>Some time ago, I drew attention to the treatment of young men who applied to join the Royal Australian Navy, but were rejected because at some earlier period in their lives they had committed some minor misdemeanour. These young men were not even medically examined. The reason given to the applicants for. their rejection is that in- certain respects they do not comply with necessary qualifications. I got in touch with the Naval Depot at Fremantle, and asked the reason for the rejection of certain young men, but all that I could get from them was that the applicants had not been up to the required standard. Obviously, the standard referred to was neither physical nor mental, because the young men in question had not been subjected -to either a physical or an educational test. The ' applicants were told that, although unsuitable for the Navy, they could apply to join some other branch of the service. Such treatment of lads is wrong, and the Government should not permit it. </para>

                    <para>I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston-</inline> that the Government recognizes that country motorists suffer many disabilities under petrol rationing which do not apply to dwellers in the cities. The Government intends to set up local committees in country districts to investigate these disabilities'. Their position is entirely different from that of city-dwellers who live close to tram and bus routes. I assure the honorable senator that country people will be given every opportunity to put their claims for extra petrol supplies before the proper authority. </para>
                    <para>I was pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> refer in terms of praise to the film released by the Department of Information depicting the defence of Tobruk. I agree with the honorable senator that such films constitute a very valuable part of our information service by keeping the people in touch with the doings, of our gallant troops. If it be possible to arrange for a wide and rapid exhibition of this film, and others depicting the exploits of our men abroad, the department will be only too glad to do so. </para>

                        <para>- Immediately after the outbreak of the war the Government took steps to protect the public against rising prices by establishing a price-fixing . authority.
