I am confident that you will get full support from every honorable senator in maintaining the honour and dignity of the high office to which you have been called. I think that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> was slightly ill-advised to make the remarks that he did make regarding absentee- senators, because he knows that it is not possible for the Opposition to give pairs in a ballot of the kind which has just been taken. The voting, therefore, has been carried out strictly in accordance with the Standing Orders. That is all I desire to say at this stage: except to add that we expect that honorable senators on the Government side will be as loyal to the gentleman who has been elected  President,  as we on this side have always been to his predecessors in that high office. </para>

                    (South AustraliaMinister for Supply and Development) | 4.27 | . - As Leader of the Senate, I  do  not think that a parliamentary committee is a satisfactory body to examine and report on such highly technical matters as the growing and processing of flax. I therefore ask the Senate to reject the motion. Having read the speech deliveredby the honorable senator in moving his motion, I am of the opinion that he grossly exaggerated the position.

                            <para>.- I understood that this matter was to be referred to a committee which will deal with rural disabilities. If so, it may be that that procedure would be satisfactory to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett.</inline> If, however, it is proposed to discuss the motion and take  a  vote on it, I desire to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has not stated the position accurately. As the growing and processing  of  flax is an entirely new industry in Tasmania, it is not unlikely that anomalies exist in that State. The honorable senator pointed out that some of the buildings which are being used to treat the flax are not satisfactory. In the short time which has elapsed since the industry was inaugurated in Tasmania the Government could hardly be expected to erect mills and other buildings for storing, retting and drying flax. Like many other primary products, flax is a seasonal crop. Flax ripens as do other crops, and it is then dealt with according to the methods thought to be most suitable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> said that in wet seasons the flax might be destroyed, but that is not so. </para>

                        <para class="block">Our trouble in Australia is that the rainfall is generally not sufficient to ret the flax. There is no danger of the flax grown in this country being destroyed by too much moisture. In outlining some of the processes through which the flax has to pass, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> said that it is carted from the field to the mills, stacked at or near the mills, carted from the mills to the thresher for de-seeding and then back to the field for retting. What other procedure does the honorable senator- suggest should bc adopted? A farmer will not stack his flax on his own farm and then cart it to the mill and thresh it.. After the seed has been extracted it has to be sent to the retting fields to ret. In Victoria the flax is carted from, the field to the mill, stacked alt the mill and then threshed at the stack.

                                <para>- At the stack. The straw is then spread out in the field and retted. I do not know what other procedure could be adopted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has suggested that the flax should be pit-retted and treated in drying sheds. I point out that in Ireland, Belgium and other countries where flax is grown in large quantities the flax is all dried in thefields. Drying plants to process the flax would cost about £10,000 each. The flax industry is merely an experiment as far as Tasmania is concerned. F]ax production. was rushed upon the Commonwealth Government by the British Government, which has offered to buy the whole of our production at a fair price - £5 15s. for standard and a premium for that above standard - just as' it did during. the last war. Private enterprise has not developed the flax industry in Australia to the degree that one would expect because of the serious competition offered by Italian hemp. During the last war, flax was sold to the British Government at £5 a ton, but it could not meet the competition of Italian hemp, and, as the result, the production of flax in this country waned. To Tasmania, flax-growing is a new industry, but in Victoria flax has been- grown, milled and treated successfully for over 30 years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has proposed that a joint committee of the Parliament be appointed to inquire into the whole of the ramifications of the industry. From whom, is it proposed, that the committee should take evidence? I point out to the. honorable senator that the only people in Australia competent to advise the Government in connexion with this industry are the eight experts of the Victorian Department of Agriculture, all of whom learned their business in Belgium, Ireland and other large flax-producing countries as well as Victoria. </para>

                                <para>- The State Governments are responsible for growing the flax, and the Commonwealth Government, through the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and its <inline font-style="italic">experts,</inline> undertakes responsibility for processing it. The quota allotted to Victoria is 28,000 acres, and it is all taken up. Very good crops a&gt;re grown in the southern districts of the State. For 30 years the flax produced in the southern districts of Victoria has been retted, scutched and prepared so successfully that it has brought £1S0 a ton on the London market. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> says that the decorticating process is a new one. That process which was evolved by a gentleman whom I happen to know simply involves the crushing of the dry, flax straw. When the dry flax straw i3 crushed, only the fibre is left. The fibre, which is not scutched or bleached, is sold on the London market at one-half the price of retted, scutched and bleached flax. The only advantage in the decorticating process is that probably it enables the flax to be dealt with speedily. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> says that the flax-growing areas of Victoria and Tasmania are too damp, and that a lot of the flax is wasted, when spread out in the fields to ret. If that be so, how  does  the honorable senator account for the fact that in Belgium and Ireland, where the climate is not so favorable as the Tasmanian climate, practically the whole of the flax produced is retted in the field? As a matter of fact the heavier the dew the better the retting. .Flax- can be grown remarkably well in irrigation areas where the proper quantity of water can be applied. Unfortunately, however, our irrigation areas are not sufficiently moist to ret it. Flax grown in irrigation areas has therefore to be transported to more moist districts or, failing that, to be watered by hand, or pit retted, which is too expensive. In Victoria the Flax Fibres Limited operated two rope cordage mills until last year,  when  they were taken over and operated by the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has said that these mills are inefficient. I point- out that the whole of the industry in Tasmania is in its infancy. It received a tremendous impetus when, almost at a moment's notice, the British Government asked us to endeavour to  supply  its requirements of fibre. Until recently the authorities administering the scheme for the growing of flax have not "had time to arrange proper supervisors. They have now done so. Had the officers of the Tasmanian Department of Agriculture done what the experts of the Victorian Government have advised, the flax industry in Tasmania would be in a much better position to-day. . </para>

Honorable  senators  will  recall  that  some time  ago the  Government imported about 400 tons of seed from abroad  but  it arrived too late  for  planting in most of the districts in Victoria. A good deal of that seed was subsequently planted in Tasmania. There are two classes of flax seed. Sisal Crown, which - produces a lot of fibre and very little seed - and that iswhat the Government is seeking to-day - and Blue Riga, which produces a lot of seed and very little fibre. The farmers in the old country sought to grow flax which yielded heavy crops of seed because of its value in the manufacture of linseed meal and linseed cake, which are used for feeding cattle. I venture to say that if, in a normal season, flax seed is planted at the right time, no difficulty will be experienced in growing good average length fibre, .particularly in Victoria. Last year thousands of acres of seed were sown .too late, with the result that the crop had to be harvested for seed as the fibre was of practically no value. </para>

                        <para>I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> that this matter should be referred to the committee investigating rural disabilities. Only experts can advise the Government on the manufacturing side of the industry. They comprise the manufacturers, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the eight advisors of the Victorian Government to whom I have referred. </para>

                                <para>- It is, in some instances. Generally, however, it is spread out and retted in the fields. Pit retting is too costly and it is almost- impossible to obtain the necessary labour to carry on the work. When flax is retted in the field, it is simply spread over acres of country. The retting is done automatically by the dew and exposure to rain. </para>

It is a coarse fibre used in the manufacture of rope and binder twine. I should say that flax could be grown in New Zealand as well as it is grown in any State of the Commonwealth. I am satisfied that, through its system of inspection, the Commonwealth is doing everything possible to assist the flax-growers. The matters referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> will be referred to. the inspectors who, I understand, have now been appointed by the Government. .If it be found that wastage is taking place, remedial measures will be taken by those Government appointees. I. trust that the Senate will reject the motion. </para>

                            <para>. - I support the motion submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett.</inline> I am astounded at the speech just made by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay).</inline> First, the honorable senator told us that the processing of flax is a highly difficult operation. That is obvious; every one knows that. Then he said that the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> were grossly exaggerated, but he failed to indicate in what respect overstatements had been made. The Leader of the Senate asks us to accept his estimate of the value of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett's</inline> statements. It would be very convenient to have a complacent Senate, prepared to do as the honorable senator asks; but before we accept his statement, we should be informed how he justifies his claim that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett's</inline> remarks were grossly exaggerated. Once again, the Leader of the Senate has indulged in his usual practice of treating this chamber in a contemptuous manner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson,</inline> on the other hand, did attempt to submit a case from his point of view. It would have been far better had the Government allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> to secure the adjournment of the debate. Had that course been followed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> would have had an opportunity to prepare his speech on the motion before the Senate, and I feel sure that we would have had. a better explanation of the position than we have had from the Leader of the Senate. "We have been told that the industry is in the experimental stage. </para>

The request is perfectly legitimate, and the weight of evidence which lias been adduced in this debate supports <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett's</inline> case. The honorable senator's allegations of waste and inefficiency in the industry have not been refuted by the Government. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has made some damaging admissions, which strengthen <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett's</inline> request for an inquiry. When moving his motion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> stressed the point t'hat he wanted to make certain that this industry would be established on a permanent basis, and not merely for the duration of the war, after which it would be abandoned as so many other industries have been abandoned by anti-Labour Governments. We know that cheapness of labour is the main consideration with which such governments are concerned. If flax can be grown more cheaply in India, I can imagine this Government saying, immediately after the war is over, we must abandon this young industry and import flax. </para>

                                <para>- Before the war we were 'importing it iii considerable quantities. Indeed, one reason why the industry is now to be encouraged is because flax fibre can no longer- be obtained from abroad. When the war is over, we do not want the Government to say, as it did after the last war in respect of many primary and secondary industries, that this industry must 'be closed down, and preference given to those countries which can produce flax more cheaply than we can produce it. That danger exists in respect of many primary industries. Owing to the closing down of the shipbuilding industry we find now that we cannot build ships to meet our requirements, or even equal the output of that industry when it was previously in existence. A similar fate may be in store for the flax industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has emphasized that we should make certain that the industry is established on a permanent basis, and will bc enabled to carry on successfully, not only for the duration of the war, but after the war. For that reason ho wan ls to be assured that the present management of the industry is capable of running the industry successfully. As a representative of Tasmania in this chamber, ha has rightly directed attention to wastage and inefficiency on the part of the management of the industry. In the absence of any evidence from the Government to the contrary, we can only conclude that his representations arc worthy of support. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has suggested that the matter might be inquired into by one of the various committees which are now functioning. I do not know whether any of those committees is empowered to conduct such an inquiry, but in -the absence- of any direction from this Parliament, each of those committees would be within its rights in refusing to do' so. Consequently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson's</inline> suggestion is not very helpful. Our only alternative is to agree to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett's</inline> motion. In any case, what has the management of the industry to fear from the proposed inquiry? </para>

                                <para>- The industry should welcome such an inquiry, particularly as it is in the experimental stage. An inquiry is also desirable, because it will be the means of procuring evidence to defeat any move which, may be made later to abandon the industry on the ground that, we cannot grow and pro'cess flax successfully in Australia, or because our costs greatly exceed those in other countries. We can well imagine such a proposal being made after the war, and the Government recommending, reluctantly, of course, that the industry be abandoned. That has happened in respect of many industries which have been placed under national control, because of the opposition of private enterprise, which is more concerned about, makingprofit* than serving the national interests. In this instance, . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> is primarily concerned about the nation's interests. I hope, therefore, that his motion will be carried. . </para>

                            <para>. - I commend my colleague from Tasmania for the trouble which he has taken to bring this matter to the notice of honorable senators. Tasmania is not an industrial State. When we were a?ked to grow flax in order to help in the war effort, many farmers entered wholeheartedly into the scheme; but they now find that, owing to  i . :  <inline font-style="italic">r</inline> ;  i i <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> i  the unsatisfactory layout of the mills by Commonwealth officers, they cannot engage in the industry economically. I do not know the officers responsible for the planning of those mills. The farmers in Tasmania were sanguine that the industry would be established permanently, and would prove of immediate benefit in our war effort. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson's</inline> statement that the experts in Victoria could have overcome the difficulties experienced in Tasmania helps us in any way. It is evident that the experts who were sent to Tasmania by the Commonwealth were not capable of doing their job. It may be. that among the many committees now functioning, one may be able to deal with this industry. However, I still think that an inquiry into the flax industry must be held. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett's</inline> statement about the difficulties of processing flax should be investigated by one of those committees. </para>

                            <para>. - After listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> when he was moving his motion, I felt that I could not let the opportunity pass to make a few observations concerning this industry. It was during my term as Minister in charge of Scientific Development that the first proposal was made to the Government for production of flax in Australia on a large scale. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has pointed out', the growers in the southern States have been carrying on successfully for seine years. However, difficulties have been experienced in processing in this country. Eoi- that reason the British Government, sent to Australia one of the world's leading flax processers to investigate not, the growing of flax - it was convinced that we could grow it - but our methods of processing. I do not wish to reflect upon the management of any of the mills, but several gentlemen wilh whom I had confidential communications on the subject assure me that the difficulty arises mainly because the management of some of the mills is "innocently, but ignorantly. inefficient". As Minister in charge of Scientific Development, I arranged with representatives of the industry to send abroad for processing a certain quantity of flax after it had been pulled. I point out, in passing, that that  i |i  m I ; i &gt;  i . ; .  is the mast economic way of harvesting  flax from the farmer's point of . view. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has made out a case for an inquiry into the industry; but I do not think that such an inquiry calls for the appointment of a select committee. Our farmers know how to grow flax. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> proposes that an inquiry be made into the growing side of the industry. That aspect has already been reported upon; and stress has been laid upon the quality of the land required for the growing of flax. The honorable senator also alleged inefficiency in the layout of some of the i mills. Our difficulties in that respect arise, probably, because of the fact that the industry is only in the experimental stage. The reason for the demand by the British Government for flax from Australia follows the decision of Russia to embark upon the production of linen. Previously, Russia, Latvia and Estonia supplied flax to the linen mills in Belfast, for which Irish production was insufficient. Now Russia will take all supplies from' Latvia and Estonia. Perhaps an inquiry is necessary, but we should hardly use a sledgehammer to crack so small a nut. The difficulty arises in regard to processing. Flax sent from Australia to mills abroad passed all tests for quality when processed, and samples were sent back to Australia. Our inability to achieve efficiency in processing, is clue partly to lack of experts. I have discussed this matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson.</inline> I understand that among the multitude of committees to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> referred is a Rural Industries Committee which could inquire into this industry. That committee could obtain expert evidence and find ways and means to rectify the. inefficiency which has been made evident by the unsatisfactory layout of various mills. After all, that is the burden of the honorable senator's attack on the industry. The choice of retting processes is not very important. We know that different processes are followed overseas because opinion varies as to the efficiency of each process. I suggest that we should not set up a select committee to inquire into a matter of this kind when a committee capable of dealing with it is already in existence. Indeed, I know of no reason why this matter could not be referred to some branch of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. </para>

                        <para>The ordinary individual cannot grapple with the chemical intricacies of this industry. Whilst I am opposed to the appointment of a select committee, I would support the honorable senator if he amended his motion to provide that this matter be referred to the Rural Industries Committee, or some similar authority capable of assessing the value of whatever technical evidence  i3  available in this country. I sympathize with those engaged in the flax industry because of the difficulties which confront them. It is an industry which will be of extreme value to this country in the years to come. </para>

                                - I listened attentively to. the opposition expressed to my motion, and the most surprising feature of it is the contradictory nature of the statements made by honorable senators opposite. First, the Minister for Supply and Development
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline>
                                said that it was not a matter for a select committee, but rather for a body of experts, and for that reason he opposed the motion. Then,
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline>
                                declared that the matter was not one to be investigated by a select committee, and should be handed over to the Rural Industries. Committee.
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline>
                                J. McLachlan supported
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline>
                                in defiance of the statement made by the Minister.
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline>
                                also said .that the flax industry had been established in this country for 30 years, and that flax had been processed in Victoria and sold on the English market at £180 a. ton. Then,
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline>
                                J. McLachlan said that the industry was only in its experimentalstages and that flax had not been processed in Victoria, but had been sent to' England for processing. Although I. 6poke for nearly 40 minutes when moving the motion,  not one honorable senator who has opposed it has been able to point to one word in my speech which was not absolutely correct. Although honorable senators opposite claimed that I had indulged in gross exaggerations, they could not point to any portion of my speech which was an exaggeration. The reason for that is very simple. They know very well that I had stated cold facts which could not be contradicted.
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline>
                                claimed that, I had cast a slur on the
                            </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">Tasmanian Agricultural Department. That is entirely incorrect. If the honorable senator peruses my speech closely he will find that I did not cast a slur on that department. In fact, I repeat now what I said previously that the Tasmanian Department of Agriculture has co-operated with the Commonwealth Government, and the ' Flax Production Committee has played a wonderful part in the development of the industry. Had the Commonwealth Government and the committee done their jobs as well as that department has done its job, there would bc no need to ask for a select committee. I resent the suggestion that I cast a slur on the Tasmanian Department of Agriculture. I did not do so, nor did I reflect in any way on the departments of agriculture in any of the four flaxproducing States concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline>  referred to the decorticating machines which, he claimed, were used in a new process. I know it is a new process. The honorable senator claimed that considerable experimenting was being carried out, and I am well aware of that. But he did not say why it was necessary to have four of these machines for the experiments to be carried out by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, or why they are lying idle while the flax is dew-retting. Neither did he tell us why the man who invented this machine and carried out experiments with it is engaged in a flax mil] in Tasmania and has not been given one ' of these machines. I understand that he went through all the experimental stages with the machine and then submitted it to the Flax Production Committee. These are questions which the honorable senator did not attempt to deal with. He did, however, say that the matter was one for experts. Apparently he considers that the ordinary man has not .sufficient common sense to understand that the handling of flax ten times instead of only twice increases the cost of production. The honorable senator said that all the necessary information could be supplied by the eight experts. </para>

I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson,</inline> as a farmer, if he does not realize that the costs of production are greatly increased, if any commodity is handled ten times when it is necessary to handle it only twice? Does he not appreciate that it is uneconomic to carry flax from one shed to another on motor lorries instead of having it moved by a conveyor ? If the honorable senator does not know these things we can understand why he says that the experts are .the only men from whom, advice could be obtained, and if he does know them he is merely trying to camouflage the issue. Obviously he does not know all about the industry and is trying to smother things up on behalf of some interest or other. I am. endeavouring to expose inefficiency. </para>

I should also call the  managers of the flax mills, the engineers who designed the layout of the mills and the other engineers who submitted plans, but were not given a hearing. Evidence should also be obtained from the producers themselves who are clamouring for higher prices for flax because of rising costs of production. In regard to the actual costs of the production, I should be prepared to call evidence from anybody possessing information, including even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson,</inline> who claims to be the champion of champions, in this chamber, of the flax industry. </para>

The general manager of Flax Fibres Limited is not conducting the show in the interests of Australia nor as economically as it should be conducted. That is a reason why I ask for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> also spoke about the threshing of seed at the stacks and the threshing of seed in the mills in Tasmania. I am not going to tell the honorable gentleman that the flax is deseeded at the stacks in Victoria, but my statement of the position in Tasmania is correct and can be verified by any one visiting that State. I repeat that the money now being wasted in carrying flax from thestacks to the deseeding mills, from the. deseeding mills to the retting-pits, and from the retting-pits to the dryingsheds and so on would be sufficient in one year to provide dutch barns to bold all the flax that we are processing. </para>

In his own speech he dealt merely with generalities. He estimated the cost of erecting drying shed? to dry from pit-retting at £10,000. I point out that, this industry today is worth millions of pounds if it is handled in the right way. I ask the honorable senator, if it is not worth an outlay of £10,000, why is the Flax Board building dryingsheds at the mills to dry the flax after it comes from the pits? He must be aware that that is being done. If the sheds are not required, the select committee should inquire into the matter. </para>

                                <para>- I understand that. Obviously a shed would be useless without plant, and the honorable senator is well aware of that. Today, the managers of the various mills are paying men who are supposed to have had experience in the processing of flax. Some of them told me that they have had years of experience in Victoria in the mills which the honorable senator himself has mentioned, but are prevented from doing anything on their own initiative. Previously I made representations to the Minister for Supply and Development for adequate storage space for flax, but my request was turned down. Some months afterwards, the wisdom of my representations was recognized, and more storage space was provided at some of the mills. At one mill a shed used for the storage of flax in order to keep it dry before it was taken to the deseeding plant is situated about 50 yards fromthat plant. The flax had to be loaded on a lorry to enable it to be carted from that shed a distance of 50 yards to the deseeding plant, although the storage shed could have been built at the end of the deseeding shed: As it was found that the flax became wet during loading and unloading operations, the board went to the expense of building a skillion roof to provide cover for the flax. Some ridiculous mistakes have been made in the construction of these mills, and there is every justification for an inquiry regarding the lay-out of the mills, the processing of the flax and the functions of the board. </para>

                        <para>The Leader of the Senate stated that an investigation of the matters to which I have directed attention was not a job for a select committee, but he did not tell the Senate by whom these matters should be investigated. Who has a greater right to make inquiries of this kind than elected representatives in this Parliament? I ask the Minister not to belittle members of the Senate by suggesting that they have not  sufficient intelligence to carry out the necessary investigation. In view of the fact that production of flax next year is expected to be twice that of this year, and in view of the chaotic economic position, in the processing of the commodity, I claim that it is highly desirable to appoint a committee immediately. If the area under cultivation is doubled, it is probable that next year's production of flax will bc more than double that of this year, because this year's crop- was light. A committee would no doubt be able to make recommendations which would enable flax production to be placed on an economic basis as a post-war industry. </para>
