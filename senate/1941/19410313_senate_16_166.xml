            <para>- The erection of the two temporary buildings which are to be constructed between the two existing secretariats at the rear of Parliament House was decided upon by the Government on account of the urgent necessity for additional office accommodation in the Australian Capital Territory. The plans were referred to the National Capital Planning and Development Committee, which was not in favour of the construction of the buildings on the proposed sites ; but the Government decided, despite the opinion of the committee, to proceed with the work owing to the extreme urgency of the matter. 1 emphasize that the committee took no exception to the plans themselves, but did not approve of the erection of the buildings on the sites selected. The growth of departments in Canberra, principally the Department of Commerce and the Trade and Customs Department, has been so rapid during the period of the war that the present accommodation makes efficient work almost impossible in two or three departments. The Government considers, therefore, that, although departure from the Griffin plan in a small detail is undoubtedly involved, it is absolutely necessary in the interests of efficient administration that this extra accommodation shall be provided. These two buildings will bo constructed between existing two secretariats. They will be constructed of brick, and will be of two storeys. In no way will they spoil the general lay-out of Canberra, since the sites to be used have not been allotted for any other purpose. </para>

              <para>- The site for that structure is well to the rear of those on which the two new secretariats are to be erected. We may as well face the facts, and realize that the permanent Parliament House is not likely to be constructed for many years. The present Parliament House will serve the requirements of Australia for a long period. I say quite frankly that; by the time this building has outlived its usefulness, and the government of the day has decided to erect a permanent Parliament House, the two temporary secretariats now to be built will have paid for themselves many times. No great loss would be sustained if they then had to be removed. </para>

            <para>- Is tho Minister for the Interior aware of the fact that, in proceeding with the erection of the buildings in question, there has been a definite breach of the legal provisions regarding the Griffin plan? Are we to understand that, in view of all that has taken place, the Griffin plan has been finally and definitely abandoned ? Is the Minister aware that foundations for a permanent administrative building already exist, and that upon them extra office accommodation could be provided? Is he also aware that these foundations cost many thousands of pounds, and that they have been lying idle continuously for a long period? Does he know that allegations were made that the foundations, which cost thousands of pounds, were not properly completed, and were, therefore, unsafe, that more money was expended to disprove that assertion, and that the foundations are now perfectly safe. For how much longer does the Government propose to depart from the Griffin plan as it departed from it when it erected the War Memorial at the foot of Mount Ainslie and the King George V. Memorial in the front of Parliament House? Those works constitute the. two most atrocious acts of vandalism so far as the Griffin plan is concerned. </para>

          <para>SenatorFOLL. - The Government decided as a matter of extreme urgency to proceed with the construction of these buildings. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> has said with regard to the foundations for the main administrative building is correct; and I regret just as much as he does that the construction of that building was not proceeded with on those foundations. That work is estimated to cost between &#163;800,000 and &#163;1,000,000, and to take approximately three years to complete. However, as I have already pointed out, the Government is faced with the problem of providing additional departmental accommodation in Canberra immediately. I feel sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> visited the offices of any of the departments which I have mentioned, he would realize the urgency for providing this extra accommodation. The Government came to the conclusion that this could best be done by erecting temporary buildings on either the site mentioned or on any other site. However, the site chosen is the most convenient in relation to the existing secretariats. My officers advise that it would not be practicable to spend &#163;80,000 on the construction of a small portion on the proposed permanent building. I repeat that the Government has no intention to depart to any great degree from the Griffin plan. </para>

              <para>- That statement is not correct. The Government has set up a special committee to advise it on the development of Canberra according to the Griffin plan, and with one or two minor exceptions that plan has not been departed from in the layout of Canberra. However, I was asked by the Government to provide extra accommodation for the departments I have mentioned as rapidly and as conveniently as possible, and in response to that request I submitted this scheme which had previously been drawn up by my predecessor. Unless the Government alters its decision on the matter I propose <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> push on with the construction of these buildings as rapidly as possible. </para>

            <para>- Is the construction of these temporary buildings likely to have any bearing on the transfer of departments from Melbourne to Canberra? Has their erection in brick received the approval of the National Capital Planning and Development Committee ? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>SenatorFOLL. - Once the Government decided to erect these buildings on this site, the plans were submitted to that committee, and it approved of them. I again make it clear, however, that that committee did not approve of the site. The provision of this extra accommodation will enable us to expedite the transfer of more departments from Melbourne to Canberra. However, our immediate purpose is to provide extra accommodation for the Commerce and Trade and Customs Departments, and the newly-created Department of Labour and National Service, the head-quarters of which the Minister in charge of that department is desirous of establishing in Canberra. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister for Information aware that arrangements to broadcast an address by a member of the British Labour party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> W. G. Mackay, from station 3LO were cancelled at the last minute ? If he is not aware of the reasons why that arrangement was cancelled, will he inquire into the matter and furnish the Senate with the reason? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>SenatorFOLL. - The speech which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackay</inline> was to deliver over the national stations was submitted in the ordinary way to the censor who excised much of its contents.Whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackay</inline> is a member of the British Parliamentary Labour party, he is not a member of the House of Commons. At present he is a candidate for a seat in Somerset. However, the censorship of his speech was not in any way related to his membership of the British Labour party. No question of political censorship entered into the matter at all. After the speech was censored, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackay,</inline> whom I know very well, showed me his script, and asked me what I thought of the censor&#39;s excisions. I told him that generally I agreed with them. I thought that whilst the speech could have been useful in certain circumstances, the censor was justified, at the present juncture, in prohibiting reference to certain matters with which it dealt. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackay</inline> was informed of the excisions he did not think it worthwhile to give the address and, consequently, his broadcast was cancelled. </para>

There is a tremendous strain on railway rolling-stock at present, and owing to the fact that the Trans-Australian line is of the standard gauge of 4 ft. in. it is impracticable to obtain additional rolling-stock from other parts of Australia. Some rolling-stock is being built. </para>

            <para>. - I direct attention to the unsatisfactory answers given by Ministers in this chamber to questions which I ask. Yesterday, I asked a question, without notice, of the Minister representing the Treasurer, but I had to go to the press to get the information I sought. It is strange that the newspapers can obtain information which I cannot secure from the Treasurer. The question which I asked yesterday, and which I repeated to-day, upon notice, was as follows: - </para>

            <para>Is it a fact that since the war started the private banks have taken up &#163;32,000,000 of government securities and &#163;23,000,000 of treasury-bills, a total of &#163;55,000,000, and that during that time the Commonwealth Bank has reduced its holding of government securities by &#163;9,200,000? </para>

          <para class="block">According to a newspaper the trading banks have taken up &#163;32,000,000 in government securities and &#163;23,000,000 in treasury-bills- a total of &#163;55,000,000. The newspaper report reads - </para>

            <para>This means that trading banks have credited the Government with &#163;55,000,000 against which the Government will draw cheques. In return the Government has lodged with trading banks government securities and treasury-bills for the amount of credit created, and upon which the Government has undertaken to pay interest. </para>
            <para>In order to pay the private trading  banks  interest on this created credit, which rightly belongs to the people, the Government has had to increase the burden of taxation on the masses. </para>

            <para>If it is good enough for the private trading banks to accept Government securities and treasury-bills to the extent of &#163;55,000,000 in exchange for private bank credit, what is wrong with the Government lodging the same securities and treasury-bills with the Commonwealth Bank in exchange for the use of the people&#39;s own credit, debt free and interest free? </para>
            <para class="block">The <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> finance editor also made the astounding statement that while the private tradingbanks increased their holdings of Government securities by &#163;55,000,000 the people&#39;s Commonwealth Bank had reduced its holdings of Government securities by &#163;9,200,000. </para>
            <para>When information was sought some time ago in the Federal House regarding the pro portion of loans subscribed by the banks, the information was refused bythe Government, which indicates that it was not desired to let the people know the extent to which the banks had been allowed by the Government to manufacture credit for the purpose of lending to the people at the big &#34; rake off &#34; in interest. Honorable senators were informed some time ago that the flotation of the first war loan of &#163;23,000,000 was to be arranged between the Commonwealth Bank and the private trading hanks. Subsequently, I submitted a question in this chamber asking the Government to state the proportions of the loan subscribed by the Commonwealth Bank and by the private banks. The information was not furnished, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gillespie,</inline> the manager of the Bank of New South Wales stated at the annual meeting of shareholders that the private banks provided the whole of the &#163;23,000,000 raised. I have contended on previous occasions that the whole of this money could have been advanced to the Government by the Commonwealth Bank free of interest. If the money had been provided by the Commonwealth Bank at the same rate of interest as the private banks received for their advances the annual interest bill would have been &#163;600,000. I maintain that that amount could have been saved if the Government had done its duty. If the credits required by the Government were advanced through the Commonwealth Bank at an interest rate of 3&#190; per cent., the amount paid in interest would go back to the nation through the revenue of the Commonwealth Bank. I cannot understand why the Government continues to borrow money in this insane way. We have been told that the Menzies Government will borrow &#163;400,000,000 by 1944. Surely the Government should protect the taxpayers by securing interestfree money. On the 21st November last I submitted a proposal to the Government that a clause should be inserted in all government contracts stipulating that successful tenderers must use the Commonwealth Bank to finance their undertakings. I pointed out that this requirement would facilitate a reciprocity which in view of the fact that all profits from the Commonwealth Bank go back to the nation, would bring in a considerable revenue. The Government is spending millions of pounds on contracts, and the adoption of my proposal would bring in a larger revenue every year. Supposing that I, as a manufacturer of clothing, obtained a Government contract for &#163;50,000. If my financial resources did not enable me to finance the contract I should have to borrow from a private trading bank and pay interest at the rate of 6 per cent. I would feel in duty bound to use the nation&#39;s bank in order to finance my Government contract. However, the Government took no notice of my proposal. I cannot understand why the Government does not adopt a policy of this nature. </para>
