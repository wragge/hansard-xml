            <para>- I recently made  a  statement in regard to this matter, and a report of my remarks appeared in the press. Up to the end of April, 411 discharged returned soldiers had registered for employment in the different branch offices of the Repatriation Commission, and at that date all had been placed in employment with the exception of 51. Since the inception of the scheme for assisting these men, the sum of &#163;3,146 has been paid by way of sustenance to them whilst awaiting suitable employment. This measure of assistance,  as  honorable senators will be aware, is extended to men discharged after service abroad with satisfactory service records, and the measure of sustenance ranges from &#163;2 2s.  a  week, in the case of single men, to &#163;4 2s. 6d. a week for a man with a wife and three or more dependent children. In addition, the commission may provide up to &#163;10 for the purchase of tools of trade by way of gift, and in special cases the commission may advance an additional amount up to &#163;40 by way of loan for the same purpose. It is considered that the great majority of men who have been placed in employment will continue in their positions either permanently or for lengthy periods, subject, of course, to the usual percentage of changes common to the particular occupations in which they have been placed; but,  as  far  as  practicable, every endeavour has been made to secure for these men classes of employment which will afford every opportunity of permanency. The commission is to be highly commended for the enthusiasm it has displayed in this branch of its work. It desires to secure suitable employment for these ex-soldiers with a minimum of delay, and to this end the  Deputy  Commissioners report that considerable success has resulted from personal interviews with the men themselves. With the encouragement held out to them, they look upon the commission and its officers, in all of the States, as genuinely desirous of doing everything possible to enable them to take up the threads of their normal civil lives. By far the largest number of men has been registered in the New South Wales branch of the commission, where 235 had registered at the end of April, and only 27 were then awaiting employment. In Victoria 169 men had registered, and all had been placed in employment except eighteen. Honorable senators will realize that, for various reasons, it is not easy to place certain individuals in employment. Generally, however, the position is satisfactory. </para>

In addition, he controls advertising for government commercial enterprises, such as the Apple and Pear Board. By consolidating the whole of the advertising work of the departments under the Controller of Government Advertising, we have been able to secure from publishers what are known as master contract rates, which are very much lower than ordinary advertising rates. In this way considerable savings have been effected. </para>

              <para>- That does not enter into it at all. The Government would not be justified in loading all advertising rates because of some other advantage it might get. The decision to place the control of advertising under one authority ensures that the Government pays no more for its advertising than would be paid by private companies which conduct large advertising campaigns. I make this personal explanation to correct any misunderstanding that might arise as the result of the statements made in the House of Representatives last night by the honorable member for Reid. </para>

              <para>- Within the last two days the Prices Commissioner fixed the price of lamb. As the honorable senator knows, lamb prices vary greatly from week to week, largely on account of matters beyond the control of any price-fixing authority. I can assure the honorable senator that the Prices Commissioner has his eye on the whole question of meat prices and will see that no exorbitant charges are made. </para>

            <para>- On the 30th April, approximately 80 tenants in the premises of London Stores Limited received notices to quit. They occupied the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth floors of the building, and they were required to quit by the 30th May. It was stated in the notice received by them that their premises were required by the Commonwealth Taxation Department. The circumstances in which this notice to quit has been given are such that great injustice will be done to the tenants. Many of them are conducting small businesses which they have spent years in building up, and, in the event of their being forced to leave the premises, they will in all probability never be able to rehabilitate themselves. Among the businesses concerned are those of a chiropodist, a hairdresser, a dressmaker, a teacher of music, and an office cleaner. If no other suitable premises were available for the Taxation Department, there would be some justification for the action of the Government, which, I recognize, must have space for the accommodation of its departments; but other premises are available in Melbourne, and I suggest that they are more suitable, and are available at cheaper rentals than the offices proposed to be taken. I understand that the Government proposes to pay &#163;12,000 a year as rent to London Stores Limited and to expend &#163;12,500 in bringing about necessary structural alterations to the premises. Among other premises available are those of Advanx Automotive Industries. The following offer, dated the 13th May, 1941, has been forwarded to the Government :  - 125 William-street, Melbourne, C.l, Vic., Aust. </para>

        <para>One of the most modern buildings in Melbourne, situated at 125 Swanstonstreet, could be leased by the Government. This is Century Building, which is eleven storeys high. It was erected only twelve months ago, is air-conditioned, and has two large passenger lifts, and 42,190 square feet of floor space. Within two days three floors could be made available, providing 12,000 feet of floor space, and from then onwards additional space could be provided, and the whole of the space could be made available by the 15th July next. The rent of these premises would be &#163;14,263 10s. per annum. Ever since its erection, this building has been used for the administrative offices of the Royal Australian Air Force, which has a staff of about 800 persons. In my opinion the building is entirely suitable for the Taxation Department. If it were taken by that department no additional expense need be incurred for alterations. </para>

I submit that the Government should not cause 80 tenants to have to leave their present premises in the building of London Stores Limited, because, in many cases, they would never be able to recover their businesses, even if other suitable premises could be obtained. In my opinion, Century Building is quite suitable for the purposes of the Taxation Department. </para>

            <para>- The letter from which I have quoted is signed by the joint managing director. It appears to me that in this connexion the company cannot be said to be &#34; doing its bit,&#34; but undoubtedly it is taking action to compel about 80 desirable citizens of Melbourne to make a quite unnecessary sacrifice. Many of these people have relatives abroad serving in our forces, and they are certainly doing their bit to help in the national war effort. Their feelings can therefore be well imagined when they found that the Government was taking action of this description. </para>

        <para>The deputation which waited on the Minister was told by him that the matter was one between London Stores Limited and its tenants and not between the Government and the tenants. That, of course, is a pure quibble. If the Government had not taken action to obtain a lease of these premises the tenants would not have been given notice to quit. </para>

            <para>- I shall deal with that point. In effect the Minister said to the deputation, &#34;Ladies and gentlemen, you should have safeguarded yourselves by securing a lease of the premises &#34;. Some of them did; but I ask whether it is reasonable to expect struggling business people, as some of these individuals are, to lease their premises for any lengthy period, when they do not know, from month to month, what their business returns will be? The operations of a number of these people are more or less speculative. The Minister might just as well have told working people in more or less intermittent employment that they should lease the cottages in which they lived. Many workers who do not know how long their jobs will last cannot possibly lease property with any certainty. Most of these tenants are in the same position. </para>

        <para>Several meetings of the tenants have been held and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane,</inline> the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> and I have addressed them at various times. We have advised them to exhaust their. legal rights. I understand that the matter is to be argued in the Practice Court on Tuesday next, but I earnestly appeal to the Government not to lease these premises. It is not necessary for it to do so, for other suitable premises could be obtained at a lower cost and without calling upon the tenants in the London Stores building to make an unnecessary sacrifice. If the Government takes over the building as proposed, a good many of the tenants will undergo severe hardship. I admit that the Minister has said that the Government is prepared to consider sympathetically any claims by these tenants for compensation, but it is impracticable to compensate some of these people to the degree that would be necessary to really meet their needs. Even if compensation is granted in connexion with the removal of machinery, it will not go very far. No compensation will be payable in respect of the &#93;088 of goodwill of a business. Unfortunately, the , business that is <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> lost by these small traders may go to the Myer Emporium Limited or to some other big business concern. I emphasize that it is quite unnecessary to call upon these people to make the big sacrifice that will be involved in the loss of their business premises, and I urge the Government to reconsider the whole proposal on its merits, particularly in view of the fact that accommodation is available in the Century Building. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to emphasize the need for placing a guard at the Collie power-house. I should not have occupied time to discuss this matter at this stage except for the fact that the Senate is to adjourn this afternoon for several weeks. The Collie power-house is of considerable importance in Western Australia. Collie coal is transported all over that State, and if anything happened to the power-house production from the mine would have to cease, for no light would be available for mining operations. The mines would automatically be plunged into darkness. If that condition continued for some days the mines might be filled with water, and it might be impossible to put them into production again for years. That is the case from the point of view of Collie itself. But there is another aspect- of the subject which may be of even greater importance. Collie coal is used in very many parts of Western Australia, including Perth. It is the source from which power is obtained for many manufacturing and public utility operations throughout the State. If this source of supply were stopped operations in many parts of Western Australia would be seriously  impeded. Collie coal keeps in operation not only the power-house of Collie itself but also power-houses elsewhere. Collie coal is necessary for the maintenance of the pumping station to pump water to Kalgoorlie and also for other pumping stations elsewhere. It is hard to imagine anything worse happening in Western Australia than for the supply of Collie coal to be stopped. There was a guard over the power-house from September, 1939, to February, 1940, and we do not know why it was removed. I was at Collie a week or so ago and the people there are extremely concerned about the present position. I therefore urge the Government to take prompt action to meet the situation. </para>

        <para>As to the proposed occupation of the London Stores building in Melbourne by the taxation authorities, I have, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> has said, already received a deputation. I have also had a certain amount of correspondence on the subject. The negotiations were conducted in the first place by the property officer of the Taxation Department with London Stores Limited. When the matter was first brought to my notice and I was asked to attend a meeting of tenants in Melbourne, I knew hardly anything about the transaction. I have since ascertained, however, that on account of the extension of the operations of the Taxation Department due to war exigencies, and the introduction of the pay-roll tax, additional accommodation became essential. A proposal to add a temporary floor on a section of the General Post Office in Elizabethstreet, Melbourne, to meet the requirements was found to be impracticable and had to be abandoned. The department was therefore compelled to look elsewhere for space, and it met with great difficulty in finding any that was suitable. London Stores Limited found itself able to offer the Government the lease of six floors of its building, and arrangements have been made to enter into occupation as from the 1st June. Practically all of the tenancies affected are of a weekly or monthly nature, and, having regard to the limited space each tenant is occupying, no insuperable difficulties should be experienced in the tenants finding other suitable accommodation. A substantial number of the tenants has already moved out of the building or made arrangements to do so. I believe that 50 out of the 70 affected have already vacated their premises. The honorable senator suggested that the Advanx building in Queen-street would be suitable for occupation by the Taxation Department. That building was specially constructed for garage premises. It has been roundly condemned by the Works Department as totally unsuitable for office accommodation for it lacks lifts, lighting and conveniences. The Government is not prepared at present to erect additional offices in Melbourne, but, in any case, the urgency of the need for accommodation to meet immediate taxation requirements is such that it will not permit of delay while a new building can be constructed. All sections of the community must realize that during the war the demands of the Government in various directions call for some re-adjustment and citizens should be prepared at this time to subordinate their convenience to the paramount needs of the Government. I have given an instruction to the property officer of my department in Melbourne to look into any complaints that tenants may have, in order to decide whether some compensation should be paid by the Government in respect of reasonable removal expenses, especially in instances where machinery has to be dismantled and installed elsewhere. </para>
        <para>Immediately after the honorable senator introduced to me the deputation to which I have referred, I submitted the matter to the War Cabinet, which happened to be sitting that day, and it was agreed that favorable consideration and reasonable compensation should be given in hardship cases, particularly where machinery had to be removed. The honorable senator made some reference to rental charges. I have obtained some information respecting the amounts that are to be paid. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> stated that an amount of &#163;12,000 would be necessary to meet the cost of structural alterations. I am advised - and I accept the advice of my officers - that the total amount that will need to be expended by the Commonwealth Government to make these six floors suitable for occupation by the Taxation Department will be &#163;6,500. It is not possible to compare, in any exact way, the rent that has been paid by the tenants in this building with that which will be paid by the Commonwealth, for the Commonwealth is taking over an extra floor. London Stores Limited has vacated its own workshop on the top floor in order to make the space available to the Government. I am also advised that the statement that the Commonwealth Government will be paying a higher rent than that paid by the tenants is also incorrect. The rental paid by the tenants for an area of 38,085 square feet is at the rate of 4s. 7&#188;d. a square foot without cleaning. If cleaning be included the rental would be increased to 5s. 7&#188;d. a square foot. A charge of ls. a square foot is generally recognized in Melbourne for office cleaning. The rental to be paid by the Commonwealth for an area of 45,010 square feet is at the rate of 5s. 5id. a square foot, which includes passages which are being taken over as office space and also cleaning costs. The Government therefore will be paying l&#163;d. a square foot less than the tenants were paying. </para>

            <para>- This is because the Government is taking over an extra floor. Until the honorable senator mentioned the matter this afternoon, I had no idea that Century Building was available. Before the deputation of tenants waited on me, I had raised the question as to the availability of the building for use by the Taxation Department, because I knew that the Air Force authorities were leaving that building in order to occupy their own premises at Victoria Barracks. 1 shall make some further inquiries regarding Century Building and should I find that I have been wrongly informed there will be trouble. I discussed with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jackson,</inline> the Commissioner of Taxation, the possibility of using that building, and he said that it was not entirely suitable for the needs of his depart ment. I was told definitely that it had been allocated for use in connexion with munitions. </para>

            <para>- I cannot say offhand, because this matter is already well advanced. To-day, I have taken two steps in regard to it; I have ordered fresh inquiries to be made in order to ascertain whether Century Building is available, and I have asked the  chairman  of the Valuation Board in Melbourne to supply me with an independent valuation and a report on the price that London Stores Limited propose to charge the Government for their building. The valuation already received was made by the Taxation Department&#39;s valuer and by my department&#39;s property officer in Melbourne. The valuation for which I have asked will be a further check. I hope to have information on the subject later this afternoon, but at this stage I cannot say whether or not there will be any alteration of the arrangements. The transaction has practically been completed, and the Taxation Department desires to become established in suitable quarters as quickly as possible. Like the honorable senator, I deplore the necessity for disturbing the tenants of the London Stores Building. Some of them are particularly unfortunate in that they have installed expensive machinery without taking steps to protect themselves by means of leases. Others, who took the precaution to obtain leases, will have to be given adequate compensation for the termination of those leases. </para>

          <para>. - This afternoon I asked a question in relation to child endowment, and if the reply of the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Leckie)</inline> was right, then the department administering the scheme is wrong. I asked whether it was not a mathematical impossibility for child endowment to be paid on account of children up to the age of sixteen, except in respect of twins, triplets, quadruplets or quintuplets. I have in mind  a  family in which there are three children aged 15, 10 and 5 years respectively. When the first child reaches the age of  sixteen, the second child will be eleven years of age. It then becomes the first child, and no further payment will be made in respect of it. That is to say, no endowment will be paid in respect of that child after it reaches the age of eleven years. If my reasoning be correct, child endowment will not be paid on account of any child up to the age of sixteen years except, as I have said, in the case of multiple births. After the Assistant Minister had replied to my question this afternoon, I rang the department and was informed that my interpretation of the scheme was correct. Many members of Parliament areof the same opinion as is the Assistant Minister. </para>
