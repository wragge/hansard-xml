The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jackson</inline> was elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Bass in 1919, and again in 1922, 1925 and 1928. He was  a  member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Works from May, 1921, to October, 1925, and from February to 'September in 1929. He was also  a  member of the Sectional Committee of the Public Works Committee on Northern Territory matters in 1922. In 1928 he visited Canada as a member of the Commonwealth delegation of the Empire Parliamentary Association. I extend to his widow our deepest sympathy, and I move - </para>

The Opposition supports the motion, and desires its condolences to be forwarded to the widow of the deceased. </para>

                    <para>- I also support the motion. I knew the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J</inline> Jackson  for many years before he became a member of this Parliament. I knew him to be a great Australian, who took a leading part in many phases of public life. He was a keen protectionist, and in that capacity he served Australia well. During the time he was a member of the Parliamentary Public Works Committee he did a great deal of publicity work for Australia. He displayed lantern slides throughout Tasmania, and .thus made the mainland of Australia better known to the people of his native State. The whole of. the proceeds of these lectures were devoted to the Bush Nursing Association. His work in the interests of charitable organizations in Tasmania was well known. Apart from his practical interest in the Bush Nursing Association, he was actively associated with the Musical Competitions Association, and his work in the interests of music generally was greatly appreciated throughout the State. Above all, he was a good employer. He brought no political pressure to bear upon his own employees, but paid them better than award rates. In my opinion, he was one of the best employers and one of the best citizens Launceston has produced. He was a very courageous gentleman, and his loss will be keenly felt in Tasmania as well as throughout Australia. </para>

When he visited the Northern Territory it was my pleasure to be in his company, and I am able to testify that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> has said is perfectly true. The deceased gentleman was a big Australian in every sense of the word. He was instrumental in having the work being done in Central and Northern Australia by the Australian Inland Mission recognized by the government of the day. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jackson</inline> died at an early age.

                    was well.known to most of us, and particularly to members of the House of Representatives, where for many years he most ably represented the Division of Bass. He was also an excellent representative of his native State as a whole. In addition to his work as a member his services were greatly appreciated by the people in his electorate, and in the city of Launceston, of which he was an excellent citizen. He was associated with most movements in that city which had for their object the welfare of the people, and, as has already been stated, he was an admirable employer. He was an enterprising business man, and the city of Launceston is the poorer for his passing.

          <para> Has the Minister for the Interior recently received a formal request from Western Australia with regard to the widening of the gauge of the railway from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle? Will the Minister prepare a statement showing the position as regards such an application, and if possible indicate the intentions of the Commonwealth Government?

                        <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for the Army whether it is not a fact that the Government is finding great difficulty in expending money already appropriated for defence purposes? Is it not also a fact that many soldiers, instead of being trained for the defence of this country, are engaged on work that could be done by navvies? If the Government is finding difficulty in expending money, will it see that some of it is expended in the employment of men who are now workless? </para>

                        <para>- A general survey is being made by a committee representative of the various parties in Parliament in order to ascertain how more of the labour available in Australia can be utilized for war work. I have no knowledge of soldiers, either in the Militia or in the Australian Imperial Force, doing work which, as the honorable senator suggests, might be done by navvies, but the training of soldiers often entails work of various kinds which forms a portion of their training. The lag in expenditure has resulted from various causes. Unfortunately, there has been delay in production, owing in some cases to industrial difficulties, but that is not responsible for the lag. In addition, there has been a considerable scarcity of skilled men, not only for munitions work, but also in connexion with our construction programme. Difficulty has also been experienced in obtaining supplies of certain materials owing to the shipping problem. The result has been that expenditure on defence works has not been maintained at the rate anticipated. I can assure the honorable senator that the Government regards it essential that money should be expended wisely instead of expending it merely for the sake of doing so. However, the lag to which the honorable senator has referred is being overtaken rapidly, and many of the minor difficulties responsible for a delay in production are being overcome. </para>

                        <para>. -  In directing the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> to the position of the fat lamb industry in Australia, I should like to learn whether the Government has taken any action to safeguard the industry. The matter is serious because shipping space for export is greatly restricted, and further it is intended, I understand, to reduce the export of fat lambs by about 20 per cent.- The industry has been established for many years and action by the Government is urgently needed to prevent the industry from getting into a chaotic condition. If shipping space is to be further restricted, the Government should ensure that each State and each exporting firm is allotted a fair quota of the space made available. Pools have been established in the interests of the wheat-growers and the growers of apples and pears, and I suggest that the Government should take similar action to protect the small producers, as the large producers of fat  lambs  could, because of their larger holdings, go back to wool production. This could  not  be done by the small holders. If Government action is not taken,  the  small producers will not be able to dispose of their fat lambs, which represent their means of livelihood, and probably the chaotic condition into which the industry will drift will encourage speculation. The present serious situation of  the fat lamb  industry is  not  peculiar to Western Australia. The situation is serious in other States, and I am sure that the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride)</inline> realizes the need for the Government to assist the producers in South Australia. The port of Albany in Western Australia has practically been carried on by holders of small areas who have embarked on the raising of fat lambs for export, but they are unable to convert to wool-growing because of the small acreage  of  their holdings. Most of the small land holders in  Western  Australia  who  have adapted themselves to the export trade will soon find themselves in a precarious situation unless prompt action is taken by the Government. </para>

                        <para>. -  There will be serious consequences in Western Australia if action is not taken by the Government to improve the present condition of the fat lamb industry caused by the shortage of shipping. Western Australia is not as far advanced in the export of fat stock as are the other States, and consequently the exporters in that State are not sufficiently strong financially to withstand the strain which no doubt is being placed upon them, and which will become heavier in the next few months because I consider that the shipping situation will become worse before it improves. The financial resources of the smaller concerns in Western Australia, which have been killing and storing carcass meat for export, must be near breaking point. T suggest that the Government should consider the advisableness of providing these concerns with financial accommodation at a low rate of interest so as to enable them to hold carcass meat until a larger volume of shipping is made available. The holding of carcass meat in Western Australia is becoming increasingly difficult. The refrigeration space available for storage is limited, and, unless the shipping situation is relieved appreciably, much more refrigeration space will have to be provided. Western Australia is now producing a large quantity of export pork which I do not think will see a ship's hold for many months. The people who are putting their energy into this industry should receive some financial consideration, apart from the provision of increased refrigerated space. A large number of workmen are dependent upon this industry for a livelihood. I hope that the Minister will pay heed to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> and see that further assistance is given to the meat export industry in Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- In my opinion, the growers of muttion will have to take this matter into their own hands to some extent. The Government may be able to store a quantity of mutton and lamb, but, after a certain period, the meat deteriorates. The only remedy is for the growers to produce fewer fat lambs and to pay more attention to the production of wool. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, many of the big pastoralists are turning th&lt; ir attention to the production of fat lambs, whereas previously they grew sheep for wool. If the large pastoralists enter the meat industry, as they are largely doing in Victoria, they will destroy the fat-lamb trade, and with it cause the ruin of the small grower. It seems to me that Western Australia will have to do as the Victorian Government has done, and assist the fat-lamb growers. </para>

                        <para>. - When the Government finds difficulty in exporting fat lambs, mutton, beef, pork, or any other necessary commodity, I suggest that it should take into serious consideration the necessity for increasing the purchasing power of the consumers in Australia. Many thousands of unemployed men and women could, if their purchasing power were increased, buy more of those commodities, and would be glad to do so. Awards of the Arbitration Court, however, indicate a  reduc-tion  of purchasing power, and, owing to the operations of the Prices Commissioner, the workers generally find themselves unable to purchase as many of those commodities as they could before the declaration of war. In addition to meat which cannot be exported, and is likely to deteriorate in cold storage, we find that thousands of bushels of apples and pears are being destroyed because of the lack of purchasing power on the part of the consumers. I submit that we cannot successfully increase production unless the necessary provision is made for increased consumption, particularly when we find ourselves unable to export to overseas countries. The question to be decided, finally, is whether surplus meat and fruit shall be destroyed, whether production shall be restricted or whether the purchasing power of consumers shall be increased. These are matters which the Government should take into consideration. </para>

                        <para>. - I draw the attention of the Government to the necessity for an equitable distribution of defence work throughout Australia. Although boards of management have been appointed in the various States to control the work already in progress, the less populous States are not receiving as many contracts as they could undertake. For many months I have been considering this matter, and I suggest that a committee consisting of one representative from each of the States, who knows what his State can do, should he established in either Sydney or Melbourne, in order to ensure that the States mentioned will be provided with defence work within their capacity. By this means, a satisfactory distribution of munitions and other contracts could be affected, and this would help to placate dissatisfied States. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - On behalf of the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> I assure Senators Fraser, Gibson and Cameron, that the subject of the shipment of frozen meat overseas is receiving the close attention of the Government. Of course, owing to the lack of shipping facilities, it is not possible to export meat on the same scale as previously, and, consequently, steps have been taken, in collaboration with the State authorities, to extend the cold-storage accommodation in each of the States. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has pointed out, there is a limit to the period for which meat can be stored satisfactorily. It would be unwise for us to drift into the position that obtained after the last war, when, on account of the large quantity of meat held in storage for a considerable period, we were forced to sell meat of inferior quality overseas. It has been represented to me that that inferior meat had a most detrimental effect on the Australian meat trade for many years, and every effort should be made to avoid a repetition of the mistake that occurred after the last war. It is inevitable, as has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson,</inline> that there must be a transference from fat lamb raising to wool production. The whole of our output of wool has been sold for the duration of the war and one year afterwards, and producers would be well advised to avoid the production of a commodity for which it will be difficult to find purchasers in the immediate future. </para>

It is not so easy as honorable senators may imagine to effect such an arrangement, because at present the bulk of the lambs are not exported on behalf of growers, but are bought at auction in the open market by meat exporters. Consequently it is not known at present what proportion of any yarding of lambs, or what proportion of a particular consignee's yarding, is exported or used in the local trade. </para>
