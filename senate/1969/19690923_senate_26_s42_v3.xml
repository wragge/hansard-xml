            <para>- I direct a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to reports of a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of allied governments fighting in Vietnam, and especially to the statement attributed to the Foreign Minister of South Vietnam that there was no question at this point of any troop withdrawals by allied governments other than the United States Government. I ask the Minister: Are we to take it that the Australian Government has not even raised the question of Australian troops being brought home from Vietnam and that the conscription of Australians for service there is to continue indefinitely? </para>

            <para>- If I answer only the part of the question that is within my responsibility there is very little I can say because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> drew his own conclusions and then based a question on his conclusions rather than on the reports. For that reason I am not competent to answer, nor do I intend to give an answer on what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> thinks or wants to think. But it is true that there has been a meeting in New York of troop contributing countries. It was one of a series of regular consultations amongst the allies at which developments in Vietnam are reviewed. To the extent that the honourable senator&#39;s question is based upon reports of that meeting, I can say it is true that there has been a meeting. There has been no change in the position of the Australian Government regarding Australian forces in Vietnam. As the Prime Minister stated in another place on 19th September, Australia will continue to be involved in close consultation with the Republic of Vietnam and other troop contributing countries on all aspects of the situation in Vietnam, including the level of assistance to the Republic. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, ls it a fact that each year more than 1,000 tons of whale meat is imported through the port of Melbourne, without any health inspection, by American pet food manufacturers? ls it also a fact that this uncertified meat is stored in the Victorian State Government&#39;s cool stores and that there is no identification on the cartons stating clearly that the meat is unfit for human consumption? Is there any Government audit of this imported meat to guarantee that it reaches its stated destination of Wodonga without being diverted to smallgoods manufacture or to the retail meat trade? ls it also a fact that for the past 3 years these American companies have been allowed to import this whale meat, described as inedible and unfit for human consumption, and have avoided paying the necessary customs duty on imported foodstuffs? Should not this question be treated with the greatest urgency in view of the dangers inherent, as a result of this situation, to the public health and to our disease free primary industry? </para>

He asked a series of questions concerning imported whale meat and then went on to ask whether the conditions under which it is imported are a disturbing factor from the point of view of health and the possible infection of our livestock. I cannot give the honourable senator an answer to the particular points that he raised, but I shall mention them to the Minister for Health and obtain an answer for him when I can. </para>

            <para>- Following the proclamation of the boundaries of the new divisions and subdivisions notifications were issued in the Commonwealth Gazette and in newspapers setting out the subdivisions and divisions for which the electors were enrolled previously and the subdivisions and divisions for which they are enrolled now. Also, in specific cases, action was taken by divisional returning officers to notify electors individually of the changes. The Chief Electoral Officer has prepared a special instruction which will be issued to polling officials to make them aware of changes in boundaries that have occurred since the last election. Assistance will be give to electors where required in recording votes for the correct divisions. In fact, presiding officers will be required to check the official lists of streets, roads and so on, or the alphabetical list of polling places wherever that is necessary. Publicity about the changes in the boundaries will also be given through the news media before polling day. </para>

            <para>- My question, which I direct to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, refers to current Press reports that the Prime Minister and the Victorian Minister for Transport have been conferring about finance to build a new underground railway in Victoria, and also to current reports that it is possible that $40m will be granted to Victoria and New South Wales for railway works. I ask: Is there any substance in the reports? If so, how is it that South Australian claims for finance to connect Adelaide with the standardised system have still been refused, a survey has been let to a group of consultants whose reports will not be available until January 1970 and there is no guarantee at this stage that South Australia will get a Commonwealth grant? Does the Prime Minister intend to give the same consideration to South Australia&#39;s claims as he has apparently given to those of Victoria and New South Wales? </para>

As allegations made by honourable senators on Thursday last were regarded as justification for withholding naturalisation in the case of a migrant who is a member of the Communist Party because his loyalty to international Communism would conflict with an oath of allegiance to  Her  Majesty the Queen, would not the same principle apply in relation to the oath of allegiance when a person is called up for military service? Therefore, can Communists be accepted for military service? </para>

              <para>- I am very conscious of the importance of such tests as the honourable senator has mentioned, especially in relation to young children. 1 have some information concerning this matter which I think will be helpful to him. Appointments currently are being made from 22nd October onwards for children&#39;s hearing aids at the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories, Sydney. However, where an appointment is requested for a very young child or where, from the information available, a child appears to require a hearing aid, a hearing test will be arranged before that date. Unexpected arrivals from country areas are dealt with immediately. </para>

          <para>Good facilities are available for testing children. A wailing time of a month, with provision for prompt attention for urgent cases, is considered satisfactory. However, because of the specialised nature of the work with children, it has been difficult in the past to ensure the availability of adequate trained staff and long delays have occurred. The honourable senator will be interested to learn that this week three psychologists will be concluding a course to fit them for work with school children. Their training is expected to enable them to carry out the more exacting work that is required for infants and pre-school children. With the increasing availability of trained staff the present satisfactory position will be maintained if not improved. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Acknowledging that the most important criteria for appointments to the High Court of Australia are legal erudition and skill as well as judicial suitability, and further acknowledging that the most recent appointment to that high office,  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Walsh from the Supreme Court of New South Wales, is accepted as meeting those criteria most adequately, does the Minister experience concern that since 1946, with one exception, those qualities have been discovered only in practititioners in the State of New South Wales, not discounting the possibility that appointments may have been offered to gentlemen who have refused them? Is this any indication, which would be disturbing, that the law schools of the other States or the nature of the legal practices conducted there no longer generally equip practitioners for the highest judicial appointment in the land? Will the Minister take any steps necessary to ensure that a situation is developed where, consonant with the application of the principal criteria I have mentioned, the High Court will reflect in its personnel, at least substantially, the component States of the Federation of which the Court is, under the Constitution, its highest judicial tribunal and interpreter? </para>

The Minister will recollect that during the debate on the estimates for the Parliament I asked him to provide the Senate with information as to the terms and conditions of, and wage rates and allowances paid to attendants in Parliament House and persons employed by the Joint House Department. I have now received a letter from the Secretary of the Joint House Department in relation to that Department in the following terms: </para>

            <para>- I recall quite well the question being asked and I recall my answer, which I gave in good faith. The communication the honourable senator has read rather suggests that information has been made available to the Presiding Officer, under whose jurisdiction the matter rests. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> is implying that because Of this I, as Leader of the Government and representative of the Prime Minister in the Senate, have circumvented his question. I think I should take the matter up with the Presiding Officer to see on what basis the information should be made available to the honourable senator and the Senate. I shall certainly do that later in the day. </para>

Has the attention of the Attorney-General been drawn to the newspaper report that informations have been issued in the Central Court in Sydney against a number of people alleging breaches of the Crimes Act in encouraging young people not to register for national service, and that such informations have been laid by the Secretary of the Committee in Defiance of the National Service Act, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Simon</inline> Townsend? Is the material on which the informations are based the same material as that which the Attorney-General has earlier said has been carefully drawn so that any prosecution launched on it would undoubtedly fail? In these circumstances, is the preparation of the material and these informations a contrived arrangement of a pre-election character to make a farce of the law? May private informations be prosecuted under the Crimes Act? Is the Government proposing to take any action in respect of the informations? </para>

It seeks assistance from the Commonwealth to build those dams. I understand that the Queensland Government made representations in respect of the Monduran dam as its first priority and the Burnett-Kolan irrigation scheme as its second priority. The others, including the Burdekin Dam, followed after that. As the honourable senator is asking questions now in respect of other projects I ask him to place that part of his question on notice so that I may obtain an answer for him. </para>

            <para>-  I preface my question to the Minister representing (he Minister for the Army by drawing his attention to the figures for national servicemen serving outside Australia as set out on page 1101 of Hansard of 18th September this year. The Minister will recall that a promise was made to obtain the information. Will he now inform the Parliament of the designation of the units to which ninety-one national servicemen in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea are attached? Can he advise also in which countries 275 other national servicemen are serving and what are their duties in those countries? </para>

Is it a fact that members of the Commonwealth Police were present at the Williamstown courthouse during a demonstration last Friday? If so, is the attack of the Australian Labor Party Executive in Victoria on the police who endeavoured to maintain law and order, and the accusation that they acted brutally and provocatively, in accord with the facts known to the Attorney-General? If not, will the Attorney-General issue a categorical denial of the Labor Party&#39;s attack? </para>

            <para>- I have no definite information, but I understand that members of the Commonwealth Police Force were present at the court. I think it is most regrettable that any political party should accuse members of the police force of making deliberate and provocative attacks in the carrying out of their duties. I think it would be generally accorded that on this occasion the police acted with great credit. </para>

The interpretation which any honourable senator may wish to place upon a speech or an answer to a question given by any Minister is a matter for himself.

            <para>This hospital has two broad divisions. The first is the mental hospital division that provides custodial care for patients suffering from long-term or severe mental illness. Under the Social Services Act pensions are not payable to patients in a mental hospital. Provision is, however, made for payment of pension to dependants of a married mental hospital patient. The remaining division, referred to as the Rehabilitation and Training Division, provides short-term treatment (of a kind often given in psychiatric wards of a public hospital) and rehabilitation and training, under open ward conditions, directed towards early discharge of patients back to the community. Patients in the Rehabilitation and Training Division may receive all social service benefits subject to the usual conditions of eligibility. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>The Australian National Line has indicated to me that costs have risen substantially in all general cargo trades and that, as a result, it seeks to increase its freight charges. In its case for an increase in freight charges the Line points out that although costs have continually increased in all trades, no increase in general cargo freight rates has been made since 1965. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The Darwin trade has operated at a loss and the loss increased in 1968-69. This is not the sole cause of the decline in the Line&#39;s profitability. In other general cargo trades, profits have declined considerably, with losses being incurred in several trades as well as that to Darwin. </para>
          <para>At the present time, the Line&#39;s case is being examined and further information sought. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Whilst in previous years the Australian National Line has been able to make reasonable profits despite losses incurred in the Darwin trade, the present situation is different in that cost increases have adversely affected the profitability of all general cargo trades. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The losses in the Darwin trade during the past 2 fiscal years have been aggravated also by the slow turn round in the port of Darwin. It is expected that the introduction of a specialised ship for this trade in mid 1970 should improve the turn round and help to reduce losses in the trade. </para>

              <para>Profits derived by the Australian National Line from the Tasmanian Trade cannot be described as lucrative. They account for much less than one half of the Line&#39;s total profit in 1968-69 and with some vessels incurring a substantial loss. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>Under the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act the Australian National Line is charged with earning a reasonable profit on its capital, whilst making its shipping services available at the lowest possible rates of charges. There is no suggestion that Australian National Line freight rates to and from Tasmania will be raised merely to offset losses elsewhere and maintain the Line&#39;s overall profit margin. </para>

              <para>Losses incurred by the Australian National Line in operating a shipping service to Darwin have been referred to by the  Chairman  in Annual Reports of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission.

              <para>It has been reported that on occasions, cabin staff do not become seated and fasten their seat belts until after the aircraft has commenced final approach. This mainly occurs where the passenger refreshment service has been delayed or interrupted by some flight condition such as turbulence, with the result that the planned time for stowage of the passenger service equipment and checking of the passengers seat belts by the cabin staff is reduced. </para>

              <para>Depending upon the duration of particular flights drinks and meals can be provided without affecting safety in any way and 1 can see no justification for eliminating these services from the flights on which they are currently provided. However, in some cases when faster aircraft are introduced the duration of flight time will be shortened to an extent which makes necessary a reduction in the standard of cabin service. For example the introduction of DC.9 aircraft to the Sydney/Canberra/Sydney route has led to a revision of the meal and refreshment services available. </para>

              <para>The report describes the results of only one poisoning campaign. The results suggest that control of the dingoes in the area could be achieved if changes were made in the techniques used. A move for discussions such as those suggested is considered to be premature at this stage. More information is needed, not only on the effectiveness of aerial poisoning in controlling dingoes, but also on related questions such as the actual pest status of the dingo, the effects of poisoning campaigns on other native fauna, and the possibility of developing alternative methods of control should these be shown to be warranted. CSIRO&#39;s dingo research is long-term, and is designed to yield basic biological information which is necessary to an informed consideration of the problem. </para>

Further, considerable efforts are being made in co-operative work between the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry, the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and the University of Western Australia, to test new varieties of subterranean clover which have been selected for the wheatbelt and do not cause clover disease&#39;.

            <para>- On 28th August <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> asked me a question in the following terms: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for External Territories, relates to educational facilities for handicapped children in the Trust Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Has the Commonwealth or the Territory Administration ever made a survey of the incidence of deafness and blindness or the number of dumb children in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea? What facilities exist in the Territory to assist in the alleviation of afflictions in children or to afford educational benefits to such children? If it be that no survey has been undertaken or that no real facilities exist for the education of these less fortunate persons, will the Commonwealth demonstrate a recognition of its obligation in this matter by promptly considering the best method of having a survey undertaken and by further encouraging, by financial assistance, the establishment of privately organised schools and facilities so that people experienced in specialised training may be used in the Territory? </para>
          <para>The Minister for External Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <para>There have been no Territory-wide surveys of the incidence of deafness, blindness or dumbness though there have been specific surveys of such defects as glaucoma. </para>
          <para>At this stage a number of considerations militate against the establishment of special schools for children with these handicaps. Firstly, the advisability of taking these children out of the village environment for education is questionable. Handicapped children are generally well-accepted in the village and have few adjustment problems if they grow up there. The separation of these children to attend special schools would bring the possibility of poor social adjustment In return for the uncertain benefits they might derive from a formal education. Few handicapped children can attain an education much above the primary level, and this would not be sufficient to assure them of employment outside the village. </para>
          <para>Secondly, there are serious practical difficulties in the way of providing special education. It would be necessary to obtain not only specially qualified teachers of the handicapped but teachers who are competent in the Territory languages, of which there are some 700. </para>
          <para>Thirdly, as there are still only 50% of primary school-age children being educated it is considered doubtful that the diversion of scarce resources to the education of a small sector of the community who suffer special handicaps would be justified. </para>
          <para>It is not therefore considered that at the present time efforts should be made to promote the establishment of special schools, nor for this reason would a survey of the incidence of these handicaps be warranted. The situation will, however, change as detribalisation and urbanisation increase. </para>

          <para class="block">The One Hundred and Eleventh Report concerns the Treasury Minute arising from your Committee&#39;s One Hundred and Third Report which relates to Financial Regulations. Your Committee would invite attention to its observations contained in chapter  3  of the One Hundred and Eleventh Report in which it has expressed the view that ministerial approval should be obtained by instructing departments for all proposed amendments to regulations involving a change of policy, irrespective of the significance of that change, before drafting instructions are submitted to the Parliamentary Draftsman. The One Hundred and Twelfth Report relates to Commonwealth advertising and, in particular to the Commonwealth Advertising Division of the Department of the Treasury. </para>
          <para>Arising from that inquiry your Committee believes that the Department of the Treasury should examine carefully a claim made in evidence that there is no danger of large-scale advertising agencies represented on the Commonwealth Advertising Council gaining the bulk of Commonwealth advertising business. The evidence shows that the arrangements existing between the Commonwealth Advertising Division and advertising media for the placing of Commonwealth advertising contracts or orders exceeding $1,000 in value are invalid in terms of the requirements of Treasury Regulation 52. However before developing proposals to amend that regulation so as to validate the present arrangements, your Committee believes that tenders should be invited for advertising contracts exceeding the value referred to and the results assessed carefully. In this regard, your Committee believes that competitive tendering should ensure that certain benefits currently enjoyed by agencies from Commonwealth advertising contracts are obtained only by those agencies that are demonstrably the most efficient. </para>
          <para>The evidence also shows that all departments should maintain specific records of their expenditure incurred on advertising placed through the Commonwealth Advertising Division. In addition it appears that, contrary to the requirements of Treasury Direction 31/41, some departments have placed advertising material direct with media but have failed to notify the Commonwealth Advertising Division. This practice should cease. It also appears to your Committee that, having regard to the requirements of Treasury Regulation 52 and a recent relevant legal opinion, the basis of engagement of advertising agencies in Australia by the Department of Trade and Industry should be reviewed. Moreover, proposals put forward by the </para>
          <para class="block">Postmaster-General&#39;s Department to remove a lack of continuity in its relationships with advertising agencies should be considered by the Department of the Treasury in relation to the needs of all departments and also in relation to your Committee&#39;s conclusions regarding the basis of engagement of such agents. Finally, your Committee believes that in view of the affinity of function and probable similarity in staffing skills existing between the Commonwealth Advertising Division and the Australian News and Information Bureau, the Public Service Board could, with advantage, examine carefully the desirability of amalgamating these two organisations and assess the economies of administration that might be achieved. I commend the Reports to honourable senators. </para>

Although the Committee has worked towards this goal, and members have devoted as much time as possible in an endeavour to complete the very formidable task committed to them, the Committee is unable to conclude its inquiry and report to the Senate this session. </para>
      <para>The Committee&#39;s investigation is nearing its completion and it has in fact given preliminary consideration to several draft sections of its report. However, the impending general elections resulting in the earlier than anticipated close of this session, and the extended days and hours of sittings of the Senate preclude the Committee finalising many matters and reporting in adequate terms to the Senate at this stage. The Committee hopes that, early in the life of the new Parliament - Twenty-seventh Parliament - the Senate will see fit to reconstitute the Select Committee on OffShore Petroleum Resources with power to consider and make use of all the records of the present Committee so that its work may be completed and a report submitted at an early date; and the Committee recommends accordingly. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill will declare the general rates of tax for the financial year 1969-70. Special rates of tax to apply to certain income of superannuation funds, trust estates and members of partnerships will be declared by a separate Bill. The rates of tax declared by this Bill do not differ from those which applied for the previous financial year. As foreshadowed in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon),</inline> however, the Bill does provide for liberalisation of the age allowance provisions in several ways. As honourable senators will recall, the age allowance is available to men and women of at least 65 years and 60 years respectively, who are residents of Australia. </para>
          <para>For the 1968-69 financial year an aged person was not required to pay income tax if his own taxable income did not exceed $1,248 or, where he contributed to the maintenance of his spouse, if the combined taxable income of the couple did not exceed $2,184. These exemption levels are to be lifted, for the current financial year, to $1,300 and $2,262 respectively. It is also proposed to extend the ranges of taxable income within which the age allowance provisions limit the amounts of tax payable by aged persons, and to reduce the amounts of tax payable under these limiting provisions. In 1968-69 these provisions imposed limits on the tax payable by aged persons whose taxable incomes did not exceed $1,532 or, where the married couple concession applied, if the combined taxable income of the couple did not exceed $3,514. For 1969-70 these limiting provisions will apply up to $2,275 and $4,121 respectively. </para>
          <para>Apart from extending the income ranges to which the tax limiting provisions apply, it is proposed to substitute graduated shading-in rates for the flat shading-in rate used until now for the purposes of these provisions. The amount of tax payable by an aged person to whom the tax limiting provisions apply is at present limited to nine-twentieths, or 45%, of the amount by which his taxable income - or combined taxable income in the case of married couples - exceeds the relevant exemption point, plus the 21% additional tax. For 1969-70, shading-in rates ranging from 16i% to 66!% will be applied to specified parts of the excess of taxable income - or combined taxable income - over the exemption point in order to arrive at the maximum amounts payable. The <inline font-style="italic">2i%</inline> additional tax will not bc added to the limited amount of tax calculated at the shading-in rates I have referred to. </para>
          <para>The new shading-in rates are designed to fit in with the tapered means test for age pension purposes, under which the age pension will be reduced by 50c for each $1 by which means as assessed exceed the free level. Under the new pension arrangements no pension is payable when means as assessed reach $2,080 per annum or, in the case of a married couple, when joint means as assessed reach $3,640 per annum. The new 66}% shading-in rate that will apply to the top shading-in ranges, that is, when taxable income exceeds $2,080 or combined taxable income exceeds $3,640, is greater than the existing flat rate of 45%. However, the increased exemption levels together with the new shading-in rates of less than 45% to apply to the lower shading-in ranges will ensure that, in every case, the tax payable will be lower under the proposed graduated rates than under the existing flat rate. </para>
          <para>It is important to appreciate that these shading-in rates are used only to calculate a limitation on the tax at normal rates that would otherwise be payable. The proposed shading-in rates will be applied only to specified parts of income above the exemption levels and not, as the normal rates of tax are, to the whole of the taxable income. The amount calculated under the shading-in rates is substituted for tax at normal rates only when it is less than the tax at normal rates. The liberalisation of the age allowance will result in worthwhile increases in the disposable incomes of aged persons. For example, the tax payable by a single aged person in receipt of income consisting of a superannuation pension of $1,500 per annum, and having concessional taxation deductions of $150, will be reduced from S47.04 to $8.33- a benefit of $38.71. That is only part of the assistance the Government proposes for elderly people, however. Under the tapered means test for pension purposes, the aged person I have mentioned will become entitled to an age pension of $290.  His  disposable income will therefore be increased by a total of $328.71. Honourable senators will find further explanations of the proposed age allowance provisions in a memorandum being circulated for their information and I do not think it is necessary to say anything more at this stage. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to declare special rates of income tax for the financial year 1969-70 on income of certain superannuation funds, trust estates and members of partnerships. These rates are related to legislation enacted in 1964 with the object of countering certain types of tax avoidance arrangements. They do not differ from the rates that applied for the 1963-69 financial year. The Bill declares that tax at the rate of 50% will be payable in respect of the income of a trust estate, other than a deceased estate, to which no beneficiary is presently entitled and which is not taxed as if it were the income of one individual. </para>
          <para>The taxable income of a superannuation fund that does not qualify for exemption will also be subject to a rate of 50%. This rale will not. however, apply to the investment income of a superannuation fund that is subject to tax only through the fund&#39;s failure to comply with the &#39;30-20&#39; public securities investment rule. The rates on such income are proposed by the Income Tax Bill 1969. A rate of further tax, sufficient to bring the aggregate rate to <inline font-style="italic">50%,</inline> will be imposed on income from a share in a partnership over which a person lacks, or is deemed to lack, real and effective control and disposal. An exemption from further tax on partnership income is provided, as in previous years, for people who are eligible for age allowance benefits. For the current financial year, further tax will not be payable by a person qualified by age and residence whose taxable income does not exceed $2,275 or by a qualified person who contributes to the maintenance of a spouse if the combined taxable income of the couple does not exceed $4,121. These changes are, of course, in line with proposals relating to the age allowance in the Income Tax Bill 1969. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to borrowings by the Commonwealth not exceeding the equivalent of $US31m ($A27.7m) to asssit in financing the purchase of one Boeing 727 jet aircraft and six Douglas DC9 jet aircraft and related equipment by the Australian National Airlines These aircraft, the total cost of which will be approximately $US38.4m ($A34.3m), are due for delivery between March 1970 and March 1972. After they have all been delivered, TAA&#39;s fleet of jet aircraft will consist of 6 Boeing 727&#39;s and 1 2 Douglas DC9&#39;s. </para>
          <para>On previous occasions when we have introduced legislation for borrowings to assist in the purchase of new aircraft by Qantas Airways Ltd and TAA, the loan agreements have already been signed but have usually been conditional on suitable legislation authority becoming available later. This is normally possible in a private borrowing in which securities are not offered to members of the public through the issue of a prospectus. On this occasion we have not yet been able to settle any firm borrowing arrangements although it appears that some favourable opportunities may arise in the course of the next few months. In the difficult borrowing conditions generally prevailing at present in oversea markets, we must be in a position to take advantage of any such opportunities without delay. </para>
          <para>At this stage it appears that it may be possible to arrange for up to one-half of the amount to be borrowed by a European unit of account loan, which would seek subscriptions from members of the public in seventeen European currencies. If such a public borrowing eventuated, it would be necessary to demonstrate in a prospectus the full legal chain of authority upon which the Commonwealth was borrowing the funds. It would also be necessary to establish that the Commonwealth could legally pass on the loan proceeds to TAA. Other possible avenues of finance being explored include assistance from the Export-Import Bank of the United States in conjunction with the aircraft manufacturers. The Bill has been drafted to provide for these possibilities. </para>
          <para>I should perhaps mention that the borrowing authority we are seeking would be no different in principle from the standing authority which is already available under the financial agreement and associated legislation to arrange public loans for the Commonwealth. Similar arrangements also apply under the Loan (Defence) Act 1966 for a series of borrowings for defence purposes. The other arrangements for the loans will be similar to those approved by Parliament for previous loans for TAA and Qantas in recent years. The Commonwealth will be the borrower in the first place, and the full proceeds will be made available to TAA on terms and conditions to be determined by the Treasurer pursuant to clause 6 of the Bill. These terms and conditions will be the same as those under which the Commonwealth itself borrows the money. As the airline will be required to meet all charges under the loan agreements, the Commonwealth will, as usual, merely assume the function of an intermediary in these arrangements. </para>
          <para>The detailed terms and conditions of the loans to be arranged will be subject to approval by the Australian Loan Council. The total amount to be borrowed has been authorised under the 1969-70 programme approved for the Commonwealth at the Loan Council meeting in June 1969 and will be additional to the Commonwealth&#39;s approved programme of $!32m for State housing purposes.

        <para class="block">The main purpose of this Bill is to seek Parliament&#39;s approval to pay grants, amounting to $25m over 5 years, to the States for the erection of self contained accommodation for single age pensioners and those who qualify for service pensions by reason of age. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I think we all would agree that those persons most in need of housing assistance include single elderly pensioners living in miserable accommodation or paying too high a proportion of their pensions in rent. These pensioners are independent people who are capable of looking after themselves and include those who, because they live in deplorable conditions, sometimes suffer an untimely breakdown in their health. Experience has shown that, when they can be moved into adequate modern housing, their health frequently improves and their life expectation is increased. If they are required to pay only a reasonable rent, their financial worries are reduced and more of their pension is available to provide them with a modest standard of living. Too often rent is the killer. </para>
        <para>Eligible pensioners are defined in this Bill as single persons in receipt of the age pension and those who qualify for service pensions by reason of age, all of whom arc receiving or are eligible to receive supplementary assistance under section 30a of the Social Services Act or under section 98a of the Repatriation Act. To be eligible for supplementary assistance their means as assessed must be less than $3 per week apart, of course, from the pension. They are the most needy, and comprise at least 80% of all single applicants to lease aged persons units from State housing authorities. To meet their needs, there must first be alternative accommodation of a reasonable standard to offer them at rents they can reasonably be expected to pay. Secondly, if they are not to suffer substantial personal disturbance, the alternative accommodation in the majority of cases needs to be offered in the vicinity of the places where they are now living. The localities in which a large proportion of them are living and where most of them wish to continue to live are the older inner suburbs of our capital cities. </para>
        <para>The purpose of our offer of advances to the States is to assist them to carry out a number of building projects. A project may include the purchase of land, the preparation of land for the erection of a building, the planning and erection of a building and the installation of water, electricity or other services to provide self contained dwellings for eligible single pensioners. In making this offer to the States we have not overlooked the very considerable amount of aged persons housing built by many charitable and other non-profit organisations throughout Australia with the assistance of the <inline font-style="italic">$2</inline> for $ 1 grant under our aged persons homes scheme. Under this scheme self contained units and, in addition, hostel type accommodation and nursing home beds have been provided for many of our elderly citizens. We wish to see the activities of these charitable and other organisations expand further under our offer of assistance to them, for as long as there is an insufficient supply of suitable aged persons accommodation. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless there are still large numbers of needy aged pensioners who are far from adequately housed. Many of these are living in the poorer inner suburbs of our capital cities. There is a large unsatisfied backlog of demand for decent and moderatelypriced accommodation for these pensioners. This problem is mainly being tackled by the State housing authorities. A more rapid reduction of the backlog is an urgent welfare need for those involved, and this may most efficiently be achieved by providing finance to the States to permit them to expand their activities in this field. </para>
        <para>The $25m has been allocated among the States broadly in the proportion that the number of age pensioners receiving supplementary assistance in a State bears to the total number of these pensioners in the six </para>
        <para class="block">States. The proposed legislation does, however, provide that, in the unlikely event that a State does not wish to accept the full amount of its share of the $25m, any shortfall may be transferred to another State which is willing and able to spend it on the approved purpose. An amount equal to one-fifth of the $25m will be available to the States for expenditure each year, and any amount available but not advanced during a year will be available for expenditure in the succeeding year. </para>
        <para>As more aged persons&#39; accommodation is urgently needed, and as the purpose of our offer is to achieve this, each State has been asked for an assurance that it will spend from funds other than our grant during the 5-year period commencing 1st July 1969 not less than five times its average annual expenditure for this purpose during the 3 years ended 30th June 1969. Where neither a State nor its housing authority has as yet built homes specifically for aged persons capable of looking after themselves, such a State will be expected to agree to spend for this purpose a reasonable and increasing amount from the funds available to it other than the grant. </para>
        <para>Clause 4 of the Bill empowers the Minister to approve a building project, and clause 6 provides that the grant may be spent only on approved projects. An approved project may include that part of a building being erected by a State authority that contains specified single person units reserved solely for occupation by pensioners eligible under this scheme. Approved projects may include those whose construction commenced on or after 1st July 1969. Projects to be built with our advances will only be approved if they are to be provided in localities in which there is a demonstrable need, and if the homes to be erected will be of an adequate size and standard and be offered at reasonable rentals. </para>
        <para>As early as practicable after the end of each financial year each State will be required to supply to the Minister a statement certified by the Auditor-General of its expenditure out of advances under the Act on each approved project, and a statement of its expenditure during the year on the erection of aged persons&#39; accommodation from funds other than the Commonwealth grant. As soon as practicable after the receipt of this information, the Minister will be required to report to Parliament on the past year&#39;s activities under the scheme. In the interests of all those needy pensioners who stand to benefit under this scheme, I have much pleasure in commending this Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>With the concurrence of honourable senators, I incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </para>
          <para>This is a Bill seeking the authority of the Parliament for the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> to guarantee, on behalf of the Commonwealth, loans raised by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd in financing the purchase of one Boeing 727 and six Douglas DC9 aircraft. Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia now have six DC9s, and will acquire their fifth Boeing 727 in November, bringing the total domestic frontline fleet to twenty-two jet aircraft. </para>
          <para>Early this year, the Government considered proposals by the two airlines that each should purchase another Boeing 727 aircraft and a further six DC9s for delivery between March 1970 and March 1972. These proposals were based on a careful appraisal of the likely traffic growth in 1969, 1970, 1971 and beyond, and studies by the Department of Civil Aviation confirmed that the additional aircraft planned by the airlines would be essential if there was to be sufficient capacity to meet the growing demand of the main air routes. This is especially so as the remaining turboprop Electras and Viscounts are to be progressively phased out of service. By early 1971, the two airlines hope to have standardised their fleets on the Boeing 727 and </para>
          <para class="block">DC9 for front line operations, both types having proved to be eminently suited to Australian conditions. </para>
          <para>In the light of all the circumstances, the Government has approved the aircraft acquisition programmes of the airlines and has also agreed to facilitate the financing of the purchases by seeking parliamentary approval to raise loans on behalf of TransAustralia Airlines and to guarantee, if requested, any loans raised for the purpose by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. The latter arrangement is needed to ensure, as far as possible, that the private airline can borrow on terms comparable with those available to the Government airline, a vital consideration in a project which will cost each operator some $36m in all. Similar guarantees have been given with the approval of Parliament in respect of the company&#39;s purchase of its six DC9s and its fifth Boeing 727. </para>
          <para>Ansett Transport Industries Ltd has indicated that it will endeavour to borrow up to $28.6m or 80% of the estimated cost of its seven new aircraft, in accordance with the normal procedure in projects of this kind. The Bill places a limit of $US32m on the loans subject to Commonwealth quarantee, this being the equivalent of $A28.6m. Time has not yet permitted the company to complete its negotiations, but it expects to raise approximately$16.3m in Australia from a bank and other financial institutions, and the balance of$1 2.3m in the United States. </para>
          <para>The Bill now submitted is along similar lines to the Airline Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill which was approved by Parliament last year. It provides that, before giving a guarantee for any loan, the Treasurer is to be satisfied the moneys are borrowed on reasonable terms and conditions, that proper security is given to the Commonwealth over the aircraft and associated spares and equipment, and that undertakings are given by the company on such matters as insurance, mortgages, and export of the aircraft. The company will also be required to make available its financial accounts and records to an officer authorised by the Minister for Civil Aviation while any part of the loans remains unpaid. </para>
          <para>In assisting Ansett Transport Industries Ltd in this way to obtain suitable finance for the next phase of the company&#39;s equipment programme, the Government aims to ensure the continued operation of its successful two-airline policy. In common with Trans-Australia Airlines, the company will, with Commonwealth support, be able to obtain much needed aircraft within a reasonable time. At the same time, each airline will be able to finance the purchase of their aircraft on a similar basis. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">With the concurrence of honourable senators, I incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend section 21 of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act which provides for the establishment and operation of the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund. Under this section, royalties received by the Commonwealth for minerals or timber taken from the land which has been reserved for the use and benefit of Aboriginals, are appropriated out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund and paid into the Trust Fund. The Minister is authorised to approve payment out of the Fund of moneys which are to be paid or applied to or for the benefit of Aboriginals. The Trust Fund was established in 19S2 at the time Aboriginal reserves were opened for mining exploration and prospecting. The intention behind the establishment of the Fund was to give some compensatory benefit to the Aboriginal people for the loss of the use of land reserved for their benefit and any disturbance to their way of life because of mining operations. In 1961 the Act was amended to include in the revenues of the Fund the amounts received by the Commonwealth for royalties on timber taken from reserves. </para>
          <para>The rate of the royalty to be paid in respect of mining and timber operations carried on in reserves is fixed by Ordinance. With regard to mining, the standard royalty payable is <inline font-style="italic">2i%</inline> of the gross value of the minerals taken, less certain statutory deductions, and this is twice the royalty paid where mining is carried on outside an Aboriginal reserve. </para>
          <para>With the development of manganese mining at Groote Eylandt and bauxite mining at Gove, the Trust Fund will be a very important source of finance available to assist Aboriginals. Royalties from Groote Eylandt are expected to rise progressively to about $400,000 annually in 1975. Royalties from Gove are expected to commence in 1971 when about $600,000 should be paid to the Fund. This figure should rise to about $870,000 annually in 1975. From these two projects alone, the income of the Fund will be in excess of $lm a year in 1975 with a total revenue up to that time of about $5m. There is, of course, a possibility of other major mineral discoveries on reserves and if a wood chip industry were later established in Arnhem Land this could produce up to $250,000 additional revenue for the Fund each year. </para>
          <para>In view of the growing importance of the Fund as a source of assistance of Aboriginals in the Territory, the Government has reviewed the whole concept of the Fund and the way in which the Fund should operate. The Bill now before the Senate proposes certain legislative amendments to the Act with regard to the Fund and later I will also inform the Senate of the principles which the Government would wish to see followed with regard to the use of the revenue of the Fund. In brief, the changes proposed by the Bill are that: </para>

            </item>
            <item label="(e)">
              <para>similarly, the Minister may authorise the offsetting against revenue from lease rentals, Commonwealth expenditure on land subdivisions including the provision of roads, water, sewerage and other services; </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(f)">
              <para>the expenses of administering the Fund to be met from the revenues of the Fund. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Leases on reserves for pastoral and agricultural purposes will be granted only to Aboriginals. As reserves have been established for the use and benefit of Aboriginals generally, it is considered reasonable that net revenue from leases of land should be paid to the Trust Fund. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth could be required to expend considerable sums of the development of forests and the subdivision of land on reserves. In normal circumstances revenue from timber royalties would be regarded as including the re-imbursement of government expenditure incurred for silviculture, fire protection and forest management. Revenue from lease rentals similarly is regarded as meeting some part of the cost to a government in making serviced land available to lessees. It is considered reasonable that the Act should make provision for the application of these principles to forestry operations and the provision of serviced land on reserves, although the Bill proposes that the Minister should have a discretion both with regard to whether there should be any offsetting of costs against revenue in particular cases and the portion of those costs for which the Commonwealth should receive repayment. </para>
          <para>The Bill also proposes to reinstate the earlier provisions, omitted when amendments were made in 1965, that mineral and forestry royalties from land which at any time after 2nd September 1953 was a reserve shall be paid to the Trust Fund. The date referred to was the date of commencement of the legislation which permitted prospecting for minerals on Aboriginal reserves. Excisions from reserves are not contemplated at present, but in the event of any future change in the status of land which is now reserved for the Aboriginal people, Aboriginals will continue to receive the benefit of royalties and other revenues from that land. It is also proposed that action be taken administratively to establish a committee to advise the Minister on the allocation of moneys from the Fund. This committee will have an Aboriginal majority; initially there will be some places on the committee for officials who have responsibilities in Aboriginal affairs. </para>
          <para>One of the principal uses of revenue from the Fund is seen as grants to Aboriginal communities for community facilities such as halls, council houses, and sporting facilities. It is proposed that these grants will be made to local bodies representative of the community,and that the representatives will decide how the money is to be spent. Because it is thought important that local communities be identified as closely as possible with major economic developments in areas where they reside or hunt, it is proposed that, as a first priority, consideration be given to grants to communities, such as Yirrkala, where there is some major development taking place. AH Aboriginal communities wholive on reserves and Government settlements and mission stations will however be eligible for such grants. </para>
          <para>Other purposes for which the moneys of the Fund might be used include the making of loans or grants to assist Aboriginals either individually or in groups to establish themselves in productive industries or in commercial undertakings especially on reserves, and the provision of finance for Aboriginal equity participation in substantial commercial undertakings on reserves. It is proposed that loans should also be available from the Fund for the purchase of furniture, or to build or purchase houses, and for assistance in special cases for education and training which might be additional to any assistance normally provided by the Government or through existing schemes. Loans for houses will be additional to the Government&#39;s normal housing programmes for Aboriginals. </para>
          <para>It seems desirable to state the relationship of this Fund to the Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises which is administered by my colleague, the MinisterinCharge of Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> The Capital Fund can be used only for the purpose of making loans to assist Aboriginals to engage in business enterprises. There may, however, be cases where with an initial grant of part or even all of the capital required, the venture can succeed. In such cases capital grants from the Trust Fund are a possibility. There could, of course, be occasions when it would be appropriate for assistance to be granted from both Funds to a particular enterprise so that the resources of the two Funds can be used jointly in the best interests of Aboriginals. </para>
          <para>In the past, the Government has, of necessity, concentrated its efforts on improving the social situation and the educational standards of Aboriginals and giving training to adults which would give them skills on which they could support themselves. The time has come when the Government considers that without relaxing efforts being made on social advancement, there should be an additional concentration of effort to improve the economic position of Aboriginals in the Territory. There are substantial natural resources, particularly in the Arnhem Land Reserve, which we intend shall be developed by the local people. Proposals are now already under consideration for pastoral projects in particular areas and we are looking at proposals for additional assistance to missions which have already started various projects which appear to have potential to become economic businesses under Aboriginal ownership, though with European management in the early stages until the Aboriginal people gain experience. </para>
          <para>Other projects being looked at or developed are the logging and milling of timber, fishing on a commercial scale in various centres, contract fencing and mineral prospecting. The feasibility of these projects is being studied by the Department of the Interior and the Office of Aboriginal Affairs where finance from the Capital Fund is a possibility. Already one group at Yuendumu has been provided with loans from the Capital Fund to establish a plant at Yuendumu for extraction of copper from local ore. Recently the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> approved a loan from the Trust Fund to enable another group to build and operate a kiosk at Standley Chasm. </para>
          <para>A major decision made this year will increase the responsibility of Aboriginals for maintaining themselves and their families and give them experience in living in a community which is based on payment in cash for goods and services supplied. This was the introduction of higher training allowances which have been paid on settlements from February of this year. This replaced the old system of Aboriginals being given food, clothing and housing, etc., plus a minimum amount in cash for the training they are undergoing on settlements. The Government has also provided subsidies to the missions in the Northern Territory to enable them to pay the same training allowances to residents of mission stations from 19th August. </para>
          <para>I see these financial decisions as being of major importance. They reinforce the programmes of housing and home management training which are encouraging more of the people to live as family units, with the housewife managing her own family budget and seeking better furniture and home equipment. As I have said, it is contemplated that some of the Trust Fund moneys should be available for loans for the purchase of furniture and houses. Looking at the Government&#39;s efforts and achievements in the field of Aboriginal welfare in the Northern Territory, it would be impossible to measure the results of those efforts in any quantitative way and come up with a picture which would represent the true result. There are certainly areas where more could be done given the funds and physical resources necessary to correct deficiencies.. Also in some areas where considerable effort has been expended, the results on the surface may appear not to be very tangible. Nevertheless, if we look back 10 or 20 years we can see that the position has improved out of sight. People who were living in the most primitive of circumstances, with very little being done for them and little possibility of change are now in touch with the wider community. They have access to health services, their children are going regularly to school, a great many are becoming accustomed to nouses, to a settled life, and to regular employment. </para>
          <para>The position of the Aboriginal people must be looked at in human terms. The reactions of Aboriginals cannot always be looked at in the terms of the reactions of a European in the same situation. There are complicating factors for the Aboriginals of tribal customs, rules and relationships and the effect of the change to living in an environment which is so greatly different from their past. We need to know more about Aboriginal thinking and the problems as they see them. While it would be foolish to claim that the story of Aboriginal welfare in the Northern Territory is one of unqualified success, it has its successes as well as its failures. Complete success cannot be claimed until the Aboriginal people are living at social and economic levels which do not place them at a disadvantage compared with their fellow citizens. It is, however, true that to-day twenty children who attended Kormilda College last year are now attending the Darwin High School; it is true that to-day Aborigines on settlements and missions have more of the skills necessary to enable them to contribute to the development of the areas where they live; and it is also true that many Aboriginals are now showing a positive response to opportunities to take up business enterprises on their own account and that expanded financial assistance is available for this purpose. </para>
          <para>There is a great deal of sympathy and interest expressed by people and organisations throughout Australia for the Aboriginal people. This is most commendable and 1 welcome and applaud it. I would ask, however, that those who feel that not enough is being done in a practical way to assist Aboriginals, remember that there are dedicated people working on mission stations and settlements who have given many years of their lives to the cause of Aboriginal advancement. These are the people who have to deal directly with situations as they are on the ground, and live with disappointments and frustrations as well as enjoying the satisfactions of seeing and contributing to social and economic progress. It will take considerable effort by the people who live and work amongst Aboriginals to ensure that the economic projects proposed will be successful, and there is room for more dedicated people in this work. </para>
          <para>I hope that my remarks have conveyed the important role which is seen for the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund in advancing the social and economic position of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory and that all honourable senators will not only support the measure before the Senate but also support the principles which the Government considers should be followed in administering the moneys available in that Fund. </para>

            <para>- This is a Bill to impose increased air navigation charges on domestic airlines and general aviation operators. The increase is 10%, and it takes effect from 1st January of next year. The rates of air navigation charges payable by international operators are left unchanged under the Bill. The Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Scott)</inline> in his second reading speech told us that the Government had had regard to the substantial charges which were imposed on international operators from 1st January of this year. At that time the charges rose by about 21%, and the international operators complained that the charges were too high and that they were being required to meet more than a reasonable share of the costs of developing airports and airport facilities within Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is interesting to note that last year there was a general increase of 10% for domestic operators, but for aircraft of more than 200,000 lb all-up weight, that is to say, aircraft operated by international companies, there was a further increase of 10.7%. As the Minister stated, in the round this amounted to an increase of approximately 21% as from 1st January 1969. The international airline operators protested about this type of increase and at the same time actually refused to pay the higher charges, although I understand from the annual report of the Department of Civil Aviation that they have subsequently done so. The Minister now informs us that there has been established a working committee of officials from the Departments of Civil Aviation and the Treasury, coupled with representatives of local aviation operators and international companies, for the purpose of examining the problem of the Department&#39;s costs. The Minister hopes that this working group will determine what proportion of costs is attributable to each section of the industry. But it would appear that pending receipt of the working group&#39;s report the local domestic operators are to be hit further whilst the international operators, for the time being, are being permitted to retain the status quo. </para>
          <para>I know that the report of the working group is not expected to be received until some time next year, but when it is realised that the number of international passengers being set down and picked up in Australia on scheduled services, including charter flights, rose by 16%, to some 795,000 people in 1968, one comes to the conclusion that international operators should be bearing some proportion of the increased charges; particularly when one remembers that compared with the increase of 16% in the number of international passengers, according to the annual report of the Department of Civil Aviation, there was a growth of about 10% in domestic traffic. In addition, I understand that international operators are not required to pay any tax on fuel in Australia, whilst the domestic operators are required to pay tax on fuel. According to some figures submitted in another place by the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones),</inline> in the last financial year this tax amounted to some $12,817,000, whilst air navigation charges collected from domestic and international operators combined totalled $12,804,000. In fact, the amount of tax on fuel paid by the domestic operators in Australia last financial year was more than the total air navigation charges paid by the domestic operators and the international operators during that year. The domestic operators are carrying a great part of the burden of air navigation charges, as is apparent from Appendix 11 of the annual report of the Minister for Civil Aviation. With the concurrence of honourable senasenators, I incorporate that appendix in Hansard. </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">The Opposition does not oppose the Bill, but we certainly believe that the Government should be asking the working group that has been established to expedite its deliberations so that the burden of the costs and charges can be apportioned more equitably. After all, a great deal of the expenditure that is being undertaken on airport development and extensions, particularly at Kingsford-Smith Airport in Sydney and Tullamarine in Melbourne, will be of tremendous benefit to the international operators when the work is completed. </para>
          <para>I do not know that it is completely fair of any of them to say that Australian charges are the dearest in the world, because there is little, if any, similarity between the way airports are financed in Australia and the way some overseas countries finance their airports. In Australia airport construction is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. In some parts of the United States, I understand, the airports are constructed by local organisations and city corporations. Other airports in that country are provided by the United States Government. In some areas navigational aids are owned by the airline companies. When all these matters are taken into consideration, it must be very difficult for international operators to come to the conclusion that Australia&#39;s air navigation charges are the dearest in the world. There can be no doubt that Australia needs an efficient and not costly airline industry because of the sparseness of the population and the great distances that are involved in travelling within Australia. However, the Opposition believes that it is unfair to load the burden on to our domestic services most of the time and to let the international operators get off the hook for the time being. </para>
          <para>During the Committee stage, on behalf of the Opposition I will be moving an amendment aimed directly at preserving the curfew that exists on the operation of pure jet powered aircraft between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. at Kingsford-Smith, Essendon, Tullamarine, Brisbane and Adelaide airports. We do not oppose the motion for the second reading of this Bill, although I take advantage of this debate to request the Government to ask its working group to expedite its deliberations on the overall question of costs. </para>

            <para>- We will support this Bill which has been brought down by the Government. We recognise that the airline operators faced up to tremendous difficulties in meeting the capital cost of providing aircraft fleets in the early days of their operations. It was necessary for the community at large, through the government, to accept some responsibility for the facilities which were made available and without which the airlines could not function. I refer to facilities such as the airfields and the attendant buildings and navigational aids. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, there seems to have developed now a discrepancy between the expenditure of the Department of Civil Aviation and the amount that is recouped. We readily recognise that we can never expect to have an equation between these two factors because airfields can be put to a great many other uses. For instance they are also part of the defence establishment. For that reason alone it is very necessary to have them in a modern society. The availability of commercial airfields during a time of national crisis would be of inestimable value to any government trying to protect the security of the nation. So we readily recognise that part of the burden should be shared by the taxpayers as a whole. </para>
          <para>However, it is difficult to justify the discrepancy that exists at this stage, when commercial airlines have developed to a point at which if they are not running on a reasonably profitable basis they should be, and they should be accepting their responsibility for a larger share of the cost. The criticism has been made that air navigation charges have been increasing Budget by Budget. But we must realise that in the beginning very advantageous circumstances had to be provided for the commercial and partially government sponsored airlines, as it were, to get them off the ground. </para>
          <para>One of the great aspects of the development of this country is that we have been one of the leading nations in the world in the field of domestic airlines. I well recall that as far back as 1952, having used the airlines of this country somewhat sparingly, I was abroad and was able to make a comparison between our domestic airlines and those of other countries, including the allegedly advanced country of the United </para>
          <para class="block">States of America. In 1952 one seldom had to wait for an aircraft in Australia; our aircraft ran according to schedule. In my view, at that time we had the most efficient domestic airlines in the world. </para>
          <para>Unfortunately, my experience in the last 12 months has been that half of the flights are late. I make a number of flights, as does every other member of the Federal Parliament. Today we have reached the stage of incompetency that was endured by the people of the United States of America about 20 years ago. 1 wish that we had not developed to the extent that we have, because somewhere along the line we seem to have lost some of our efficiency. That is a criticism of our domestic airlines. It is made without full knowledge of all the circumstances that they have to face up to. I am certain that I had many infuriated parliamentary colleagues at the Canberra Airport only last Friday week, when many flights were delayed for up to 3 or 4 hours. The facilities to deal with the emergency seemed to me to be totally inadequate. I do not know whether the increase in air navigation charges will improve that aspect of domestic aviation and get us back to where we were years ago, when in my view we were the leading aviation country in the world because of the efficiency of our domestic airline. </para>
          <para>It appears to us that the increases suggested in this Bill are fully justified in view of the losses that are being sustained by the Department. It seems reasonable to us that if the international airlines are protesting that our charges are higher than those of any other country there should be, as has been advocated, an inquiry into that matter without accepting that the protests from the international airlines are justified or unjustified. We would be prepared to await the result of that inquiry before we offered criticism or otherwise and said whether the charges imposed on the international airlines should or should not have been increased in this legislation. I think that as practical Australians we must recognise that there has to be a clash of requirements in this field. We just cannot have our airports at a disadvantage with other international airports if we wish to participate in the volume of international tourism as it is at the moment. As we know, international tourism is increasing rapidly day by day and year by year. This increase is occurring purely and simply because air transport is so convenient. It enables tourists to travel the world in such a space of time and therefore makes tours available to a far larger section of the world&#39;s population than ever before. </para>
          <para>It is to Australia&#39;s ultimate advantage that we should participate in the international business that is going on in this sphere. We would be foolish to inhibit our own opportunities by allowing our airport charges to become so excessive, by comparison with those in the rest of the world, that we limited our opportunities to participate in this type of business. Here again we are forced to take into consideration all aspects of the problem. We must consider not only what we think is fair, right and just for the needs of our own domestic airlines and our own community but also for our interests in international trade. This is true whether it be in respect of tourism by air transport or the export of our commodities, either rural or manufactured. We have to make concessions to an international market in regard to goods that are manufactured and developed in this country. I think that an inquiry will reveal whether we are placing ourselves at a disadvantage by charging international airlines excessively. These airlines have protested and have said that that is so. The Government proposes to inquire into that matter and has at the moment more or less declared a situation of status quo in that there will be no increases until the inquiry is completed. We think that that is reasonable and proper. We suggest that this Bill should pass through all its stages and we are prepared to support it. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I spoke in relation to this matter when dealing with the Budget. It is a matter that has concerned me for some time, that over a period of, I think, 8 years the Government regularly has increased this charge to the domestic airlines by 10%. I know that the view of the Government is that it expects a certain recoupment of its expenditure on the building of aerodromes and the provision of navigational aids for safe flying. It is a case of looking at it in one way or the other. The Government wants as big a recoupment of expenditure as possible. I think that there is another aspect of it to be taken into account which is very important, and that is that this country, as I mentioned in my speech during the Budget debate, is a large one and the building or the sustaining of a first class air service is extremely important to its people. As one who has been in local government for years I sometimes see things differently from the way that a parliamentarian sees them. One thing which concerns small communities in remote areas, is the difficulty of holding their people. From the point of view of decentralisation it is important that we hold as many people as possible in the outer regions of this country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Everybody should not be living in the capital cities but, of course, if there are no satisfactory facilities afforded to people in the outlying areas the drift will be to the cities. But when speedy air services are available people can live in the distant regions and travel to the capital cities for a holiday or for a change of scene. The necessity for change probably does not strike the people who live in capital cities in the same way as it does the people who live elsewhere. The State of Queensland, which I have the honour to represent, is one in which the capital city is right in the south eastern corner. Most of the people in that State are in far flung regions or in the cities and towns along the coast. Queensland has a very well distributed population and it is most important that air services should be sustained at the present quality and available at a reasonable price. I emphasise the point that they should be available at a reasonable price. That is what concerns me in regard to the regular 10% increase, because the more these charges are piled on to the air services the more they will be passed on, by way of higher fares, to the people who use the services. Therefore I think this is an extremely important matter to the people of Queensland. </para>
          <para>I am not going to say that the adding of this 10% will mean an increase in charges immediately, but it is another cost that is being put on to the air services. If I remember rightly, this is the eighth year in a row that this has been done. I know that some people say that only a percentage of the population use air services, but it is a very big percentage. Air services provide a convenience not just for business people who travel between Sydney and Melbourne. The airlines provide a greatly used and cheaper service to people in outer areas. It is most important for us to have people who are satisfied to live in those areas. Therefore the requirement for an air service is probably more necessary in such areas and in the more torrid regions than it is to enable businessmen to travel between Sydney and Melbourne, lt is essential that we have air services that are as cheap as possible. I know it is very easy for people in Parliament to say that there should be an increase of 10% now, 10% next year and 10% the following year - and that it does not really matter; but we come to the time when the last straw breaks the camel&#39;s back. I have spoken about this before. I think we are reaching a position where we shall be asking for too big a percentage in return for expenditure. </para>
          <para>It is said to me that it is the people of the capital cities of Sydney and Melbourne who provide most of the traffic. Of course they do, because that is where the greatest aggregation of population is. But these people also involve this country in a terrific expenditure of millions and millions of dollars for the construction of airports such as Tullamarine and Mascot in order to handle overseas air traffic as well as our own. When we place increased charges on the domestic airlines we have to take into consideration the amount that is spent in those areas for the benefit of overseas airlines. Not only must we meet the requirements of our people but we must keep air fares as low as possible so that air travel will appeal to more and more people. It is not just business people in the outer areas who are using the air services but other people who are important because they are building up the population in sparsely populated areas of this Commonwealth. Today we see children travelling by air in parties, in college groups and so on. It is a very fine thing to see them moving about in a modern manner like this and seeing their country because it is a process of education. </para>
          <para>Anybody who has been to Japan would have seen school party after school party being taken around the country. I think this is a very good way of teaching children about their own country and making them realise what a wonderful country we live in. Whilst we might like to think that we ought to get a good return for our expenditure in building aerodromes, we have to remember the nature of the services that are required. Let me illustrate by referring to the railways. How many railways in Australia pay? The railways give a service to people in outlying regions. To a great extent it is probably a matter of preference. There are some people who still are a bit timid about plane travel and will travel by train. </para>

              <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> has pointed out, Queensland is so welldeveloped because the railways went out and developed the country. Aviation, too, can develop the country. Anything that we do to make travel to and from outlying areas more difficult makes those areas less attractive. People say that the Government is subsidising aviation. What if it is? Anyone who has taken an interest in aviation for as long as I have would know that originally the Government subsidised the airlines so that they could operate economically. Because of their increased efficiency, brought about by the development of modern planes, modern techniques and so on, in most cases they do not now require a direct subisidy. This achievement has been brought about by the encouragement shown by former governments. Today we have this very happy state in which we provide, by our domestic airlines, a service probably equal to that provided in most other countries. </para>

              <para>- Qantas started in the Queensland outback. 1 thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> for reminding me that from its small beginning in the Queensland outback today Qantas has developed a great international air service to which we can look with pride. It carries the name of Australia wherever its aircraft travel. It is an indication of how an airline can develop if it is encouraged and subsidised in its early days. So, we should not squeeze every ounce out of the orange - the orange being the utilities that provide a service to the community. We have to make up our minds to do things to help build such services. The Government will get a full return on its expenditure, no doubt. When the population of this country grows and as more and more air traffic uses the aerodromes the return on the Government&#39;s expenditure will be so much greater. We should not lose sight of the fact that a great deal of this Government expenditure is in the capital cities of Sydney and Melbourne. I do not object to that. 1 just mention that in passing. </para>

          <para>When we talk about returns on investments, we have to think of several things, including the indirect returns that come to the Government. 1 heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> say that the working group will come to some decision on the proposed increases. 1 believe that this Legislation should have been deferred until such tune as that group decided on the allocations of expenditure. What is the position of those who make profits from people who travel by air - the people in the tourist industry, resorts, hotels and motels, the industries that service the aircraft and supply oil and fuel, the people running businesses at the aerodromes? What about those who build the aerodromes? All these people make profits. They are taxed by this Government. Has consideration been given to this aspect? These are very important matters. By way of indirect taxation the Government is receiving money from this industry. This 10% increase in the rates of air navigation charges does not mean a 10% increase in revenue to the Government. I am speaking impromptu, but I think that the Report of the Department of Civil Aviation shows that last year income rose not by 10% but by about 29%. </para>

              <para>- Yes, that was brought about by the increased mileage, but no doubt it was brought about also by the increased usage of aerodromes and of the extra services provided. The increase is not just 10%. I think it works out at 29%. I think that is the figure. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> said, the increased mileage and usage are matters that require study. If the Government studied those matters properly it might have some different thoughts about the future. In the case of the international airlines any proposal for an increase has been deferred because of the clamour that charges for Australian airport services that international airlines have to meet are higher than those in operation in any other country. </para>

              <para>- Yes, but there is no such additional charge this year. Nobody disputes that the Australian charge is the highest in the world. The increase could have a detrimental effect on operations by international airlines in that an aircraft taking off from Sydney might not land at, say, Darwin because of the increased charges. What is the result? The service to people in one of our outlying regions is reduced. I just mention this as an illustration of what can happen. Apparently as a result of what was said and the clamour that arose when this group was set up, the Government deferred the matter of rates of air navigation charges payable by overseas airlines. Unfortunately, the domestic airlines were not considered in a similar light. I certainly think that all aspects should be studied. </para>

          <para>For some time I have been concerned about this regular increase of 10%. It is building up a cost structure that could have a detrimental effect on many operations. When I spoke on legislation to impose what was virtually an air passenger tax, which I opposed and which I am pleased to note that this Senate rejected, I mentioned that industries such as the tourist industry in my home State of Queensland could be injured by the introduction of that legislation. No doubt industries in other parts of the Commonwealth would be affected also. Honourable senators know their own States better than I do. In my home State, of which I can speak and about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> as a previous Premier, would know, tremendous development has taken place. It was during <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> term of office as Premier that a lot of the development took place. A string of tourist resorts along the coast and on the islands sprang ip. Today resorts such as those on islands in the Great Barrier Reef face competition from resorts in Papua and New Guinea, Noumea and Fiji. Today, because air fares pro rata are so much cheaper because increased charges have not been imposed on overseas operators, Australians are being encouraged to go to Fiji. Our own international airline will, in co-operation with British Overseas Airways Corporation, invest money in a resort in Fiji. I have never heard of Qantas investing in any resort in this country. Australia is the country of which we should be thinking. The Commonwealth Government is considering making a grant for the building of an aerodrome in Fiji. The Government can make a grant for the building of an aerodrome in Fiji, whose tourist industry is in direct opposition to the tourist industry in my home State, but it will not help our own tourist industry. Queensland and Fiji are both tropical regions which have a similar appeal because of similar vegetation, rain forests and so on. We should consider the development of our country rather than that of other countries. I mention that proposed grant to show that sometimes our thinking is on other places instead of on this country. </para>
          <para>I make a strong suggestion to the Government that earnest consideration be given to stabilising, these aerodrome charges and keeping them within reasonable limits. We should not consider the direct return but the indirect return. We should consider how the increased charges will affect the development of this country and whether they will encourage further development of air services by a greater usage of those services, or whether they will become too tough and so retard the air travel industry and associated industries such as the tourist industry. </para>
          <para>I feel strongly about this matter. The international airlines having been given consideration this year, I think that similar consideration should be given to the domestic airlines. I make a strong recommendation to the Government that it consider these increased charges not just as a matter of dollars and cents returned but as a matter of the contribution that airlines make to the development of this country. We do lots of things and we give money for lots of things on which we do not get a return. We spend lots of money in New Guinea and we spend money on different things here, but we do not get a direct return out of that. We should consider the air travel industry as something of great importance to Australia and something which has a much greater impact on the people than has the provision of a monetary return to this Government on its expenditure on aerodromes and on civil aviation aids. In doing that we should remember that the outlying aerodromes are not like Mascot in New South Wales or Tullamarine in Victoria. </para>
          <para>The airports in many country centres are under the control of councils. If there is any form of government which is short of funds it is local government. Many local government bodies throughout Australia are maintaining aerodromes and doing other necessary work. I ask the Government to remember when taking action that might affect such areas that the people there are doing more towards the maintenance of aerodromes than are people in the capital cities. I hope that what I have said will cause the Government to bring fresh thinking to this matter. </para>

            <para>- in reply - I thank honourable senators of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democratic Labor Party and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for their comments on this legislation. 1 point out particularly to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> that the Government has a big responsibility to provide airports and air navigation facilities for the travelling public. This year the operating costs of the facilities will be about $69m and the revenue from air navigation charges and other charges and the fuel tax will be about $26m, leaving a deficit of about $43m. Since 1962 an annual increase of 10% has occurred in air navigation charges. I remind honourable senators that the agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the airline companies provided for in the Airlines Agreement Act states that the Commonwealth cannot increase air navigation charges by more than 10% a year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline>put the view that the Government by the imposition of these charges is probably affecting the airline industry. </para>
          <para class="block">The revenues of the airline companies, the weight of goods carried, the number of passengers carried and the distances travelled increase each year. The domestic airlines last increased their fares in 1967, by 5%. In that year they paid air navigation charges of about $4.4m. Last year they paid about $5. 9m, an increase of about $1.5m, or about 35%. It is therefore apparent that the additional charges have not in themselves necessitated an increase in fares. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline>in his speech on the Budget suggested that an increase in fares of about 2i% might have to be made by the airline companies to cover the proposed increase in air navigation charges. 1 point out to honourable senators that a 10% increase in air navigation charges costs the domestic airlines about $590,000 a year, or about one-third of 1% of their costs of about $170m. It is a very small factor and it is clear that increased air navigation charges alone would not justify or require increases in fares. The number of passengers carried in 1968-69 increased to 5,231,880, an increase of 9.5%; freight increased to about 91,000 tons, an increase of 5.3%; and mail cargo increased to 9,968 tons, an increase of 2.4%. Although the actual results for last year are not available, the increased traffic and freight indicate that the airlines must have had another successful year. 1 therefore find it hard to be convinced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood&#39;s</inline> submission that the airline industry is being affected by increases in air navigation charges. </para>
          <para>The fact is that we are developing  a  very big nation, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> has said. Many airports are located in outback areas, involving the expenditure of large sums of money for our outback settlers. I am sure that honourable senators agree that although the Government cannot recoup all its costs the air travelling public should be responsible for providing some of the costs. I have pointed out that the total revenue from air navigation charges, other charges and fuel tax will be about S26m, which is nowhere near the sum of S69m that the Commonwealth Government has to pay for the upkeep of airport facilities. The Budget provides in the coming year for over S33m for capital improvements to our airport facilities. </para>

              <para>- Yes. But we are providing a large proportion of the expenditure on marginal aerodromes and they do not produce much revenue. I agree that it is necessary to go on spending that money, but 1 remind honourable senators that the Commonwealth Railways, which has been referred to during the debate on the Estimates, shows a profit while providing a passenger service. At present the Australian National Line is running on a profitable basis. By these measures the Government seeks to recover some of the money provided by taxpayers for facilities for the travelling public. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> referred to problems experienced when planes do not operate at the scheduled times. Of course it must be understood - I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> would understand it - that schedules are subject to alteration.

For some considerable time a great publicity campaign has been waged to persuade the Government to lift the curfew on the night operations of pure jet-powered aircraft.

          <para class="block">This kind of campaign has been waged over a period of months. It has gained considerable momentum since the Government granted permission for the importation of Boeing quick change aircraft, that is to say, aircraft which can be converted very quickly from passenger to freight carrying purposes. It is interesting to read in the annual report of the Department of Civil Aviation that the increasing emphasis on the use of quick change aircraft is reflected in the decision of Ansett Airlines of Australia to purchase the next two Boeing 727s in the quick change version.

          <para class="block">Whilst all these statements are being uttered by senior members of the Liberal Party all that the people who are injuriously affected are told by the Government is that no application has been made for a lifting of the ban; that at the present time - I emphasise the words &#39;at the present time&#39; - there is no intention of changing the restriction; and that it is the Government&#39;s intention &#39;under the existing circumstances&#39; to maintain the present restriction. Nonetheless, the Government has stated that if an application to lift the ban is made the Government will have to consider it. As late as 16th September, which is only a week ago, the Premier of New South Wales was non-committal in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly when, in reply to a question asked of him by the member for Marrickville, he said:  1 should like to have the benefit of the Committee&#39;s findings- </para>

The cynicism with which the Federal and State Governments are treating the problems of those people who are vitally affected by aircraft noise is, frankly, quite staggering and frightening. No government in Australia seems to be on their side or to bc taking up their case against the large and powerful airline interests. The Australian Labor Party has endeavoured to obtain a statement from a responsible Minister that the embargo will never be relaxed, but no Minister seems to be prepared to give such an undertaking. </para>

              <para>-  indeed, one says one thing and another says something else. The people who live in the southern suburbs of Sydney in particular have every justification for being concerned at the Government&#39;s failure to say positively that whilst the present airport remains in use and no other site is made available for a second airport to serve Sydney there will be no lifting of the curfew under any circumstances. It should be remembered that the present embargo is not a legislative ban. There is no act or regulation to enforce it. lt is merely a departmental ban. As I understand the situation, the ban can be enforced at present only because the airline operators have to submit their schedules to the Department of Civil Aviation for approval and, knowing the attitude of the Department at this stage, the airline operators have not submitted schedules for night operations. Property values in some Sydney suburbs, particularly the southern suburbs, are being adversely affected by the noise problem. If night flying operations are allowed in the future the value of homes in some Sydney suburbs may be greatly reduced. Day by day the noise is becoming more intolerable because of the increased number of intrastate, interstate and overseas aircraft which are taking off and landing. </para>

          <para>The Opposition&#39;s amendment is a simple one. It seeks to provide a legislative bar to pure jet aircraft taking off and landing at night at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, Essendon Airport, Melbourne (Tullamarine) Airport, Brisbane Airport and Adelaide Airport between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. The Opposition anxiously awaits the Government&#39;s announcement that a new airport site for Sydney will be chosen. In the meantime an assurance should be given by a responsible Minister that no jet flights between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. will be tolerated from any of the airports I have mentioned. The matter is of serious concern to those who are affected. It is a matter which affects not only the people of Sydney and Melbourne but also the people of Adelaide and Brisbane. I noticed an article in the Adelaide Advertiser* of 10th May to the effect that airport noise is a problem in Adelaide and that controversy has been raging in the last few weeks over the question. It is the Government&#39;s responsibility to ensure that the lives and living conditions of people who live adjacent to airports and under flight paths are not deleteriously affected. It is up to the Government to make a positive pronouncement that the ban will be rigidly enforced. In the meantime, however, on behalf of the Opposition I move the amendment knowing that if carried it will bring great comfort and succour to those who are affected. </para>

            <para>- I oppose the amendment. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> pointed out, the embargo has been in operation for a considerable period of time. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland&#39;s</inline> statement that there is a need to put more teeth in the embargo. As far as I know, the embargo has been carried out effectively so far and there is no indication from the Government that it is likely to be relaxed in the immediate future. The amendment would appear to be in direct contrast to the general principle of the two airline policy which has been enunciated in this chamber on many occasions. There is an agreement that air navigation charges cannot be increased by more than 10% a year. The Opposition&#39;s amendment appears to be quite contrary to that restriction. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Opposition has requested that the present embargo on jet flights between 1 1 p.m. and 6 a.m. remain in force at all time. 1 think that is a far reaching request. Conditions can change from month to month and from year to year. There may be completely different circumstances in the future. For instance we may have new types of aircraft. If the Opposition&#39;s amendment is passed we could be tied up to such an extent that an Act of Parliament would have to be passed in the future to meet a new situation. I would like to point out that, although I have not seen any noise deflecting fences and walls installed at any of the aerodromes in Australia, these are used in almost every international airport in the world that I have seen. These moonshaped fences and walls deflect the noise upwards instead of horizontally. I am surprised that they are not being used anywhere in Australia. </para>
          <para>Another point I would like to make is that there is no provision whatsoever in the Opposition&#39;s amendment for emergencies. If an internal flight took off from Sydney for Perth, Darwin or New Guinea at say 10 o&#39;clock at night or a bit later and, as a result of engine trouble, it had to return at 11.30 p.m. would the operator be up for the 500% increase in landing fees simply because the aircraft returned for safety reasons? I understand that existing regulations provide that aircraft can now use these airports in a genuine emergency without a fine being imposed or without the airline operators getting into trouble. There is no such provision in this amendment. It is a very rigid amendment without providing any authority for the remission of charges. It simply states that there shall be an increase by 500%. There is no mention of emergencies. For those reasons I oppose the amendment. </para>

            <para>- One could be tempted to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> on a very long and informative second reading speech on a Bill related to a different matter from that which is under discussion. This is virtually what the amendment amounts to. We have received no preknowledge, in accordance with the normal courtesies of the chamber, that such an amendment would be proposed. Had we done so this would have given us some chance to consider it. We would have asked, as the opposition to a government does after a second reading speech, for an adjournment to allow us to give the mature consideration that all legislation should receive before it is passed by a parliament in our democracy. If for no other reason than that we have not had that opportunity we would be opposed to the amendment. But 1 cannot accept the argument that to insert a clause such as this in a Bill that relates to increased landing charges in respect of commercial aircraft would give the teeth that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> requires to the regulations under which the Government is achieving what would appear to many of us to be the very admirable effect of forbidding the use of airports by these aircraft within the hours mentioned in the amendment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What we would do if we carried an amendment such as this would be to legalise the use of our airports within these hours while imposing what appear to us at this stage to be prohibitive charges for the use of the airports. I do not know whether, if the charges were merely increased by 500%, I could accept that they would be prohibitive charges under all circumstances. When the Government is looking at all aspects of this very new problem of the tremendous noise created by modern high powered aircraft and is apparently achieving the objective which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> seeks to achieve by the amendment, I do not think that the Government is open to a charge of cynicism. </para>

              <para>- That is true. We have no expression of opinion from all of the people of Victoria. It is true that the democratically elected Premier of the State, who manages to get a majority of the votes of the people within the State, has expressed a point of view. I am not prepared at this stage to accept that as being the point of view of the whole of the State. Obviously the Federal Government has not accepted it either, at this stage anyway. I cannot read into that any reason why I, as a senator from Victoria, should give approval to a proposition that it is all right to use the airports between these hours so long as a higher charge is imposed. The fact that it appears to be a prohibitive charge is inconsequential when we are considering legislation in the interests of the people. This is not a boy scout institution. It is a Parliament and should be run on the lines of a Parliament. </para>

Our objection is that it is impossible under the Bill we are considering to give consideration to the matter which the amendment covers. We would be opposed to the principle expounded in the amendment that the only way to prohibit, if it is the considered opinion of the Parliament that we should prohibit, the use of airports between these hours by aircraft of this character, is to make it so profitable for the Government as to make it worthwhile for the people to put up with the inconvenience if airline operators are prepared to pay the required charge. We consider the amendment to be ill-conceived and hastily introduced on a Bill that really has nothing to do with the noise created by aircraft.

              <para>- It is a flat charge, and of course there are express freight charges on top of that. The amendment calls for an increase in the air navigation charges from approximately SI 10 to S550 which would reduce the earnings of the aircraft from &#167;3,700 to &#167;3,150. But this is still a very profitable operation. If the airline companies imposed a surcharge of 1.5c per lb they would again be earning $3,700 for that flight. So what the Opposition puts forward here as a deterrent to airline companies operating between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. would not be a deterrent. </para>

              <para>- It is an encouragement to the airways to break the ban. The electors of St George and other areas which will be affected should be told of these figures so that they may understand clearly that the Opposition is attempting to influence them and so that they will know that the interest which the Opposition has at heart is indeed an extremely odd one. On these figures alone the Opposition&#39;s amendment must be defeated in the interests of the people around Kingsford-Smith Airport. I find it difficult to understand why Tullamarine is included in this amendment because it was built in open country to avoid the great problem that has arisen around other airports in Australia. </para>

              <para>- I am sure that the people of Western Australia will not be very impressed with this amendment because one means of obtaining quick freight between the eastern States and Western Australia would be with the night operations of fast jet aircraft after 11 p.m. between Melbourne and Perth and return. This would be of great benefit to those in Western Australia who are always having some problem because of the inability of the small piston engine aircraft to carry the freight required in that State. Whatever argument is applied to Kingsford-Smith, Brisbane or perhaps even to Adelaide, would not apply to Tullamarine. I do not think the people of Victoria, Western Australia or any other State should be disadvantaged by the action of a person who, knowing of the problem of noise near an airport, builds a house close to Tullamarine airport. Therefore 1 oppose the amendment because it will not achieve what the Labor Party thinks it will achieve and indeed it will be to the detriment of people living near the Kingsford-Smith Airport. </para>

            <para>- The amendment we are discussing is to impose a 500% increase in landing charges in respect of jet powered aircraft taking off from Kingsford-Smith, Tullamarine, Brisbane and Adelaide airports between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. lt is our view that this would discourage any airline operator from wanting to use the aerodromes after 1 1 p.m., even if perhaps it wanted by some chance to divert a flight other than in a grave emergency. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> has just asked why Tullamarine should not be exempted as it is farther outside the city area. Aircraft could take off from Tullamarine and could land at some other airport, but where would they land? </para>

              <para>- The Perth, Launceston and Hobart airports were designed in anticipation of a situation in which more and more noise would be associated with the aircraft industry. I was a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works which examined the Perth airport project. In that case there was an area which was considered to be a noman&#39;s land which would act as a noise buffer. The same thing applies to the airport at Hobart. Originally the airport was closer in at Cambridge, and when the present site was chosen it was considered that, being a forestry area, not only would it lend itself to development as an airport but also it would be well away from the built up area. </para>

              <para>- That is right; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> has remembered the area. It seems as though the wasps were working in favour of the community rather than against it by ensuring that an area of forest land would be given up for later use as an airport. I come back to the situation that we are debating with regard to priorities and the conflict of interest. We have reached the situation where the Parliament has jurisdiction over the matter and has to make decisions which will take into account the situation that has arisen. There is no doubt that the effects of noise are well known to people who have lived in close proximity to an aerodrome from which jet aircraft have been operating. Grave concern is being expressed about problems of air pollution and water pollution, but noise is another form of pollution which can have a grave and even more serious effect than water or air pollution. The noise level and decibel rating of many aircraft have a nervous effect and create a strain on people who unfortunately have to live in the vicinity of an airport. 1 believe that the health of the community must be of prime consideration. Commercial interests will still go to the full limit without regard to the health of the community if they are given enough rein. Legislation such as this will make even more effective the ban which has already been imposed. We support the complete embargo that exists at present. </para>

              <para>- In Tasmania we are working with our brains instead of with brawn and we are very happy with outairport situation, i refer there not only to the people of Tasmania but also the Department of Civil Aviation which has taken over areas which are not built up at present and in respect of which precautions have been taken to ensure that the areas will not bc built upon. One of the quirks of human nature that 1 cannot understand is that people wil buy land alongside an airport, it must be a particular breed of land salesman who can possibly sell a person a block of land or a house near an airport. People who buy land near an airport must be tigers for punishment if they think they will ever have any peace at night or at other times when jet aircraft are operating from the airport. </para>

          <para>I should like to refer to a letter of 25th July 1969 from the Town  Clerk  of the Council of the Municipality of Rockdale to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton).</inline> The Town  Clerk  referred to a letter dated 3rd June 1969, which he had addressed to the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz).</inline> In the letter of 25th July he stated, referring to the letter of 3rd June:  . . my Council sought a clear indication of the Government&#39;s policy on the question of introduction of night cargo flights by jet aircraft to and from Kingsford-Smith Airport between the hours of II p.m. and 6 a.m. No reply from the Minister has yet been received. </para>
          <para>The Minister had earlier informed Council, on 24th September 1968, and again on 13th November 1968. that he had no intention of changing the existing policy restricting operations by jet aircraft during the curfew period of 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. The Minister further stated that no proposal had been received by the Department of Civil Aviation for the operation of schedules by jet aircraft for cargo carrying purposes during the restricted hours and that, in the event of the receipt of such a proposal, it would be considered in the light of the need for additional services and the ability of the operator to contain noise levels within specified limits, which were yet to be determined. </para>

            <para>Council&#39;s very real concern in this matter has been brought about by recent Press and other reports, from which it is apparent that airline operators are initiating action for lifting of the curfew ban.

            <para>Council and the citizens of Rockdale have continuously suffered the severe effects of excessive noise over the Municipality from aircraft taking ofl&#39; and landing at Kingsford-Smith Airport since the introduction of the Constellation aircraft 15 years ago. They have borne an unreasonably large share of the nuisance and annoyance caused - more so than any other local government area in Australia - and will use every means within their power to see that night cargo jet flights are not permitted, so that they can be assured at least that the little rest and sleep they are getting will not be disturbed. </para>

            <para>The problem of noise created by low flying aircraft coming into land and taking off from Kingsford-Smith Airport is one that concerns every member of this community. This noise, even with the use of the new runway out into Botany Bay, is becoming increasingly intolerable day by day as more flights are allocated to overseas operators. There now appears upon the scene the spectre of night jet freighter flights.  lt is a spectre. An indication of the effect which this noise is having on members of the community is seen in an article in the Australian&#39; of 6th June 1969. It refers to the concern of church people about the disturbance which aircraft noise is creating. </para>

              <para>- They want the ban maintained, and they want every possible pressure brought to bear on airline operators to restrain them from using an airport in a built-up area between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. There is no suggestion from honourable senators on this side of the chamber that we want the ban lifted. We want it to remain. But we also want to impose the additional penalty to ensure that airline operators will not find their way around this embargo, by taking off from one airport and, under the guise of operating to another airport, landing at an airport  in a built-up area. The amendment is designed to ensure that airlines do not operate in this way, because of the extra charges which would be involved if they did so operate. I am not referring to an emergency. The Department of Civil Aviation is able to differentiate between a normal set of circumstances and an emergency when it is urgent for an aircraft to land at the nearest airport. The amendment does not apply to an emergency. It is designed to add teeth, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> stated, to the existing provisions for an embargo on the operations of jet aircraft at airports between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. I do not oppose the operation of jet aircraft to airports which are remote from built-up areas. I believe the point at issue is that where an airport is situated in a built-up area, operations between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. should be automatically excluded. It is as simple as that. </para>

              <para>- It is indirectly concerned with the Bill. It is indicating to the people concerned the gravity of the situation that has arisen where people living near airports from which jets are operating are under such constant nervous strain that the imposition should not be tolerated. Because this position has arisen, it is the Commonwealth Government&#39;s responsibility to take the initiative and to select another airport site. When we were discussing this matter recently I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> whether in future he would ensure that his own Department and the client departments would place a covenant on land adjoining newly selected airport sites. I believe it is of great importance that this be done in future. This problem will recur because, I suppose, of the avarice or the keenness of land developers and land salesmen who are able to persuade unsuspecting people to buy land near an airport. I am quire certain that no person in his right mind would purchase such land if he knew of the noise factor created by modern jet aircraft using airports and of the nervous strain which this would place upon him. </para>

But a problem which this Parliament must face is the congestion which busy airports create in population centres. 1 think that the time has come when airports have to be transferred away from population centres and when helicopter feeder services have to be introduced. After all, the technique of helicopter transport is improving. I believe that one of the thoughts behind the amendment is that we have reached the stage where a prohibition has to be placed upon noisy aircraft using airports after 1 1 p.m. Not only should that prohibition be as complete as possible, but those who try to avoid it should be very heavily penalised. That is the purpose behind the amendment. We believe that operations by jet aircraft after </para>

          <para>In reply to the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> and, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline> to the effect that the amendment seems to suggest that the Labor movement approves of the lifting of the embargo and wants money to be made out of night operations, let me repeat that the amendment is moved to this Bill, which is a charges Bill, in order to give legislative teeth to the mere administrative decision or departmental edict that exists at the present time. There is no embargo in a statute or in statutory regulations; there is only a departmental minute which can be torn up at any time and replaced by another edict. We suggest that, this being a charges Bill, in the circumstances existing at this time this is the only way we can move to put legislative teeth into the departmental minute. </para>

He suggests that that report will be tabled at some time in 1970.

I suggest that it is quite likely that, if the pressure is on the Government at the present time, as it obviously is, to have the ban on night jet nights lifted, after the election, with another 3 years to go, the Government, irrespective of what any select committee recommends, will succumb to the pressure and lift the embargo. The Government is not bound to accept any Select Committee recommendation. We want to prepare the way for anything that might happen, if by some mischance this Government is re-elected, and to make sure that the people living in the areas adjacent to or near the airports concerned are protected. </para>

            <para>- The purpose of this Bill is to continue the operations of the present legislation which expires on 31st October. The intention is that subsidy at the rate of $80 per ton which is being paid at the present time on nitrogenous fertiliser should be extended. The variations for which the Bill provides have become necessary with the increasing usage and manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers in Australia. If the Act were extended in its existing terms the subsidy would not be attracted by imported nitrogenous products because under the Act, subsidy is payable only on those imports which represent the shortfall between the requirements of primary producers and domestic production. The intention of the Bill is to extend the period for payment of the subsidy for a further 3 years and, as I say, it will also vary the conditions of payment to enable the subsidy to be paid on imported nitrogen fertilisers. Another very important feature of the Bill is that depending on the amount of nitrogen in the fertiliser, whether it be urea, aqua ammonia, ammonium sulphate or anhydrous ammonia - which, of course, is the highest in nitrogen content - so the subsidy is increased. The reason, of course, is obvious, having regard to the fact that it is the nitrogen which is of most value in the application of fertiliser to a particular crop. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I propose to move an amendment, which is now being circulated, to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. It is similar to the one that was presented in another place and I therefore make no apology for not having distributed it to the leaders of other Parties prior to presenting it. The subsidy on nitrogenous fertiliser is not opposed by the Opposition. We feel that the arguments that were put for a subsidy on ordinary superphosphate apply to the subsidy for nitrogenous fertilisers which we are now considering. The argument put forward by the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Scott),</inline> who represents the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> when dealing with the superphosphate subsidy was that the cost price squeeze has made it necessary to assist the farmer and this assistance can be given only in this way because the prices that the farmer is obtaining for his commodities have not increased with the increased costs in the industry. In the case of nitrogen fertilisers, until recent times we have found that their greatest use has been in the sugar industry but they are now being used in many other fields of primary industry. In the wheat areas of Western Australia we are now using anhydrous ammonia to a considerable extent because it is necessary with the type of soil we have and it gives us better returns. That is why we in Western Australia are particularly pleased with any form of subsidy on nitrogenous fertiliser. </para>
          <para>The amendment which is now before honourable senators seeks that the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted for two reasons. We want to raise the rate of subsidy for nitrogenous fertiliser  in  line with the recent increase in the subsidy paid on ordinary superphosphate. The reasoning is, of course, identical with that which applies to ordinary superphosphate. I think that I can refer to the arguments raised by the Minister  in  his second reading speech and apply them to the amendment which I intend to move. Dealing with the subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The case for a subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers rests on two main grounds. Firstly, the subsidy provides cost relief for the user of nitrogen and secondly, it encourages the application of nitrogen to crops and pastures where it has been shown to lead to increased productivity and lower unit costs. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I agree with this. Because costs have increased and returns have not, this  is a  further reason why we should have  an  increase based on the subsidy for ordinary superphosphate. Further in the Minister&#39;s speech - and this also is in support of my argument - he said in relation to a report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>However, since 1965-66, the year just prior to the introduction of the subsidy, the overall Bureau of Agricultural Economics index of prices paid to prices received by the primary producers has continued its downward trend from 102 to 89. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So, according to the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, there has been a lowering of return to the farmer. In the second part of the amendment honourable senators will notice that we refer to a review each year of the subsidy rate on nitrogenous fertiliser. The Bill is seeking an extension of the subsidy for 3 years. We think it would be a good thing if the subsidy were to remain static, but it docs seem that there will be an increased use of nitrogenous fertiliser and also an increased production of nitrogenous fertiliser in Australia. This will come about with the movement into full operation of the Austral-Pacific fertiliser plant in Queensland. Recently the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> opened this $34m complex on Gibson Island. In a very short time we could be producing about three times as much nitrogenous fertiliser here in Australia as we have been producing. It is quite evident that, with increased productivity, costs could be reduced. Because of the possible reduction in costs we think it would be worthwhile to have a yearly review of the situation so that we could determine whether or not the rate of subsidy should continue or whether or not it should be reduced. 1 have not mentioned what the first part of our amendment would cost. The amendment does not mention a specific amount. We have in mind an increase in subsidy of 50%, which was the increase given recently in the superphosphate bounty. I commend the amendment to honourable senators. It seems to me to represent a perfectly reasonable approach to the use and to the encouragement of the use of nitrogenous fertilisers. It would help primary industries to rise above the difficulties imposed by low prices and increased costs by enabling those industries to use this very valuable stimulant more as the years go by. I hope that the Senate will accept the amendment and that we will be able to send the Bill back for a rapid redraft to incorporate the clauses and the ideas that have been presented. I move: </para>

            <para>- The purposes of the Bill have been explained very clearly to the Senate by the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Scott)</inline> when he delivered his second reading speech. 1 would like to make one or two supplementary points to those raised by the Minister. The purpose of this legislation is to enable Australian farmers to buy nitrogenous fertilisers at a price comparable with those paid by their competitors in other parts of the world. I would like to quote some prices made available recently to the Senate through the courtesy of the Minister. I shall refer to an average price. The price varies from place to place. The average price quoted for urea is $84.73 a ton. In the United Kingdom the price paid by farmers is $89.44. In France the farmer pays $102.93. In Italy the price paid is $102.62. In West Germany, a similar price, $102.28, is paid. The proposed Australian price is $79 which compares very favourably with the prices that I have quoted. </para>

              <para>- These are comparative prices. The price for Western Australia, because of the existence of stocks at lower prices, will be $74.80. At the same time as the Australian farmer, under this legislation, is guaranteed nitrogenous fertilisers at a somewhat more advantageous price than that paid by his overseas competitors, the Australian industry, which is a new industry, will receive the Australian price plus the bounty. The industry will also receive various subsidies payable under other legislation. In the case of urea there is a limit of $500,000 and a tonnage rate will be worked out in accordance with the number of tons produced. I believe the current rate is in the vicinity of $7. At present the Australian manufacturer receives something like $122 a ton for urea. I selected urea as an example because it is one of the most commonly used of these fertilisers and it seems to set the pattern of usage of nitrogenous fertilisers. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Currently the Tariff Board has an application before it and there seems to be a great deal of anxiety because of the excess capacity that will be brought into operation and its effect upon the cost to the Australian industry of producing at an economic price. I understand that the application before the Tariff Board seeks a bounty for some$29 a ton in respect of ammonia produced for agricultural use. There are problems in this field. In the early 1960s Australia manufactured very little nitrogenous fertiliser. With the completion of various oil refineries it was necessary, for their economic operation, that the ammonia, which is a by-product, be used. The Government encouraged industry to enter the field. To encourage the use of nitrogenous fertilisers a subsidy, which amounted to $80 a ton, was introduced. The subsidy in relation to urea amounted to $36.80 a ton. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to note that only when the subsidy was introduced was it found possible to import cheap urea. Hitherto Australian farmers were not able to buy cheap overseas nitrogenous fertilisers. Importers had no incentive to land urea at lower prices when there was no Australian industry with which to compete. Urea in South Australia in 1962 cost $157.35 a ton. In Western Australia in that year it was $97 a ton. There was a great variation between the States. From 1964 to 1966 New South Wales farmers paid $125.50 a ton. When the subsidy was introduced and with it the right to control prices, it is interesting to note that prices fell. Great interest was taken in the dumping of urea in Australia. The Bill before the Senate amends the Act to provide that where nitrogenous fertilisers are obviously being dumped the subsidy will not apply. I think this is a very sound practice, in conformity with our general tariff policies. </para>
          <para>I am very interested in the amendment proposed by the Opposition. Obviously this is the right time to offer attractive baits of this type. I appreciate as a farmer that primary producers would be delighted to be able to secure nitrogenous fertilisers with a bounty of $120 a ton, instead of $80 a ton. However, I recall the criticism of </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline>with regard to the superphosphate bounty when the Bill to give it effect was introduced in the Senate only a few weeks ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> complained that the bounty would aggravate the present wheat situation. I am wondering whether that sort of attitude has now gone by the board and would not apply to the Opposition&#39;s suggestion to increase greatly the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty. Presumably the argument is good when you like to use it. </para>
          <para>It is quite interesting to note that the effect of the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty has been most marked in Western Australia. For instance, from 1st July 1967 to 30th June 1968 Western Australia imported 60,734 tons of urea out of a total Australian importation of about 116,000 tons. It was in Western Australia that the effect of urea was most marked in promoting the expansion of our wheat growing areas into the light lands. The Opposition&#39;s proposal would undoubtedly continue that tendency. I think we must treat the proposal as a legitimate electioneering exercise, not carefully thought out with regard to the whole situation of the economy. </para>
          <para>The production of nitrogenous fertilisers has increased and it is a nice exercise in cause and effect to decide whether the increased production resulted in a fall in price which has offset the greater productivity; but it is undoubtedly true that the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty, used with discretion, can and will reduce costs to farmers who perforce need to maintain their places in the industry. I think the bounty is a safeguard to the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers and is beneficial to the economy. It provides a mark to ensure that importers must keep their prices within limits. With the assistance of the bounty a stable position can be maintained in the industry. 1 commend the Government for its efforts to make available to Australian farmers fertilisers comparable in price to that being paid by our competitors in other parts of the world. </para>

            <para>- This is a simple Bill which proposes to continue the existing bounty. This step seems to be necessary for the people in the rural industries who use nitrogenous fertilisers. The Government is to be complimented for introducing legislation before the general election to ensure that the bounty is continued. Otherwise payment of the bounty would cease on 31st October. It is hardly likely that the new Parliament would meet before that date. There seems to be plenty of evidence to justify the continuation of the bounty. No representations have been made by people in the industry, one way or the other, which seems to indicate that they have every confidence that the bounty will be continued. There does not seem to have been any great objection on the ground that the bounty is insufficient, and we would not expect representations from people in the industry that the bounty is too high. That would be too much to expect. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>An attempt has been made in the proposed amendment to relate the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy to the bounty being paid on superphosphate. This attempt does not seem to us to carry very much weight because we are aware that nitrogenous fertilisers are produced in an altogether different manner from that in which superphosphate is produced and must be subject to completely different costs of production. Superphosphate, up to the present, has mostly been imported into Australia. The circumstances of the production of superphosphate for the Australian market could change dramatically in the reasonably near future as I understand there is plenty of evidence to suggest that there are huge deposits of phosphate in this country. The extent to which those deposits have been developed is unknown to me, but their existence has been established. I( is quite likely that the circumstances relating to superphosphate use in Australia will undergo a distinct change. It may not be wise to suggest in a permanent sense that nitrogenous fertilisers that are manufactured should be in any way tied to superphosphate in the application of a bounty calculated to realise the ultimate in production in the rural industries at prices competitive on the world&#39;s markets. This proposal could produce injustices if the philosophy it embraces is accepted as realistic. </para>
          <para>The proposed amendment also suggests that a review be conducted each year of the rate of the subsidy. This suggestion does not seem justified by the evidence that is available. It has not been established that there has been a marked shift in the prices of nitrogenous fertilisers in recent years nor is it likely to occur during the period of 3 years covered by this legislation. Any changes in price have been directed rather towards reductions than towards increases. It is impossible to read into the proposed amendment the purpose for which the review is suggested. It is not clear whether the Australian Labor Party is concerned in proposing the amendment that the subsidy may be too high in the future if the price of nitrogenous fertilisers continues to fall, or whether it believes that the subsidy may be insufficient. A case has not been made out either way. I would be inclined to give the ALP the benefit of the doubt and to believe that it proposed the amendment to ensure that injustice was not done to farmers through increased prices for nitrogenous fertilisers. There is no evidence to substantiate such a case, as the price seems to have been falling. As this is a manufactured product there seems to be every reason why the price should continue to fall while the present trend continues. We believe that the Bill is necessary and are prepared to support it as it stands. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)</inline> indicated on 19th September 1969 that she would make only one second reading speech to cover this measure and the States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Bill (No. 2), and we are debating the two Bills together. The Opposition, whilst not opposing the Bill, is taking the opportunity to be rather critical of the general administration of Aboriginal affairs. On 21st August I placed on the notice paper the following question, which was directed to the Minister representing the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>During the last financial year, what proportion of the Commonwealth grant for Aboriginals was actually spent in establishing such people in their own business or in rural industries, and how many Aboriginals were so assisted. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">On 16th September the Minister provided me with the following answer: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In the 1968-69 Budget,$10m was allocated for an Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account, and of this amount, $5m was set aside in a Commonwealth Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises. In the last financial year, ending 30th June 1969, eighteen loan applications from Aboriginals were approved involving a total of $328,096. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One of the reasons why we are extremely critical of this legislation is that although the referendum giving greater freedom to Aboriginals was carried in 1967 it is now September 1969 and very little indeed has been done. As I advance my argument in this regard I shall provide details of why we feel that the Government has been either sadly misguided or very neglectful of the powers granted to it by the people of this country. As was stated by the Minister, this Budget allocation of $ 10m was divided into two sections. One was to establish people in business or in farming enterprises and the other was to assist generally. Might 1 say that I have had very little success indeed in my endeavours to obtain loans or advances or grants for these people. Of all the cases that I have handled in only one instance were a few sticks of furniture made available to one family. </para>
          <para>I have one outstanding case in which the application of a Torres Strait Islander with considerable qualifications, with war service in the Second World War, and with a grown family for whom he would be able to provide if he received some sort of capital assistance, has been on the stocks for a long period. 1 know of another case in which a full blood Aboriginal applied for a job in the new Department. I would say that he probably had better qualifications than most of those who had previously applied.  His  application was rejected, probably because he was a member of the Australian Labor Party. Probably the same consideration applied to the first case that I cited. That particular individual also happened to be a member of the Labor Party. The amount involved was only about $7,000 but it would have enabled him to obtain a small property and to become no longer a charge on the community. He is unable to get continuous employment and for part of the time has to rely on social services. The business was large enough not only to establish himself but also to keep in employment a grown daughter and son. He is still waiting for the assistance. The family is still picking up casual work and so far as  I  can see he has probably no possibility of getting this property. </para>

          <para class="block">Development of Aborigines&#39; which was directed to the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> in which a quotation was made of a statement previously published by the fairly well known anthropologist, Margaret Mead. Before referring further to this I want to point out that I believe that the Minister personally may have a quite sincere interest in the problems of Aboriginals and when this part-time portfolio was first established  it  was probably quite appropriate that it be given to him. I give that much credit in this regard. But we find that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton),</inline> who wants all power unto himself, taking it over into his Department so that all sorts of shackles have been placed upon the portfolio. Might I say  that  after 25th October, when the general election is held, in accordance with Labor Party policy, under the Labor Government the Office of Aboriginal Affairs will be upgraded to ministerial level and the Commonwealth will assume the ultimate responsibility for Aboriginals and Islanders accorded it by the referendum of 1967. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator is quite garrulous again tonight, is he not?  I  suggest that  he  might enlighten himself on some of the problems associated with Aboriginals and then make a well thought out submission. At a Monash University seminar, &#39;Education of Aborigines 1967&#39;, a paper entitled &#39;Some Problems Facing an Educator in a Programme of Social Change&#39;, was delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline> J. B. Gallagher, Assistant Director of Education, Department of Welfare, Northern Territory. Referring to Margaret Mead he stated: </para>

            <para>Her comments are typical of the judgments that have been made that are very pertinent to the Northern Territory. She says: </para>
            <para>For many years schooling was not only ineffective, but also disruptive, because it applied only to the young. Roles were reversed in the homes, so that children became the teachers of the parents, creating confusion in relationships, and resentment on the part of the displaced leaders. A &#39;younger&#39; generation in conflict with an &#39;older* generation was created where there had been no such categories. In some societies, where the structuring of authority was felt strongly, the responsibility placed on the young to teach the old created unsupportable conflict for them. Children, taught at school not to spit on the floor, to take baths regularly, to be  inoculated against epidemics, lived in homes which taught the opposite. Wilh the new conception of education as covering all areas of living came the recognition of society as the unit to be educated. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Whilst we are not specifically referring to the lack of education made available to Aboriginals generally, 1 think even Government supporters would realise that over the last 20 years that it has been in office the Government has made no real contribution to the integration or the assimilation or even the development of the people who originally peopled this country. It is even worse than that, because when these additional powers were granted by the people the Government set out on a planning exercise that very obviously has fallen short in many respects. 1 think it was the Minister who said in a second reading speech that we must take these things carefully. I shall refer to the speech later in generally rather critical terms. Government supporters are aware, as I am, that awards apply to these people in territories controlled by the Commonwealth and also in Western Australia and Queensland. It is significant that the Government has sided with the employers, particularly the absentee landlords, the owners of the vast pastoral properties of the Territory in particular. </para>

              <para>- As my colleague from Western Australia has said, in Western Australia too. This applies also in Queensland where sub-standard wages and working conditions are the rule rather than the exception. There has been a resistance to payment of the increased wages as provided for in the new awards and all sorts of loopholes have been found for avoiding payment of proper wages. Honourable senators will recall also that it is in the pastoral industry that so many of these people seek a subsistence - not a living; they merely exist from day to day. As Captain <inline font-weight="bold">Major, one</inline> of the Gurindjis, said on one occasion: &#34;There has been a big improvement in our living conditions. The bosses are now giving us salt with our corned beef. </para>

          <para class="block">This is quite true. But the point that I am trying to make in this regard is that in these examples that have been taken out one would assume from what has been said that the only cattle stations concerned are sixteen in the Kimberley area of Western Australia and, apparently, twenty-three station properties in the Northern Territory. If the inspectors are required by the Department to visit only those properties, why are they not going around to every station property to ensure that the award is carried out in its entirety? Is it because  they have inspected the other places and are not prepared to state the truth about them? Any person with normal intelligence - that would include <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> - who wants to go about this area can carry out a personal inspection if he wants to do so, provided that he is not caught up by the shotguns of some of the station managers. If an inspection or a proper interrogation of people is carried out the reply to that question will bc completely disproved because it is not true. </para>

          <para>How the indigenous people on settlements are expected to learn is beyond my understanding, when one looks at the neglect to these people, especially in Queensland and Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>In Queensland, enrolment is presented to the indigenous people as being a step towards citizenship. However, Aborigines and Islanders are hesitant to enrol because they believe it means they will have to leave the settlements. Few people in the main stream of society realise what this entails. It means that if the indigenous people arc considered able to exercise the vote, they are expected to stand alone in the main stream of society, by virtue of exemption from the settlements, which brings about an abrupt change from the governmental paternalistic, misguided &#39;Great White Father&#39; attitudes to what Governments really believe is complete freedom of thought and action. The indigenous people are ill-equipped to stand up to the fast running stream of the Australian society, because they are given only a bare knowledge of the Australian society; within the settlements a lack of knowledge of education, housing, health and wages, takes its toll of the people. </para>
          <para>The end result of this policy is a further swelling of the ranks of the fringe dwellers, where indigenous people exist under the gloom of rejection, starvation and further frustration. </para>
          <para class="block">Might 1 interpose at this stage to say that although it has been suggested that the criticism that has been levelled at the recent Four Corners&#39; interpretation of conditions in the south west Queensland area around Cunnamulla was completely unjustified, the conditions of the fringe dwellers in this area are parallel with the conditions of the fringe dwellers in almost every town and city in this country. The conditions at Cunnamulla are exactly as they were painted, despite the findings of the local people and the Queensland Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Walker</inline> continued: </para>
          <para>Unless sensible, logical policies are implemented in all fields on the settlements, the majority of indigenous people are doomed to die  on  the fringe of Australian society without ever having entered the main stream, because of the misguided laws that at present prevent them from learning about the true situation of the Australian way of life. </para>

          <para>Work for the removal of Government welfare departments and administrators behind the boomerang curtain. Work also to retain for your own use the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island settlements in Australia. This land is yours, hold on to it. </para>
          <para>To the Aboriginal delegates of this FCAATSI conference may  1  suggest that you go back from this conference wilh the purpose  of  uniting your own people and to encourage them  to  seek out the laws they consider are detrimental  to  their welfare and advancement and to raise your voices outside the offices of the various departments where such laws are made and implemented. Don&#39;t wait or leave it to the white man to do your protesting for you. Gather your own people around you and if we can bend the ears of the Aborigines selected to represent us in the Federal office of Aboriginal Affairs, then let us charge them with the responsibility of protesting for us, on our behalf. </para>
          <para>When you leave this Conference and go back to your rat holes- rat holes you call homes, that you have inherited from the Australian society -unite your people and bring them out fighting. </para>
          <para class="block">If that is the so-called black power and if they are the words of an agitator, as some people might call her, those words were uttered with very great justification because of what we have done to these people since June 1770 in Queensland and earlier elsewhere. </para>
          <para>For years we have kept a record of our sheep and cattle population. Farmers are prosecuted if they do not supply the correct figures. Yet, in spite of the fact that we are now entitled to count these people with non-white skins in the census, we still have not an accurate record of how many full blood Aboriginals or part Aboriginals this country has. I repeat that we do keep an accurate record of our pig, cattle and sheep populations. All sorts of estimates of the Aboriginal population have been made. Suggestions have been made that it is somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000. That is approximately 100,000 fewer than were here when Captain Cook first landed here. </para>

              <para>-  I want to answer that interjection because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse</inline> belongs to that group of people in this community who have completely exploited the Aboriginal people, taken child endowment payments from the children because they are non-white, taken age pension payments from the aged people because they cannot fight and taken maternity allowances from the mothers. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse</inline> approves of that sort of thing, there are many Australians who are not proud of it or of him. </para>

          <para>We keep these Aboriginal people on reserves which are virtually wild life sanctuaries. If a person is a tourist with dollars to spend he will be taken <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> a tourist bus to see them; he will be allowed to buy a few trinkets; he will be allowed to look at them in their so-called primitive state; and he might even see a corroboree. If he is a developer in the mineral field he will be allowed to exploit the land and to dispose of things that these people have held religiously sacred for hundreds and hundreds of years. But if a person wants to go on to a reserve in order to find out what their living conditions are, to find out what the disease rate is or to help these people, he will be refused permission, as Stan Davey was recently by the Western Australian Government. This man, who is a pastor of a Christian church, was refused permission to enter a reserve because the Government and those who guide it were ashamed of what he would find. </para>
          <para>In fact, figures have been quoted by people in authority in recent years to prove that yaws, leprosy and other highly contagious diseases are worse in the Kimberleys region than anywhere in the Asian area. Aboriginals represent approximately 1% of the Australian population. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse</inline> will check that figure later. Although they represent a very small section of the population, 10% of the deaths of all children under the age of 1 year are of non-white children, and 28% of the deaths of children of 1 year and over are of non-white children. This is an indictment of the Government and of the Australian society. Almost all of these deaths result from causes that could have been prevented or diseases that could have been eliminated. The infant mortality rate in some sections of the Northern Territory and other parts of northern Australia is as high as 145. The comparable figure for children of European descent is 19 or 20. </para>

          <para>I refer now to the speech made by the Minister for Housing. This is one of the greatest whitewash speeches ever presented in this chamber or in any parliament in the Western world. It is so sanctimonious that one would have thought it was written by a  minister of  religion - and that is no reflection on ministers of religion. The Minister said very sanctimoniously:   . . the Commonwealth conceives that it has a particularly important role towards Aboriginal citizens within its responsibility for Australians generally. </para>
          <para class="block">I might say for the Minister&#39;s benefit that I do not believe that she wrote this speech; but had I been in her position I would have thrown it out; I certainly would not have presented it to the Parliament. She went on to say: </para>

            <para>Indeed, I do not believe that it is possible to achieve either of these two objectives in isolation. Social independence cannot be effectively exercised unless it is built upon a secure economic foundation. Conversely, economic independence can end in frustration and contradiction unless the social infrastructure exists to sustain it in the eyes both of the Aboriginals themselves and of other Australians. We seek, therefore, to advance on each of these two fronts simultaneously. </para>

            <para>The guiding concept of the Fund is to provide capital and technical help for individual Aboriginals or groups of Aboriginals who wish to undertake productive enterprises which are or have prospects of becoming successful. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">My colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline> if he speaks in this debate, will be able to tell honourable senators of an enterprise for which he is endeavouring to obtain some money but for which money has not been forthcoming. I propose to refer specifically to Queensland and to show how the Government has doled out this fantastic sum of money. At Lock.hardt River there is a hospital complex that will cost $91,248. In the northern peninsula area of the Torres Strait Islands 42 houses are proposed to be built and 53 houses in the country centres, a total of 95 houses. This is a tremendous contribution towards rehousing of Aboriginals with the money the Government has available. I remember that when I raised this matter here last year, I think it was on the debate on the Estimates, I complained about the lack of housing on Horn Island and at Bamaga and Thursday Island. Do honourable senators know what the Minister said on that occasion? She said: &#39;But have you seen the hibiscus and frangipani trees? They are nicely laid out&#39;. As one of my colleagues on this side interjected: &#39;Yes, but you cannot sleep under frangipani trees&#39;. </para>
          <para>At the Mitchell River a similar hospital complex is to be built. I do not know why there is a difference between these two costings, because while the Lockhardt River complex is to cost $91,000 the Mitchell River complex is only to cost $41,000. Then the first stage of the Bamaga complex is to cost $83,000. A dental clinic and equipment at Bamaga is to cost $12,500 and the same thing at Woorabinda is to cost the same amount. But we are going to be really good to the 6,000 people in the Torres Strait islands who have never had proper dental treatment. We are going to make sure that they have two dentists and two technicians for 4 months to work in the Torres Strait and peninsula area. They will probably be dealing with 15,000 to 20,000 people and in this limited time they will attend to their dental wants. Then we are to have supplementary food assistance for 1,445 children at Weipa, Arukun, Edward River, Mitchell River, Mornington Island, Doomadgee, Lockhart River, Hope ValeBloomfield, Yarrabah, Palm Island, Woorabinda, Cherbourg and other centres. We are going to be so generous as to spend $74,000. Is this all that we can afford to spend in this area on all these government settlements? </para>
          <para>Of course, this expenditure will be supplemented by the Queensland Government, but it is too busy drilling for oil on the Barrier Reef to be able to spend much money on these sort of things. Then, in regard to education we are going to construct and equip schools at Bamaga and Palm Island at a cost of $240,000. The construction of the school at Palm Island is in the process of being carried out. There is one decent sport&#39;s ground on the island and this is a recreation area which the 1,200 people on this island have used for many years but because of the short-sightedness of this Department and the State Aboriginal and Island Affairs Department, the school is being built in the middle of the recreation area with the result that the 1,200 people now incarcerated on this island have no chance at all of having any sort of a recreation area. But it is pounds to peanuts, or these days perhaps dollars to donuts that it will never be built. </para>
          <para>With due respect I would submit that this is the view of the Government as expressed in this publication I have here. I am not quite sure whether it is an official publication of the Liberal Party or not. It is a magazine called &#39;Shipping, Coal, Metals, The Harbour&#34; and I intend to quote from an article headed &#39;Current Comment*. This is an editorial in 1969 and these are so-called responsible white people saying these things in a respectable business publication. </para>

The States in fact, in their time have tried almost everything Aboriginals are now demanding, including the opportunity to nin their own affairs. Governor Macquarie in the second decade of the nineteenth century, established a school for Abo children, gave them boats, land, agricultural implements, clothes, even decorations.

          <para class="block">Island.  If  any honourable senator on the Government side wants to go and look at this  at  first hand I have no doubt that he will probably be given permission. I mentioned Weipa a moment ago and I have here a statement prepared by the research section of my party. It has been properly investigated under the supervision of witnesses and this is in fact what has happened. Honourable senators will recall that a moment ago I mentioned what the mining companies can do. This is what they have done to the Aboriginals on Cape York Peninsula, according to the statement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In the 1957 agreement on Weipa bauxite, the company agreed to establish the township and harbour facilities at their own cost. </para>
            <para>The Agreement Act was amended in 1965 and these amenities were then provided by the Government at a total cost to Queensland of about $12 million. </para>
            <para>Both are supposedly recoverable but no payments have been made. It appears that the company is paying a meagre 2.5 per cent of the total capital outlay for the annual use of the wharf facilities. </para>
            <para>In 1957 the company talked of a 5,000 township in five years and a 10-15,000 city in 10 years. After 10 years the township for only 370 people was built at our expense. </para>
            <para>Senior company and Government authorities forecast an alumina plant in operation near Weipa by 1966. This has not occurred. . . . </para>
            <para>Trade training and full employment was promised for Aborigines on the mission at Weipa. There has been no trade training and employment opportunities are decreasing. All Aborigines are employed on unskilled work. </para>
            <para>A similar promise of single barracks for Aborigine workers has not eventuated. Weipa is a segregated community - Weipa North and Weipa South. Hie Aborigines live in one township and the Europeans in the other. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Last year when we on the Opposition side of the chamber were critical about the segregation in the schools, the Minister said that black children went to one school and white children went to another because it costs too much to transport them and that is why they are attending segregated schools - although the Minister did not admit even that they were segregated. The statement continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The company paid $300,000 to the mission to construct the Aborigine township of 62 homes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Remember that figure. The statement continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The Government spent $4m on 52 homes for the European section. Despite the small population there arc two schools - one for Aborigines and the other for Europeans. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I mentioned the schools a moment ago. The company spent 5300,000 for 62 homes for Aboriginals as compared with $4m spent by the Government on 10 fewer homes - and $4m is almost the total allocation for the welfare of Aboriginals throughout the country. If the Government has any excuse I want to hear it and I want to see it in writing and signed in triplicate, otherwise f will not believe it. </para>
          <para>Palm Island, with its 1,200 people, in the Great Palm group off the east coast of this country probably would be comparable with St Helena and other islands on which gaols were established in the past. About 300 young people on the Island under 21 have no jobs, nowhere to go and are not in receipt of social services. One Aboriginal among the 1,200 receives an award wage. When I say that the wage rates paid at Bamaga are far better, you will realise what kind of wages are paid at Palm Island. I would like the Government to say how a man can keep a wife and 3, 4 or 5 children on $8 or $10 a week. That is about half the age pension. The Island has a store, but no reduced prices apply. I do not blame the management on the Island. They are the victims of a system. They are doing their best in most difficult circumstances. I spoke to one of the officials in charge of the settlement and he said that they try to keep their prices in line with mainland prices but that now and again they go a bit above those prices - and that the money comes out of the Aboriginal Welfare Trust Fund anyway. It is true that now the very small children there have a vitamin enriched meal. It is equally true that people, whichever way we look at it, must suffer from malnutrition. </para>
          <para>I shall give some examples of what happens on the Island. A person can be punished by being sent to Palm Island; a person can be punished by being sent off it. No-one is allowed to take liquor to the Island. Yet only a few months ago an Aboriginal was fined for stealing liquor on the Island. Who owned the liquor? One of the white officials owned it. If it is good enough for the Aboriginals on the Island to be prevented from having liquor, it is good enough for the white people on the Island to be prevented from having it also. There ought to be one rule for all. There is segregated schooling here. It is not as bad as it was in the past, but five or six children of European descent have the benefit of one teacher. Why should there be segregation? The parents of the other white children are prepared to let their children be taught by teachers at the school attended by Aboriginals. I wish to mention another case. I intended to mention the man&#39;s name, but 1 will not because of the victimisation of anybody from the Island who dares to make a statement to anybody. I asked this man what he wanted to do with his children. He said: &#39;1 hope they get off Palm Island and I hope they never come back&#39;. </para>
          <para>Another case is that of a girl who failed her Junior examination. She had attended a school on the mainland. She begged for an opportunity to go back and repeat that year. She was refused. This would not have cost the Government much money. I doubt that it would have cost the Government $200 to let that child repeat her Junior year. She should have been allowed to repeat it. This is the kind of action which ought to have been taken but which was not taken. There is no trade training. There is no apprenticeship school. This Government settlement is the same as every other Government settlement in my home State. Tradesmen on the Island are always flat out keeping up with maintenance work. One tradesman to whom I spoke recently has since left the Island. Most of the school teachers are glad when their tour of duty on the Island ceases. They do not want to stay there because of the restrictions imposed. </para>
          <para>Another case is that of an expert bulldozer driver who went to the mainland because he had some disagreement with those in control on the Island. On the mainland he was unable to secure employment. I will not make direct accusations about why he was not allowed back on the Island, but he was not, even though his wife was pregnant and expecting her fourth or fifth child. At the time I did not know this, but apparently the man committed some misdemeanour and was in trouble with the law on the mainland. As far as I knew he was a man of comparatively good character, but he found himself in trouble with the police. He was told that the reason why he was not allowed back on the Island was because his wife did not want him. When she came to the mainland to be confined for the birth of her child I went to see her. She said she wantedto see her husband. I was not able to get him back on the Island, but 1 was able to get her and the 1 month old child, whom the father had not seen, to visit him on the mainland. What kind of inhuman monsters are we in 1969 when we prevent a father from seeing his son, when we prevent a father from seeing his wife and family? </para>
          <para>Recently four people, all of whom have relatives on the Island, have come to my office. None of them is allowed on the Island. None of them has a police record. Even if they had a police record, they should be allowed visit the Island. Would any people in this community deny a white man an opportunity to see his family? Would they prevent him from travelling over 30 or 40 miles of water to see his family? They would not, because there would be a revolution if they tried. But because these people are black we are not afraid. The mental atmosphere in which we live is the same as that of the last century when we got rid of such problems by using guns, poisoned wells and poisoned food, when station owners and others shot little coloured children and said: &#39;They will not worry us in the next generation&#39;. Someone has to speak on behalf of these people. The Government must have a conscience. Admittedly it has only 3 or 4 weeks left as a government, but at least it could initiate some of the reforms that are necessary. I do not want to appeal to hearts in white people that are tinged with black because the Government is not prepared to do something. In this so called Christian community such matters should be of concern to every one of us. We are not worried about the mortality rate of infant black children. We are not worried about mothers dying in confinement because they do not receive proper medical attention. We are not worried about families having to live on $7 or $8 a week - and there are hundreds in this category, not just a few. We are not worried about station owners who, to use a typical Australian term, knock off endowment money and knock off age pensions. They are doing it still. If the Minister says that they are not he is misinformed sadly or he is playing drastically with the truth because it is happening still in the Northern </para>
          <para class="block">Territory. Western Australia and north Queensland. So-called respectable members of the community still pay a couple of dollars a week and tucker to people working on their farms, not for a 35 or 40-hour week but in many instances for a 60-hour week. </para>
          <para>Although these Bills give a little to the Aboriginals, a lot more ought to be given. If by some unfortunate circumstance this Government is returned, it ought to examine its conscience and its policies. </para>

            <para>- The purpose of this Bill is to grant $5. 4m, divided among the States, in the current year for Aboriginal welfare. The problems of Aboriginals have raised great difficulties over the years. Until 1967 the Commonwealth&#39;s power to deal with them was very limited. The Constitution provided: </para>

The people of any race, other than the Aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws; </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The Commonwealth complacently hid behind the principle that the onus lay upon the States to make laws for the Aboriginals. The Aboriginals came within the laws of the Commonwealth as they applied to any citizen in Australia but the Commonwealth had no power to make special laws for them in the same sense that it had power to make special laws for another group of a particular race in Australia. in 1967 this matter was submitted by referendum to the people of Australia. While they are traditionally opposed to alterations of the Constitution, they overwhelmingly voted to delete from the Constitution the words &#39;other than the Aboriginal race in any State&#39;. That vote opened the door for the Commonwealth to deal with the problems of the Aboriginal race. The Commonwealth now has power to make special laws for Aboriginals. When that power was given by the referendum it was thought that the Commonwealth would take over the sole control of the welfare of the Aboriginal population and that if it were necessary to make a special law, as distinct from a general law applying to all Australian citizens, the Commonwealth could do so because it was now invested with the power to make such a law relating to Aboriginals. </para>
          <para>We have been somewhat dismayed that since 1967 the Commonwealth has not used its power to make special laws for Aboriginals and still leaves it to the States to provide the administration of this section of the community. This is quite contrary to the intention of the Australian people who voted in the referendum. This Bill seeks to grant $5.4m to be spent on Aboriginal advancement and welfare on the condition that the States make matching grants for the same purpose. Of course, the States are battling for finance. If they are unable to make matching grants for the same purpose the Commonwealth then will not be interested in the welfare and advancement of the Aboriginals in the States. The Commonwealth is not accepting its responsibility but is showing the States that it is prepared only equally to finance their activities in this field. If a State finds it is unable to make a matching grant, then the Aboriginals in that State will not benefit. </para>

          <para>About 7 years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> D. Nichols was appointed to the Native Welfare Department at Yuendumu, about 130 miles from Alice Springs, as a motor mechanic. He was previously employed for 3 years in the Public Service with the Department of Civil Aviation. He took the job of motor mechanic at Yuendumu in Central Australia on an Aboriginal settlement where there are about 800 Aboriginals and about 30 white employees. He was acting manager at Yuendumu from 9th December 1963 to 11th February 1964 during the absence of the manager. Although his wife is not a trained or qualified teacher she was employed in the settlement school in an attempt to make up the deficiencies in the teaching staff until 1966, when a new welfare officer was appointed. From that time the treatment of Aboriginals by the new superintendent of the school met with the disapproval of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nichols,</inline> who strongly complained about it. In 1968 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nichols</inline> was dismissed from the Department. </para>
          <para>The dismissal took the form of offering <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nichols</inline> a transfer to Darwin or to Hookey Creek, some distance away. Acting on medical advice, he was not prepared to accept a transfer, firstly because he wanted to stay at Yuendumu, and secondly because his wife was in ill health, suffering  from a nervous complaint. She had got on very well with the Aboriginals and medical advice was that a transfer would be detrimental to her health. Because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nichols</inline> refused to transfer he was finally dismissed on 24th January 1969. He claimed that he was victimised. Of course, this is one of the most frequent claims in respect of dismissal and one of the most difficult to prove. Nevertheless, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nichols</inline> was dismissed the native people, because they thought so much of him, went on strike for a number of days. The strike was finally settled. A certificate was presented from a government medical officer to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Nichols</inline> would be better in health if she were transferred. However, the natives believed that Nichols was being sent away from the camp because of the humane treatment he had given them at Yuendumu. He was a barrier for the natives against the harsh tyrannical treatment of the superintendent. </para>
          <para>As a result of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nichols&#39;</inline> representations to me I asked of the Minister a series of questions which became Nos 1174 and 1177 on the notice paper. In question No. 1177 1 asked: </para>

              <para>In January 1966 were ten Aboriginal girls in their early teens at Yuendumu native settlement accused by the superintendent of having broken into an old disused store and, without a trial, compelled as a punishment to pick up stones from the roadway and place them in drums at the side of the road? </para>

            <para>Ten teenage Aboriginal girls, several of them married admitted breaking and entering into a cottage occupied by an Aboriginal family, entering an unoccupied staff residence and breaking louvres in the pre-school and infant welfare centre. These offences occurred during the weekend of 8th and 9th January 1966. Several of the girls had been involved in conduct of an undisciplined nature on an earlier occasion. Because of their age and problems of transport to and accommodation al Alice Springs, the superintendent decided that the best course of action was to discuss the behaviour of the girls with their husbands and parents rather than referring the matter to the police in the first instance. The guardians of the girls had previously suggested that the girls be sent to Ernabella Mission or to Areyonga settlement. The superintendent considered this action too drastic and the husbands and parents concerned agreed that the problem should be dealt with by disciplinary action within the settlement Each girl was given the task of picking up pebbles from the roadway outside the settlement office and placing them in drums provided. This task was allotted because it was not arduous and the girls were working where the superintendent could exercise some supervision. </para>

If you find it embarrassing for yourself or for the Government you support, I suggest that you have the right to reply because I am just leading up to describing the treatment that we are meting out to Aboriginals, lt warrants some consideration. Even monetary consideration of $5.4m will not compensate for the treatment meted out to them. Until now I have put the favourable impression. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nichols,</inline> who obviously feels somewhat aggrieved about the dismissal, has posed a number of questions which I have asked in the Senate.

            <para>During the morning, some of the girls who hadn&#39;t arrived for this task were rounded up with the Landrover, one I saw being driven up from camp like an animal. I gathered that a certain amount of resentment was being built up among the natives over the treatment of these girls, so I decided to speak to the Superintendent about the matter. On seeing him in the office a little after 1 p.m. I asked him how long it was going to continue, his answer being: &#39;As long as it pleases me, so what are you going to do about it?&#39; With these words plus the sarcasm used, I lost my temper, I told him that if it didn&#39;t cease I would report it to the welfare. officials and if it continued after this, I would not hesitate to report it to a newspaper, as I understand this to be a welfare settlement not a penal settlement. I also asked him to get the Assistant Director out, which he refused to do. I also asked what authority he had to set himself up as prosecutor, judge and jury when he did not keep within the law himself ... 1 also pointed out that the offence committed by these girls was more in the line of mischief, which stems from lack of employment and interest, than any criminal intent and it would bc better to endeavour to have them suitably employed, as punishment of this kind is really mental cruelty and only builds up a resentment against staff, without any real benefit being obtained, also ii he considered the offence serious it should have been reported to the police so the girls would have got a hearing according to law. On leaving the office I told the girls if they left, as they had every right to do, as they weren&#39;t being paid and slave labour was abolished many years ago, I would do all in my power to see that they weren&#39;t penalised. Two of them were immediately taken away by Kenny Jungari and another by David Jabarula, these having some family connection. The others started to leave- </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nichols</inline>went on to recite how he decided to speak to the Superintendent. The Minister stated in reply that some of the girls were married women. They may have been tribal marriages, but I believe that their ages ranged from  12  to  15  years.

If this form of punishment was the decision of the husbands and parents of these girls, why did at least a dozen Aboriginals approach me and ask me to intervene and why were there three of the men waiting at the office to take their girls away when I did finally intervene? If the Superintendent was within his rights and had .the support of the Aboriginals, why did this punishment cease immediately upon my intervention? </para>

Consider whether this is favourable treatment of the girls. He states that six Aboriginal males were directed with the approval of the superintendent to round up three girls and as punishment for an offence take them out to the bush to be continually raped.

If there is an inquiry which will permit the 30 employees - these are not Aboriginal staff - to be put on oath and be secure against any victimisation, the whole story of Yuendumu will be revealed to the public.

The Minister can never find out the true position by inquiry from officers of his Department. If we have as the Minister stated in the second reading speech, any interest in native welfare, it is not so much a question of money as a question of proper treatment. The challenge has been laid down. Will there be a full, frank public inquiry into the allegations that have been made? Will there be an assurance of no victimisation of those who may give evidence before the inquiry? Can we find out what is happening at Yuendumu before we talk about what the Commonwealth is doing for the Aboriginal people? </para>

            <para>- by leave  -  I propose to make a statement on behalf of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> relating to the Fill aircraft. I do so in the name of the Prime Minister. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This House will know that the Government recently sent a high level mission to the United States to discuss matters concerning FI 1 1 aircraft. That mission has now submitted its report to the Government and the Government has considered it. However, before detailing the matters discussed and the conclusions reached, there is one matter which I believe should be made clear. </para>
          <para>Because of the great publicity which has been given to any accident in which any Fill aircraft has been involved there has grown up a feeling that the aircraft is itself unsafe. The record shows that this belief is simply not true. The United States Air Force fleet of Fill aircraft have now been flying for a total of more than 40,000 hours, including more than 25,000 hours in the operational command, and now has an accident record better, for example, than the Super Sabre or the Phantom and better than any other F Century series of aircraft. On the record, the aircraft is not unsafe and this should be known. </para>
          <para>The matters discussed by the mission related to the aircraft&#39;s range, its weapons load, the assurance of a continuing supply of spare parts during its service life, and the fatigue performance of the wing carry through box. Our military advisers are completely satisfied that the range and weapons load of the aircraft will meet the requirements of the Royal Australian Air Force, as set down when the decision to order the aircraft was made. It will do the job which the Air Force wanted an aircraft to do. They are also completely satisfied that there will continue to be a full availability of spares, readily available, during the full period of service of the aircraft with the RAAF. </para>
          <para>Furthermore, our advice is that the FI 11, both in practice and during operations, has demonstrated a capacity to deliver a bomb load in any weather condition with unprecedented accuracy, whether the target can be seen or not. For this purpose it is the best aircraft in the world, and our military advisers after evaluating other possible aircraft types tell us that there is not in being or in prospect any aircraft that would approach the already demonstrated performance of the FIJI us a strike aircraft of the kind the RAAF requires. </para>
          <para>The Government believes that the RAAF must have an ultra-modern bomber strike aircraft to replace the Canberras which are now the RAAF&#39;s only strike force. The Government knows that the Canberras are approaching the limit of their service life. And the considerations which 1 have set out above all point to the FI 1 1 as the best aircraft to be this replacement, without exception. </para>
          <para>But there remains the problem of the fatigue performance of the wing carrythrough box. This has been a matter of concern to us because it indicates that we would not get the length of service from the aircraft which we require, or anything approaching it; and our concern has been snared by the United States Air Force, although the United States already has over 120 Fill aircraft operating with the present wing box. </para>
          <para>As a result of this concern two matters are in progress. Firstly, the wing box which gave an insufficiently long life under test has been modified as a result of information gained and is to begin a new series of fatigue tests next month. Secondly, more far-reaching activity has been undertaken to overcome the fatigue problems identified as limiting the service life of the aircraft. Action taken has been comprehensive and has included the participation of groups of technical experts from universities, industry and Government all participating in detailed reviews of the test results and proposed actions to resolve those technical problems. These groups have been assisted by Australian structural experts. </para>
          <para>As a result of these investigations, a new design of the wing carry-through box is under way and it is intended that this new design will be fitted to Fill aircraft by 1972. But, of course, the new design box, which our mission has advised us it confidently expects to be successful, has not yet been in practice. The question posed now is whether we should accept our F1 1 ls with the modified wing box which is due to begin testing next month. If we do it is expected that this box will give our Fills a longer service life than the present wing box but not the length of service life we require. Modifications seen to be required would be made lo the wing boxes already fitted to our aircraft without additional charge to the RAAF. </para>
          <para>The Government has decided that, provided the modified wing box to be tested next month lives up to expectations, we should accept the aircraft. This, however, is conditional on an agreement which has been reached that whatever is needed to finally overcome the wing box problem will be incorporated in our aircraft at the appropriate time and at no increase to the ceiling price under the formula applicable to the purchase of our aircraft. That is to say that unless the modified wing box we now propose to accept meets the endurance requirements for which it is designed, the USAF will replace it with the new design box to be available in 1972 - again with no increase to the ceiling price under the formula applicable to the purchase of our aircraft. </para>
          <para>A further safeguard is the agreement that should one or more of the wing boxes we now propose to accept become unserviceable due to a design deficiency before the new design wing box is ready for fitting, then the United States will replace those boxes at no cost to us - and as often as may be necessary until the new wing box is available for fitting. </para>
          <para>As a result of these agreements we have therefore decided to accept delivery of our Fills as soon as the fatigue tests to begin next month have proved successful. We believe that in so doing we will be greatly strengthening the defence capacity of Australia and that the remaining problems of the aircraft which is not one of safety but of service life will have been overcome by the arrangements to fit new boxes or replacement boxes until the new boxes are ready. </para>
          <para>I believe I should, in this statement, remind honourable members that the arrangement made with the USAF for those aircraft was that the ceiling cost was to be $5.95m plus escalation of labour costs and materials after 1965, modification requested by the RAAF, and improvement modification proposed by the USAF and accepted by the RAAF. The combined effect of this item will approximate $1.5m per aircraft. I would also add that the United States Air Force has decided to go to a RF111A version for the reconnaissance aircraft and that this decision now makes it possible for the RAAF to proceed to a reconnaissance version of the F111C, as originally contemplated, which will be common with the reconnaissance aircraft in the USAF inventory. Before the Government makes a decision on this matter the Government would require far more information as to cost. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline>hope the House and the country will agree that our Air Force needs a strike bomber most effective in operations. I hope they will accept the advice of our military experts that the Fill is far and away the best such bomber available. And I believe they will agree our acceptance of the bomber, subject to the conditions I have set out, will be a powerful addition to our capacity to defend ourselves in need. </para>

          <para>- This matter arose out of an incident on Thursday night. As honourable senators will recall, some statements which were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> were regarded as objectionable and honourable senators took objection to the remarks. A withdrawal of a certain statement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield,</inline> and then another statement was made. Then, after the taking of various courses that are detailed in the record of the Senate, the matter was resumed and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> ultimately made a complete withdrawal and an unreserved apology. </para>

            <para>-  I am speaking pursuant to the leave that was granted to me by the Senate. I can think of no higher authority in this chamber than the decision of the Senate itself. The Senate has given me leave to speak on a matter of privilege. The matter having reached the stage to which I have referred, I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> whether she apologised unreservedly. She said &#39;Yes&#39; and made certain other remarks to which it is perhaps better not to refer. I then said: &#39;This will be regarded as an end to it&#39; - meaning an end to the incident. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Now we find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> has been reported in newspapers circulating throughout the States of Victoria and Queensland as saying something which is offensive to the dignity of the Senate and which undermines the basis of the practice that we have in this chamber of withdrawal and apology. What she said was: The Senate can compel you to apologise, but they cannot compel you to mean it&#39;. Apart from other remarks which were repetitious of what had been said in this chamber and which may be objectionable on the basis of wise rulings that have been given to the effect that when a matter has been ended by withdrawal that is an end of it, the statement &#39;The Senate can compel you to apologise, but they cannot compel you to mean it&#39; is subversive of the whole conduct of the Senate. </para>
        <para>If the honourable senator was correctly reported - 1 trust, that she will be given an opportunity to say whether she has been or not - she seems to be saying of herself that she was insincere. Apart from whatever reflection she may make upon herself, it is an undermining of this institution if, having withdrawn her remarks and apologised for them to the Senate, she goes out and says, in effect: &#39;What does it matter? I have apologised and given an undertaking but they can&#39;t make me mean it:. </para>

            <para>- As I recall the course of the proceedings, the Senate did not require <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> to do so at all. What happened was that she made a statement and I said that it was insufficient and that if it were not an unreserved apology I would move a motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> said that she had already withdrawn and apologised. What happened was that she said that she herself would withdraw and apologise and avoid the Senate having to compel her to withdraw and apologise. </para>

        <para>I do not think that kind of approach to the matter would commend itself to anyone. Here is a simple position. I hope that it will be accepted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield,</inline> after what might be regarded as some prevarication, said that she would unreservedly withdraw and unreservedly apologise. Now she has gone outside the Senate, if the reports are correct, and said: &#39;The Senate can compel you to apologise, but they cannot compel you to mean it&#39;. </para>

            <para>-  This is a very serious matter. It seems to mc that if the reports are correct, on the face of it. a grave offence against the Senate has been committed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield.</inline> 1 think she should have every opportunity to answer to the Senate and to explain to the Senate. No-one can do that better than she can. I do not think there will be any lack of opportunity for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> to explain her remarks. That is one of the reasons why I am speaking now. I think she should tell us why, after saying that she unreservedly withdrew and unreservedly apologised, she went outside the Senate and made these statements. By her interjection now, as I understand it, she seems to accept the truth of the reports. </para>

I do not think we ought to do that if we can avoid it. Here is something that has happened in the presence of us all. We know what happened on Thursday night. If the Press statements are correct, we know what was said outside the Parliament. We do not want unnecessarily to go through the procedure of sending this matter to the Committee on Privileges, unless that is desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield.</inline> For myself - and, I would think, for most of us here - I want to see that the proper procedures are observed. </para>

        <para>I believe that the honourable senator should be asked to give any explanation or apology that she thinks fit. It seems to me that if she has been correctly reported, and subject to whatever explanation she may give, what she has done amounts to a breach of privilege of the Senate, a contempt of the Senate and an undermining of the proper practices and procedures by which any body such as this ought to be conducted. I would like to see this Senate insist upon a proper regard for its procedures. We cannot have a senator making an apology and then going outside the Senate and in effect saying that it was insincere and stating: &#39;Well, they can tell you to do it but I do nol have to mean it&#39;. &#93; would like to see her frankly, properly and decently make a meaningful apology to the Senate. One would like to think that it would be accepted, and 1 suggest that since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> has indicated that she would like the Senate to know why it was done, she should be given the opportunity of saying why it was done. I would think that the Senate might then consider its course. The Senate having heard her, 1 would ask that I should have the opportunity of speaking and, if necessary, of moving a substantive motion. </para>

The point of order I raise, and I raise it with some sense of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has said, is that in view of the seriousness of the allegations made, a person ought not to be called upon to make any statement with regard to a serious charge unless the gravamen of that charge has been established. Inasmuch as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has by leave raised a matter of privilege, 1 would respectfully submit that he should move a substantive motion on the issue of privilege. 1 understand that there was a ruling which is referred to in an authoritative work which has been published by the  Clerk  of the Senate, that in times past it has been accepted that when an issue of privilege is raised the person who raises the matter of privilege should conclude with a substantive motion.

            <para>- I again rise lo order. I ask wilh ail respect - and I say this because an issue of privilege has been raised, one of the most vital matters with which this .Senate can concern itself - whether it is proper that a point of privilege be raised and a person be called upon to answer the point of privilege unless the substantive charge has been disclosed. With all respect, I would ask for a ruling as to whether any senator can be called upon to put himself or herself in that position. As I understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> what has been raised was raised outside this Senate. If persons feel aggrieved they can take action and they may rely upon anything which is said inside or outside this Senate. I think it is highly dangerous for the Senate to permit a procedure to develop until it knows what it is that is charged against a particular person. </para>

          <para>-  I am not prepared to support the motion that has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> The facts are basically as he has stated them, and indeed as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> has indicated, that she did in fact make a statement to the Press. Last Thursday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> withdrew two statements that she made and conformed to the requirements of the Presiding Officer. The record of the Senate reveals this, and it is not in dispute. She indicates that she did make a statement to the Press after being requested to do so, responding to something that had already been said to the Press by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges.</inline> She has now stood in her place and stated that she withdraws the statement she made to the Press and apologises to the Senate for having made it. I believe that in all those circumstances it would be quite unreal and quite out of character to proceed with the motion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has moved. I do not want to deliberate upon the matter. I do not think we could get a more unqualified apology than the one <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> has made here tonight, and in those circumstances 1 will not support the motion and the honourable senators sitting behind me will not support it either. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> tried to stop her from rising by taking points of order on procedures. Ultimately <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> responded to your request, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> that she should avail herself of the opportunity to state her position. She did so. I still think that what is missing in these proceedings is some clear statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> that this time she means her apology. In the absence of such an apology and explanation, the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition is perfectly correct. It protects the dignity of the Senate, which otherwise would be outraged. If it is possible for an honourable senator to make an apology in this chamber and then to move outside and say, in effect: &#39;I did not mean it&#39;, then the dignity of this Senate is not upheld. The motion of the Leader of the Opposition attempts to put the matter into proper perspective. It is reasonable and moderate and, in my view, it should be supported. </para>

          <para>- I oppose this motion. I do so on two grounds. Firstly, I believe that it is a travesty of what ought to be the Senate&#39;s approach to issues of privilege. Secondly, I think it is a grave injustice to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield.</inline> In relation to the first ground I think that, if this Senate is to take cognisance of a statement such as that alleged to have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> and to regard it, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> suggested, as an outrageous breach of the privileges of the Senate, then members of the Opposition who support such a motion either have no idea of what the dignity of the Senate is or have no understanding of what the word &#39;outrageous&#39; means. I regard the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> as indiscreet, but I do not see in it anything which this Senate should regard as a breach of its privileges. For a breach of privilege the Senate has the power to admonish, to reprimand, to commit to gaol or, if a precedent is established, to expel from the Senate. Once it is accepted that conduct amounts to a breach of privilege, and that is implicit in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> motion, then the penalty which this Senate can exact is a penalty of expulsion or a penalty or committal to gaol. When such penalties exist, I do not think we should treat lightly what is involved in a breach of privilege. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think it borders on humbug or on partisan politics to regard the statement attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> as amounting to a breach of privilege. No inquiry has been made about the circumstances in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> made this statement. No inquiry has been made about whether or not she was provoked into saying it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> raised no suggestion of the possibility of extenuating circumstances existing, in that a person may have insulted her before she made the statement. Yet, as I understand the position, inquiries and suggestions of this character would bring forward evidence which is not before the Senate. In those circumstances, for the Senate to take one sentence out of its context and to regard the newspaper report as setting out the sequence of what happened, in my submission to this Senate, demonstrates the need for action to be taken before any regard is had to what is or what is not a breach of privilege. If one looks at the history of parliaments and at what have been regarded in the history of parliaments as breaches of privilege, one finds that such things as the coercion of members and the preventing of members from doing their duty have been regarded as breaches of privilege. The impeding of a member and the preventing of a member from attending to his duties have been regarded as breaches of privilege. The bringing of parliament, as an institution, into contempt has been regarded as a breach of privilege. </para>
        <para>Can it be said that an act is an act tending to obstruct the Senate in its functions or diminish the respect that is due to it if all that is said is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> conceded she said? Parliamentary procedure must be concerned with acts and with things which are done. It cannot attempt to try the thoughts of individuals and hold people in judgment because of their thoughts, lt is not and it should not be a body which endeavours to rule the thoughts of persons. I will say in this Senate that the statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> made is true. This Senate can compel a person to apologise, but it cannot make that person mean it. Who can deny the truth of that? If at this point of time I were to say in criticism of our Standing Orders that one of their deficiencies is that although an honourable senator can be called upon to withdraw and to apologise he cannot be compelled to mean it, would I therefore be in breach of privilege? I would be saying nothing more than what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> has said. </para>
        <para>I sense that there are deficiencies in our Standing Orders. In the short time that I have been in this Senate I have noticed what I regard as an undue sensitivity on the part of a lot of people about remarks made. As parliamentarians, we are expected to be a robust lot. Yet I think we are one of the weakest groups if we take offence at a lot of the things said, in respect of which honourable senators are compelled to withdraw and in respect of which, in my opinion, the withdrawals are hollow ones and any apologies tendered are not really or sincerely meant. I say that because I think it is in the course of human nature that these things happen. </para>
        <para>What will be the result if what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> said is regarded as a breach of privilege? ls it to be regarded henceforth that if in some indiscreet moment in some private quarter a senator is overhead saying: &#39;I withdrew, but I did not mean it&#39;, we could assemble the Senate, establish the facts, call upon the honourable senator to say &#39;yea&#39; or &#39;nay&#39;, and if that honourable senator admits that it was said, to rely upon this precedent and to allege a breach of privilege? We would reduce Parliament and the Senate to a laughing stock. I think the importance of this Senate is that it does not take undue notice of small things as an indication of whether or not its dignity is affronted. We ought to be concerned with major matters and not with trivia such as that raised by the Opposition. I believe it has been raised for purely partisan political purposes. </para>

            <para>- I do not want to embark upon discussions of past events. I have indicated already certain views which I hold about past conduct.

            <para>- Accepting what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> says, the point is that she was not directed by the Senate and it cannot be fairly said that she was com pelled by the Senate. Accordingly the remarks she made have to be regarded in the context of what occurred last Thursday night only if persons desire to put them into that context, because the record of what was said last Thursday night set alongside what is reported in the Press on Friday does not bear out that they are precisely the same things. 1 have already asked whether this is to be taken as a precedent, because there could be many other incidents which might inadvertently come before the Senate. Once this is done on one occasion I think there is being raised for the future conduct which I would not like to see as a precedent in the records of the Senate. </para>

        <para>I have referred to the standard works on what constitutes a breach of privilege. I have turned particularly to Erskine May&#39;s Parliamentary Practice. At page 109 of the seventeenth edition, it states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It would be vain to attempt an enumeration of every act which might be construed into a contempt, the power to punish for contempt being in its nature discretionary. Certain principles may, however, be collected from the Journals which will serve as general declarations of the law of Parliament. It may be stated generally that any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which obstructs or impedes any member or officer of such House in the discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as a contempt even though there is no precedent of the offence. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I suggest that if honourable senators use that as a standard there is nothing in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> has said which would fall - even straining to bring it within the words - within the general concept of what is meant by &#39;contempt*. At page 115 of the same volume there is a reference to the well known situation in which the Minister of State for War in the United Kingdom Parliament was found guilty of a grave contempt in 1963. But in that case the Minister had made in the House of Commons a deliberately false statement and subsequently admitted that he had made a deliberately false statement. That is not this situation. One can search in an endeavour to find a situation analogous to that which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> I suggest that strive as one may it is not possible to find such a record. </para>
        <para>I believe that the motion is not in the best interests of the Senate, lt seeks to establish a precedent and standards which are impossible of attainment and which reduce the dignity of the Senate rather than uplift it. I also feel that the terms of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> motion are unjust to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield.</inline> She responded to what the  Deputy President  said in words which completely withdrew what was reported in the newspapers, and she apologised.

            <para>- I sense from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant&#39;s</inline> interjection that he wants some proof that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> means it. With the honourable senator&#39;s experience of advocacy in the courts. 1 would like him to tell us how to establish that fact. To attempt to do so is to impose an impossible standard and the Senate will not do itself justice or credit if it tries to impose an impossible standard or to seek to exact some imaginary vengeance because such an impossible standard has not been reached. I feel that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> has been subjected to far more than she should have been required to face. She has voluntarily made a statement which withdraws and apologises to the Senate and I think it would be unfair to her to take this matter any further. I hope that the Senate will reject the motion. </para>

          <para>- It is felt by the Australian Democratic Labor Party that we should be heard on a matter of such consequence, even though our Party as such was not involved in the interchange between representatives of the other two Parties. I think it should first be slated that the whole incident was extremely unhappy. I was personally concerned by SenatorButtfield&#39;s reference and the reproduced reference in the Senate. It would have been much better if it had not been said. However, finally an apology was tendered and the matter passed off in the Senate. We are not now rediscussing that matter. We are discussing now the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> to the Press which referred to what had happened in the Senate and indicated her point of view. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Let us study the context in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield&#39;s</inline> Press statement was made. The matter had been left with the Senate. As far as we were concerned, that was the end of it, for better or for worse. But it seems from Press reports that the matter was resurrected by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges.</inline> Apparently when asked by the Press to comment he made a comment in relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield.</inline> It was a result of that and in consequence of that that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> tendered the remark which is now before the Senate. Whether that would exculpate her 1 am not discussing. I am merely saying in fairness to the honourable senator that it should be put in the context of this discussion that she herself did not take the initiative in resurrecting the matter which had left the Senate and as far as we were concerned was concluded. It was raised by another honourable senator whose comment then through the instrumentality of the Press precipitated the other comment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield.</inline></para>
        <para>The difficulty in this matter is one that is common to many matters of this character. Very often the emotions of the moment and the attention which is directed to a particular matter lead this chamber as they can lead individuals into a situation which goes far beyond the immediate matter tinder discussion and can induce chambers such as this to debate as a principle something which on recollection and quiet thought they would not have wished to adopt. That is the clanger which I feel is implicit in carrying the motion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is now presenting to the Senate. </para>
        <para>I refer honourable senators to the text book on the Senate, &#39;Australian Senate Practice&#39;, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Odgers.</inline> At page 461 it deals with freedom of speech. We are dealing essentially with a matter of freedom of speech and the absolute privilege of this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Odgers</inline> wrote: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Statutory recognition of the privilege of freedom of speech in Parliament had its genesis int he famous Bill of Rights (the document selling forth the conditions upon which the British throne was offered to William and Mary in 1688), the ninth article of which declares: </para>
          <para class="block">That the freedom of speech, and debates or proceedings in Parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament. </para>
          <para class="block">But while a member has a right to state whatever he thinks fit in debate, however it may affect individuals, it must not be in violation of the rules of the Senate, and a senator is always subject to the discipline of the Senate for things said, even to censure or expulsion. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In other words, the privilege of the Senate goes to what is said - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Greenwood - and not to what is thought. The Senate is in no position to control what is thought by honourable senators. As a matter of fact, the very idea of Parliament is that honourable senators shall have an opportunity to ventilate their thoughts on a public matter; but because the absolute privilege applies to this place we must accept the responsibility of putting circumscription around the unfettered privilege that otherwise would be ours. We have to put such disciplines upon ourselves as we think are appropriate and relevant to the situation in which we find ourselves. We do that, not by an attempt to control the thoughts of individual senators, but by an attempt to control the expression of those thoughts insofar as they conflict with the Standing Orders of the Senate. I know of no judicial tribunal which attempts to control the thoughts or attentions of men. The only instrumentality 1 have ever heard about which decreed that a man&#39;s thoughts should be subject to penal action was the Kempe Tai of Japan, the thought police. Generally the thoughts of man are not controlled. Within the ordinary courts of law, criminal and civil, a person is not triable for his intentions. He is triable only when his intention is carried into execution. When we think of the definition of an attempt, it is something in these terms: When a person who forms an intention to do something carries, or begins to carry, it into execution by means adopted to its fulfilment. In other words, once an intention finds expression by articulation or by action, then it is legal and triable. </para>
        <para>In the same way in this court of Parliament that precisely is the attitude we adopt. Whatever thoughts may be held by people in this chamber, when they are articulated contrary to the Standing Orders the people concerned are subject to the discipline of the Standing Orders. That of course is different from the ordinary laws that surround places of privilege or partial privilege outside. The situation is different in the case of the ordinary process outside where the laws of defamation may apply. Strangely enough, in this place there are rulings of the Chair that to impute wrong motives or wrong intentions to persons is disorderly, again I presume because the intention of the person is not to be challenged. It is only the articulation of it that is challenge able. The Standing Orders themselves prescribe that to challenge the intention of a person is in itself disorderly. There are many rulings of the  President  to that effect. </para>
        <para>So we come to the position that we are dealing with a chamber of absolute privilege which has surrounded itself with certain circumscriptions which are embodied in the Standing Orders. As far as we can see, in this case those Standing Orders were complied with. However I will direct attention to what could be the serious consequences of the decision which this Senate is asked to make in the event that it is made in the terms of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> motion. Allowing that the intention - the thought - of a person is triable and he cannot be punished for it in this place unless he articulates it in some way contrary to the Standing Orders, let me take the example of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator X</inline> who accuses <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Y</inline> in this place of being the personal tool of the hire purchase companies, or the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A</inline> who accuses <inline font-weight="bold">Senator B</inline> of being the personal tool of the Fascist Party. Both senators concerned were immediately called upon by the Chair to withdraw those expressions and to apologise. The expressions were withdrawn and apologies were tendered in each case. </para>
        <para>Let us look at the consequences of this situation if the decision implicit in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> motion were accepted. If the senator who made the original allegation that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Y</inline> was a tool of the hire purchase companies could be challenged in this place at that moment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Y</inline> could say: If you make those allegations outside I will proceed against you in the ordinary courts of law for slander or for libel. I challenge you to do that&#39;. If this proposal were carried <inline font-weight="bold">Senator X</inline> could say: &#39;Nothing would give me greater satisfaction but if I make the allegation outside not only am I subject to the laws of libel and defamation but in addition, having withdrawn the statement in this place and repeated it outside, even under challenge from the honourable senator, I am now subject to a breach of privilege of this place&#39;. That would be an incredible situation. </para>

            <para>-  I am not saying that at all but I am saying that when we select a particular incident in which to lay down a general principle we could finish with a very grave circumscription of the rights and privileges and, more particularly, of the responsibilities of this place. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>In those circumstances, however unfortunate the original situation was, and in the circumstances in which the second statement was made in the Press following the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline> and in view of the serious circumscriptions that this necessarily would impose on honourable senators who either would have to acknowledge total hypocrisy in this place or go outside and keep their mouths closed because they would be guilty of breach of privilege and, as has been stated, subject lo dismissal by this House if the occasion were grave enough, I feel that a person would not have the courage, in this place or outside, to make an allegation. If this is a House of absolute privilege let us observe the privilege absolute on all sides. Let us move within the circumscriptions and disciplines that we ourselves impose but let us not, so far as we can, interfere with the opportunities that are given us for debate by carrying the proposal before us. </para>
        <para>However strongly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> may feel about this matter - it is obvious that he does feel strongly about it - I feel equally as strongly that the implication to which I have directed attention may well have escaped him and the honourable senators who support him. If that is so, there would be a very grave deterioration in the power, authority and sense of responsibility of this Senate if his suggestion were adopted. In those circumstances, an apology having been tendered and a withdrawal made, and as that is not subject to challenge in this Senate as being made either in bad faith or as a matter of falsehood or of hypocrisy, because so to do would be disorderly in this House, I suppose the very fact that this motion has been moved means a nonacceptance of the honourable senator&#39;s assurance and is impugning her motives and her veracity. The very motion of censure which has been moved is in itself a breach of the Standing Orders of this House. Therefore it is quite possible that the motion itself, by reason of its implications, may be out of order. </para>
        <para>For all those reasons I feel that the Senate might well admit and accept the situation as it stands at present. There has been an apology and withdrawal by the honourable senator for the benefit of the Senate, for the protection of the power and authority of the Senate and as an acknowledgement of its responsibility. To carry this motion would be in itself in violation of the Standing Orders of the Senate. The Australian Democratic Labor Party, therefore, does not support the motion. </para>

          <para>-  I bring no legal aspects to this discussion nor do 1 want to bring any reasoned argument. In a matter such as this I do not see why everything should have to be put down in black and white. Last week I voted against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> because I thought she was completely in error. Tonight, however, having heard her apology - it takes a lot of humility to get up and apologise and I thought it was very gracious of her lo do so because I do not think many of us would have done it - &#91; was surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> go on with this motion. In the circumstances I think that the sooner this matter is settled, the better. I do not think we should keep on arguing. I do not propose to try to bring Senate practice into the discussion. Surely we should show a bit of common sense. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> has apologised very graciously and 1 hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> withdraws his motion. </para>

            <para>- There was an indication in the approaches of both honourable senators that there may have been provocation on my part. Let me make this clear. I made a general statement that the Government&#39;s approach  -  that includes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> - to migrants was paternal, that in effect the Government believed that there were first class and second class citizens and that migrants were regarded as second class citizens. I do not know the sequence of the approach by the Press. I do not know whether it approached myself first and then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield.</inline> But let us say that the approach was first made to myself. I would concede that, as a result of my general statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> could have retaliated. It would then have become a matter between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> and myself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> denied that she thought it was a great pity that 1 was allowed to be in Australia. She continued with all sorts of other statements. She said that anyone who wants Communists to be allowed citizenship should not be permitted to remain in Australia. This may have been in retaliation for my provocation in saying that she believed, as the Government did, that there were first and second class citizens. But I do not think that there was any provocation for the statement concerning the Senate. I am not over-sensitive. If the whole article had been presented with the exclusion of the statement that the Senate can compel an honourable senator to apologise but it cannot compel an honourable senator to mean it, the matter would have been one between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> and myself. I assure the Senate that it would have rested at that because, as far as T am concerned, the statement <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> made cannot be withdrawn. It was made and she may believe it. It is for her to justify that belief and it is for me to answer from time to time. But I fail to see how I could have provoked the statement which was made against the Senate itself. I think this is what the Senate is dealing with tonight. I am not quite certain how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> could have arrived at the conclusion that I was the first to be approached by the Press. I do not know how he could know this, unless he spoke to the members of the Press involved. </para>

          <para>- The motion before the Senate is that the Senate is of the opinion that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> has, in her statements set out in newspaper reports Which were tabled in the Senate, committed a breach of the privileges of the Senate and therefore should be reprimanded and her apology accepted. The question is: Did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> commit a breach of the privileges of the Senate in newspaper statements attributed to her? Honourable senators will recall that last Thursday night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> was guilty of making an objectionable and disgraceful statement about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges. Senator Buttfield&#39;s</inline> statement was to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> should not have been allowed to come to Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> withdrew that statement and replaced it by the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> should not be allowed to remain in Australia. After much prevarication <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> withdrew that statement in a way which was not satisfactory to the Senate. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>When I indicated to her that her withdrawal was not satisfactory, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> said she would do what I was going to ask the Senate to direct her to do, which was to make a complete withdrawal and to apologise unreservedly. Honourable senators know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> stood up and withdrew but she did not withdraw unreservedly. Finally, when she was pushed to the point by me, she said: &#39;Yes, I do. Do not rub my nose in the dirt.&#39; Ultimately, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> unreservedly apologised in the Senate on Thursday night. Because of this it was not necessary to have a resolution of the Senate. Knowing that there would be a move in that direction, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> withdrew and unreservedly apologised. T said that that should be the end of the matter and I hoped it would. </para>
        <para>I think honourable senators will agree that I gave the honourable senator every opportunity to get out of the matter graciously. I did everything I could to give her a chance to get out of it with no loss of face, to herself and with graciousness, decency, honour and dignity to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline> herself, and the Senate. Now it appears that the honourable senator made certain statements outside of the Senate. She has admitted doing so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> has pointed out that a part of the honourable senator&#39;s remarks were directed to himself. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> also said that although the Senate could compel an honourable senator to apologise, it could not compel an honourable senator to mean it. What does that statement mean? Surely it undermines the honourable senator&#39;s apology in the Senate. If such a statement does not tend to impair the dignity of the Senate, I do not know what does. There is no need to go into books and precedents. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> said that to be a breach of privilege, an act had to be something which tends to diminish the respect which is due to the Senate. Is it not diminishing the respect due to the Senate for an honourable senator to withdraw a statement and unreservedly apologise and then to go outside of the chamber and speak as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> admits she did? </para>
        <para>The attitude which has been adopted in the Senate over recent years is that the dignity of the Senate must be preserved. The party approach has not always been the decisive factor. I appreciate that sometimes it is the decisive factor, but at other times there is such an overstepping of the mark that the Senate acts in unison. Honourable senators will recall that this happened not very long ago when a member of my Party overstepped the mark. All honourable senators on this side of the chamber voted for his suspension and would have gone even further. On other occasions when there has been an act which tended to detract from the dignity of the Senate and which was a clear breach in defiance of the Senate the party approach has not been observed. In this instance we have an honourable senator who has admitted having said to the Press that it is a great pity an honourable senator was allowed to be in Australia and that anyone who wants Communists to be allowed citizenship should not be allowed here. That was a repetition of her offence in the Senate. Is this to be regarded as not tending to diminish the dignity of the Senate. What is all this talk about suing in the courts? When an offensive remark is made in the Senate should an honourable senator be allowed to withdraw that remark and make an apology and then walk outside and say: &#39;They told me to do so under the Standing Orders, but do not worry about that because it means nothing. I did not mean what I said&#39;? Reference has been made to controlling the thoughts of honourable senators. No-one can control the thoughts of other persons. But this was not a matter of thought. It was an expression of insincerity and a statement that what had been said in this chamber meant nothing. In other words she is saying: T made a withdrawal. I made an apology to the Senate. I did not mean it.&#39; Now we heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> with his casuistry. It was one of the most remarkable speeches to which I have ever listened. We heard this talk about thought control when a senator has gone outside the chamber and been reported over the State of Victoria and over the State of Queensland in terms such as that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> says something about thought control instead of an expression of contempt for the Senate. A senator says: They can direct you to do it but that does not mean that you have to mean it.&#39; What is that but showing utter contempt for the processes in here? Do honourable senators want to maintain the dignity of this Senate? If they want this to be the standard it means that every senator here can stand and say: &#39;I withdraw and apologise,&#39; and then walk outside and say: &#39;That is all rubbish. I did not mean that at all.&#39; There is a certain fairness; there is a certain dignity about these matters. With great respect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> notwithstanding what might have been said and what votes might be taken here, I would suggest to you that the sense of the Senate is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> has broken the proper practices and the proper standards to be observed in relation to this chamber. What she has done is a breach of the privileges of this Senate. Indeed, there would be no necessity for an apology at all unless she had done so. After being forced to an apology she has gone outside and repudiated what she said here. Is it any less than a repudiation? Because she has repudiated she should be reprimanded. She having apologised then, her apology even at this stage - ungracious as it was - ought to be accepted. The motion sets out that the Senate is of opinion that she has committed a breach of privilege and I do not think anyone really doubts that. For that she ought to be reprimanded. She having made an apology, I think that it ought to be accepted. </para>

            <para>-  I have reminded honourable senators opposite of that. It may be that notwithstanding what the Democratic Labor Party has done that there are honourable senators who take a different view. I know that there have been party meetings on this matter. It may be that there are honourable senators who nevertheless think as the Australian Labor Party did in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> that certain standards ought to be observed. If those standards are not observed it is clear that the Senate as a whole will suffer from non-observance of those standards. I ask that the Senate support the motion. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-  I feel that this Bill should be discussed not so much on the questions which have been raised to such a large extent during the debate so far but rather on the general intentions of the Bill. I suggest that we should get away from isolated or even numerous incidents of mismanagement or improper treatment of the Aboriginal people, although I believe that those incidents need to be corrected. I would prefer to see the Senate discuss this proposition with an understanding that every member of this Parliament and every member of the State parliaments today has a feeling that something drastic needs to be done in the interests of the Aboriginal people of Australia. I feel that that is the attitude of the Australian people towards this question, irrespective of their political ideologies. I believe that it is a long time now since anybody in the Australian community worthy of the name Australian has sought to demean any further the unfortunate Aboriginal people of this country who have not received the opportunities that most of us would have liked to have seen them receive. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If we go back through history we must recognise that when Australia was being settled by people of European descent they found here a tribal race of people which at that stage was one of the most primitive civilisations in the world, a race which has been recognised as such ever since by people interested in this subject. I suppose it would be true to say that if Europeans had settled in Australia 100 years earlier than they did they would have failed to survive in a country which was so inhospitable as Australia was at that time. Because they arrived at that point of history they were able to take advantage of advancements that had been made up to that time by Western type civilisations, were able to establish themselves on this continent and gradually take over, to the detriment of the Aboriginal people who were here when they arrived. This, of course, is not an isolated incident of this type in the history of mankind. If we go through the world today we find that there are still many old tribal communities of various races which have found it difficult to make the adjustments necessary to enable them to take part in a way of life that we now refer to as modern civilisation. We would find at least 30 different races of tribal people in respect of whom many experts predict that there is no future, that gradually they will be absorbed into the rest of the community and, as a race, will vanish. We would not like to see the Australian Aboriginal vanish in that way. I think it can now be said that that is the view of the Australian people as a whole. </para>
          <para>In supporting this Bill it is not the intention of the Democratic Labor Party to impute lesser motives to any political party than another. I think the members of all political parties in Australia today want to do their utmost to assist the Aboriginals to adjust themselves to a modern type community so that they may take their rightful place in our way of life. The big question that none of us is able to answer is how we may achieve that. We have not just recently thought of trying to help the Aboriginals; we have been thinking of this for a considerable time. We have tried by various means to achieve this aim, but many of the things we have attempted as a people have rebounded because we have used the wrong methods. When the referendum was carried to give the Commonwealth greater responsibility in this area I was one of those who were a little disappointed that there seemed to be no immediate result or action from the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- I agree that we all thought so, and perhaps even the Government was disappointed. But I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> with his particular interest in this subject, would be one of the first to agree with me now that much wisdom can be seen in a slow start. Many people with excellent intent had tried previously to achieve their purpose by spreading millions of dollars through various channels among the Aboriginals, but they found on many occasions that the result was the opposite of what they had set out to achieve. Often they helped to destroy rather than assist to re-establish the Aboriginal people. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>My former attitude of disappointment has now changed. I believe now, from what 1 have read, that the rather slow start on a programme for Aboriginals may pay off. I believe that the Bill now before the Senate will establish a sound basis and a sound stepping off place for a proper programme for Aboriginals. I know that both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> and I would be disappointed, as would also many Government supporters, that the amount of money that it is proposed to spend for this purpose is not large enough. But we cannot buy off our conscience on this issue merely by spending money; we have to go much deeper than that into the subject. I found in the second reading speech of the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin),</inline> who represents the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> in this place, the very thing to which I have referred - that depth of thought, that attempt, whether it is ultimately successful or not, to reach a sound stepping off place so that we may achieve the objective that all Australians have today of trying to rehabilitate and to bring into our community with their proper status and in their proper place the Aboriginal people who previously hari known mainly a tribal way of life. An attempt to belittle the difficulties will not solve the problem. </para>
          <para>I have no doubt that if we cull through the history of the Aboriginal people of Australia, or through the history of tribal people in any other country, we could find issues which we could debate for months in this chamber. I compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> for drawing to our attention and documenting cases which he has raised with the Minister. However, I am afraid that I cannot accept to the same degree the arguments put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> The honourable senator said that he knows of numerous cases where squatters have robbed the Aboriginals of child endowment and age pension benefits. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> was trying to save our time tonight by referring to cases in this way, but surely if he has specific information or knows of specific squatters who have been doing these things to the detriment of the Aboriginal people he should support his allegations with the fullest possible information and documentation on a question which is so serious, so that all those who break the code of the great mass of Australian people on this question and hamper what we are trying to do to help the </para>
          <para class="block">Aboriginals will be dealt with properly in accordance with the laws of this country. If there is no specific evidence it does not assist the proposition or help to establish the Aboriginal people in their proper way of life to make wild accusations to the effect that he knows that something like this is going on. He should mention specific circumstances and support his allegations with evidence. I compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> for the manner in which he presented the cases to which he referred, although I may not agree with him on the evidence that he has submitted that the charges in themselves were tremendously serious. </para>

            <para>- The questions <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> raised related to matters in which mistakes in administration could have been made. I do not know that any of us sitting here fully appreciate the tremendous difficulty experienced by people of our way of life in administering people who have known only a much more simple code and are bound by many tribal rites, rules and regulations which to us may seem childish but which to the people concerned are very serious. 1 would rather attribute to the Government sincerity on this question. I believe that matters such as those raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> should be brought directly and personally to the attention of the Minister. I would have full confidence that what could be done to correct a mistake that had been made would be done. That may not be possible at this stage. In fact, the action may have been taken with the best of intentions by the persons charged with the responsibility of administering justice to a group of young women who had broken into a residence of their own people. He did not want even to think of a criminal charge under a legal code such as we have in our civilisation. He took other steps to correct the situation. Perhaps they were wrong steps or ones which in our terms might be construed to be harsh. If a mistake was made in that instance, I attribute to the Government the sincerity to try to prevent a repetition of such a mistake. 1 do not know who the people in Alice Springs who got the pork were. 1 do not know whether they were wealthy or poor. lt is alleged that they were white. 1 agree that it would have been better if the pork could have been distributed among the Aboriginal people themselves. I have no doubt that if this matter were brought to the attention of any administration it would see that, if nobody had the right to distribute the pork other than among the Aboriginal people, such an incident would not happen again. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, 1 have read in the newspapers of people being searched when leaving the slaughteryards of our big cities. On some occasions they are found lo have a lol. of meat that they are not supposed to have. Steps are taken to reprimand these people. But I do not think we judge all the Australian people on the standard of the odd person who commits an offence. So 1 do not think we should judge the ability of this measure to advance our Aboriginal people on the fact that somewhere somebody or other did not properly administer some pork carcasses that were available or perhaps allowed them to be stolen and distributed mainly among people who had no entitlement or right to them. I believe that this is a far bigger question than that. </para>
          <para>I hope that the theme of the second reading speech of the Minister for Housing is carried out in its fullest intent. This is explained to be a beginning on the question. I believe that it is a beginning. Provision is made in this legislation for the expenditure of $5m. I can find no fault with the wisdom of such expenditure, with my very limited knowledge of this matter. Of course, I have taken some interest in it. I believe that this money is being spent in a better direction than we have ever spent money before. I could still be proved wrong. There have been previous occasions when I have thought that handouts were helping. I think we all have been through that phase when we have taken any interest at all in a problem such as this. </para>
          <para>We are largely in a situation of experimentation on this problem. But I believe that the experimentation is on a sounder basis than that on which we have ever attempted to tackle the problem before. 1 pay a personal compliment to the MinisterinCharge of Aboriginal Affairs. He seems to have surrounded himself with a group of people who are in a position to know. He has two of our most distinguished old Australian citizens working in conjunction with him and helping him with the problems. They should have at least a very personalised knowledge of those things that will lift their people out of the situation into which they have drifted in the development of our Western type of civilisation in the land that once was theirs. </para>
          <para>As I said at the outset, this is not a problem unique to our Australian Aboriginal people, although it is probably more difficult than corresponding problems in many other parts of the world. I am encouraged by the attitude of Australians to this question. We need to understand the attitude of real Australians to this question. It is good to mingle with members of our own community in the outback or in a place such as Darwin. The attitude of the people of Darwin to the racial question is one of the finest I have ever observed in a mass community anywhere in the world. The people there have a fundamental, simple approach to this question, without those undercurrents of fear, hatred and prejudice that can prevent the accomplishment of the ideal that we have on this question. </para>
          <para>I must say that in observing the way of life of the people in Darwin I was somewhat concerned by what I saw in some of the hotels there. I do not wish to demean that small proportion, as I hope it would be, of our Aboriginal people who perhaps are not adjusting themselves to a higher rate of income. As yet they are unable to appreciate that their income could be spent in much better ways than those in which they are spending it. I do not intend to recount any individual or personal things that I happened (o see in Darwin. I believe that only a minority of the people would be involved. </para>
          <para>I suppose that this is not surprising because it is true that in any community - even where the people have had all the advantages of university education under our modern system - there are people to whom we can refer loosely as dropouts. We should not suggest that we are failing because members of the Aboriginal community also have some difficulty in adjusting to some things in life to which they have not always been accustomed. It is true that the receipt of an excessive income before they have developed the ability to know what is the best way to use it can be selfdestructive in some cases. But that is no reason why there should be discrimination against those people in the labour laws of this country. </para>
          <para>If we are to overcome this problem we must start among the very young. We must reach as many children as we can reach by systems of education so that when they step into their role of responsibility as mature people in our community they will be able to take what is rightfully theirs in the form of an appropriate rate of income for whatever they put into the community. This is inherent in what the Minister said in her second reading speech on this legislation. It is also inherent in what I have been able to study of the manner in which the money that is to be appropriated at this stage is to be spent. I repeat that we sincerely trust that this is a beginning on this question. </para>
          <para>I did note one passage in the Minister&#39;s speech which, at first reference, seemed to imply that the things that should be done for these people were not to be done and that privileges were to be granted to them for a very limited time. The Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is evident that in order to achieve this we shall have to extend certain privileges to Aboriginal Australians - on a temporary basis. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But on re-reading that I find that it is most likely to mean that these will be privileges that we must of necessity extend and that they will not comply completely with our Western type law. That is, of course, the reason why these privileges are to be granted on a temporary basis. It would be indeed foolish if we did not have the objective that sooner or later the Aboriginals shall be absorbed and be a complete part of the Australian community with their rightful status and their rightful dignity in our community and be able to live amongst us as the true Australians that they are. Because this is a step in the right direction, we are prepared to support the legislation brought down by the Government. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator LAWRIE</inline>(Queensland) (11.11&#93; - 1 wish to speak briefly on this Bill and to commend the Government for what it has done to help the Aboriginal people of Australia. 1 would like to reply to some of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> We listened to a 50-minute tirade from him against this Government and against the Queensland Government. We have been told that since the referendum was carried there has been not much reaction from the Commonwealth. I would like to point out to the Senate that we have already had one full year of grants to the States to help them with their Aboriginal populations and we are now well into the second year. In the first year the Commonwealth gave $3,650,000 and in the current year it has budgeted for $5,410,000. We must remember that prior to these grants the States did not have any substantial Commonwealth help in the matters that are enumerated here and that these grants are in addition to what the States have been doing. I want to refer more particularly to Queensland. These grants supplemented the State welfare work for the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders as well as State housing, State education and State hospitals. Despite what was said earlier this evening, I point out that all these people receive Federal social service benefits, the same benefits as are received by anybody else. </para>
          <para>To go through the vote item by item as it refers to Queensland for the year ended 30th June we notice that 42 houses were constructed on the northern peninsula area and Torres Strait Islands and that 53 houses were constructed in other country centres, a total of 95 houses for which an amount of $800,000 was allocated. I want to make it quite clear that that is in addition to any work that was done by the State Government beforehand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> mentioned the hospital at Lockhart River and the one at Mitchell River. He said that for some strange reason the allocation for the hospital at Lockhart River was $91,000 whereas that for the hospital at Mitchell River was only $41,000. But he did not tell the Senate that the allocation for the hospital at Mitchell River was only for the first stage of that hospital, so I want to correct the statement that he made. There is also the first stage of a hospital complex at Bamaga which was to be built at a cost of $83,000. A dental clinic and equipment at Bamaga was to cost $12,500. I mention that Bamaga is a fast growing settlement on the mainland across from Thursday Island, and it will grow larger. It is being developed rapidly because of an irrigation project for which the Commonwealth has found the money. I propose to refer to this later. The next item is an expenditure of $12,500 on a dental clinic and equipment at Woorabinda. </para>

            <para>-  I happen to know Woorabinda. It is not very far from where 1 live and a lot of work has been done there. In addition to the actual settlement there is associated with it a very well run cattle property which provides considerable revenue for the Queensland Aboriginal and Island Affairs Department. This property is self supporting and helps the funds of the Department very much. There has been no mention of that. The next item is the provision for two dentists and two technicians to work for 4 months in the Tories Strait peninsula area at a cost of $10,000. Again this is a big step forward because apart from Thursday Island that type of service was not provided in the past. It was simply beyond the resources of the State. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The next matter mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> in a fairly scathing manner was supplementary food assistance for 1,445 children at Weipa, Arukun, Edward River, Mitchell River, Mornington Island, Doomadgee, Lockhart River, Hope Vale/ Bloomfield. Yarrabah, Palm Island, Woorabinda, Cherbourg and other centres. An amount of $74,000 was allocated for that purpose. I have worked that out. It is supplementary food assistance; it is not meant to provide the main items of food or anything like that. It works out at $52 a year for each child. I consider that $1 a week to buy something special to supplement the child&#39;s diet is quite a considerable amount of money when all is considered. </para>

              <para>- I think it is quite a considerable amount of money. It would be used in some areas more than in others and I think it is a start for what we hope to do for these people in the future. The next item of the vote covers education, the construction and equipping of schools at Bamaga and Palm Island. I have already mentioned the location of Bamaga. Palm Island is about 30 miles off the coast at Townsville. The Commonwealth has provided $240,000 by way of a direct grant for the construction and equipping of those schools. The next item is residential accommodation at Bamaga for secondary level students. This is a very big step forward. An amount of $30,000 was allocated for this purpose because the only secondary education available to students in the far north has been at Thursday Island. Now it is being provided at Bamaga. It will enable a very large number of children to receive secondary education who could not possibly have received it under existing conditions. Then there is an allocation of $29,600 for the construction of a school at Lockhart River and an amount of $25,000 for the construction or purchase of pre-schools at Bamaga, Mitchell River, Weipa and Woorabinda. That brings the total Commonwealth grant to Queensland in the year just ended to $1,450,000. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>While the vote is not detailed in the current year it rises to $2,055,000 for Queensland alone. There is an amount of $350,000 excluded from these figures for an irrigation scheme for Bamaga. I might mention that at Bamaga there is a very nice area of rain forest the extent of which, I understand, is about 60,000 acres. The river never ceases to run. It is a summer rainfall area with the rain falling during 4 or 5 months of the year and very little for the rest of the year. These people want the water to provide continuity for the growing of crops and for other purposes. The two Bills are being taken together. During the course of her second reading speech, the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)</inline> said: </para>

Honourable senators will recall that an amount of $350,000 was provided in the States Giants (Aboriginal Advancement) Act 1968, but in the event, due to the shortage of time remaining after the passage of the Act, it did not prove possible for the details of the terms of the loan to be concluded with the Queensland Government. </para>

However, I am glad to say that these formalities have not been allowed to hold up the actual work. The Bamaga project, for which these funds are provided, is now nearly complete. The main pipeline is operating, water is already in the big reservoir at Bamaga itself. Only minor reticulation is still incomplete, and work on this is proceeding. I have very great hopes that the present Bamaga irrigation project will succeed and justify future extension. If so, it should open up new horizons for the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in the community in the north of Cape York Peninsula and perhaps eventually in other parts of thai urea. </para>

I now refer to the first annual report of the Commonwealth Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises. The Fund started off in a comparatively small way with a fair amount of capital.

              <para>- That is not a disgrace. The applications have to be processed. They cannot be rushed through in one day, one night or one week. A breakdown of the approvals shows that thirteen loans were rural and five were non-rural. The declined applications were six rural and five non-rural. The average loan approved is $18,600. The average term of the loan approved is 8.4 years. I say that the allocation of these loans is a big step forward. 1 believe that this Government should receive great credit for the way it has helped to supplement State expenditure, lt has been said that the Government has done nothing for these people. From my personal knowledge, quite a number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island teachers have been sent to Brisbane to train at teacher training colleges. I know one such person who is doing a course al: the Queensland University, under a Commonwealth scholarship. These are great achievemenls on the part of the Government and for the people concerned. Tonight we heard a lot of criticism about what the Government is or is not doing. I would like to draw attention to what the Australian Labor Party has suggested for people on Torres Strait Islands. This is in direct contrast to the welfare programme and everything that the Commonwealth and the State are doing. I refer to a statement by the Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> in another place, in which he wanted lo give away three Torres Strait islands and dispossess the people on those islands.

              <para>-  I am stating the position. In fact, when the Legislative Council of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea dealt with this matter one of their members moved a resolution that the area become part of the Territory. That resolution was defeated on the voices. That is what the legislature thought of taking over three Torres Strait islands and of dispossessing those people. I ask the Senate to contrast the attitude of this Government and of the Queensland Government and the work they are doing for Aboriginals in that State and for Torres Strait Islanders with the criticism we have heard tonight about this vote, about the work being done by this Government and by the Queensland Government for these people and with the great steps forward which are being taken at present. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </para>

This is a worthy attempt to assist with this problem, provided, of course, that the full co-operation of the Aboriginals is sought and that it does not become another native affairs development scheme in which the Aboriginal merely follows the instructions of his master, a situation which he deeply resents. What interest is to bc paid on this money? What are terms of the loan? Why is it that there are some procedural difficulties? </para>

              <para>- Yes, the work is finished. I know that. But even this was not made clear in an answer to a question I asked. But now the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)</inline> in her second reading speech, said that the work has been completed but that the terms of the loan have not been decided upon. 1 find this very strange indeed. What is the Queensland Government objecting to? Is the Queensland Government objecting to a charge of interest on this loan? If that is the case, I think the State Government is justified in its objection because somewhere along the line there has been a change of policy about the Aboriginal advancement fund set up to encourage and to develop enterprises by Aboriginals. At the end of last year&#39;s debate I asked a question. It concerned the interest to be charged on loans. The Minister will recall that I referred to the copper project at Yuendumu. The States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Bill 1968 was before the Senate. The Hansard report shows that the Minister said: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>I have just been informed that this money for the Yuendumu copper project is interest free. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The purpose of my questioning was to find out whether the particular fund to be set up was for the direct assistance of Aboriginals in establishing enterprises. I asked for details of the terms and interest rates of loans to make certain that only a nominal interest was to be charged. But upon investigation we have discovered that the rate of 5% is to be charged. This is not a nominal rate of interest. The practice has got away from the original intention, as indicated, that no interest would be charged. I ask the Minister quite clearly whether the Commonwealth is having difficulty in negotiating the $350,000 loan with the Queensland Government because of the interest rate. </para>
          <para>I believe that the good intentions of the Government are failing in application. I am not saying that the Government&#39;s intentions are not good, lt has meant well in bringing down such legislation and in setting aside such large sums of money. It is not a problem of administration. I have had dealings with the staff of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs. They have been most co-operative and dedicated to their work, ft is not a question of administration or staffing. It seems to me to be a lack of direction in policy. For this reason it is necessary for the Government to take another look at the Office of Aboriginal Affairs. </para>
          <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson</inline> was answering queries relating to the estimates of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs his advisers were members of the Prime Ministers Department. I asked a whole series of questions which could not be answered, obviously because the Office of Aboriginal Affairs comes within the administration of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department but is tagged on to the ministerial responsibility of the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> Although the intentions of the Government may be good, in practice the policy is not as effective as it should be. Perhaps the Government should study the matter and accept full responsibility in this area of activity and consider whether it is worthy of a separate ministry. </para>
          <para>This is not idle talk. The money being set aside for Aboriginal affairs will increase rapidly. The Aboriginal population because of new methods of direct or intravenous feeding of Aboriginal children will increase rapidly as the Aboriginal death rate in children which is twenty-eight times the national average will fall substantially. This will greatly increase the responsibilities of the Government in this field. At Kuranda in Queensland there is an Aboriginal population explosion, possibly because of congested living conditions and cohabitation. Youngsters are bearing at an early age and families of up to twelve children are living there. This situation will be matched in other areas where the Government&#39;s policy is applied. I therefore think it is reasonable to expect the Government to take another look at the activities of the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and to make them a direct ministerial responsibility. </para>
          <para>Another reason why such action is necessary is that the expenditure of these large sums of money should be under the direct supervision of the Commonwealth. I pointed out last year that his not good enough to give large sums of money to the States without supervising the way in which they are spent. I refer again to the sum of $350,000 which was given to build a pipeline from the Jardine River to the Bamaga Aboriginal settlement. The pipeline is completed. I asked certain questions. I asked why in the construction of the pipeline, for which money supplied by the Commonwealth was used, Aboriginals were not paid the full award wage. In answer to my question the Minister stated, in part: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Allowances paid by the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island  Affairs  to reserve residents who are engaged in developing the reserves are determined by that Department taking into account a number of factors, including the nature of the work, the skills and work performance of the individuals and the value of certain services provided to residents of reserves. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This policy resulted in the authorities at Bamaga paying one-third of the award wage. One-third of the award wage was paid to a bulldozer driver. He has a skill. You are either a bulldozer driver or you are not. You cannot be half a bulldozer driver. You have to qualify to drive a bulldozer. Anybody who drives a bulldozer should receive the full rate. In this instance the bulldozer driver was obviously engaged in this work, but he received only $28 a fortnight. That is a ridiculous rate to pay. All other payments to those Aboriginals were at the same level. </para>
          <para>A consequence of the low payments was to reduce the application of justice to the Aboriginals under the Social Services Act. 1 asked whether Aboriginals on reserves are entitled to benefits under the Social Services Act. The Minister replied that they are entitled to all social service benefits if they are unemployed. But what happened at Bamaga? A bus driver was dismissed there by the manager for a misdemeanor. The manager refused to re-employ that man on the settlement, but did not advise him that he was entitled to social service payments. The reason why he was not informed of his rights is obvious. If the Aboriginals at Bamaga were to become aware of the amount of money they are entitled to under the Social Services Act they would promptly realise that it would be better to stay at home and draw that money than work for the manager of the settlement. I think it is absolutely necessary that where money is provided by the Commonwealth Government in increasing amounts it should also provide supervision so that the money is properly spent and the Aboriginals are properly treated. </para>
          <para>A sum of money was provided for school buildings at Bamaga. I will tell honourable senators what happened to the last school building there. It was supposed to accom modate the increasing number of children at the settlement, but the manager acquired the building for an administration building. The Commonwealth must be careful that money provided for school buildings is not used for another purpose, as has happened at Bamaga. This is why it is so necessary for the Office of Aboriginal Affairs to increase the number of research and supervisory officers and for the MinisterinCharge of Aboriginal Affairs to have more time to devote to this particular portfolio. </para>
          <para>The Torres Strait Islanders concern me very much because they are a thriving and an energetic people. On a recent visit to the islands I heard mention of some 43 houses being built there. I did not see them. There may have been 1 or 2 going up, the forerunners of the 43. What concerns me is that here is a rapidly increasing population. There are 1,000 youngsters at the high school on Thursday Island, 1,000 children who are being educated to junior standard but who have very few prospects. This is another avenue in which care and interest should be displayed by the Department. </para>
          <para>Recently I asked a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry lo learn why the Torres Strait Islanders had been refused a permit to export crayfish. They are skilled at crayfishing and they have the necessary equipment and the processing plant but the Government refused their application for a permit for no other reason than that if they were permitted to export painted crayfish from Thursday Island the crayfish trade of Western Australia and Tasmania would be affected. There is no other reason for the refusal. The Office of Aboriginal Affairs should be taking a particular interest to see that any decisions made by the Government on behalf of the Torres Strait Islanders or Aboriginals is rightly made. </para>
          <para>I raised the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Young</inline> who was sent to gaol for a lengthy term with a minimum of 9 months imprisonment for the manslaughter of her child who died of scurvy and malnutrition. The Office of Aboriginal Affairs should have taken a personal and financial interest in this woman&#39;s problem but it did not. The problem at Cunnamulla is as was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> The problems of the fringe dwellers at Cunnamulla are as have been portrayed by &#39;Four Corners&#39; and as described by </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline>and other honourable senators. I am pleased to note that an allocation of funds has been made for housing in this area. The Department has a very grave responsibility, and on the next occasion when Bills affecting Aboriginals and the two funds which have been mentioned are brought before us they should be produced at a time when they can be discussed fully by all honourable senators who are particularly concerned about the welfare of Aboriginals. J should have liked to deal with other matters affecting these people but the time approaches 11.45 p.m. and 1 do not doubt that the Minister would like to reply to the many points that have been raised. </para>

            <para>&#91;11.43&#93; - in reply - I have only a minute or two but I should like to deal with a couple of points because I think it is important that we do so. I want to commend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> very much for his comments. It was obvious that he spoke with a great deal of knowledge as well as a great deal of feeling having regard to his experience of the area. I thank him for his comments and I thank honourable senators generally for the interest they have taken in this legislation. 1 deplore the comments of speakers who give the impression that nothing is being done under this legislation. I believe that the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> and the officers of his Department are completely dedicated in carrying out their duties in this field. I remind the Senate that over $8m was spent in 1968-69, not the $328,000 that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> said was spent in 2 years. 1 think his statement should be corrected. In addition I would direct attention to the figures <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> mentioned which show that in the fields of housing, health and education some $3,650,000 have been spent. We add to this sum the amount which has been allocated for the capital fund and the amounts which have been appropriated for the Northern Territory for health purposes and for the study groups which are so important and which are operating in the Northern Territory. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is quite true, as honourable senators have said, that education is one of the most important matters to be considered because it is in that field that we will see a benefit not only in this period but also in the future as the children grow and as the families understand so much better the requirement to live happy and successful lives within the community. Commonwealth grants to the States for Aboriginal advancement in the field of education total $843,000, for housing $2,297,000 and for health $510,000. 1 know that honourable senators have a document which shows those amounts. The grants are contributing tremendously to the welfare and improved living conditions of these people whom we all wish to help. </para>
          <para>I referred to study grants for Aboriginals. I direct attention to the Minister&#39;s announcement of a scheme of study grants for Aboriginals at the post-secondary and tertiary levels. He went on: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Already more than 100 Aboriginals arc  being  assisted under this scheme. We are also financing some action-research studies through the States. In the course of the present year  it  is our joint intention to undertake some special work in community schools in the Northern Territory. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I believe that the future will show the benefits of this planning and the work that is being done. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline>referred to two schools at Weipa and the children who attend them. I should like to inform him thai a secondary school is to be opened shortly at Weipa North which, I understand, will be for Aboriginal and white children alike. In other words, it will be an integrated school. As the honourable senator knows, one school already has Aboriginal and white children attending. </para>

              <para>-I thought you were speaking too quickly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> referred also to the outstanding Aboriginal poetess Kath Walker. I think he would be interested to know that she saw MrWentworth today and put to him her opinions, including those on black power. She subsequently visited the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and met with the Council for Aboriginal Affairs this afternoon. Among many matters which were discussed was the contribution <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Kath</inline> Walker could make, as an outstanding Aboriginal poetess, in matters related to Aboriginal affairs. </para>

          <para>The honourable senator also referred to the capital fund. I think points in relation to the fund were raised by other honourable senators as well. I direct attention to the report of the Commonwealth Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises which was brought in earlier. I think it shows very clearly, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> mentioned, the splendid work that is being done. It will be seen that the number of applications for assistance where the amount required is known is ninety-seven, and the total amount applied for is $4,755,932. Already eighteen applications have been approved to a total amount of $328,096. I find it interesting to note the number of loan approvals which cover both rural and non-rural areas. The average loan approved is $18,672. It should be realised that all these matters have to be considered. The first annual report of the Commonwealth Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises states in clear terms how a loan is made. It states: </para>

            <para>Broadly, prospects of success are regarded as having been reasonably established if the investigation of the loan application reveals that the enterprise will generate sufficient net income to provide a satisfactory living for the borrower and to meet repayments of principal and interest, over an extended term if necessary. </para>

          <para class="block">I think that is a clear statement of the actual position. I would like to reply to a matter that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> raised tonight and also during the Estimates debate. It is correct, as the honourable senator said, that 1 informed him in the Senate on 28th November 1968, that the loan for the Yuendumu copper project is interest free. This was an exception to the normal procedure. On the basis of the known body of ore, the project could be successful only if interest was not charged. Normally interest is charged on loans from the Capital Fund. But this interest can be reserved in part or in whole at the discretion of the Minister in order to give a particular project every chance of being successful and thereby of qualifying for assistance under the Aboriginal Enterprise Assistance Act 1968. I again stress the point that the interest can be reserved in part or in whole at the discretion of the Minister so that every possible assistance can be given. </para>
          <para>I thank honourable senators for their contribution to the debate. I realise that the hour is late. I think I have covered the main points which were raised. 1 am sure all honourable senators will agree that this legislation is of paramount importance to helping Aboriginals to live a better, happier and healthier life. I believe that the Aboriginals generally and particularly the children will benefit from the foresight, vision and dedication of the MinisterinCharge of Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> and the Office of Aboriginal Affairs. </para>

            <para>- I wish to ask one or two questions in order to clear up points which I regret the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin),</inline> who represents the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs in this chamber, did not find time to reply to. The Minister did not reply to any of the accusations I made, although I thought they were serious enough to warrant a reply. I draw the attention of the Committee to clause 3.(1.), which states: </para>

            <para>There is payable, during the year that commenced on 1st July 1969, to each State, for the purpose of financial assistance in connection with the welfare and advancement of the Aboriginal people of Australia living in that State, such amounts as the Minister determines not exceeding in the whole the amount specified in the Schedule to this Act opposite to the name of the State. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I interpret that clause as meaning that the Minister will decide the amount of financial assistance to  be  given to a State but that this cannot exceed the amount set out in the Schedule to the Bill. Apparently the Minister and not the Parliament decides what financial assistance shall  be  given to the States. Clause 3.(2.) states: </para>

But if a State does not have the amount lo spend it  may  nol  be  able to accept the Minister&#39;s  offer.  If that  were  lo happen the welfare of the Aboriginals in that State could be affected, f will  use  South Australia as an illustration.

              <para>-  But it becomes a loan if the State does not match the Commonwealth&#39;s offer. Clause 3 (2.) (b) states, in effect,that if the Minister grants $500,000 to, say, South Australia and that State can find only $400,000 of its own finances to spend it will have to repay the whole amount to the Commonwealth. Docs a Slate have to pay back to the Commonwealth the amount in excess of the amount the Slate has spent on a $1 for $1 basis or does it have to pay back the whole of the amount the Commonwealth has given to it. despite the fact that the State has matched part of the grant? I am concerned with the words &#39;that amount&#39; at the end of the clause. Il appears to me that the whole Commonwealth grant would be refundable if a Suite did not match it $1 for $1. </para>

            <para>1 1 1.58&#93; - As 1 understand the situation, when a project costing a certain amount of money is put up the Minister decides what amount will be made available to meet the overall cost of the project. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> thinks is a matching grant is in fact not a matching grant. Clause 3 (2.) (a) is only a machinery provision to ensure that the State spends the money provided on Aboriginals. This condition is normally provided for in section 96 grants to the States. However, it is not a matching grant. </para>
