In particular, will he check whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoffmann</inline> ever did tender a resignation to the Department of Customs and Excise or whether a resignation was prepared for him by the Department?

I corrected the answer I gave yesterday as soon as I found out from Hansard that I had incorrectly answered the question. Everybody knows that I did this; everybody knows that that was my right and that it was the right thing to do. In relation to the question as to when the resignation was initially received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoffmann</inline> by the Public Service Board or by the Department of Customs and Excise, that date remains the same as I gave in my statement and is the date that we all agree with. </para>

Has the Minister&#39;s attention been drawn to an article in todays Australian Financial Review&#39; referring to the steep increase in imports of New Zealand jam by Australia in the first seven months of the current financial year, wherein imports were stated to be 40 times greater than the total such imports for the whole of the year 1967-68? Is the Australian jam industry suffering an inordinately heavy economic handicap arising from the differential between sugar prices paid by Australian jam makers on the domestic market and the world market price paid by the New Zealand manufacturers? If so, what steps can be taken to ensure a reasonably competitive position for the local jam and fruit industries? </para>

            <para>- This is a question which might better be directed to the Minister for Trade and Industry. Following a Press comment I was informed of some of the facts relating to this matter. It has been claimed that the local industry is at a severe disadvantage because of the cost of sugar to the Australian industry, which is $191.60 a ton compared with $94 a ton paid by the New Zealand industry for sugar used for export production. The degree of injury to the Australian jam industry has to be considered in terms of the quantum of trade at present between Australia and New Zealand. In that regard, the New Zealand component is a very small proportion of the Australian market. From June to December 1968. 271,000 Jb was imported from New Zealand, but in the same period 965,000 lb was imported from other countries. The </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Australian production in 1968 was 84,150,000 lb. That gives a very quick appreciation of the degree of injury that is allegedly being sustained because of this differential in the sugar price. There has been no industry request for increased duties. Jam does not come within the complex of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement, but if the industry suggested that it was being injured it would have the right to go to the Tariff Board to seek protection on the basis of that injury. That is a procedure that normally applies in these matters. </para>

            <para>- I do not subscribe to the last sentence of the honourable senator&#39;s question in which he has expressed an opinion. I did see in a very quick way that there was to be an increase in the price of some motor vehicles, but I did not take on board the actual amount of the increase. I shall refer the question to the Minister for Trade and Industry for his comment. I feel bound to say, however, that we cannot simply take the profit of a company out of the air and say that because it amounted to $Xm then it must be profiteering. Profit must be considered in relation to capital investment and in terms of plant and machinery. It must be considered in relation to a whole host of accountancy problems before one can start making judgments as to whether the company is making a big profit, a reasonable profit or a small profit. To demonstrate the point further, there could be a situation in which a company made a profit of $10Om and that still would not be a reasonable profit in view of the capital costs involved in the undertaking. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development. In view of the determination of Australian Labor Party politicians in South Australia to influence the people of our State against their own best interests with regard to the building of a new dam on the River Murray and, seemingly, for purely party political purposes, I ask: If the Chowilla Dam were to be built in South Australia, would South Australia get one jot more water than it has rights to at present under the existing River Murray Waters Agreement? ls it likely, when the Ministers of the three States concerned with the control of River Murray waters meet with the Commonwealth Minister on Friday, that the agreement which fixes the allocation of water for South Australia will be altered to allow more water to pass to South Australia if the Dartmouth dam is constructed? </para>

            <para>- I must say that last night South Australian members of the great Australian Labor Party criticised the honourable senator quite severely in relation to her attitude of endeavouring to persuade the River Murray Commission, the Commonwealth Government and the States concerned that South Australia should be given the maximum amount of water possible. The River Murray Commission&#39;s technical advisers who met in 1961 and recommended Chowilla are now recommending Dartmouth. The reason that they now recommend Dartmouth is that it can provide for South Australia 0.86 million acre feet of water more than Chowilla. Consequently, at the meeting of Ministers to be held this Friday South Australia has a great opportunity to gain an increase in the amount of water it is to receive - something above the amount of only 1.254 million acre feet which Chowilla could provide. As a capacity of 0.86 million acre feet more water is planned for the Dartmouth dam than would be provided by a dam at Chowilla, that amount of water can be sent down the river to help South Australia. I am sure that the people of South Australia will be able to get an amount of water considerably in excess of the amount they would get from a dam at Chowilla. </para>

Will the Minister for Supply comment on allegations made in a circular sent to senators by the Women&#39;s International League for Peace and Freedom that Australia is linked with preparations for chemical and biological warfare and that the placing of an advertisement by the Department of Supply in January for a senior principal research scientist with a record of achievement, preferably in the study of the behaviour of compounds of biological significance and associated procedures, suggests that Australia may shortly be co-operating more fully in biological warfare7 Is the Women&#39;s International League for Peace and Freedom one more organisation where innocent and idealistic women are manipulated as a front by a shrewd minority coterie, behind the scenes, of Communists and extreme leftists? </para>

            <para>- I received a copy of the circular referred to by the honourable senator. 1 have kept it in a folder after reading it with interest, since my name is mentioned in the second paragraph. I have had a reply prepared in anticipation that an honourable senator would ask me a question about it. The note I have on the subject states: The whole of the second paragraph of the circular - I have had a good look at this paragraph - draws a completely misleading inference. It is well known that Australia is a member of the technical co-operation programme with the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Canada, and that one field in which information is exchanged is chemical and biological defence. I have made it quite clear that it is Australia&#39;s policy to be well informed on defensive measures in this field, but not to have an offensive capability. A small group of scientists in Australia has the responsibility of keeping up to date our technology on advances in this field. Such knowledge is essential to the protection of the Australian people. The advertised position mentioned in the circular is in relation to work of a defence nature. </para>

            <para>- I know of the honour-&#39; able senator&#39;s concern about drug trafficking. I can tell him that there is not a shortage of 100 officers at Sydney. Within the past 3 years we have increased the staff of the prevention and detection service - they are the officers who handle this kind of work - by approximately 100% . We are equipping the officers with the latest gear, such as modern ships and means of transport, to help them in carrying out their duties. We are running schools to teach persons joining the Department the best methods of detecting people who are bringing in drugs on ships and so on. We haw turned our interest to the north of Australia in an endeavour to keep the drug problem at a minimum. In addition, recently in Canberra a meeting of State Ministers concerned and representatives of the police and health departments was held. I was the  chairman  of the meeting, lt was decided to set up a standing control committee to look into all the problems associated with drugs in Australia. </para>

            <para>- I address my question to the Minister for Housing. Is it a fact that the maximum amount of S500 payable by the Government under the homes savings grant scheme has not been increased by one  cent since its introduction on 2nd December 1963? Is it a fact also that this scheme was first announced in the Liberal-Country Party policy speech for the 1963 general election and that the only variations to it since then were contained in the 1966 policy speech? Does the Government believe that it was so extraordinarily generous in 1963 in granting $500 that this amount will absorb all building cost increases for the next 20 or 30 years and that there is no need to review frequently the sufficiency or adequacy of the $500? Does the Minister agree that this scheme appears to have taken its place with pensions and family allowances as levers to be manipulated solely at election time without regard for any social justice merits of the payments? </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator commented first of all that since the inception of this scheme the payment of the maximum grant of $500, which is a tax free gift to persons under 36 years of age who fulfil the required conditions and become eligible to receive it, had not been altered. This is correct. But I thought I also understood the honourable senator to say that the legislation had not been amended at all since it had been brought in. </para>

              <para>- I think you will be pleased to know. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> that since the inception of the scheme the grants paid out amount to S5S,458,980. These grants have been paid to 134,832 young couples who have benefitted from them. I believe that these figures show that this scheme is now not only doing a very fine work for these young persons who get the grant or whatever proportion of the grant they become eligible for but also it is benefitting them by saving. When we say (hat we have paid out this amount pf money, the Senate will recall that the Government pays $1 for every $3 saved by a young couple. This is a very great amount of money saved in the field of housing. </para>

I ask: Is it a fact that the Minister for External Territories and the Administrator of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea shortly will announce the name of the consultant who will conduct the survey and later recommend the improvement pl&#39;an for Port Moresby and the Territory of Papua and New Guinea? Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to the fact that honourable senators have pleaded with Ministers who have been called upon to make similar decisions that it is in the Australian public interest that firms be used which are truly Australian based and recognised as Australian firms? Can the Senate be assured that the Minister and the Cabinet are fired wilh the importance of establishing the confidence of Australian consultants, and indeed the regard of the world for Australian consultants, in the use by the Australian Government of Australian consultants? </para>

The point that the honourable senator makes, not for the first time, so enthusiastically, is well understood. But our purpose in Papua and New Guinea is not to be the torch bearer of the Australian flag per se. We will make an appointment of a person who has the most merit from the point of view of competence in town planning. </para>

            <para>- I am aware of all the charges spoken of in last Sunday&#39;s newspapers. I say right here and now that the charge that members of parliament - not Ministers, but members of parliament - had interfered with customs officers to stop them doing their duty in relation to the drug traffic is a complete fabrication. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been one member of parliament who has intervened in the interests of drug peddlers in Australia. </para>

In view of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition in the South Australian Parliament has said publicly that if the waters of the Murray were to be impounded in a Chowilla reservoir, and therefore inside the South Australian borders, South Australia could simply help itself to the water when necessary, will the Minister explain the possible effects of such contemplated rebellious action by any future South Australian government? </para>

            <para>-  I have not seen in the Press any statement relating to the action that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, may take, if the Chowilla Dam is built, to give water to South Australia in times of extreme drought - that is, by opening up the gates and letting the water go. All I can say to the honourable senator is that the River Murray Waters Agreement has been in existence for over 55 years and nobody - not even the Premier of a State - has broken that Agreement. Therefore, it would be the action of a completely irresponsible person if a Premier or any other person broke the Agreement so that a State could get water to which it was not entitled under the Agreement. </para>

Has the Minister seen any recent Press articles, some of which have appeared in Adelaide, which recount reports of young people holding degrees in arts or science who have been unable to obtain employment in line with their educational qualifications? Does the Minister agree with Professor Badger&#39;s statement that university courses, however abstract, should contain at least something realistically designed to fit in with what the student will have to do after graduation? Can the Minister say whether any attention has been given to this kind of inclusion so that the time, talent and money expended on the obtaining of university degrees will not be wasted? </para>

            <para>- I have had my attention directed to Professors Badger&#39;s contribution to the Press on the subject referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson.</inline> I am informed that arts graduates who do not enter the teaching profession are having some difficulty in obtaining appropriate employment. About three quarters of the arts graduates of Australia enter the teaching profession. Nevertheless it is thought that there may be some merit in the Professor&#39;s suggestion that what I might call subjects of working experience be included in an arts degree course, and the Diploma of Education is a step in that direction. I hope there would not be one member of the Senate who would accept the proposition that the arts degree and its merits should be subordinated to economic purposes. It is hardly to be expected, as Professor Galbraith has suggested, that we would wish St Peter to ask those seeking entrance to Paradise: &#39;What was your contribution to the gross national product?&#39; </para>

            <para>- Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> the Government is concerned about any industrial difficulty that arises in the Commonwealth because industrial strife affects everybody in the Commonwealth and it al&#39;so affects our capacity as a nation. As to some variation of the industrial law which, by inference from the honourable senator&#39;s question, would resolve this threatened strike, I would not have a view. After all, changes in our industrial laws, so far as Commonwealth conciliation and arbitration are concerned, come to this place and are debated here. I think it is a complete over-simplification of the situation, or of any industrial situation, to suggest that some magical change in industrial law can be produced out of the bag overnight in order to resolve a strike that may occur next Friday. </para>

            <para>- 1 know of considerable debate by various organisations and some companies on this subject of the price of oil and the fixing of the price of petrol following the new oil pricing agreement between the Prime Minister and Esso-BHP. Between now and the end of this year Esso-BHP will come into production. The first oil is expected to be delivered to the refineries in about August. Because the price has been reduced under the new agreement from $3.19 to $2.43 or $2.47, according to quality, this will mean that people going to bowsers to get petrol will not have to pay the substantial increases outlined by various members of the Opposition and by university people. In fact the price of petrol is not expected to rise, because of this new pricing formula and agreement, by more than half a cent per gallon between now and Christmas. </para>

Has the Minister&#39;s attention been drawn to a report in today&#39;s Brisbane Press of the arrival in Brisbane of the first ship under the new customs rule relating to oral declarations by incoming passengers? Will the Minister inform the Senate whether any unnecessary delay was caused to passengers in clearing customs in this case? Will the Minister do all he can to see that passengers are cleared in the shortest possible time, as many of these people are tourists from overseas and the tourist industry is of great importance to Queensland? </para>

            <para>- The Department of Customs and Excise has now introduced the principle of oral declarations by overseas visitors who come here by ship. The new system is similar to that which has been operating for over 12 months with respect to people travelling to Australia by air, and it has been introduced because of the great success achieved by this system in connection with overseas visitors who arrive by air. At the moment the system is going through a trial period. At a later date I shall be pleased to report upon the success or otherwise of the system of oral declarations by people travelling to this country by ship. </para>

My visit there confirmed the view that it is a unique area of Australia which has a fascinating interest for overseas tourists. At one  resort  I was informed that last year there had been bookings for 600 American tourists and that this year there were already bookings for 1,000 tourists. I announced during my visit there, as I had previously announced in the Senate, that the Australian Tourist Commission has engaged experts to make an assessment  of  the area and expects the co-operation of the Northern Territory Reserve Board in having the area around Mount Olga and Ayers Rock assessed conjointly by the same team. I expect that assessment to be made within the next 3 or 4 months. </para>

I remind him that he said yesterday that in the last 12 months the payment of a large amount of money as customs duty had been evaded and that the officers concerned had been charged. Does the Minister now say that the officers have not been charged but have been reprimanded only? Were they reprimanded only because of the latest interpretation of Public Service practice that if they were charged and found guilty they could tender their resignations and escape scot free from any punishment? What was the amount of customs duly evaded in respect of cigarettes and tobacco? What legal proceedings are in fact being taken and against whom? Finally, has any investigation been made to ascertain how deep these rackets are running within the Department of Customs and Excise? </para>

I refer to the sum of $22,906 in Commonwealth subsidy paid to the Queensland company Artesian Basin Oil Pty Ltd. Is the Minister aware that this money was used to upgrade the value of the lease held by the company to enable it to sell its interest to Exoil (NL) at a great profit? Is the Minister also aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> was the prime mover in the share transactions?

            <para>- 1 am fully aware that the Commonwealth Government&#39;s policy in relation to oil exploration has achieved wonderful and staggering results inasmuch as we hope to be getting in the very near future at least 70% of Australia&#39;s oil requirements from our own companies drilling for oil. We will have it refined in Australia by companies established in Australia. Our petrol will flow through petrol bowsers to our motorists at reasonable prices. As to the honourable senator&#39;s charges against a State Premier and his question about an amount of $22,906, I ask him to place the question on notice and I will get an answer from the Minister for National Development. </para>

            <para>- A Although I address my question to the Minister for Repatriation it concerns also the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service. It relates to changes in the Defence (Re-establishment) Act last year when provision was made for national servicemen to extend their period of service by 3 months. As the result of that, however, they lose the right to re-establishment benefits, including vocational training. Since this mistake became evident has any administrative action been taken to provide these benefits to servicemen in that category? If legislation is pending, when is it likely to be introduced? </para>

            <para>- It is true, as the honourable senator has said, that national servicemen were given a period of 3 months to apply for re-establishment benefits. Unfortunately in one sense, some of the national servicemen decided to re-enlist. Apparently in doing so they did not realise that they were cutting themselves adrift from the re-establishment benefits. We have been assured by the Army now that in cases of re-enlistment these chaps are told of the position which confronts them. The matter has been examined by a committee which has been set up and which is chaired by an officer of my Department. I have taken up the matter with my ministerial colleagues - the Minister for the Army, the Minister for Labour and National Service and the Treasurer - but as yet we have not arrived at a decision. However the matter is being considered. </para>

            <para>- -My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Will he ask the Treasurer whether the policy of seeking to raise capital for the Australian Resources Development Bank within Australia only is to be changed in order to encourage investment in the Bank from overseas as well? I am prompted to make this comment because of the remarkable success of the latest issue of transferable certificates of deposit, which demonstrates the confidence of the Australian people- </para>

In view of the threat of substantial unemployment in the metals industries in Queensland and the subsequent decision of unionists employed in those industries to impose overtime bans, will the Minister influence his colleagues to release foreseeable government contracts to ease the situation and ensure that all contracts, be they for the Government or for private industry, are executed in Australia rather than farmed out to overseas interests? </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for National Development. What means will be used to transport water between the Dartmouth Dam and Adelaide? Will this transport be by pipeline? If so, what size pipe is to be used? What is the estimated quantity of water that will be delivered to South Australia each day? If transport is to be by means other than through pipeline, what form will the transport take? If it is to be by open channel, what is the distance to be traversed? How will flow pressure be maintained? What percentage of the water leaving the dam will be lost by evaporation and soil absorption? The Minister was pretty loquacious before; let him answer that. </para>

Because he had obtained this job on the recommendation of the chief officer of the Department, through the Commonwealth employment agency, he thanked the officers and me for the work done for him. </para>

            <para>- The price of petrol in Australia is cheaper than that in many other countries. It is interesting to know that in America and Canada the price paid for indigenous crude oil is about $3.50 a barrel. We will be producing crude oil in Australia, and after 17th September 1970 Esso-BHP will be receiving a price of only $2.06 a barrel. The honourable senator asks: Why should that put up the price of petrol? The answer is that come 1.7th September 1970 the price of petrol should be, or will be, the same as it is at the present time if we take into consideration only the Government&#39;s oil pricing policy. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Customs and Excise. I do not know whether I heard or interpreted correctly the answer he gave a few minutes ago regarding the reason for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoffmann&#39;s</inline> visit to him after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoffmann&#39;s</inline> dismissal. If I beard him aright, he said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoffmann</inline> came back to thank him and the officers of the Department of Customs and Excise for finding him a position with some private firm. All I want to ask the Minister now is: Is it the normal practice of the Minister and/or officers of his Department to find employment for employees who are dismissed or who resign from the Department, or was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoffmann</inline> given special, privileged treatment? If he was, for what reason was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoffmann</inline> given the preferential treatment? </para>

            <para>- 1 did not sec the announcement made by the Victorian body, as mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton.</inline> But I agree that if suggestions could come from the body that made this statement they would be very valuable indeed and a lot of credence would be given to them. The only point is that I am afraid that when we do receive the suggestions they probably will not hold water. However, I will transmit the honourable senator&#39;s suggestion to the Minister for Primary Industry. </para>

Britain is the only depositary government to have deposited its instruments of ratification to date, although the USA and the USSR have signed the Treaty.

An urgency motion has been moved and has been supported by honourable senators. The motion is in accordance with and pursuant to standing order 64.

          <para class="block">Obviously that refers to the Senate notice paper. I direct my attention to these two standing orders, which I suggest must be read in conjunction with standing order 64, because the Senate already has this matter under its survey and surveillance. A Senate select committee has been charged by the Senate with the examination of this problem. The matter appears on the notice paper. I suggest, that under the two standing orders I have referred to - I consider they must be read in conjunction with standing order 64 under which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and his supporters have moved this motion - honourable senators opposite are out of order. 1 suggest that they are canvassing a matter which is before a select committee of the Senate; therefore it should not be debated on the grounds that it is anticipating a matter which at present appears on the notice paper. 1 know there are difficulties associated with this matter. I also address my attention to the &#39;Australian Senate Practice&#39;, third edition, in which the eminent and learned  Clerk  who sits in front of you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, deals</inline> with the problems in which the Senate finds itself involved from time to time. I refer you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> to chapter 14, page 198 of &#39;Australian Senate Practice&#39; which is headed &#39;Motion for Adjournment to Debate Matter of Urgency&#39;. In that chapter the learned  Clerk  of the Senate properly provides for the instruction of senators matters that arise in relation to a motion for adjournment in order to debate a matter of urgency. For example, I direct attention to the second paragraph on page 198 in which a 1957 case is used as an illustration. The author states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A <inline font-weight="bold">Senator gave</inline> notice  to the  President  of his intention to move the adjournment of the Senate to discuss the effect on Universities of a  Bill before the Queensland Parliament which related to the administration of the University of Queensland. The  President  ... in a  private ruling, indicated that the motion, if proposed, would be disallowed because the Commonwealth Government had no administrative responsibility in tha matter. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The  President  went on to refer to &#39;May*. Then, in the ultimate paragraph of that page - and I quote it because it can be said that perhaps in quoting it I am taking a point against myself - it is stated that the  President  upheld a point of order that a motion was not in order because it dealt with a matter that was not a Commonwealth responsibility but one for which the Government of Western Australia was responsible. I mention those two paragraphs only so that no honourable senator present can say that I am being anything less than fair. The motion of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has given notice gives as its reason: </para>

          <para class="block">I direct your attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> to the fact that the Commonwealth Government does not have jurisdiction over the Great Barrier Reef, even under our Petroleum (SubmergedLands)ActwhichIhave examined. Here I would refer to what the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bowen)</inline> said during the course of his second reading speech when introducing that measure in another place. He said that involved in this was the inability to distinguish what was the area of jurisdiction of the Commonwealth under that measure and what was the area of jurisdiction of the sovereign State of Queensland. I direct attention to the fact that the motion in question here refers to the Great Barrier Reef areas. This is an allembracing designation which concerns a matter in which there is a division of authority as to what is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government of Australia and therefore the ministerial, responsibility of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>The second matter is the areas which are the responsibility of the sovereign State of Queensland. Therefore I suggest that, in accordance with the rulings and practice of the Senate, the Parliament has but limited powers to argue as to assurances in relation to, for example, matters that deal with the sovereign rights of the State of Queensland. It was only on 4th March - yesterday - that a similar motion was introduced in another place. As discussion of that matter is now concluded I may refer to it. The debate is reported in full in yesterday&#39;s Hansard of another place. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson),</inline> a member of the Opposition in another place, launched debate on a matter of urgency in terms substantially the same as those contained in the motion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has moved this afternoon. After the honourable member for Dawson had completed his introductory speech the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn)</inline> replied, and I seek your permission to quote what he said for your information so that you may advise me on the question that I have raised with relation to the jurisdiction of the Senate in this matter and the propriety of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe&#39;s</inline> moving of the motion, bearing in mind that it refers to an area that is not specified or designated and where there is a division of authority which is not specified.

          <para>So, asI did when opening my remarks, I suggest that the motion in the terms as submitted to the Senate is out of order. Firstly, it seeks to examine the jurisdiction of the sovereign State of Queensland in an area which is not defined; but implicitly it seeks to extend authority over the sovereign State of Queensland. Secondly, there is constitutional propriety involved in this question. Thirdly, 1 suggest that this is a device which is being used for party political purposes and not in the interests of public urgency. Therefore, I suggest that the motion is out of order and should not be accepted. </para>

              <para>- I suggest that the point of order is not well taken. So far as constitutional propriety and other points taken by the honourable senator are concerned, one has only to consider what the Senate did with relation to the appointment of the Senate Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources to understand that this Parliament, and therefore the Senate as part of it, has a legislative interest in all these areas; otherwise we could not have set up that committee. It is one of the particular subject matters of inquiry by this Senate and there is no substance in the objection at all. You might as well say we were not entitled to set up the Select Committee to inquire into any of these matters. At best, the honourable senator says there is some doubt about who owns the areas. These matters are not resolved by doubts. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <para>The reality is that apparently the permits have to be approved or consented to at the Federal level. Therefore this Parliament is concerned with the matter, because the Federal Minister can take action to prevent drilling being done. It is clearly a matter of Federal ministerial responsibility. We are concerned with it, and it is being suggested that that responsibility should be exercised in a certain way. </para>
          <para>Then the honourable senator says that the motion is contrary to the Standing Orders in that it anticipates something. Standing order 125 reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No Motion or Amendment shall anticipate an Order of the Day or another Motion of which Notice has been given. </para>

          <para class="block">No order of the day is being anticipated and there is no other motion of which notice has been given and which this motion anticipates, We therefore suggest that this motion is entirely in order. </para>
          <para>A somewhat similar motion was moved on 16th October 1968 dealing with the Gulf of Carpentaria and Great Barrier Reef waters. The matter of definite public importance there, was the failure of the Government to initiate action to police, control and preserve the resources of the waters of the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Great Barrier Reef. I ask you to reject the point of order. </para>

At the outset, by way of desiring to assist you, the point which has been taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> with regard to a motion in October last year was, 1 put with all respect, irrelevant to the consideration here. That motion was concerned with the waters of the Great Barrier Reef and the Gulf of Carpentaria whereas what is involved in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe&#39;s</inline> motion are the actual resources of the sea bed. But leaving that aspect aside, it is clear that the Senate has appointed the Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources to examine the provisions of legislation relating to off-shore areas and, in particular, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. </para>

              <para>- I do hot desire to anticipate what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> will say; to a certain extent that would be beyond me. However, it is apparent that the work of the Committee and the provisions of the legislation which the Committee is investigating comprehend what are the relative powers of the Commonwealth and what are the powers of the State with regard to the Great Barrier Reef area. Looking at the terms of the urgency motion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has raised, it is quite obvious that questions of power must arise. He stales in the terms of the motion that he has proposed: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. the failure ot the Government  io  give an adequate assurance that oil drilling and mining in the Great Barrier Reef areas will not be permitted. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> is going to say. It may be difficult to forecast, in any event, what he would say as to the words &#39;adequate assurance&#39;. It is clear, nevertheless, that one reasonable interpretation of those words would be as to the power of the Federal Government or the power of a State government to take the necessary steps. Therefore I suggest that one attack which is to be made is on the sufficiency of Commonwealth powers. That was one of the principal matters aired in this chamber as justification for the appointment of the Senate Select Committee. Accordingly, as I said earlier, there is comprehended within the terms of reference of the Select Committee the very matter which this motion contemplates. It is a matter of public knowledge, and not a disclosure of committee affairs, that the Committee has been to the Great Barrier Reef area for the express purpose of hearing submissions and, in due course, considering them. Therefore it becomes a matter of what is the limit upon the Senators and what constraint should be exercised by the Senate in the light of standing order 308. lt would be very difficult for honourable senators to speak on matters in this field without offending the Standing Orders. That is one point. </para>
          <para>A second point is that the Senate ought to recognise the difficulty into which it puts its members. Furthermore, having appointed a select committee, the Senate ought to consider whether in those circumstances the honourable senator should embark upon a discussion when it has already given to the Select Committee the obligation of making a major consideration of these matters. I have entered this discussion because I sense that there is here a very real problem. I do not know whether this matter is expressly covered by the Standing Orders, but I certainly ask for your ruling upon it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> It appears from the Standing Orders that the Committee may report at any stage, or it may report when it has completed its deliberations. If it reports when it has finished its deliberations then, according to standing order 317 the consideration of that report must be by specific motion, of which notice must be given in the usual manner. That would suggest, I submit, that if the report of the Committee were before the Senate it could not be discussed in this way. Therefore I ask whether it is proper for the Senate to discuss matters which are within the terms of reference of the </para>
          <para class="block">Select Committee, prior to the Select Committee reporting. Obviously there is embarrassment. 1 suggest that it is proper for the Senate to be concerned with the matters 1 have canvassed, both as to the position of individual senators and the Senate itself. I support the point of order because there is, to my mind, a problem which arises. I ask for your ruling. </para>

          <para class="block">One would have thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> would have a very difficult job persuading you and the Senate that this motion was anticipating an order of the day because he has not indicated which order of the day it could possibly affect, nor has he referred us to another motion of which notice has been given. What is really being said is that we have a Senate Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources and legislation relating thereto. He has suggested that these are wide terms of reference which might cover some of the matters which may be canvassed in this debate and, therefore, for some extraordinary reason, the Senate is precluded from debating these questions. </para>
          <para>That is an extraordinary proposition if it is to be upheld because it means that one can effectively gag the Senate by appointing a select committee. If you uphold the objection it means that anything that falls within the terms of reference of that committee is ipso facto shut out from the consideration of the Senate. I am sure that you would lean against any such construction of the Standing Orders if, indeed, such a construction were open to you. </para>
          <para>The plain fact is that the subject matter of this motion involves the Federal Government. It calls into question the failure of the Government to give an adequate assurance that oil drilling and mining in the Great Barrier Reef area will not be permitted. It is clear that the Federal Government has power to decline to give the permission that is involved in the motion. We are asking the Minister to take a serious view of his responsibilities and to make it plain that such oil drilling and mining in the Great Barrier Reef area will not be permitted, because it is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. </para>

I do not know what it is at the moment, but I am perfectly clear in my mind, and I respectfully suggest that honourable senators should be clear in their minds, that this is pre-eminently a matter than can be discussed in the Federal Parliament. There is not a tittle of substance in the point of order because no foundation has been laid upon which it could succeed. There is not an order of the day. There is not a notice of motion with which this would interfere, and to ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, to</inline> fall back upon some inherent jurisdiction of some esoteric illdefined character to say that the Senate should not debate this motion would be assuming a responsibility that is entirely beyond the powers of the  President  of the Senate. 1 suggest that we should not waste time on this discussion, that the point of order is completely without substance and that you should rule so at the earliest possible moment. </para>

I.</inline> feel that I was quite justified in making the statement, but I shall temper my remarks in accordance with your ruling. It is not my intention at any stage of this debate to disclose any confidential information that has come into my possession as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Off-Shore Petroleum Resources. However, matters which have been raised in publ&#39;ic session of the Committee have been published in many sections of the Press. I suggest that these are public matters and that in referring to them I will not breach any confidence gained in any discussions that have taken place inside the Committee or with witnesses appearing before the Committee. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There is one matter that I think should be cleared up now and placed permanently on the record. I suggest that on a previous occasion when we discussed the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Great Barrier Reef in the Senate, at least a gentleman&#39;s agreement was reached between honourable senators opposite and Opposition senators who are members of the Committee, that if we followed the general course of action that I have said I will follow, there would be no problem. As time is limited I wish to proceed now with the argument as outlined in the motion. </para>
          <para>The Great Barrier Reef is not a parochial issue, lt is not a subject that concerns only a limited number of people in this country. It is a national asset, or indeed an international asset, and ought to be treated as such. In these circumstances I hope that honourable senators opposite appreciate that this is not a joking matter. The Great Barrier Reef stretches for about 1,200 miles down the coastline of Queensland. It is basically, and perhaps most importantly, a tourist attraction. From time to time the Minister in charge of Tourist Activities <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wright)</inline> distributes reports stating that a very large number of visitors to Australia from overseas make a point of seeing the Reef, or at least some of its attractions. The area is rich in fishing resources. I refer not only to the types of fish to be seen in small aquariums but also to the fish that are caught for food in many countries. The Reef acts as a protection against tides and cyclonic disturbances. If the Reef were interfered with to a large degree, one theory that operates holds, a major effect on tides would follow. If the Reef were permanently damaged over a large section, not one surf port on the coast of Queensland would be able to stand up to heavy weather and heavy seas. lt is not necessary to create artificial damage to the Reef, because it has many natural enemies. In the past cyclones have created damage that now, many years later, is still in the process of repair. There is a common misconception as to whether the Reef is dead or living. No accurate survey has been carried out, but estimates of the amount of living coral have varied from 60% to 80% of the total area. In some parts of the Reef, particularly at its northern end, the Crown of Thorns starfish has caused tremendous damage. Currently surveys are being made to discover an agent to control this starfish. </para>
          <para>The damage that can be caused by silt is apparent in the Townsville area. In the Cleveland Bay area in days gone by there  were a number of small reefs which were alive, but unfortunately most of them now are dead or have disintegrated and have disappeared. The theory expounded by experts on many occasions, and which has not been contradicted, is that this has been caused by silt coming out of the Townsville Harbour. No tests have been carried out in Australia into the effect of oil or any other hydrocarbon type of mineral on living coral. </para>

Until that is done is there anyone in this chamber - I doubt whether anyone in Australia can - who can tell us authoritatively whether the Reef will be damaged by an oil blowout or by an escape from gas wells? Marine life in the vicinity of the Reef depends on the minute creatures of the sea, on things smaller than themselves such as plankton, seagrass  and seaweeds. It would be reasonable to assume that an escape of oil directly or indirectly would lake great toll of the type of life on which the larger marine creatures feed. </para>

              <para>- 1 will make my decisions with the assistance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> might prefer to remain quiet. When the legislation was before the Queensland Parliament that was one point uppermost in the minds not only of members of the official Opposition, the Labor Party, but of other members of the Parliament as well. They were particularly keen and anxious to see that the Barrier Reef was protected. It is significant that the Minister has said outside the chamber, as he did inside the chamber on that occasion, that there was nothing to fear. Probably I could quote a facetious statement he made to the State Legislative Assembly but I do not think it would be the proper thing to do. He said that he would be personally responsible to see that no damage was caused to the Reef or the areas continguous to the Reef. lt is well known, and has been mentioned in this chamber this afternoon, that yesterday in another place there was a debate on this subject. 1 am not satisfied with what the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn)</inline> had to say. I am not attacking the Minister.  He has to speak in accordance with the policy of the Government. Today some sections of the Press indicated that certain assurances had been given that there would be no drilling in the Reef area. I should like to quote very quickly three or four statements. To me, sufficient assurances have not been given that proper precautions have been taken or that there will be any blocking of exploration or drilling permits on the Reef or in the immediate area of the Reef, and I hope that the Minister who in this place represents the Minister for National Development will convey my sentiments to his colleague. The Minister for National Development said that he agreed entirely with the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> who said that we would have to be very careful in respect of future permits for oil exploration. That would be construed as being a sympathetic statement. Referring to the Queensland Minister for Mines, who was the Designated Authority under the joint legislation and who in this case will have to wear two hats when carrying out his duties, the Minister said: </para>

              <para>- The Minister said that three exploratory wells had been drilled but none of them was within 20 miles of the Great Barrier Reef. That is not good enough because it has been proved by the explosions that took place in the Santa Barbara area on one occasion, and on another occasion by oil slicks which drifted many miles with the tides and currents, that damage can be done to the Reef. That is exactly the kind of thing which will take place if there is an accidental spillage from a well or from a pipe in the Barrier Reef area. In the Brisbane daily newspaper, the Courier Mail&#39;, on Friday, 13th September 1968, the following report appears: </para>

Of course, once the meat is removed the clam dies. This could upset the ecological balance of all marine life on the Reef. Not enough is known about this. Those people who are scientifically or academically qualified to tell us say that we should not touch the Reef until a suitable period has been spent in carrying out a proper physical and scientific survey. </para>

          <para>To substantiate further the arguments that I have been developing, I want to quote from the American magazine &#39;Time&#39; of 14th February 1969, only 2 weeks or 3 weeks ago. Before doing so, may I say that we received all sorts of assurances, and some of the overseas news items were slanted suitably, to prove to us that no great damage was being caused in Santa Barbara. &#39;Time&#39; has been looked upon as a reliable magazine even by some members of the Liberal Party.

          <para>I suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> that if this type of catastrophe takes place within the Great Barrier Reef area the Reef will be spoiled for a much longer period. If such pollution killed off the top of the Reef over a fairly lengthy area - places like the coast east of Ingham, the Townsville area, the Halifax area, particularly the Lucinda Point bulk storage area, possibly the Cairns area and Mission Beach and the other delightful beaches that we have along the Queensland coast - the area of the Reef involved would be ruined by the high tides and the heavy seas experienced there. The theory has been expounded by people with scientific knowledge. This is what they believe. With no evidence to the contrary, I am prepared to believe it. </para>
          <para>I refer to the &#39;Torrey Canyon&#39; incident. That ship spilt 100,000 tons of crude oil into the English Channel. We are told that 90% of the animal loss was caused by the detergents used to clean up the oil. No real survey has been conducted to inform us whether or not the chemicals used in cleaning up the mess had any serious effects. However this information will come forth in due time. The situation at Santa Barbara is even worse than that. Direct blame is placed on the oil companies. One oil company in particular is named in this article in Time&#39; because it did not exercise proper supervision. One of the State officials asked the then Secretary of the Interior, Stewart Udall, for an extension of the buffer area in this locality of something like 2 miles. Such an area would be completely useless off the Queensland coast with its heavy seas and high tides, even for the protection of the Reef. In Santa Barbara, when an extension was sought, it was not granted. But this is the comment. Santa Barbara County supervisor George Clyde said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Always, Interior and oil officials led us to believe we had nothing to fear. </para>

          <para class="block">This is what is happening in Australia now. We are told by the representatives of the Queensland Government and the Commonwealth Government that we have nothing to fear.

            <para>The Government, of course, profited by the drilling; last year it made $1.6 billion in rentals, royalties and bonus payments from the Santa Barbara concession. The block that included the leaky Union well was good for $6 1.4m in bonus revenues to the Federal Government. </para>

Twice in 1967, the company was brought up on violations of California fish and game statutes for polluting Los Angeles harbour. Indeed, its competitors complain that Union is giving the industry a bad name. </para>

          <para class="block">Of course, when this problem blew up, its competitors decided to get behind Union for the sake of mutual protection. </para>
          <para>I am charging the Commonwealth Government with responsibility in this matter. I think that the onus must come back to the Commonwealth Government because the Queensland Government is not prepared to take the responsibility. The Queensland Government will make every cent that it can out of royalties from oil. Because the Great Barrier Reef is a national asset, I believe that onus is on the Commonwealth Government to give a complete assurance - much better than that which was given by the Minister for National Development in another place approximately 24 hours ago - which will convince all Australians and all Queenslanders in particular that the Commonwealth Government means what it says. The statement outlined by the Minister for National Development yesterday does not appear to convey that impression. If any doubt exists about the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth and State Governments, this doubt ought to be the matter of some sort of emergency discussion so that this question can be resolved satisfactorily. </para>
          <para>I wish to make one or two more points and that will conclude my contribution to the debate. I feel that, so far as Queensland is concerned, we have very little chance of overcoming the problems to which I have referred. The Queensland Premier and the Minister for Mines, Main Roads and Electricity on numerous occasions have given this assurance but have not backed it up with anything. There is no legislation to back it up at all. The Minister for Mines, Main Roads and Electricity has said publicly on several occasions that licences or exploration permits will be granted for the Great Barrier Reef area, but only after conditions have been decided. This would take many months. If honourable senators want my authority for that statement they may refer to the &#39;Queensland Mines Magazine&#39; of January 1969 where this statement was made originally. Perhaps we will find out yet. May I say this also: In his statement the Minister for National Development said that no more permits in certain circumstances will be granted. It might be advisable for a proper investigation to be carried out. Such an investigation might indicate that there is no more reef for which to issue permits and that that has not been made public yet. Because it has not been made public, it creates a further area about which one must be worried. </para>
          <para>As I said a few minutes ago, the Queensland Minister clearly indicated that a statement on the successful tenderers for the Reef area would not be made for a long period of time. Under pressure - I leave honourable senators to judge whether from his own Government or from interested oil companies - he said that the announcement would be made in March. For the benefit of those honourable senators who think that I may be going close to the bone in regard to the Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources, 1 point out that these are all public statements appearing in Queensland newspapers and other newspapers in this country. I repeat that the Queensland Minister said that he would make the announcement in March. Then he got down to the day. He said that it would be made on 1st March. Today is 5th March, and the announcement has not yet been made. </para>
          <para>Perhaps I should refer to the Queensland Premier here. 1 believe that it is appropriate to do so because he also has been vocal in statements that the Reef area would be protected. Those honourable senators who read the newspapers will know that at the moment the Queensland Premier is in serious difficulties in regard to his holdings in oil companies. It is more than a rumour that one of the reasons why the successful tenderers have not been announced is that the Premier is associated with one of the consortiums seeking to take out leases of Barrier Reef areas. </para>

              <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> from the Country Party can understand the prospectus of an oil company, I suggest that he study it tonight. This is what is likely to happen, and this is why no decision has been taken and no firm announcement has been made in relation to the allocation of the permits, and, worst of all, why no firm decision has been taken on whether the Reef is to be protected. When I find that a State government is prepared to involve itself in things of this nature, I despair of the future. That is one of the reasons why we have decided to raise this matter and to make this appeal to the Commonwealth Government to be powerful and strong enough to take the initiative in protecting this natural asset. Honourable senators who are supporting me will develop other points. I am certain that they will cover adequately those details which time has precluded me from including in my contribution to the debate. </para>

            <para>- I think I will be excused for referring to the fact that in speaking in this debate I am placed in a more difficult situation than perhaps any other senator apart from the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Scott),</inline> who represents the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn).</inline> 1 am the  chairman  of a committee appointed by the Senate to investigate and in due course to report on the off-shore petroleum legislation under very extensive terms of reference to which I will refer later. I am extremely concerned that in no sense will I, as  chairman  of that committee, breach the rules of the Senate or the secrecy of the proceedings of the committee. This is a problem that will confront all of us who are members of the committee appointed by the Senate when we talk about this matter. I was conscious that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> was labouring under this difficulty. I ask honourable senators to bear with me and to understand that, while there is a lot of evidence about which I would like to talk, in my view I am precluded from doing so. </para>

          <para>I put it to the Senate that the function of select committees, in which we are engaged much more now than we have been hitherto, is a very important extension of the work of the Senate. The success of select committees is very much the province of the whole of the Senate, not of any one part of it. I believe that anything which in the end tended to diminishThe status of select committees or to denigrate their work would do harm to the institution which we respect and which we hope will reach a higher status and a greater responsibility. </para>

              <para>- -Prior to the suspension of the sitting I had dealt quite briefly with the genera&#93; position of Senate select committees and with the problems that discussing their activities prior to the preparation of their reports presented to the members of the committees and, I suggested, particularly to the chairmen, who always have to be concerned that the committees operate within the terms of reference laid down for them by their colleagues in the Senate, and also in accordance with the Standing Orders of the Senate which lay down rules for the conduct of our affairs. I am concerned about discussing some of these matters within the terms of the urgency motion as they affect the work of the Senate Select Committee on Off-Shore Petroleum Resources along the lines upon which the Committee was set up in November 1967. I think it would be appropriate if I, in my position as  chairman,  referred to standing order 308, which no doubt has been dealt with before and I am sure will be dealt with by other honourable senators in the course of this debate. I think it is appropriate to mention some of these things in their proper order. Standing order 308 is a very clear Standing Order, in my interpretation, and has concerned me from the time I became  Chairman  of the Committee. Standing order 308 states: </para>

          <para class="block">That Standing Order restrains one, as a member of the Committee, from discussing freely some of the matters that have been referred to earlier and which, I am sure, will be referred to later.

          <para class="block">When we debated the petroleum Bills it was stated that the legislation was perhaps the largest piece of legislation to pass through the Commonwealth and the States since Federation. The operation is an immense one. Those who are engaged in the work of the Select Committee realise what an immense piece of legislation it was. It took something like 6 years to draw together. About 120 drafts went through the hands of the various draftsmen prior to completion. I read the terms of reference to remind honourable senators, and anybody who may be interested, of the extremely wide range of inquiry placed upon the Committee and therefore how difficult it is in this debate not. to impinge upon some area upon which evidence has been given to the Committee or upon opinions expressed which have not been reported to the Senate. I hope the Committee will permit me to make a progress report of our activities to the Senate fairly shortly. I have the progress report drafted, but I believe it only proper that the Committee as a whole should approve it prior to its being reported to the Senate. In many ways it would have been a good thing if I had been able to present the report this evening, but 1 cannot do that. I will do that as soon as the Committee reads the report and makes the changes that it thinks desirable. The Senate gave the Committee very wide terms of reference so it is entitled to hear the Committee&#39;s progress to a certain date. I have referred to standing order 308. I would be indebted to any of my colleagues, and anybody else interested, for any further discussion in which they may care to involve themselves on the meaning of standing order 308. I refer again, briefly, to term of reference (h) which states: the provisions of the legislation generally. </para>
          <para class="block">One of the difficulties with which we were confronted in this broad investigation was these areas of what might be called great public interest which were not specifically referred to within our terms of reference but obviously came under clause (h), a fairly wide clause which enabled us to look at and examine such matters. Early in our work it was quite apparent that the problem of drilling in the area of the Great Barrier Reef, and any possible damage that might flow from this drilling, was a matter of public interest not only in Queensland, and North Queensland in particular, but also in Australia generally. We took some trouble to consider the whole matter of our authority - I suppose that is the best word - to take this matter in hand and do what we could to find out about it. We did this. I . will refer to that later. Two facets of the legislation, it seemed to me as  chairman,  gave us sufficient authority to take some cognisance of this matter. Section 18 of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act states: (1.) The Designated Authority may, by instrument published in the Gazette, declare that a block specified in the instrument (not being a block in respect of which a permit or licence is in force or over or in which there is a pipeline) shall not be the subject of a permit, licence, special prospecting authority or access authority and that a pipeline licence shall not be granted in respect of a pipeline over or in that block. (2.) While a declaration under the last preceding sub-section remains in force in respect of a block, a permit, licence, special prospecting authority or access authority shall not be granted in respect of that block and a pipeline licence shall not be granted in respect of a pipeline over or in that block. </para>

          <para class="block">Those honourable senators who have followed this and have an interest in it will see, 1 think&#39;, that there are two areas where quite properly the Senate Select Committee, under term of reference (h) which relates to the legislation generally can look at the difficulties or problems associated with the region which is popularly called the Barrier Reef or the Great Barrier Reef. 1 do not want to canvass the issue of the extent of the Barrier Reef, nor do I want to canvass the possibilities or otherwise of damage because it seems to me that it would be not quite proper to do so. I have expressed the view in the Committee and 1 have also expressed it here in the Senate, that while it is quite in order for people to say that standing order 308 is wide and that they can make their own conclusions about it and behave in their own fashion according to their own interpretation of it, there is placed upon the Committee a very heavy responsibility because under that standing order, for the Committee to divulge its evidence and to speculate upon this mutter could bring upon it or its  chairman  a charge of breach of privilege. </para>

I further say to the Senate that the Committee has been concerned about this because we believe that Senate select committees now operating are inevitably laying down rules which could be called rules of precedent. Every later Senate select committee will have to take notice of these things and will say: &#39;Well, if it was good enough for them to do it. it is good enough for us.&#39; If, in our case, we are wrong then we are setting the pattern for a series of wrong events.

          <para>As I said earlier, there is a great area of public concern about possible activities in the Great Barrier Reef. The Committee recognised this very well and being conscious of it went to north Queensland. It spent the best part of a week in Townsville, in February. My colleagues and I had the fascinating experience of being in Townsville on the hottest day for 45 years. We met in a room with broken down airconditioning. Nobody could say in this instance that the Committee was not prepared to go there and try to find out about conditions in that area. We did our best, on behalf of the Senate, to be available to any person who felt that he had a genuine case to put about the Great Barrier Reef and a genuine concern to express. From the point of view of the Senate, I think this was welcomed by the people in that area. They felt that this was a chance for them to express their views. One did not necessarily always agree with them. After leaving Townsville we went to Brisbane and did some more work in this regard. Since returning to Canberra, the Senate having resumed its sittings, we have done a little more work here. This is what we have tried to do and this will, in due course, come out in our report. </para>

            <para>- I believe it unnecessary to express the importance to Queensland, and indeed to Australia, of the natural wonders of the Great Barrier Reef and the desirability of preserving them. I believe it would be generally acknowledged that as a tourist attraction the Reef would be worth millions of dollars to Australia in terms of direct and indirect spending. However, that alone is not a sufficient basis on which to determine this issue. The exploitation of the Reef is a national problem and one that must be tackled by the national parliament. As the Great Barrier Reef is one of the wonders of the world it is unnecessary, I believe, to stress its importance, but as a representative of Queensland it is necessary to stress the real fears of the people of Queensland that insufficient is being done by the Commonwealth Government to preserve the Reef. Surely their fears are well founded when they read the statement made by the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn)</inline> who said that while the Government was concerned that any proposal to mine at the Great Barrier Reef might lead to damage or desecration of this magnificent wonder, we cannot ignore the fact that we do not know where our power lies in this direction. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline>here we have a responsible Minister of the Crown saying that he does not know where the powers of the national government lie in relation to the preservation of the Great Barrier Reef. What a statement to make! There was no indication as to how the Federal Government was endeavouring to extend its influence in this matter; there was no indication of discussions between the Federal and State Governments aimed at resolving the situation; there was no indication of the Federal Government exerting all the power at its disposal. </para>
          <para>I have always believed that in the federation of Australia, where the statutes of the State and Federal parliaments conflicted the Federal statutes were supreme. In those circumstances I suggest that the national parliament should see that its powers in this direction are supreme. However, at the present time we have a negative approach on the part of the Minister for National Development. He does not indicate that there is to be any change in approach. I suggest that the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Parliament are not so slow to enforce their supremacy in other directions. For instance, in the trade union field, if a branch of a union has a rule which differs from that of the federal union the branch rule is disallowed. I believe the same procedure should be adopted in this matter under discussion because I believe all would agree that the control of the Great Barrier Reef is a national responsibility and should not be left at the discretion of any State. </para>
          <para>We appear to be doing nothing positive about the Great Barrier Reef. We seem to be hoping that something will turn up. This was evident from the remarks of the Minister yesterday in another place. In his speech he said that the Commonwealth is unlikely - and I stress the word &#39;unlikely&#39; - to grant future applications to mine in the area of the Great Barrier Reef until more is known of the possibility of damaging the Reef. Yet the State Government ofQueenslandisatthisverymomentcon- sidering the granting of leases to institutions to mine the Great Barrier Reef. The Queensland Government probably has before it at this very moment an application from a consortium to mine the Reef, the principal of the consortium being no less a person than the Premier of Queensland who has a substantial number of shares in it. </para>
          <para>What will be the situation if we, as the national parliament, say that we do not know where our powers lie in this direction while the State Government grants a permit or lease to mine the Reef? Surely we have a responsibility to Australia, and indeed, to the world, to say that we shall do everything possible to preserve this natural wonder for posterity. Could it be that the application now before the Queensland Cabinet is being considered because of the factors I have outlined; inasmuch as a consortium has made the application? I repeat that the Premier of Queensland is a principal shareholder in that consortium, holding 1 million shares of a total of 15 million. I repeat that this is a particularly shameful proposal and the national Government should see that it does not come to fruition. It is criminal even to consider any application to mine an area before proper precautions in the way of adequate investigations are taken. And those precautions must be taken at this stage. I am confident that honourable senators will agree with me that as yet no proper investigation has been made. Indeed, the Minister for National Development admitted that yesterday in another place. If this is to be the way in which the national parliament treats the situation with regard to one of the great wonders of the world then I believe future generations will look upon the national parliament with some degree of disgust for not having protected the interests of Australia. </para>
          <para>Let us examine the dangers inherent in the granting of a licence to mine in this area. Firstly there is the danger of possible immediate damage to the Reef. Secondly, a well having been sunk, who can guarantee that an incident similar to the Bass Strait happening will not occur? Thirdly, oil having been found, what are the dangers of a ship loaded with oil foundering on the Reef, and what damage could result therefrom? ls it worth the risk to endanger one of the wonders of the world in order to find petroleum? This is the question which honourable senators must answer in arriving at a decision on this motion. If they are thinking only of immediate gain they will answer yes, because they will be looking for a dollar. On the other hand, if they answer no, then they will be indicating that they are conscious of the worth to Australia of preserving the Great Barrier Reef in its natural state as against any immediate monetary gain. I suggest with respect that the Government is not doing all that it could do to protect the Reef. We on this side say that no mining leases should be granted until proper investigations have been made, and we implore this Government to do its utmost to influence the Queensland Government to adopt a similar attitude and thus protect one of the great wonders of the world. </para>
          <para>I have referred to the remarks of the Minister for National Development in another place. After hearing those remarks, is it any wonder that the Opposition brings forward this emergency motion which refers to: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The failure of the Government to give an adequate assurance that oil drilling and mining in the Great Barrier Reef areas will not be permitted. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>We know that the Minister himself is genuinely concerned that irreparable damage may be done to the Great Barrier Reef should mining operations continue in that area. Consequently I submit the Opposition is justified in bringing this emergency motion forward so that honourable senators might express their dissatisfaction with the way in which this problem has been approached up to date. I repeat that I do not believe that the national Parliament has exercised sufficient power in dealing with the problem. 1 believe that it is the responsibility of the national Parliament to use its powers, because the Great Barrier Reef is somthing that should be preserved for the future of Australia. </para>

The interesting feature about his remarks is that he criticises the Commonwealth Government in respect of some action that it might take to exercise control over the Great Barrier Reef. It must be remembered that, under the off-shore legislation that was passed some time last year- </para>

              <para>- Or the year before, under that legislation the designated authority is given the power to grant leases. That designated authority may be a State officer, but the Commonwealth retains the right of veto. It is all very well for members of the Labor Party to criticise us for what action they think the Commonwealth Government might take. What happened when a Labor government was in office? It granted the only lease in perpetuity to mine tin on the Queensland coast. Honourable senators opposite may attempt to contradict that if they wish, but the fact is that a Labor government granted a company a lease in perpetuity for the mining of tin on the Queensland coast, and everybody in Queensland was disgusted at its action. </para>

I say at the outset that the Government is appreciative of the wonderful asset we have in the Great Barrier Reef which extends for some 1,200 miles along the coast of Queensland. 1 understand that the Queensland Department of Mines received two applications for permits to drill for oil adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. The sites were 18 miles away from the Reef. One was the Elliston Reef and the other was Pentecost Island. The application for a permit to drill adjacent to Pentecost Island was refused by the Queensland Government. </para>

              <para>- The members of the Opposition can always give it, but they can never take it. I shall go on with my speech in my own sweet way and I shall not quote from Hansard if I can possibly avoid it. The Queensland Minister for Mines is reputed to have said that he has known that there has been a great deal of controversy over the Great Barrier Reef. He should be one person in Australia who at least knows as much about this matter as anybody else because he has lived on the Great Barrier Reef. Indeed, the Reef is in his electorate. Because it is in his electorate he has made a complete study of it. I should like honourable senators to know that 1 also have been in a position to make a complete study of parts of the Barrier Reef. Having heard of the Reef&#39;s great tourist potential I visited it in August last year. I went out to Green Island, which is off Cairns, and 1 was amazed at the great tourist potential of that island. I was told, and T believe, that Green Island has the only observatory in the world where people can go below the surface of the water and look outside the observatory to see the fish. </para>

              <para>- They were looking in to see me. At all other places throughout the world the fish are in the observatory and one looks in to see them. I was very impressed by what I saw. While in the observatory we saw hundreds of different species of fish swimming about within a few feet of us. I thought that the colours of the Great Barrier Reef were some of the most marvellous and dazzling colours that would be available for one to see in any part of the world. Honourable senators opposite have said that the Government must be most careful about what it does in relation to the Great Barrier Reef and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has objected to my reading from Hansard. I agree with his objection, up to a point, but I thought it necessary to read this passage and to memorise it because it is quite important and relates to the approach to the mining industry taken by some honourable senators. Members of the Opposition in another place have said that there should be no mining or drilling in searching for oil within 100 miles of the east of the Great Barrier Reef. Of course, this is very learned stuff because the maps reveal that the depth of the ocean 100 miles east of the Great Barrier Reef is probably greater than the depth to which any well can be drilled at the moment. </para>

All that the Labor Party is en deavouring to do is to play political football as it did with the Chowilla Dam and as it has been doing over the last fortnight on another issue. Its purpose is to gain a cheap political advantage. </para>

            <para>-  As a member of the Senate Select Committee appointed to examine and analyse the very important off-shore oil exploration and exploitation legislation passed by the Commonwealth Parliament I desire to express my disappointment that: the important question of the Barrier Reef and its future should be the subject of a debate as a matter of urgency in the Senate this evening. I share the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton, Chairman</inline> of the Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources. I have endeavoured lo conform to standing order 308 and to reserve the deliberations of the Committee as a subject of debate until our work is completed and we are in a position to report to the Senate in conformity with the requirements of Senate Standing Orders. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that the question of the future of the Barrier. Reef is too all-important to discuss in these circumstances. As a member of the Select Committee appointed by the Senate I believe I am restricted in my contribution to this debate if I am to continue to conform to standing order 308. It states very definitely and without any ambiguity that in my position 1 am not to disclose the deliberations of the Committee until its report has been presented to the Senate. Senators of all political shades from all States are members of the Committee. I say without hesitation that there is not one member of the Committee who is not genuinely and sincerely concerned and interested in the future of the Barrier Reef, irrespective of which State he comes from and the Party he represents. Not one member of the Committee has a monopoly of interest in or concern about the future of the Barrier Reef. Every Australian accepts the Reef as one of the wonders of the world, as it would be classified by most visitors from overseas who have been privileged to see it. </para>
          <para>I wonder what is the real purpose of this debate tonight, lt is being conducted prematurely before the Committee has had time to submit its report. Is it because this debate is being broadcast and someone believes that he can gain a cheap political advantage? </para>

As a Queenslander I do not. I believe that the Barrier Reef belongs to Queensland and that it is the responsibility of the Queensland Government to see that it is properly protected. I cannot go into the subject of the evidence that has been submitted for and against the exploitation of the Reef for oil. I have already explained that as a member of the Committee I am pledged to observe the Standing Orders. It will suffice to say that I cannot for the life of me imagine that any responsible person in the Commonwealth Government or any State government would knowingly and consciously permit exploration for oil on the Barrier Reef unless he was completely and entirely satisfied that the exploration could be carried out without any adverse effect on the Reef, in part or in whole. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne</inline> is  a  member of the Committee as I am. He has heard the evidence of responsible men in the north and in Brisbane, including evidence from a chief mining engineer. He has heard evidence from legal men who participated in the long deliberations that after a period of 6 years brought forth the legislation. Six States reached agreement with the Commonwealth on this unique legislation. Indeed, it was an epochal event for six States and the Commonwealth to come to agreement on anything. I do not subscribe to the view that a Minister of the Crown in Queensland or anywhere else, irrespective of his political party, would be so irresponsible as to approve of work being done on the Reef until he had had evidence to satisfy him beyond doubt that the work could be done without damage to or destruction of the Reef. </para>

          <para>I would like to have had a real debate on the Reef in this chamber tonight and I would have enjoyed it, just as I am sure everyone who is privileged to listen to a debate on such an important matter as this would have enjoyed it. But in the circumstances we are not able to have that debate. It is to be regretted that the matter was introduced in this way - prematurely and ill-conceived. It occurs to me that senators selected to do the responsible work of committee investigation are not given very much security in the work they are doing. </para>

I have been a regular attender at the sessions of the Committee and have found them to be most interesting, educational and informative, but for all that I find that a Committee member wants to go off on his own representing himself as the great defender of the Great Barrier Reef and giving the impression that the other members of the Committee have no concern about its future and would sacrifice it to the oil companies.

              <para>- Well, normally. They would have you believe that there is no other threat to the Reef. Before the question of oil exploration is considered at all there is a danger from oil tankers which travel the coast of Queensland delivering oil to Cairns and Townsville and other points. If a tanker was unfortunate enough to be wrecked or damaged and there was a leak from it and the oil was swept to the Reef, the Reef could be damaged just as badly as any exploration would damage it - that is, if oil has the damaging effect that we believe it has. But even in regard to that matter there is a difference of opinion by people engaged in scientific research into these questions. I do not want to proceed any further because I will be enticed into the field of evidence, and I do not want that to happen. Let me reiterate that 1 support, concur in and share the views of the  Chairman  of the Committee as expressed at the outset of his speech tonight. I say again that it is to be regretted that this debate has been brought on and that this matter unquestionably has been made a party political football. </para>

The subject that has been brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> for debate as a matter of urgency certainly has a two pronged purpose. I do not believe he brought it forward for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef.

              <para>- That statement was made in November of last year. Some very interesting points are associated with mining in the Great Barrier Reef. If as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources I am allowed to traverse one or two of my own thoughts in relation to this matter, 1 must say that I myself certainly have informed this Senate that 1 am concerned that permits to explore for oil in the Great Barrier Reef and in submerged lands may be granted. It is a ridiculous proposition that we hear from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keeffe</inline> to the effect that this Federal Government has no right whatsoever to advise the Queensland Government- </para>

This Commonwealth Government has absolutely no control of the land areas of Queensland.

Is it known to the Federal authorities, and is it a fact that the Queensland Government is likely within the next few days to announce (Ite successful applicants for exploration permits over a considerable area of the Great Barrier Reef?

              <para>- Indeed, the honourable senator is right. He will find that demonstrated from this corner of the Senate on many occasions. The fact is that at this point in time there is no knowledge or method known in the world - 1 speak not from evidence presented to the Senate Select Committee but from my own experience overseas - as I understand it, to control the flow of oil should such a flow occur in such a submerged drilling. Indeed, had the leak in Bass Strait been an oil flow instead of gas flow it would have been a disaster. What a redundant type of argument it is for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> to put forward in this Senate that an adequate assurance should be given by the Government that no oil drilling or mining in the Great Barrier Reef areas will be permitted - full-stop. None will ever be permitted! Surely there is enough intelligence in this Senate to appreciate that some progressive thinking takes place somewhere in the world - even though it may not be on the left side of the Senate - and that in due time it will be possible to control an oil flow if there should be a leak such as occurred in the Santa Barbara Channel. </para>

          <para>Incidentally, you may recall, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> that I asked a question on this very point in the Senate, lt appears at page 170 of Hansard of 27th February 1969. Wishing to avoid the very difficult position of discussing a matter that is before the Senate Select Committee on Off-Shore Petroleum Resources, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott,</inline> this question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Can the Minister representing the Minister for National Development advise the Senate of the preparations which have been made by either Slate or Commonwealth authorities to reduce the incidence of damage which may occur should an oil tanker founder and break up on the Australian coast? ls it a fact that no preparations arc in hand which would be effective to meet such an occurrence? Would the Minister request hi* Department lo meet appropriate State authorities and give urgent consideration to this  important  matter? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I believe that question time in the Senate is for this purpose. In a very wide and new field of legislation and remembering that there are six States joined with the Commonwealth in this matter, I feel that it is necessary to alert any authority as to what should be done for the protection of certain areas of our coast. Indeed, it may not be on the Great Barrier Reef where the first oil tragedy of this type may occur on the Australian coast. We should be well aware and well alert as to what can be done. </para>
          <para>Indeed, there are moves afoot these days whereby, if a tanker founders, it is possible to use polystyrene type submerged pontoons which can be floated around the stricken vessel and used to control it so that it can be dispersed at a later date. When I was in New York last year, I viewed a film of the use of a disperser which is put out by the Esso organisation. This is able to be sprayed on the surface of the water and so granulate the oil and make it possible for bacterial action in the sea to disperse the oil by natural methods. It is redundant for the Opposition to put forward the suggestion that no permit should be granted particularly when the Australian Labor Party was the first one to breach this suggested principle some years ago by granting permits for dredging on the Queensland coast. The Opposition should be greatly dishonoured by the facts which have come to light this evening. </para>
          <para>May I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen.</inline> He is one member of the Labor Party in the Senate who raised last year a question, which was answered, regarding what companies have been granted oil or mining exploration leases in the Great Barrier Reef area. The answer is very interesting. I suggest that honourable senators look at it on page 83 of the Senate Hansard.

The Queensland Minister for Mines, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Camm,</inline> promised that this week he would announce the successful applicants. That simply is the reason for the urgency motion that has been brought before the Senate today. It is urgent that we clear up the area of dispute as to who has the authority to grant these leases. The heading &#34;Area Q/1PA&#39; has listed below it the names of about forty companies that applied for it. The heading Area Q/2PA&#39; has listed below it the names of about thirty companies. The numbers of applicants foi the rest of the areas then fall away. 1 suggest that this matter should be resolved immediately. We on this side of the Senate are considerably concerned about the activities of the present Queensland Government, lt has been said here tonight that not one off-shore lease has been granted. But that is not so. Exoil NL was awarded lease Q/8P under the transitional provisions of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act as from 1st September 1968. That off-shore lease was granted to Exoil NL, which is a company about which 1 have been asking questions in this chamber. The reason why I have been doing so is that one of the prime movers in the establishment of Exoil NL was the present Premier of the State of Queensland. </para>

              <para>- I will try to moderate my approach. However, I feel strongly on this matter. Earlier tonight <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> indicated that the Queensland Minister for Mines, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Camm,</inline> was considerably concerned about the Barrier Reef; that he lived close to it; and that he thought it was a place of great beauty. But let me refer to the Queensland &#39;Government Gazette&#39;, No. 23, which contains a notice of grant of permit Q/8P signed- by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Camm. Mr Camm</inline> - the Minister who showed such concern about the Great Barrier Reef - was the man who signed away a lease within the Great Barrier Reef area. He signed it away to a company in which his leader is one of the major shareholders. I am sorry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> but I must insist that this is fair political comment. I suggest to honourable senators that if they want to make a quick quid they might have a look at the list of areas available for lease and look particularly at area Q/9PA. </para>

              <para>- There are no applications for that area. I suggest to honourable senators that they pay $4 and obtain the right to explore or exploit that area. If they have the facilities of one member of the Queensland Government in particular, they could turn that $4 into $720,000 within the space of 4 years. This is a dangerous situation. Oil exploration - something that we badly need - is being used not to find oil for the benefit of Australia but to make a kill on the share market. I believe that it is a reasonable comment to make that the activities of the present Queensland Government and the improper behaviour of certain of its Ministers place in doubt its ability to supervise the exploitation- </para>

              <para>- I represent Queensland and I have to live under the Queensland State Government. I submit that in Queensland a conflict of interest endangers the future of the Barrier Reef. I hope that does not offend the sensitivity of honourable senators opposite. The matter in question is an important one. The recent transactions in Queensland, with one lease having been granted by the present Queensland Government, are cause for concern and cause for urgency in this House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Camm</inline> was to have made a statement yesterday, 4th March 1969, regarding which applicants were successful, but this statement has been held back; posibly for two reasons. Honourable senators opposite may say that I am not charitable, but I think the reason why the names of the successful applicants have not been announced is that one of the prime leases has been applied for by the company that I mentioned before, Exoil (NL), in which a Queensland Minister has considerable holdings. But I will be more charitable than that. Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fairbairn</inline> stated that the Commonwealth is unlikely to grant future applications to mine in this area - the Reef - until more is known of the possibility of causing damage. I am prepared to accept that that statement has thrown the Queensland Government into a flap. It is not prepared to announce the names of the successful applicants. I took time off to ask someone to ring the Queensland Department of Mines, which would not say a word. It would not state when it was likely to announce the names of the successful applicants. I hope that the statement made by the Minister for National Development is sufficient to make the Queensland Government think twice. I also hope that this debate tonight will make the Queensland Government think again. 1 believe, as all honourable senators on this side believe, that the Barrier Reef must be protected at all costs and should not be subjected to the risk associated with oil drilling and oil exploration. The Reef, as a tourist attraction, has an economic potential far greater than that which it would have if oil were produced in the area of the Reef. Honourable senators should consider all those people who are under the age of 20 years, who are not represented here and who have no voice, and should consider that these people need the Reef as a heritage and as a resort to which they can go to see one of the greatest wonders of the world. The Reef has more economic potential through tourism than it would have if oil were discovered there in large quantities. It is a matter of urgency that we should take great care. As 1 suggested before, time is running out. If the Queensland Government is permitted to proceed with the granting of applications and if the oil companies defy the Commonwealth Government, all the work that has been done by the Senate Select Committee will have been wasted. It is urgent that something should be done now. 1 ask honourable senators to support the motion. </para>

            <para>-  I am surprised and I regret very deeply that the Opposition has seen fit to move an urgency motion on a subject such as this. In November 1967 the Senate Select Committee on Off -Shore Petroleum Resources was established to consider all the aspects of Australia&#39;s off-shore oil areas. It had very wide terms of reference, which covered consideration of such areas as the Great Barrier Reef. Since that time the Committee has worked, 1 consider, being a member of the Committee - as members of other select committees would agree - very effectively, very fully and very conscientiously and has been willing to take evidence from everybody who showed any concern about  any  aspect whatsoever of the oil industry or of the off-shore areas of the Commonwealth. I thought that the Senate would have shown enough respect for the responsibility and personnel of the Committee to give it the opportunity to presenting its report before certain sections of the Senate, particularly the Opposition members, should see fit to move an urgency motion, to play some other game and to try to weaken the strength, the work and the efficiency of the Committee which has worked so hard. Tonight <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> said that he felt like resigning. ) am not trying to stress the importance of the work of one committee any more than the work of any other committee, but I happen fo be a member of this Committee so I shall speak within this area. I. along with the other members of the Committee, accept full responsibility for what it is doing. 1. along with other members, attended regularly. The Committee meets outside of Senate sitting time and outside of parliamentary time and is working to present a report which it considers, in its judgment, will be in the best interests of the Commonwealth. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is with regret that tonight we see the Opposition moving an urgency motion. I discount the Opposition thinking that the Committee is not functioning extremely well. I hope that the Opposition has more respect for the personalities on the Committee than to think that. I hope I am right in my judgment on that aspect. Therefore I look to two alternatives. We now realise, as was pointed out tonight, that this year Queensland will have an election. If we did not realise that before we only had to listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline> when he went out of bounds and took advantage of the  President  by saying the things which he said.  His  speech was not a speech on the preservation of the Barrier Reef; it was an election speech and I regret that the honourable senator saw fit to make an election speech at this time in this chamber. If honourable senators opposite see fit to denigrate the Select Committee for the sake of politics I think it is high time that some of them slopped and had a good look at the origin of the parliamentary institution. I agree that in all probability politics provided one of the main reasons why the urgency motion was moved. Another reason - and let us consider this - is that today, Wednesday, the proceedings are broadcast. The Opposition was aware that today the defence statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> was to be debated. What happened? We are aware that a discussion on defence has been taking place in another place. We are aware also that the Prime Minister has made his statement on defence and that it has been accepted not only by the people of Australia and by the Press of Australia but that it has been accepted and welcomed very warmly by the Prime Minister of Singapore. The Opposition saw fit to try to find some weak spots in the defence statement made by the Prime Minister. It tried to do this in (he other place, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, but</inline> the plan backfired. The Opposition therefore was nol very keen to speak on defence today while the Senate proceedings were being broadcast so what did it do? It turned to an alternative subject and brought forward an urgency motion relating to the Great Barrier Reef. The Opposition may want to chicken out, but I regret very much that honourable senators opposite have seen fit to denigrate the work of a Select Committee of this Senate. </para>

              <para>- The Opposition has denigrated the work of the Select Committee. It knows that members of that Committee have a responsibility. The Committee realises that it must work within the confines of a select committee. If Opposition senators do not believe this, let mc refer again to standing order 308.

          <para class="block">So how much ground can we cover tonight in this discussion on the Great Barrier Reef? Let me go further on this point. One would think from the way that the Opposition is carrying on tonight that this Select Committee does not even know that the Great Barrier Reef exists. The debate is being broadcast and I will let the people of Australia who are listening - and I hope there are a lot of them - know that the Committee saw fit, before the Parliament resumed for this sessional period, to go to Queensland to take evidence about the very thing that we are discussing tonight, the Great Barrier Reef. The Committee took evidence in northern Queensland. We heard evidence from anybody willing to appear before us. All sorts of evidence dealing with the Barrier Reef was presented to the Committee. The Committee then moved lo Brisbane and there again all who felt they had something to contribute, be it from one point of view or another, were given the opportunity to come along and give their evidence. The Committee has shown conclusively that it accepts the fact that there is a Great Barrier Reef. May I say also that it is very conscious that we have only one Great Barrier Reef.  1  do no intend to say anything more about the Great Barrier Reef. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> said tonight, we are privileged to serve as members of the select committee and to do what we consider will be in the best interests of the area in which we work. However, we also know that we have responsibilities to that committee and to this Senate. Therefore it is not for me tonight to comment on evidence that has been given. I could talk very easily about newspaper reports. I am referring to the reports about evidence given to the Committee. However, I am not prepared to speak about the type of evidence that was given to this Select Committee. I will say that we have received evidence which completely conflicts with other evidence given to us.  1  think this shows conclusively that the Committee has a big job to do and a great responsibility when it comes to its final conclusions. Would it be right for a member of the Committee to show any bias whatsoever tonight about aspects of the Great Barrier Reef? I say it would not be right. Is it right for any member of the Senate at this stage to start forcing issues one way or the other about the Great Barrier Reef? I say it is not right. </para>
          <para>Members of the Opposition have seen fit tonight to stand up and to spruik, for political advantage, about the Great Barrier Reef. We all know of the possibilities of the Great Barrier Reef and I want to make that point clear; but Opposition members are speaking, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> did tonight, in a certain manner and with an extreme political bias. They are trying to take political advantage of a situation and at the same time are denigrating the responsibility of the Committee and the responsibility of those who are members of it. I would say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> that if he is so concerned about the Great Barrier Reef why did he not give evidence to the Committee when it was in Queensland? Why did he not give evidence while we were in Townsville or Brisbane? Why has he not bothered to come before the Committee when it has been sitting in this House? He would only have to wait overnight in order to appear before the Committee. We would hear what he has to say. But no; he waited until the Senate debates were being broadcast. Why did he do this? He did so to make political capital. I wonder now. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, in</inline> all sincerity, which has the greater influence on his mind at the present moment - political gain or the preservation of the Reef. If it is the Great Barrier Reef why did he not come to Queensland and give evidence to us? We were willing to hear what he had to say. I say to honourable senators opposite who have stood up tonight and carried on as they have done, that the Senate Select Committee is a responsible Committee and we welcome those who are willing to give evidence to us. We are doing a job and we will gladly hear evidence on any aspect which a person wishes to bring forward, so long as it comes within the confines of our terms of reference, so that in the long term we will be able to bring down a report which is in the best interests of this Senate, this Parliament and the nation as a whole. </para>
          <para>In conclusion I say again that I regret very deeply that this issue has been brought into the Senate before the Senate Select Committee has had time to bring down its report. The subject has been raised either to dodge an issue that the Opposition was not prepared to debate tonight, because the proceedings were being broadcast, or in order to gain help for an election campaign in Queensland because the Opposition thought that this subject might bring it political capital. So far as I am concerned, certain principles should be observed. As a member of this Senate I shall stand up for my principles and pass no comment whatever about the Great Barrier Reef at this stage. </para>

I hoped, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that there would have been a more analytical and dispassionate approach to this particularly important problem. As we realise, the Great Barrier Reef is a State asset but it is part  of the national heritage. 1 should have liked to see a wider motion than the one we are discussing. I think the motion is worthy of serious consideration but I would have liked to see it state that there was to be no despoliation of the Reef until more is known about it. </para>

          <para>I heard a Minister tonight refer to the Queensland Minister for Mines as having a complete knowledge of the Great Barrier Reef. Let me assure him that no one has a complete knowledge of the Reef; nor has any particular group of scientists. Nor has the Liberal and Australian Country Party Government spent much money in furthering the scientific knowledge of the Reef. The Government has been miserably parsimonious on all occasions. The only place where there is a chair of marine biology is at Townsville and no special grant has been made by the Federal Government through the Department of Education and Science for its work. That is the approach of this Government. There is a small marine biological research station at Heron Island and on one occasion the Government granted $10,000 for that work. The staff there today consists of one scientist and one maintenance officer. These are the only people engaged on full time marine research and located within the precincts of the Great Barrier Reef. Heron Island is part and parcel of the Great Barrier Reef. Irrespective of what an honourable senator on the Government side said, the Reef is all around it. </para>
          <para>The Great Barrier Reef is an extraordinary structure; it is the biggest structure ever made by man or animal in the history of the world. It is magnificent and it is attractive. The Government has the responsibility to see that it is maintained in this way. Irrespective of the camouflage that has been introduced into this debate tonight about the Senate Select Committee, we are attempting, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> to do something to avoid the granting of leases to a particular company, if possible. The Government has the right of veto. There is this dual pattern of control. The Government has the right of veto, because there is a dual system of control over exploring for oil in submerged lands. I know the constitutional position with relation to the ownership of the Great Barrier Reef. </para>

              <para>- The State owns the Great Barrier Reef but this Government has never bacl the courage to declare the waters between the Reef and the mainland to be Australian waters. This is typical of the lack of courage this Government constantly exhibits. I do not think the Attorney- General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bowen)</inline> has ever explored the possibility of declaring these waters to be Australian waters. After all, they are in fact sea waters covering submerged mainland. The history of the area is that this land was part of the Australian continent many years ago. It is now submerged land, but this Government, has not had the courage to explore the possibility of declaring the waters of the Great  Barrier Reef to be Australian territorial waters. </para>

          <para>Let us look at the position as it really is. Exploring for and mining of oil will not be the only methods of destroying the Great Barrier Reef. Part of it has been destroyed already by the Crown of Thorns starfish as a result of the removal of Triton shellfish by tourists. I do not know whether honourable senators know how the scientists believe that parts of the Reef have been destroyed. It is their opinion that destruction has resulted from the removal of the Triton shells. The ecology of this area is based on the relationship between the Triton and the Crown of Thorns starfish. This is responsible for the preservation of the coral. An infinitesimal organism, the coral polyp has built up this tremendous structure of dead coral with live coral on top of it, surrounded by a multitudinous array of marine organisms and plant life. Yet, when the Labor Party proposes an urgency motion such as the one before us Government senators impute to our members all the improper motives they can possibly devise in their extraordinarily low minds. That is the best way I can put it. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline>has tried to impress upon the Government tonight the concern that he and other honourable senators on this side have to see that no further leases shall be granted. He outlined in detail how a particular consortium of oil exploration companies is seeking to exploit the position. He mentioned Exoil (NL) and Transoil in particular. A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stiller</inline> is  Chairman  of Directors. They are major oil companies. </para>
          <para class="block">They are applicants for exploration leases. One lease has been granted already. We must look at this position in a fair, factual way in order to arrive at what is likely to be the outcome. I am not imputing improper motives to the members of the Queensland Cabinet at all. I am merely adopting a realistic, practical, factual approach to the position in which these men are placed. They happen to be cronies or very great friends of their leader, the Premier of Queensland. He had a lease in northwestern Queensland. Fifty-one percent of the shareholding was ultimately taken over by an American company. Then the Exoil company, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stiller</inline> is  Chairman,  took over Artesian Basin Oil Pty Ltd, which held the earlier exploration lease, that company being granted I million shares of which the Premier of Queensland holds 49%. He has since bought another 45,000 shares so that he actually owns over 500,000 shares in this oil company.  His  colleagues are now sitting in judgment to decide whether a company of which he is the major shareholder shall be granted the right to explore for oil in the vicinity of the Great Barrier Reef. Is it any wonder that the Labor Party sees fit to bring forward this urgency motion? It is to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe&#39;s</inline> credit that he was prepared to submit the motion and so face the odium that Government senators seek to hurl at him. </para>
          <para>Let us consider some of the things they have said. It has been said by Government senators that a Labour government granted a tin lease in perpetuity in Queensland. I do not know where they got this information. No Queensland government, whether it be Labor or otherwise has granted any lease in perpetuity in the last 50 years. I think the lease to which reference was made is a coral dredging lease granted to the Queensland Cement and Lime Company when it was running short of lime. It is a lease over a patch of dead coral which is not connected in any way with the Great Barrier Reef. It is in the south of Queensland. I point out for the information of honourable senators on the Government side that the Great Barrier Reef extends from near Torres Strait in the north down to Sandy Cape on Fraser Island, which is just outside Maryborough. It covers a distance of 1,200 miles. No part of the Great </para>
          <para class="block">Barrier Reef is off Moreton Bay or anywhere just outside Brisbane at all. The lease mentioned was a dredging lease which was granted by a Labor government to provide the Queensland Cement and Lime Company with a reasonable and permanent supply of coral. But no lease is granted in perpetuity. All leases, whether mineral or oil, are granted for specified periods. The exploration company, or the developing company, has the right to apply for an extension of lease at the end of the specified period and, depending on whether the work they have done or the development they have carried out is satisfactory, approval is given to their application. If what they have done is satisfactory, their lease will almost certainly be extended. This is not unreasonable. It is a reasonable policy, and it ill becomes the members of this Government to seek to besmirch a Queensland Labor government so unfairly and so untruthfully. But, of course, this is but typical of this Government&#39;s approach to such matters. And Government senators have the temerity, the colossal impudence and the hide to suggest that we are merely electioneering in submitting this motion. </para>

              <para>-  It is not true at all. Anyhow, if it is, what is wrong with that? There is nothing wrong with it. This afternoon, a distinguished lady senator from South Australia who sits on the Government side submitted a couple of questions in which she sought to impute improper motives to Labor senators from South Australia. She sought to enhance the declining prestige of the Liberal Government in South Australia. Is that not electioneering? Is that not trying to bolster up the political party with which honourable senators opposite are associated? Of course it is. We are proud of the Party to which we belong and we look forward to the day when the interests of Australia will be safeguarded by Labor governments not only in the States but also in the Commonwealth sphere. </para>

              <para>- Is not that in your own hands? You are the Government? Let us get back to the Barrier Reef. I do plead with honourable senators on the Government side to adopt the approach that has been suggested. In this Barrier Reef we have a magnificent structure. Anyone who has been there has expressed for the Reef an admiration far in excess of that expressed for any other natural phenomenon. In the Great Barrier Reef we have an extraordinary array of colours. We have myriads of different forms of fish, we have a multitudinous array of plant life and numbers of islands of various types. Some are of coral formation; others are of volcanic formation. These have sunk into the sea and, with the coral formations surrounding them present a spectacle which excites the admiration. This great wonder attracts people from all over the world. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>Do Government members propose only to worship Mammon? Is money all that they think about when considering the search for oil in this area? Is their only consideration going to be the amount of coral that can be taken from the Reef for cementmaking purposes especially when there are tremendous deposits of coral on the mainland. Is this all that is going to be in the minds of Queensland Cabinet Ministers when they see fit to grant oil leases as they have to their Premier? Is monetary reward to be all that spurs them on? We suggest that in the Great Barrier Reef Australia has something of which all can be proud and for which all have a responsibility. The Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn)</inline> said that it was unlikely that there would be drilling on the Reef, but he gave no real assurance in the other place yesterday that there would be a preservation of this structure until scientific information was available to show that it would suffer no damage if oil escaped during exploration projects. </para>
          <para>Someone mentioned tonight that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morley,</inline> the present State Mining Engineer who is likely to retire, appeared before the Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources and said that there was no evidence that damage had been caused by oil. If he had only read the newspapers he would have known what had happened on the south coast of England when a tanker broke up. In that instance millions of dollars were spent in an endeavour not to eliminate the nuisance but to minimise it. There was recently an oil leak in the Santa Barbara Channel off the coast of California, as a result of which the people of that area alone are seeking from the oil company, through the United States Government, damages to the extent of $ 1,300m. That is the result of one oil leak. I believe that since that leak was stopped another has developed. Fish have been destroyed and birds have died. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morley,</inline> a witness before the Select Committee, said that there was no evidence that oil in the sea had caused any damage. It is interesting to note that the Premier of Queensland, who has done so much in the interests of the oil industry in that State, did not see fit to appear before the Committee. </para>

            <para>- 1 oppose the motion. The Senate is discussing a motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> that the Senate should adjourn until tomorrow for the purpose of debating a matter of urgency, namely, the failure of the Government to give an adequate assurance that oil drilling and mining in the Great Barrier Reef areas will not be permitted. The moving of this motion at a late stage this afternoon was an exercise by the Opposition of the powers conferred by the Standing Orders of the Senate whereby senators may move that a matter of urgency be discussed. It is significant that if this motion had not been moved the Opposition in this place would have been compelled, through its various spokesmen, to indicate which of its various views on defence put forward by its spokesmen in the House of Representatives they were prepared to espouse. I imagine that was the challenge that was before honourable senators opposite. So we have had a discussion this afternoon and this evening on whether or not oil drilling and mining in the Great Barrier Reef areas should be permitted. The Opposition feels on safer ground with this somewhat innocuous subject than it would be with the very difficult subject of defence on which its views are so numerous that it does not know where it stands. </para>

              <para>- In deference to your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, and</inline> if I may be permitted to say so in deference to the sensitivity of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe,</inline> because possibly some of the barbs have struck home, I shall now deal with the subject of the motion which is whether or not oil drilling and mining in the Great Barrier Reef areas should be permitted. In a consideration of the urgency of this matter it might be relevant to mention to the Senate that this issue was discussed in the House of Representatives yesterday where the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn),</inline> on behalf of the Government, stated explicitly what the Government&#39;s attitude was. I should have imagined that if the Opposition was sincere in what it was putting forward today it would have accepted what the Minister said yesterday. But that is not the case. We know that at present the Labor Party feels that in Queensland it may be able to score a point, whereas it has not been able to score points anywhere else in the Commonwealth. There is to be an election in Queensland this year. The Labor Party wants to be able to say to the people of Queensland: &#39;We will protect the Barrier Reef. To give support to this view it has developed an argument against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr BjelkePetersen.</inline> We have heard some of the most rank and unfair statements that one could expect to hear levelled against this gentleman in this chamber tonight. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>But leaving that aside, I turn to the terms of the resolution which states that the Government has failed to give an adequate assurance that oil drilling and mining in the Great Barrier Reef areas will not be permitted. I must turn to the terms of the motion in order to answer it because nothing that the Opposition has said in the course of this debate has demonstrated what is meant by &#39;failure to give an adequate assurance&#39;. Not one of the five senators who have spoken has given any indication of what is meant by that expression. That is because they cannot give such an indication. What assurances has the GoGovernment given? First, the Government, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fairbairn,</inline> has said that it values highly the unique characteristic which Australia possesses, namely the Great Barrier Reef. The Government has said that it is worried about the effects of mining on the Great Barrier Reef. It has said that it will do its utmost to ensure that the Great Barrier Reef is not despoiled. Furthermore, the Government has said that it is unlikely to grant future applications for permits until more is known of the possibility of exploration and exploitation causing damage. But let me mention further what the Government has said, lt is useful to indicate to the Senate what the Government has said because the Opposition has chosen to ignore it. </para>
          <para>The Government, in conjunction with the Government of Queensland, has the advantage of one of the world&#39;s most renowned geologists, a <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Ladd,</inline> who was commissioned to investigate the Barrier Reef and who has presented a report to the Queensland Government. The contents of that report have now been made public. In it he indicated, firstly, the dangers of mining in the Barrier Reef if protective measures are not taken and, secondly, that if protective measures are taken we should be able to protect the Barrier Reef even if mining occurs. The Commonwealth Government is sending an officer of the Bureau of Mineral Resources to America to make an on-the-spot investigation of the leak which occurred at the off-shore rig in the Santa Barbara Channel. The Queensland Government has also sent its senior mining engineer to make a similar investigation. A further fact which I think is relevant is that the Queensland Government has rejected applications for drilling, not for petroleum but for other minerals, at Ellison Reef and Pentecost Island. It is a fact also that at present not one drill is being put down on the Barrier Reef. The Opposition has suggested that the Government has failed to give an adequate assurance. This is a matter which, if it is to be tested, depends upon the power that the Commonwealth Government has to give any assurance at all. lt is this field of power of the Commonwealth Government and of the State Government over the Great Barrier Reef which is comprehended by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act passed by this Government in 1967. Legislation complementary to that Act was passed in remarkable fashion in each State Parliament. The Act attempts to give to Commonwealth and State authorities a joint control over offshore areas in which petroleum may be found. The legislation was designed in that way after 5 or so years of discussion and negotiations because, in terms of constitutional law, there are many competing views in respect of off-shore areas. Who has authority to determine what shall happen in the seabed off the coast of Australia? Is it the State alongside which the seabed is found, or is it the Commonwealth because the Commonwealth broadly has legislative power in respect of the Commonwealth? These are difficult constitutional matters that could have been fought out in the High Court of Australia as happened in the Supreme Court of Canada, but the result of such litigation would be to create further difficulties which, when clarified, would still have required negotiations and a solution arrived at by the Commonwealth and the States. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth and State governments, showing horse sense of which Australians ought to bc proud, got together and the petroleum (submerged lands) legislation was agreed upon. Such is the pattern of that legislation that the Commonwealth and the State each have independent authority with regard to the Barrier Reef. It may be that if the State had to justify its authority, or if the Commonwealth had to justify its authority, neither would be able to sustain it as a matter of law; but they have agreed that they will collaborate and in that way it is hoped that any problems of constitutional power will be overcome. Acting in that way, the Queensland Government has power over the land mass which constitutes Queensland, and the islands of the Great Barrier Reef area above the low water mark are part of Queensland. In that respect the Commonwealth Government has absolutely no power at all. It would be a strange thing if the Queensland senators who have been protesting so vigorously today were not aware of that fact. </para>
          <para>With regard to the seabed areas of the Great Barrier Reef the Queensland Government has certain powers, but it is agreed in the negotiations and the agreement which constitutes part of the petroleum (submerged lands) legislation framework that the power will not be exercised except on consultation with the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is similarly bound. Therefore the Commonwealth has not an absolute power over what happens in regard to drilling and mining in the Great Barrier Reef. It must consult with the Queensland Government. It is said that the Commonwealth is not satisfied with the general knowledge which exists with regard to possible dangers to the Barrier Reef. In those circumstances it is a voice which is saying: &#39;Caution&#39;.  la  sought by the Opposition would be an assurance lacking legal effect and contrary to what has been solemnly agreed between the Queensland and Commonwealth governments. </para>
          <para>Members of the Opposition may say, as part of their general1 irresponsible attitude: What do agreements matter? Just override them. On that issue we can avoid them&#39;. That is what would be involved if the Commonwealth were desired to give a more explicit assurance. There are two types of permit currently available for the Great Barrier Reef area. Firstly, there are the permits issued by the Queensland Government before the legislation came into force in 1967. As to those permits the Commonwealth Government has no power at all. They were issued by the Queensland Government and are preserved by the legislation. They are honoured because they were granted before this legislation came into force. Secondly, there are permits which may be granted under this legislation. No such permits have yet been granted, but if permits are to be granted subject to the terms and conditions of the Act one can justifiably suppose that conditions designed to protect the Barrier Reef will be imposed. </para>
          <para>The vital issue involved in this proposition is whether all exploration for oil in the Barrier Reef should be stopped or should bc permitted under the most stringent safeguards. The Minister has said that he is not satisfied at present that those safeguards exist. I think that is a very reasonable attitude. The matter of urgency we are debating suggests that the Government has failed to give an adequate assurance. As I have said, it has been raised to seek some political advantage by a desperate and frustrated Opposition. A realistic examination shows that it is a matter of balancing what is in the best interests of Australia, and the determination of whether drilling and mining is to occur in the Barrier Reef must await further information. That is the general approach which the Commonwealth Government, to the limit of its constitutional ability and to the extent of its legislative power, is adopting. For the Opposition to say that in those circumstances an adequate assurance has not been given is to ignore the provisions of the legislation. I repeat that it is an attempt to gain some advantage. Unfortunately, the attempt has been made ignoring the powers of the Commonwealth and without doing the obvious and necessary homework which ought to justify the proposition put forward. </para>

            <para>- I, like other members of the Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources who have spoken in this debate, do so with a feeling of inhibition as to how far I can go in discussing the matters that have been raised tonight. However, I relieve my mind quite considerably, and I take little notice of standing order 308, because of advice from the  Clerk  of the Senate as to the disclosure of evidence by the Committee. To free my mind a little in this respect I propose to quote briefly from the advice given by the  Clerk  of the Senate. In talking about freedom to allow the evidence given before committees to be perused, he said: </para>

              <para>- I listened very quietly to honourable senators who have spoken in this debate. There will be time for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> to make his speech. The advice of the  Clerk  that a practice has grown up that would seem to have gone over the top of the standing order, or at least to be in conflict with it, considerably relieves my mind. The terms of reference of the Committee have been referred to tonight. However, not all the terms of reference have been referred to. Under item 3 the Committee has power to send for persons, papers and records, to move from place to place, to sit in open court or in private. Substantially we sit in open court. The Press is admitted. It is allowed to publish reports of the proceedings and the evidence given is not secret the circumstances, any greater assurance from the public any more than the proceedings of the Senate are secret from the public. The galleries can be filled at any time. So the restrictions that are placed upon senators in speaking in this place on matters with which a Senate select committee is dealing are not so great as they were made out to be earlier in this debate. </para>

          <para>Has anyone stopped asking questions about health matters because there is a Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs? Of course not. Every day there are questions on matters related to the health services in Australia. It is sheer humbug to say that we cannot discuss these matters. I agree with what was said by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cohen)</inline> today to the effect that if we were to adopt literally standing order 308 we would muzzle the Senate for the period that a Senate select committee was in existence. The Senate would not be justified in muzzling itself on any subject that it thought it should discuss. </para>
          <para>Now we take it a little further. It has been said by speakers on the Government side that this matter has been raised for political purposes because it is an election issue. However, Government senators are pretty adept in the art of using this Parliament for the purpose of influencing the electorate. If the Liberal Party is allowed to use this Parliament for the purpose of influencing the electorate, I do not know why the Labor Party, the Country Party or the Australian Democratic Labor Party should not have the same opportunities to do so. The day members of the Liberal Party cut it out is the day on which we will cut it out. Even recently when a Minister in this place was under severe pressure the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton),</inline> in order to get him off the hook, started to drag a red herring across the trail. He called it a left wing conspiracy. Do not claim that that was not electioneering. </para>

However, out of respect for you I will not go any further on those lines. Although the debate centres on the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, about which the Labor Party is very concerned and about which the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn)</inline> and the Minister for Mines in Queensland purport to be very concerned, it is noticeable that not one Queensland senator on the Government side has stood in his place to express his opinion on what should be done with the Reef. I leave honourable senators with those few thoughts on that aspect. </para>

          <para>It has been said in this debate, and by the Minister in another place, that permits to explore and exploit the Great Barrier Reef area off Queensland will not be issued. It is wrong for people to come into this place and make that kind of statement. It is well known to anyone who has studied the legislation that if a permit was issued to an exploring or an exploiting company prior to the passage of the legislation that permit must be re-issued to the same party in accordance with the transitional provisions of the legislation. </para>

              <para>- All I am saying is that there are senators on the opposite side of the chamber who would attempt to mislead the Senate in respect of the provisions of the legislation. It is well known that no power is vested in the Commonwealth Minister or the State Minister to withhold permits or licences if permits or licences were held prior to the passage of the legislation. It is true that the work provisions that the Designated Authority may apply to the issue of any permit may be such that they would prevent an applicant or a person holding a permit or a licence being able to explore and exploit. The conditions that he will apply to the issue of a permit are a matter for the Designated Authority, but it is not true to say that permits will not be issued for the Great Barrier Reef areas if permits were issued before this legislation was passed. The very purpose of the legislation was to keep faith with people who had taken out permits to explore the sub-soil of the sea bed on the continental shelf of Australia, lt would be an act of gross bad faith for anyone to refuse the permits, because the transitional provisions of the legislation do not allow anyone to refuse them. </para>

              <para>- That is right. However, I remind the honourable senator that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> said today that if we had the greatest oil province in the world in the Great Barrier Reef area it would be unreasonable to expect that we should not exploit it, but you could have the greatest oil province in the world and reap a crop from it for only a limited time. However, you could reap a crop from the Great Barrier Reef for year after year ad infinitum. Irrespective of the amount of oil found there, I believe that the Great Barrier Reef will pay greater dividends to Australia as a tourist attraction than as an oil producing area, but of course the vested interests of overseas capital might determine otherwise. That is what worries Labor Party senators, even if it does not worry Government senators. </para>

          <para>We feel justified in bringing this matter before the Senate for discussion at this time because, as most honourable senators on the other side who have spoken know, we believe that it will be some time before the Committee which is dealing with this question will be able to present a report to the Senate. Then, it will probably take several months before the Government acts, if it does act, on the report of the Committe. We believe that this is the time when some action should be taken to prevent the Great Barrier Reef from being exploited and destroyed. I say quite frankly: How can the Government give an assurance that the Barrier Reef will be protected, in view of what happened in the Santa Barbara Channel, what has happened on several occasions in the North Sea, what happened to the Moonie pipeline near Brisbane and what happened in Bass Strait? Can this Government give an assurance that no blow out of an oil well or a gas well will occur in the area of the Great Barrier Reef if exploration and exploitation are allowed to take place and continue to take place? </para>
          <para>We know that the crop can be reaped every year, year after year but we say that the value of the Great Barrier Reef to the national interest is greater than all the oil that may be found under it. For that reason, we say that the Government should give an adequate assurance that oil drilling and mining in the Great Barrier Reef area will not be permitted. There is no let out for the Government. We say that there should not be any exploration for and exploitation of oft in this area. </para>

            <para>- I rise to pursue a matter which has interested me since I had the honour, by the direction of the Senate, to join a Senate select committee. That committee did me the personal honour of asking me to accept its chairmanship. Honourable senators will recollect that there was a stage where I fell into some sort of bother with one of my colleagues. A matter arose in a debate and evidence that had been given in a meeting of that select committee was quoted in the Senate. The argument turned upon whether the evidence quoted was evidence that was in the executive committee, if I may use the American expression, or whether it was given in open forum. The reason why 1 mention this is that this was the stimulus that caused me to jump to my feet earlier today to take a point of order in respect of the matter raised for urgent discussion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and which has been convassed in the Senate for the last 2i hours or 3 hours. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The problem has not been resolved. 1 say that notwithstanding the advice entitled Disclosure of Select Committee Evidence&#39; that the eminent  Clerk  of the Senate, for whom I have a great respect, circulated and which I have not seen because it was circulated to the members of the existing Committee, the fact is that I do not believe that a select committee of the Senate can pursue properly the responsibility that the Senate places upon it when the matters which have been given to that committee and are within its terms of reference can be, at the whim of any senator supported by four other senators standing in their places, subjected to scrutiny in debate in the Senate. The realities of the debate that has taken place in the Senate this afternoon and in the evening are that the <inline font-style="italic">forms</inline> of the Senate have been distorted for the purpose of partisanship. This is what we have been attempting to make clear. Notwithstanding anything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> from Western Australia has said to the contrary - he made out as glib a case as he could - the facts are that the forms of the Senate are being distorted for the purpose of partisanship and this detracts from the efficacy of select committees which should be protected from this sort of operation. </para>
          <para>It is for this reason - I am glad to see you back in the Chair, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline> - that I was prompted to take a point of order this afternoon, supported by my colleagues, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie.</inline> I hope that the last has not been heard of the propriety of the matters in which we have been involved. I was heartened tonight by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> who left the strong impression upon me of the young David involved with a sort of collective Satanine  Goliath- </para>

              <para>- They are in the Opposition. It seemed to me symbolic of this Old Testament character that the Australian Labor Party so often assumes, filled with prejudice and partisanship, myopic, living in the past, and trundling out the shibboleths that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> has trundled out tonight. </para>

          <para>Whenever there is a mineral discovery, we can calculate and lay down as a certainty that an honourable senator on the Opposition side will get up and say that its development is not in the best interests of Australia. An Opposition senator will say, for instance, that it is not in Australia&#39;s best interests that a rocket range should be established and that this will interfere with something. An Opposition senator will suggest that we must not pursue alumina in the Gove Peninsula because of some sacred tribal grounds there or that we must not allow somebody else - this is where the curiosity occurs - to fish for prawns because this is a sacred ground or something else. One can bet one&#39;s life that whenever problems of the reasonable extraction of the primary resources of the country are involved one will find in the Opposition someone who will get up and say that this is a bad thing and that it is not in the national interest. Of course it is in the national interest. What is the position when the reporter who has been engaged by the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government reports that, without prejudice to the ecology of the Great Barrier Reef, it is possible to extract, let us suppose, gold from sea water? The question is whether this is or is not in the interest of tourist traffic or the Barrier Reef, which is one of the wonders of the world. Tt is not a question of oil or of lime for the manufacture of cement. No-one knows what can be extracted from the sea. </para>
          <para>The matter raised for urgent discussion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> asks the Commonwealth </para>
          <para class="block">Government to give adequate assurances that oil drilling - that has been canvassed - and mining on the Great Barrier Reef will not be permitted. This argument can be extended as far as to take in all other aspects of Australian development. It may be said that it is not in the interests of South Australia to allow oil drilling rigs to operate in St Vincent Gulf because it is not in the best interests of the city of Adelaide. This sort of argument can be pursued to the most illogical conclusion. I suggest that the Senate should not take undue cognisance of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has been saying. It should turn its attention to the propriety of using evidentiary matter received by Senate select committees for useful debate and partisanship purposes in this chamber. </para>

            <para>- This motion gives any honourable senator the opportunity to discuss more or less any question that he cares to discuss. This debate is similar to a budget debate. In view of the happenings of last evening I desire to discuss matters that have been before the Senate off and on for the last 2 or more days. It is not my intention to deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoffmann</inline> at all. I am most touched by the crocodile tears of honourable senators on the Opposition side for any worker who may have made a mistake. In fact, my heart bleeds when I hear what they have to say aboutthe individual concerned in this case. </para>

              <para>- Yes, I meant my friends opposite. I could feel drops of blood from my heart when the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Scott)</inline> said: Oh, the poor worker&#39;. I leave the unfortunate individual to himself. I hope that his future life is what he wants it to be. I believe in the old saying that it is human to err and divine to forgive. I am concerned with the matter of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. That is what worries me. Today it seems that anyone who stands up to speak about the Security Service of this country either is left wing or unpatriotic or is one who wants to affect the security of his country. If this Organisation acted only in the field of the security of this country, I for one would have nothing to say against it or even about it. I am not one who believes that we should not have a security service. 1. believe that we should have one. But I believe that it should work within the ambit of its constitution. </para>

          <para>In this case, irrespective of what anyone says, I believe that the Organisation was in contact with a lady who worked in the Japanese embassy and that she and one officer of the Organisation did something that I believe affects this great nation. I hate to think that in this day and age - not on a matter of security but on a matter, as I understand it, of pure commercial practice - copies of documents were taken from the embassy of a nation which at the moment is friendly, whatever it may be in the future. Why was that done? First of all people are asking: Was it done? I understand that a letter which states that it was done was about this building. Unfortunately I have not a copy of it. But the letter was read within the precincts of Parliament House. It was brought to this building by the lady in question. </para>

If anyone wants to know whether it is true, I ask him to listen to a comment from the one journal in this nation which since 1949 has never seen the Government do a wrong act. I refer to the Sydney &#39;Telegraph&#39;. The Sunday Telegraph&#39; stated: </para>

          <para class="block">That referred to a statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> on this question. From his high and mighty position, he thinks that the only way to get out of this situation is to use the old dodge of flinging political mud. I regret that he thinks that way. He spoke about the left wing of the Labor Party. I shall trace what has been said, prior to elections, over the years by Governments of his political complexion. In 1917 the Government said that it would win the war. In 1920 it was against the Bolsheviks. In 1925 it spoke about the British seamen&#39;s strike. It raised the familiar catch cry: &#39;Do not vote for Labor; the Corns will rule the country.&#39; That is the history of what has been said over the years. That is what the Liberal Governments have done each time an election was to be held. Novices here have spoken about left wing members of the Labor Party. Who are the left wing members? I have been a member of the Party for over 50 years. All I know is that I have been a member of the Labor Party. </para>
          <para>How will the Government extricate itself from the position in which it finds itself today? It has placed the nation in a position in which it should hang its head in shame because its security organisation, acting outside the ambit of its powers, has belittled itself and the nation by obtaining papers on trade matters from another nation&#39;s embassy. Instead of trying to win a political argument the Government should stand up to something of which it ought to be ashamed. The people will not be convinced that there is nothing wrong simply because the Government continues to sling mud. I am reminded of a writing by Samuel Johnson that patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. That is all honourable senators opposite know. They want to think that they are super-patriots and that they are the only people who guard the welfare of the nation. There are others. I remember what happened in the war years. Honourable senators opposite talk about what the Government did for the nation. I remember when the Government had to be voted out of office by some of its own supporters in the early part of the last war because it could not run the country. I also remember that, in order to keep in office since then, it dummied up the Petrov affair. I also remember that at one election the Government bought the votes of one section of the community by allocating less than &#163;2m for science blocks. I also remember an exPrime Minister sending the then Minister for Supply to the United States of America to buy aeroplanes to save the country. </para>

              <para>- That was the famous Fill. We have not seen it yet. In order to fool the people the Government arranged to have large American planes visit certain cities a fortnight before the pending election. The Government got away with slinging mud and not answering its critics then, but it will not get away with it now unless it makes an explanation of this whole affair. The whole business is crook and the Government knows that it is. The Government is a party to it because it will not answer. If it has any love left for the nation, if it wants to see the nation hold its head up as it should, it should investigate the whole affair. It is no good saying that the allegations are not true. It is no good saying, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Anderson)</inline> said - and personally I have great respect for him - that we cannot discuss anything about security. All we seek is an assurance that members of ASIO will act within the ambit of the powers bestowed upon them by their charter. They should ensure that the country is secure, but they should not make us hang our heads in shame because they put a young lady in the Japanese Embassy to make extra carbon copies of letters. How wrong is that? How will we be respected in the world of commerce today? A lot has been said about the Japanese trade treaty, how Japan is helping in our development and what it is doing in Western Australia. I know what I would do if I were they, and if it suited me. I would say: &#39;If we are friends play the game as it ought to be played and play it decently&#39;. Last night one honourable senator opposite rose in one of his typically heroic efforts to try to bolster up the stocks of the Government. He is new in politics. He comes from my own State. He has to learn. He can throw mud, and he throws it, because he knows that within a short space of time he will shift to a vacant seat on the front bench. </para>

We should clean this matter up. lt is no good the Government saying that the allegations are not true. The last thing the Government would expect its friends to be saying is that it has something to answer. The Government may expect that from the Opposition, but it would not expect it from the people who put their columns at the Government&#39;s disposal at the right time. I hope, in the interests of the nation and in the interests of everyone here, that, the guilty person - and there is a guilty person because the party did hand over extra copies of the letters - is identified. I do not want to hurt Hoffmann at all.

            <para>- The Senate should be grateful tonight to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> for again raising this matter. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus&#39;s</inline> comment was fairly apt this afternoon when he spoke about the Tales from Hoffmann&#39;. Perhaps we should go back to the music hall song entitled &#39;Who Threw the Turtle Skins in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> Chowder&#39; because that is what this matter has developed into. I am also grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> for reminding me of the sort of nonsense we have heard tossed up by the Labor Party about this subject for years and years. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is no doubt in my mind that the Hoffmann affair has been trotted out as a vehicle to attack the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. It was trotted out for that and no other reason. It is all right for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> to accuse people on this side of the chamber of mud slinging but he would be well advised to realise who started the mud slinging. It was started by the Opposition as an exercise to denigrate ASIO. There are no two ways about this. The entire attack has been based on this. When one recalls the debate on this subject, which commenced 4 or 5 sitting days ago, it included an attack on Hansard for allegedly producing false pulls of what the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Scott)</inline> had said; then the Public Service Board was under attack and then the Minister was under attack. But ASIO has been mentioned throughout the entire attack. This debate has been a convenient vehicle to denigrate the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. </para>
          <para>Why is this so? It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> to come into this chamber and pose as the great patriot. But one wonders why, if he is the great patriot, he wants to attack ASIO. This is what I want to know. He is saying that the Government has something to hide. Ministers have been quite frank in their answers about what has happened, yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> goes on and on with the same old story. The same thing has been trotted out hour after hour. There has been a continuing attack on ASIO. </para>

              <para>-  It is quite a simple proposition, as I see it. The Opposition is making the accusation and therefore it should make it stick. For a long time we have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> prating on and on this chamber about the Declaration of Human Rights. However, irrespective of the modern versions which arise out of the discussions of that organisation known as the United Nations, there is a very old principle of British law to the effect that the onus of proof is on the prosecution. </para>

          <para class="block">Does the Opposition wish to throw aside that principle? This is what it is attempting to do. Opposition senators are picking out some newspaper allegations and are saying: Here is some proof - now you answer it.&#39; </para>
          <para>If this is the way that members of the Opposition attempt to build a case and if this is the way in which they seek to represent their unions in industrial advocacy, then it is no wonder that trade unions complain that they cannot get a fair go from our arbitration and conciliation courts. If the presentation of the unions&#39; case is as good as has been the presentation by the Opposition of this affair in this chamber, then God help the people that they are supposed to represent. The Opposition&#39;s standard of advocacy and presentation of a case is deplorably low, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline></para>

              <para>- If this is the standard of advocacy, if all the Opposition can do is to abuse the other side, then it does not say much for honourable senators opposite. All they have done is to trot along here with allegation after allegation, attacking various officers of the Parliament and of the Public Service Board, jumping from one to the other. As the Opposition has failed with one attack it has tried to attack another target. Well, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I do not think it says much for the validity of the Opposition&#39;s case if that is the most it can do. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We keep coming back to the point  I  made earlier when I said that this is purely a vehicle to attack the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. The matter has been raised for no other reason. The Opposition has no other purpose in mind than to promote this in an attempt to uncover some scandal which it has never been able to prove existed. Yet it is quite convenient for its members to attack along these lines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> has dragged in another point by saying that there is a letter. Which letter is this? He says that there is a letter in existence which was read within the precincts of the Parliament. I think it fair enough that he should disclose who has the letter and why it is not being read. Again there is this mysterious evidence. Is this another allegation? Is there something else floating around the Parliament? Not one answer has been given about this. What are we doing? Are we having a trial by ambush? Is the Opposition attempting to trot out matter after matter in an attempt to confuse the issue? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> with respect to all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> said tonight, I am afraid that so far as the Opposition is concerned it has failed in its attempt throughout this whole sorry business. We have had this subject brought up night after night and to what stage have we advanced? We have come to the crux of the matter, as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> tonight. The crux of this matter is definitely an attack on ASIO. We can forget about turtle skins; we can forget about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoffmann;</inline> we can forget about the Hansard reporter allegedly doing wrong things when reporting the Minister for Customs and Excise and we come back to ASIO. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>I feel sorry for the Opposition. The Parliament has been in recess for some 2 or 3 months and it appears that this is the best sort of vehicle that the Opposition can raise as a matter of national importance in this Parliament. There are great questions to be debated, such as the defence statement. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> pointed out quite rightly this afternoon, the Opposition has chickened out and has run away again. The Opposition does not want to get down to debating the great national issues. It would rather dash off and talk about turtle skins. Is this the sort of mentality that the Opposition possesses? It is no wonder, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> said, quite rightly, that my distinguished colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> will one day sit on the front bench. We all hope that this is so. If the attack launched tonight by the Opposition is an indication of the thinking of the &#39;Labor Party then it will be in opposition for a long long time and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> who will be in this chamber for many years to come, may expect that he will naturally gravitate over the next 20 or 30 years to the front bench of this Senate. He has all the time in the world because the Labor Party will be staying in opposition for the next 20 years. It will be sitting on that side of the chamber for the next 20 years because I am quite convinced that the Australian people will not fall for the sort of nonsense that has been trotted out here night after night about the tales from Hoffmann. </para>
          <para>This is a fairly sorry affair, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> It is regrettable that we have spent most of this day talking about an alleged urgency motion and are now dealing with this matter. These great patriots on the other side talk about what they did in the war and all the rest of the clap-trap that we have heard tonight. So many of my colleagues on this side of the chamber were otherwise engaged in those times on the Queen&#39;s business. One would have thought that these great patriots on the Opposition side would have wanted to debate the defence statement or the statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> on Australia&#39;s attitude in our far north. But no; they would much prefer to attack the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. If this is the best that the Opposition can come up with then I repeat that the Labor Party will be in opposition for a long time. </para>

            <para>- I wish to raise a very important matter but I do not propose to detain the Senate for any length of time. I advised the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Scott)</inline> representing the Minister for National Development that I proposed to speak this evening on what appeared to be the misuse of Commonwealth subsidies paid in connection with the search for oil. It will be necesary for me to raise a number of points. I am mindful of the fact that it is not permissible to criticise the activities of a State Parliament in this place. Therefore I propose to deal with that matter only insofar as the funds of Commonwealth taxpayers are affected indirectly by the payment of subsidies to encourage and assist the search for oil in this country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think all honourable senators are aware, even at this early stage of my remarks, of the matter to which I intend to make reference. I wish to refer first to the Artesian Oil Co. Ltd which started off originally with a capital of $4 and which subsequently attracted an oil search subsidy of $22,800. Working on the farm-out system, a drilling company known as Lucky Strike Drilling Co. spent something like $70,000 over a period of 3 years in the search for oil. I might say that the original $4 was the total investment at that particular time by Johannes Bjelke-Petersen who, today, is Premier of the State of Queensland. The subsidy that was attracted by the combined drilling and exploration operations that I mentioned a moment ago was $22,800. During the signing up process in a subsequent amalgamation or takeover by a company known as Exoil (NL), this company received a refund of something like $60,000 allegedly as compensation for its oil search activities. </para>
          <para>This meant that somewhere along the line the sum of $12,000 changed hands, to put it in simple terms, twice. Ordinarily, in view of the search, or lack of search, that had taken place, this $12,000 should have been returned to the Government. I am not aware that it has been returned. Perhaps the Minister representing the Minister for National Development can tell me that in fact a refund of $12,000 was made to the Government. I hope he can. If no refund was made perhaps the Minister can tell us where the money may have gone. Perhaps the transaction may be looked upon by some as a proper one. Did this money go into the pockets of certain persons associated with the companies involved? One significant fact about all this is that, according to the documents available, the personal expenditure by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> in this fantastic oil search was something like $170. </para>
          <para>I take the Senate back now to the year 1959. Apparently at that time the gentleman to whom I have referred filled in a tax return for the year which showed the sum of &#163;140 3s 9d as being proceeds from the sale of his interest in the lease in question which, incidentally, was in northern Queensland. From memory, the lease is described as Authority 69P. Some months later the taxation authorities contacted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen.</inline> I am quoting now from documents which are available to the public. It was explained that there had been an error and that in fact the amount of &#163;140 3s 9d should have read &#163;14,039. There was a very big mistake and the tax consultants were blamed. Permission was obtained for an amended statement to be submitted. </para>
          <para>I would now like to refer to notes taken from the transcript. I will be as brief as I possibly can and will refer to only the relevant sections. This is a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Peterson</inline> and it sets out how his investment in the fantastic oil search was made up. The document states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">We spent a full week flying the area from the 14th to 19th December 1958. Hours flown 25. </para>
            <para class="block">Cost: As it was my own aircraft and pilot, the cost to me was not so great. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The document sets out the wages of the pilot at &#163;25 - this would be $50 in today&#39;s currency; the fuel used at 8 galls per hour at &#163;50; and hotel expenses at &#163;10. The document continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>During this period we flew to various points across the width of the area. Our investigations took us also to the furthest north-eastern corner on the Saxby River, and through the length of the area in different directions until finally reaching the eastern boundary. </para>
            <para>The other expenses were in connection -with the trip. I also had to go to the area which I flew by passenger plane via Townsville to Hughenden to inspect drilling sites . . . fare &#163;24. </para>
            <para>On this occasion I also flew some hundreds of miles with a friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jack</inline> Smultz  of Hughenden with whom I stayed. He flew me in his twin engine aircraft. I paid for all the fuel and running expenses, a total of &#163;26 10s Od. </para>
            <para>On that occasion I inspected by car possible drilling sites in the area. </para>
            <para>I also made two trips to Sydney at my own expense to interview the Directors of Longreach Oil Search, and the Directors of Oil Drilling Exploration with a view to having them participate in assisting us in our drilling, and thus throughout I spent many weeks of personal endeavour, particularly in the Mackay area, seeking to bring the drilling operations to a successful conclusion. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">My conclusion is that apparently a total sum of about $170 was involved. If ohe peruses the records of these three companies it is obvious, of course, that there has been a very, very substantial return made on the original very minor investment of $4. I think that this situation is deserving of a pretty thorough investigation to see where the $12,000 has gone. If it has been returned to the Government I would be happy to have that explanation. </para>
          <para>We ought to look at this matter from another angle because it was mentioned in various places today and at other times that licences for off-shore areas are currently being held up for some reason or other. I have very good reason to believe that one of the licences is included in the Premier&#39;s chosen company, that there were 18 other applicants and it is a glamour lease on the Great Barrier Reef. 1 believe that if this is the way subsidies are to be used to enrich people personally - to enrich those who participate in small mushroom companies that grow into major companies overnight - the Commonwealth Government will have to be much more discreet and searching before it decides to pay out these subsidies on the scale on which this subsidy was apparently paid out, and in circumstances such as those to which I have referred. </para>
          <para>It seems ridiculous that such a small sum should be spent by one individual and the ultimate turnover to the company and to the individual runs into many thousands of dollars. The facts I have stated can be verified from any of the documents I have quoted. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> who was doing some challenging a moment ago, would be interested in this. The documents I referred to are associated with the appeal to the taxation people. I suggest in all sincerity that this is a matter deserving of very deep and searching investigation. </para>

              <para>- I accept the honourable senator&#39;s statement that he indicated to the Minister that he proposed to raise this subject, but he did not give to the Government any summarised or adequate statement of the matters of finance that he proposed to raise. It is quite obvious that the only purpose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> had in raising this matter tonight was to smear a man, whose responsibility is complete and adequate in another Parliament, by ex parte insinuations in this chamber on a subject more than 6 years old. On his own statement of the facts it originated 10 years ago. The irony of it is the miserableness of the matter as presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> This is brought in at a time when the State parliamentarian concerned is about to engage in an election in Queensland. The Premier of Queensland has made his own statement in the Press today. I have not had an opportunity to read it. I did not know that it would come within my responsibility to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe&#39;s</inline> statement tonight. I concede that the honourable senator&#39;s remarks are pertinent insofar as there is some suggestion that subsidies paid by the Commonwealth Government have gone to a company. The honourable senator does not suggest that they have not been refunded; he inquires whether they have been refunded and whether there is an obligation to refund. Of course, the matter having been stated here, inquiry will be made. </para>

          <para>With regard to the suggestion of evasion of income tax, I had the opportunity yesterday to read the High Court report on a question as to the taxability of some matter arising out of mining investments by the Premier of Queensland. That was reported in 1963 Argus Law Reports. It will be noted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> said that he relied upon matters accessible to the public. I presume that he was referring to the documents that are filed in the registry and stated in the Law Reports. I hope that the honourable senator will not presume to discuss in this Senate, or expect us to inquire of the Commissioner of Taxation or any of his officers, the personal details of any taxpayer in this country, high or low. Not only is that within the confidential custody of the Taxation Branch as a matter of acknowledgment on all sides, but the statute of this Parliament specifically enjoins that neither the Commissioner nor any officer shall make available to any person any information with regard to the private affairs of a taxpayer on whom we have placed the obligation to render a return as to his income. If anything further is to be said after the High Court has decided the taxability of the taxpayer concerned, I have no doubt that that too would be inquired into by the Treasurer and dealt with in due course. </para>
          <para>It should be stated further that the issue that came before the High Court was as to whether the receipt was of an income nature or was in the nature of capital. I think it is only fair to say that that question is very indefinite in its definition and in many cases is a line ball, especially in modern commerce. The very fact that a man comes before an appeal tribunal, either at his own instance or at the instance of the Commissioner to contest the question as to whether money received in certain circumstances is in the nature of income or in the nature of capital is no indication of want of integrity or any questionable bona fides. It is a common experience that can be shared by any taxpayer who has a difference of opinion on that very indefinite field of law in relation to which the Commissioner and even the High Court in recent cases have gone out of their way to acknowledge that the criteria are very indefinite and uncertain. </para>
          <para>That is as much as I need say with regard to this stale and miserable insinuation that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> characteristically has brought forward in the Senate 6 or 10 years - at least 6 years - after this matter was publicly reported in the law reports of the High Court of Australia. </para>
