          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> it is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the tragic death this morning of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keith</inline> Alexander Laught at the age of 62 years. He collapsed this morning while walking from the Hotel Canberra to Parliament House and later died. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> was born at Mitcham, South Australia. He was educated at Scotch College. Adelaide, and graduated LL.B. from Adelaide University. He was a solicitor at the time of his election to the Senate and for many years conducted a law practice at Mount Gambier and subsequently in Adelaide. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline>was elected to the Senate for South Australia at the general election in 1951; at the Senate election in 1953; at the general election in 1958 and at the Senate election in 1964. He had a distinguished record of parliamentary service and at all times was a staunch advocate of the future progress and development of South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> was by nature a studious man and in his speeches to the Senate he always revealed the depth of his research in the arguments he put forward to substantiate a case. He was also an assiduous reader and was a devoted student of South Australian history. </para>
        <para>He served on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances from 23rd February 1956 to 15th August 1962. He was a member of the Australian delegation to the 47th Conference of the Interparliamentary Union in Rio de Janeiro in 1958. He was a member of the Council of the Australian National University from 1st July J 959 to the time of his death and represented the Senate of the Parliament in that capacity. He derived tremendous satisfaction from this side of his activities in Canberra. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> was a member of the Committee of Disputed Returns and Qualifications from 9th August 1962 to 26th August 1965. He was a serving member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs from 16th August 1962 and was a member of the parliamentary delegation to South East Asia in June-July 1963. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> had been a. Temporary  Chairman  of Committees from 11th August 1964. He was  Chairman  of. the Senate Select Committee on the Metric System of Weights and Measures from 12th July 1967 and tabled the report of that Committee in the Senate on 29th May 1968. </para>
        <para>During World War II <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 6th July 1940 and served in Syria and Egypt, including El Alamein, with the 9th Division Cavalry Regiment. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, for</inline> the whole of my Senate career I enjoyed his companionship, his loyalty and the scholarship that he brought to this place. No doubt many other honourable senators present could say the same. </para>
        <para>I know that at this time we all extend to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Laugh*</inline> our very sincere and genuine sympathy in the tragic loss that she has suffered. Keith Laught, as we knew him, loved the Parliament. At all times he was vigilant in relation to the Senate itself and particularly in relation to the constitutional position of the Senate in the parliamentary system. He brought to this place a dignity, and he brought it honour; he brought to it friendship and companionship; he brought to it a sense of purpose and advocacy for the State of South Australia as well as a broad national outlook. He always believed in the future of South Australia, which he had the honour to represent, and made it abundantly clear where he stood in relation to that Slate. We will all miss him. We will miss him as a friend and we will miss him as a senator. 1 move: </para>

          <para>- 1 support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Anderson).</inline> The death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> was unexpected; it was sudden. We all regret his passing. He was a worthy senator for the State of South Australia.  His  life was one of service. He served, in the Middle East during the Second World War. He served on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. He served as a distinguished  Chairman  of the Senate Select Committee on the Metric System of Weights and Measures. 1 think his work, especially on that Committee, will be long remembered and will be of great value to this nation. He served on the Council of the Australian National University as a representative of this Senate. In this and many other ways his life was one of service and of dedication to the tasks he undertook. He was a true Liberal and a man of tolerance and of willingness to listen to the views of others. 1 recall that in his early days he was a solicitor in Mount Gambier. To show his breadth of outlook I point out that he acted as the solicitor for the Australian Workers Union in Mount Gambier at a time when I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron, a member of the other place, was the Secretary of that Union. We in this chamber all know how courteous and how gracious he was. He never engaged in personalities. He always endeavoured to bring the mind of the Senate to bear upon the deeper aspects of matters. He always took a long range view. I think everyone is entitled to be proud of the fact that a man as worthy as he was amongst us and was able to do so much by way of achievement for the Senate, for the State of South Australia and for this nation. I think that the late senator could well be described as a quiet man of considerable achievement. </para>

As has been mentioned, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> was reelected to this Parliament in 1958, the same year that I was elected for the first time. 1 served on committees with him. J served with him on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. 1 am quite sure that a review of the questions asked in this House would show that the majority of questions asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> referred to the State which he represented - South Australia. He was a very strong supporter of his own State and of the Senate and what the Senate stands for. It was with considerable regret that we all learned this morning of his sudden passing. To his sorrowing wife we of the Australian Country Party extend our very deep sympathy. </para>

We were both sworn in in 1.951 and we made our first speeches to this chamber, one following the other. The high principles which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Laught propounded in his first contribution to these debates were principles that he espoused with integrity, with dedication and with enthusiasm during the many years that he served in this place. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>He was a man of gentle disposition who did not allow the vicissitudes of politics, and the sometimes scarifying influence of politics, to affect his nature or to mar his disposition. He was a man who at all times, in peace and war, made his contribution to the welfare of his nation. I would say to such young Australians who may be privileged to hear today in this place the thoughts that we express in relation to the deceased senator that the life of this good man could well be an inspiration to any of them who may choose to follow the path of public service. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> gave of his best for so long for the welfare of the nation of which he was part.' </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline>was a .lawyer by profession and, along with other lawyers, brought such skills as he commanded in that field to his work in this chamber. I recall with great pleasure our friendship over many years.  His  work, was fruitful and the friendship which. he bestowed on those who knew him was something we will not forget, just as I am sure honourable senators will not forget the. contribution he made to the deliberations of this place for so long. To <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Laught</inline> in her sadness and in her very deep bereavement, made all the more acute by the suddenness of its onset, we of the Australian Democratic Labor Party add our tribute of regard. To the soul of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught,</inline> with his strength and gentleness, we wish eternal rest. </para>

          <para>- As a senator from South Australia I should like in a few words to be associated with the motion before the Chair which has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Anderson)</inline> and supported by the leaders of the Parties in this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> as a hard working and vigorous South Australian gave a great deal to the Parliament and, indeed, to his State. He was widely known in Mount Gambier, in Clare and in Adelaide. Indeed, he was widely known throughout South Australia through which he travelled constantly in the interests of his parliamentary duties. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We all speak from a background of our own association and experience. I had the pleasure of knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> all of my adult life and over many years we shared common membership of various councils and organisations in the South Australian community. Scotch College and St Andrews Hospital are just two that spring to mind. We had a common interest in, and he gave a great deal of his interest to. the work of the Presbyterian Church in South Australia and indeed beyond. All of those things gave a dimension to the work that he took up in Parliament, and I for one speak with appreciation of sharing in his political philosophy and the words of wisdom that he gave to us from time to time. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>various spheres of service were reflected in his parliamentary work. He gave to his parliamentary work a constancy, an intensity and a concern. He gave the constancy by constantly espousing in his own quiet but strong way the political philosophies in which he believed. As I said earlier, he travelled widely, worked hard and studied intently in the course of his involvement with the Senate, the Parliament and the various committees which sprang from his parliamentary association. But above all he brought to his work a continuing concern; a concern for people, their problems and their welfare. All this found expression in his membership of the Senate and in his associated activities. </para>
        <para>The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> was, as the Leader of the Government has said, a great senator and parliamentarian. He constantly maintained positively the status of the </para>
        <para class="block">Senate, both in Australia and abroad. The record of his work on committees and of his leadership are monuments to him. But his place in his own home, his hospitality, his friendship and his personality are the things that we remember most at this time, and in remembering them we extend our very sincere sympathy to his gracious wife, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Laught.</inline></para>

Those honourable senators who served on that Committee, and the officers of the Committee, know just how much time and hard work <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> put into the memorable report which was tabled in the Senate last year. He never spared himself and he never asked members of the Committee to do things that he was not prepared to do himself. He was a gentleman at all times. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> also served with him on the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs. The late senator was recently elected  chairman  of a subcommittee of that Committee. He applied himself diligently and with plenty of vigour and enthusiasm to the committees on which he served. I wish to extend to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Laught</inline> my very deepest sympathy. </para>

          <para>- 1 wish to be associated with the motion of condolence. I support all that honourable senators have said about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> being a great advocate for South Auustralia In the speeches that he made in this chamber and in the questions he asked he was consistently concerned about the things that mattered to his State. Although the Opposition did not always agree with his viewpoint, it respected what he had to say. We on this side of the chamber had no doubt that he was always doing what he thought was best for his State. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> made a great contribution in that respect. He was al'so a very kindly man. As we all know, he had special interests. He used to talk about space research, the Antarctic, defence and the like. He always took an interest in the trade union movement. I was very pleased when he recently expressed to me a desire to be associated in a very small way with the new Trades Hall project in South Australia. I knew that he was very interested in the trade union movement. We all1 grew to like him. I am sure that he made a great contribution to his State, [n fact, he made a contribution to Australia that we should all recognise.  His  efforts will, of course, be on record and will serve as a reminder for those who are left behind. </para>

He was a very humble man, possessed of those qualities which make a man great - sincerity, kindliness and a full and strong character. During his service as a South Australian senator he always worked in the interests of South Australia and the national Parliament. I knew him for only a short time in the Senate, but enjoyed a long association with him in South Australia. Wherever I have gone I have found that he was known not only as a man who has done a lot of good but also as a man who made a lot of friends during his life and, to my knowledge, no enemies. This again is a mark of a great man. </para>

At that time you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, in</inline> your wisdom allocated to me an office to share with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught.</inline> J shared that office with him for 2 years. He always had infinite patience in explaining to me how the Senate and the Parliament carry out their duties. For 8 years he sat beside me in this chamber. 1 always found him to be a great companion and a truly gentle person. Yet if somebody crossed Keith's path and his principles became involved^ he demonstrated that he had a rod of iron up his back. He was a very strong person. My sympathies go to his widow and family. </para>
