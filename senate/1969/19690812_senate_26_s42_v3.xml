            <para>- 1 address a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I ask: Now that you have lost the war in Vietnam, will the Government tell the people that all Australian troops will be withdrawn as soon as possible and will you extend the same clemency, which in the past has been shown even to murderers and criminals, and release those young men who are in prison because of their conscientious opposition to the war, which is shared by half the people of Australia? If you are so unrelenting that you will not release all those young men, will you at least let out John Zarb on the compassionate ground that his mother is gravely ill? </para>

I refer to the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Metric System of Weights and Measures, which was tabled over a year ago, recommending the early adoption of the metric system of weights and measures in Australia. Can the Minister inform the Senate whether the Government as yet has made a decision in respect of this recommendation? </para>

            <para>- The position is that the Senate Select Committee on the Metric System of Weights and Measures, of which the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> was  Chairman,  tabled its report in Parliament in May of last year, as I recall it. The only information I have available for the Senate and for the honourable senator is that the Government still has the Senate Committee&#39;s recommendations under consideration. I am sure everybody will recognise the implications involved in a switch to the metric system and indeed will recognise that the substance of the very magnificent report presented by the Committee involves many aspects of the Australian economy. No Government could take a decision on such a matter without due and weighty consideration. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator cannot take anything more from my words than what I say - except that in a legal sense, I suppose, he might try to interpret something to make an argument. In fact, my reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was quite clear. He made the categorical statement that the Vietnam war had been lost. I told him that I did not know what his criteria of judgment were or what his authority to say such a thing was. </para>

            <para>- The central Queensland power-house proposition has been investigated by officers of the Department of National Development. They have made an extensive survey of the area. The project is a vital one to central Queensland; it is designed to develop power for secondary industry at the port of Gladstone and it will be of great assistance to the general development of this region. I understand that a report has been made to the Premier of Queensland and no doubt the Premier will be in touch with the Commonwealth Government about the report. </para>

            <para>- Before coming to the substance of the question, may I say, in relation to a statement made earlier by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> by leave, that I, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, congratulate him on the singularity of his achievement. I will always extend to him the same courtesies as 1 have extended to him in the past. Coming to the question of the proposed visit to Bougainville, let me say that it is my understanding that there has been a visit by members of both parties to Bougainville in the last few weeks. I recall seeing <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mackay,</inline> a member of another place, on television, and he indicated that he had just come back from that area. It is my understanding that the Minister for External Territories will make a statement on the Bougainville matter in another place later this afternoon and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> will be making the same statement in this place. I would not want to make any comment ahead of the making of that statement. </para>

            <para>- The position is as follows: The  Chairman  of the Australian Meat Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Shute,</inline> issued a Press statement on 6th August, setting out the reasons for the restraints on shipments of beef, veal and mutton to the United States of America as from 9th August. In brief, the reasons are that under the United States Meat Import Law arrivals in the USA in 1969 of beef, veal and mutton from Australia are restricted to 225,000 tons. Between November 1968 and July 1969 - that is, arrivals in the USA in the period from January to August 1969 - approximately 180,000 tons had been shipped, leaving a balance of 45,000 tons to be exported between August and midNovember. This period corresponds approximately to arrivals in the USA in the September to December period. The number of exporters currently prohibited from making shipments to the USA is around twenty; that is, one-eighth of those exporters licensed to ship to that country. Each of the remaining exporters will be entitled to ship to the USA up to the level of the credits he has earned under the Meat Board&#39;s diversification scheme. </para>

            <para>- It is true that the Prime Minister has extended an invitation, through the  President  of the United States, to the Apollo XI astronauts to visit Australia. That was done at the time when an announcement was made that proposals were in contemplation by the United States that they should go out of America on world tours. I am sure that everybody will agree that it was very wise and very proper for our Prime Minister to extend an invitation to them to come to Australia. I do not think I need to remind the Senate or the people of Australia that we in this country played and continue to play a very significant role in the Apollo programme. Perhaps question time is not the appropriate occasion for me to expand on that: but we will continue to play a very significant role as an agency of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. So it is proper that we should have extended the invitation. As to the question whether the astronauts would come during an election campaign, when the time of the election is fixed I will be more competent to answer the question. </para>

If he was, does he agree that Australian manufacturers of motor vehicles should be allowed to sell vehicles that are capable of 130 m.p.h in the case of a vehicle of one manufacturer, and 140 m.p.h. in the case of a vehicle of another manufacturer, when in most Australian States there is a speed limit of, at the most, 65 m.p.h.? Does he agree that these vehicles should bc allowed to be sold, in the case of some States, to people of 17 years of age, and in the case of other States, to people of 1 S years of age? Will he make representations to his appropriate colleagues for an increase in the duty on these vehicles to save young people from shocking 100 m.p.h. accidents of the sort that occurred recently in which seven decent young Australians were killed? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator asks a very comprehensive question. Yes, it is true that I had the honour to chair a Senate select committee which dealt with the question of road safety. Its report was put down in this place and was given consideration by the Government. It will be recalled by those who read the report that a fundamental problem from the Federal point of view was that the relevant power vests with the States. Whilst we looked at ali of the aspects of road safety, in the final analysis any recommendations that we made - with one exception I think - became the responsibility of the States for implementation. It is within their judgment as to whether they act in relation to excessive speed or in relation to the manufacture of types of vehicles. With the best will in the world - and I find myself greatly in sympathy with the sentiment expressed in the question - I say that responsibility does not lie with Federal Parliament; it lies with the six sovereign States. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to some other parts of the question, it has been my understanding that an agreement was arrived at between the States and the Australian Transport Advisory Council that there would not be advertising of the speed capabilities of vehicles. I shall be interested to find out whether there is any validity in my understanding. The honourable senator raised a point in connection with duty. I think he would appreciate that in the modern scheme of things most motor vehicles sold in Australia have a high Australian content. We have what are known as our Plan A and our Small Volume Plan, whereby the Government has consciously encouraged more and more Australian content in the manufacture of motor vehicles. The only rebate of duty that manufacturers would get would be under a certain by-law concession for a percentage of imported parts, provided manufacturers planned to expand the </para>
          <para class="block">Australian content over a period of years to about 95%. So there is not much power of persuasion in a duty concession. To round off what I have said I say that I think it is extraordinary that there should be advertising which is calculated to attract young people by the high speeds of motor cars. I would hope that as a result of the honourable senator&#39;s question the States will get the message that he conveys and will use some manns to discourage the advertising of the high speeds of motor vehicles, which is calculated only to make people buy the vehicles and see whether they can do those speeds. </para>

Was Australia&#39;s support and commitment of its forces to South Vietnam in pursuit of the same objective as that pursued by the United States? 1 also ask: Has the United States activity, supported by that of Australia and other countries, succeeded in very real measure in restraining the terrorism, insurrection and aggression of North Vietnam directed forces and in protecting and enhancing the democratic self determination of the people of South Vietnam? If these assumptions are correct, is it correct to say, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> said, that Australia has lost the war in South Vietnam? If it is not correct to say that, is it to be taken as an indication of the desire of this so-called newly united Australian Labor Party that Australia should lose the war in South Vietnam? </para>

            <para>- That is a very long question but I am grateful to the honourable senator for asking it. lt is true that the United States of America did go into Vietnam at the request of the South Vietnamese Government. It is true that Australian forces went into that country to give support on the same conditions and for the same objectives - to ensure that thai Government and those people would have the right to freedom, which was at risk because of Communist infiltration and the activities of the Vietcong. It is equally true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> said in his question, that because of the intervention of the United States, Australia and other nations, the people of South Vietnam have had preserved for them a way of life that we enjoy and which they expect to have. Against that background, what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has said about the questions originally put to me is equally true. Where the situation exists that a country&#39;s viability, independence and right to govern itself have been preserved, to suggest that by aiding in that situation you lose a war is legal talk that any ordinary person would never understand. Australia&#39;s contribution should never be denigrated. It should always be regarded as one of greatness, and that is what history will prove it to be. </para>

            <para>- I agree with the honourable senator that it would be far better to make a statement in some depth in response to his question than to answer it at question time. It is true that the Minister for Trade and Industry recently visited the United States of America. It is true that he negotiated an agreement which is calculated to preserve Australia&#39;s position. Since I am not the Minister directly concerned, but representing him, I would prefer that an answer be given in depth to the honourable senator by that Minister. I think the first thing for the honourable senator to do is to place his question on the notice paper in order to give the Minister an opportunity to furnish a considered and more detailed reply than I could give now. </para>

            <para>- I think that this question should also go on the notice paper. I would hope to get a reply for the honourable senator. At present no request for consideration by the special authority has been made. As honourable senators are aware, that procedure can operate prior to a Tariff Board inquiry. As I understand it, no such request has been made to date. I am sure all honourable senators would agree that it would be far better for me to get a reply in depth from the Minister for Trade and Industry in relation to this matter. </para>

            <para>- My question, which 1 direct to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, relates to the unnecessary delays in connecting Adelaide with the standardised rail system. This matter has been commented upon by spokesmen for the South Australian Government and the Opposition who claim that delays, particularly in relation to construction but more recently in relation to the consultant study which was offered by the Government in 1968 have been mainly the fault of the Commonwealth Government. In view of the importance of this railway line to South Australia, will the Leader of the Government in the Senate do whatever he can to facilitate agreement between the two parties in order that this rail link can be built as quickly as possible? </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the recent decision of the Reserve Bank of Australia to increase interest rates by about 0.25%. 1 ask: Will the Minister give an assurance that the interests of Australia&#39;s export industries, particularly those involved in primary production, have been given adequate consideration in this decision? As this is a matter of national importance, does the Minister consider that it would be wise for the Government to give a direction to the Reserve Bank that the interest rates imposed on this important sector of Australian industry should not be increased? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator asks about the recent increase in interest rates. It is true that there has been an increase. The honourable senator then link his question with the effect that this increase may have on primary industries. I think it is quite proper for me to say that any decision that the Treasurer makes in relation to a matter such as this is a Government decision. The Government would look at the matter to make certain that no particular or special damage was done to any section in isolation. It would have regard to the overall position of the economy. The decision would be calculated to ensure that the primary industries in Australia as well as every other industry continue to have the degree of success and prosperity that is being enjoyed today. </para>

Because of the untenable position in which Australia is now placed as a result of the United States Government&#39;s change of policy on Vietnam - having realised the futility of the conflict - where the war is needlessly dragging on because of the stubborn intransigence of military diehards, I ask: What purpose is to be served in risking the lives of more Australian soldiers in pursuit of a policy of war which has been proved to the United States to be negative and militarily unwinnable? </para>

            <para>- If anyone had any doubts about whether an election was pending I think today&#39;s events would have dispelled them because some of the questions asked are quite obviously loaded with political overtones. It is true that the United States Government has said that there may be certain reductions in the United States forces in Vietnam. The background of the withdrawals is that the South Vietnamese needed time to develop the capability to take over certain of the commitments that outside forces were fulfilling. It was quite clear, and honourable senators opposite surely understood, that the South Vietnamese forces were being trained to defend their own country and that the need for expeditionary forces from outside Vietnam would be lessened. That is what is happening now. I do not intend to be drawn into a debate during question time on the broad issues predicated by the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- It is early days to make a judgment and express views as to the implications of the French devaluation which took place a few days ago. If the situation remains that the devaluation is confined to the French Republic, that would be one matter. Indeed, if that were to be the position then I do not believe that the implications to the Australian economy would be significant. I think the real question is what the situation is going to be in future in the other countries of Europe. I am not competent to express a view on that matter, nor have I been briefed by the Treasurer on it. So I come back to what 1 said at the start: It is really early days to be making a judgment. At the present time, the effect of the devaluation is limited to the French Republic and I would presume that it would also affect the French territories. When there is a clearer picture of what is going to take place, if anything, I shall be happy to give an answer in the Senate. </para>

Is it also true that the serviceman had received only a crash course of one week in clearing mines although the normal course of training takes several months and only specially trained men are permitted to do this work? By whose authority was the serviceman detailed to carry out this duty. Was the order given with the full knowledge that the serviceman had received only the one week&#39;s crash course? Will the Minister give an assurance to the Senate that in future only men specially trained in this work will be detailed to do it and that steps will be taken to make sure that sufficient men are trained for this dangerous work? Will the Minister give a full report on this disastrous incident to the Senate? </para>

            <para>- I do not know to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drury</inline> refers as the victim of the unfortunate occurrence which did take place. We all know that casualties have occurred in the clearing of mine fields in Vietnam. From the information I have received from the Army, I take it that a lot of mine fields were laid but later it was found necessary to remove them. This represented a considerable task. One of the reasons for removing the mine fields was the fact that they could not be looked after. Naturally, of course, certain personnel were engaged in clearing the mine fields. As I understand the position, normally only persons trained in the clearing of mine fields have been engaged on this work. As the honourable senator did not mention the name of the serviceman concerned, I am not sure how much training the serviceman had had. But the normal practice is to employ only those who have had sufficient training in the work. I should like to point out that according to my information there were at least thirty-four fatal Vietcong casualties as a result of the laying of these mines about which we have been hearing so much. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Primary Industry made a statement the other day. I forget exactly which day it was, but be said that he thought it was not practicable to expect the Commonwealth Government to provide wheat storages in the manner indicated by the honourable senator. He gave as his reason - and I think it is valid - that if this were done this year then, if the same conditions confronted us next year, no doubt the Commonwealth Government would be asked once again to provide storages. The position at the moment is that the wheat growers themselves have decided that there should be a quota system applied to wheat grown in Australia. The State governments also have agreed with this decision, but the Commonwealth Government has not put a quota on wheat production, although others have done so. In my own State of New South Wales the wheat growers have shown their approval of the quotas laid down by the Minister for Agriculture. To the best of my knowledge the Commonwealth has not so far been prepared to provide storage in the manner indicated by the honourable senator. I was asked also about the use of excess wheat being made available for feed in drought affected areas in the northern and southern parts of New South Wales and in Victoria. I do not know whether the honourable senator is suggesting that we should embark upon a different system of using surplus wheat for drought relief. Wheat is available and it can be used under the same conditions as it is now available. </para>

            <para>- I cannot state off-hand the number of patients at Wacol. I have been there and I have seen the conditions under which these men are living. I feel that the patients at that establishment are receiving very good treatment. I do not know whether it is a fact, as the honourable senator suggests, that these mcn are not enrolled. If they are not enrolled it would be for a very good reason. I shall inquire and let the honourable senator know what the position is. </para>

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior. Does the equivalent to legislation operating in the southern States and broadly known as lifts and scaffolds Acts apply to various types of cranes used at the Gove bauxite project in the Northern Territory? Do crane operators in the Northern Territory have the same traditional rights as crane operators in the southern States to refuse to operate a crane which they consider unsafe, pending an inspection by State lifts and scaffolds inspectors or, in this case, their Northern Territory equivalent? Is the Minister satisfied that such qualified lifts and scaffolds inspectors are available in the Northern Territory or has Nabalco Pty Ltd sought to downgrade safety provisions in its quest for greater productivity? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator was good enough to advise me of this question. The answer to the first part of the question is yes, cranes are covered by the Northern Territory Inspection of Machinery Ordinance 1941-62. The answer to the second part of the question is that a crane operator must hold a certificate of competency in accordance with the requirements of Part X of the Inspection of Machinery Ordinance and Part V of the regulations made thereunder. By virtue ot their possession of such certificate it is considered that the operators have similar rights and similar obligations regarding safe operation as have crane operators in southern States. The answer to the third part of the question is that inspectors are available. Assuming that the crane in question was that concerned in a recent labour stoppage at Gove, this crane had been inspected and found safe for operations at loads recommended by the manufacturer. The crane is operated by a contractor to Nabalco - not by Nabalco. I understand that the crane was being used at a work capacity above that recommended by the manufacturer. Instructions have been issued by an inspector for the load operated to be reduced and the men have returned to work. </para>

            <para>- Has the Minister for Customs and Excise seen a letter in this morning&#39;s &#39;Australian&#39; written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norman</inline> Talbot, a teacher of English at the University of Newcastle, of which the  President  of the Senate is Chancellor, complaining of the action of the Department of Customs and Excise in seizing some ten books required for research in his university work on a serious study which he believes is of importance to the social and cultural life of Australia? If the Minister is familiar with this case, is it a fact, as alleged by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Talbot,</inline> that the Vice-Chancellor of the University countersigned one series of applications for the release of these books, which apparently were among hundreds bought in the United States of America while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Talbot</inline> was a visiting fellow at Yale University? Has the Minister further noted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Talbot&#39;s</inline> statement that he has no intention of selling or lending microfilms of these texts, that he will not teach or publish them and that he does not intend to lend them to any honourable senator&#39;s teenage daughter? I do not know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Talbot,</inline> but surely this is an obvious case of a book being required for a bona fide purpose of the type mentioned in the reply that the Minister made to my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon,</inline> about another censorship matter. Will the Minister have a good look at this case to see whether it is possible for him to make some effort to save Australia from being the laughing-stock of the world in matters of censorship? </para>

On 1 3th May <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Talbot</inline> was advised by letter that his application had been approved and that he should contact the Collector of Customs for New South Wales to take delivery of the books. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Talbot</inline> made no approach to the Department of Customs and Excise in this regard. he was contacted. I understand now that he did not receive the letter that 1 wrote to him on 13th May. Action is being taken to release the books to him. </para>

Now that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court has ruled that the search warrants issued for the searches of Maxwell Newton&#39;s home, office and bank records were invalid, will the Government give an assurance that there will be no repetition of a misuse of the Crimes Act to search homes, offices and bank accounts on grounds as flimsy as those on which the warrants were issued against Maxwell Newton? Were not the whole proceedings designed to stop the strong criticism of the Government by Maxwell Newton&#39;s publications in an election year? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator will well know that the procedures referred to were followed by legal action. The decision with regard to the validity of the search warrant is still under consideration and may not yet be final. The other decision, which involves <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pratt,</inline> is one of a most interesting character, lt appears that three cables from the Department of Trade and Industry were practically copied in the handwriting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pratt</inline> and were found, on the search to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne</inline> has referred, in the offices of Maxwell Newton, having been printed word for word in three separate issues of &#39;Incentive&#39; a few days following the date upon which they were in the Department of Trade and Industry, where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pratt</inline> had access to them. In those circumstances, although the magistrate found that in his opinion there was no evidence of communication of those cables by Pratt to Newton, as I say, the cables were practically translated and were in manuscript handwriting, proved to be that of Pratt. Other people are entitled to make their judgment as to whether there was a sound basis in reason and to enforce honesty in administration for the prosecution of Pratt in the circumstances of that case. To impute wrong political motives in any such prosecution is to make a completely spurious suggestion. </para>

Is that the standard that the Government is going to tolerate? </para>

That was the basis of the question, and very properly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> defended the decision that the Government took. He gave the facts which were the basis of the Government&#39;s decision. Quite frankly, I do not think one can go beyond that. Of course, there is a second side to this matter. It is that, just as I have responsibilities - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has directed his question to me - he equally, as Leader of the Opposition, has responsibilities. If he thought there was impropriety in the response <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> gave, he had his responsibility to stand up and use the forms of the Senate when the answer was being given. </para>

Therefore I would not dream of revealing discussions I had with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> in relation to the management of the Senate unless the matter was one into which I had to bring my Party. I would then do it in a conclave of my Party. That answers the first part of the question. As to the second part, I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> gave a fair answer. It will be recalled that earlier I indicated that the Minister for External Territories would be making a statement in another place in relation to Bougainville and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> would make the same statement on the Minister&#39;s behalf later today in the Senate. I concluded that that was why no questions Save been asked in relation to the matter. </para>

            <para>- The Department is using its best endeavours to stop the entry of drugs into Australia. Recently we chartered a special aircraft for service in the north west of Western Australia, to patrol the coastline to stop prohibited imports, including drugs, from entering Australia. The question of allowing into Australia people who are drug addicts concerns us quite considerably, but it is really a matter for the Minister for Immigration. I shall take this question up with him, see what can be done and advise the honourable senator personally of the decisions that we make. </para>

            <para>- I made some reference to the decision of the learned magistrate who dealt with the case of Graeme Pratt and in order to answer the honourable senator&#39;s question I would be impelled to refer to one or two passages from that decision. It is necessary that I be accurate in my response to the question. The magistrate said: </para>

            <para>In my view there is not a shadow of doubt that these documents were communicated either to Newton, his wife or some person connected with 55 Kent Street, Deakin. The first question is, how was this done and on (be evidence 1 am unable to answer this question. The second question is, when was it done and on the evidence, also, I am quite unable to answer that. The third question  -  I may be excused for using a nonjudicial term - the sixty-four dollar question is, by whom was this information communicated and on the evidence before me I would answer that question by saying, &#39;probably by the defendant&#39;. </para>
            <para>Now, that answer would be based on suspicion and not on evidence. Let me say quite emphatically that the clouds of suspicion lie very heavily on the head of the defendant. It has never been the law to my knowledge, and I trust it never will be, that a man can be convicted or even required to stand his trial on suspicion alone and nothing else. So heavy and thick are these clouds of suspicion indeed that even the slightest thread of evidence, the barest thread, the minimum of evidence, that the defendant had in some way communicated these documents would, in my opinion, have been sufficient to have caused me to commit the defendant for trial. </para>
            <para>I have searched the evidence minutely but I cannot find that thread which would convert suspicion into possible guilt. </para>

          <para class="block">I have quoted that to show the basis upon which I express an opinion - as I was invited to do by the honourable senator - on the question as to whether the magistrate was in error in finding that there was no evidence that Pratt communicated the document to the Press. I point out that there were three documents, not one. They were all in the handwriting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pratt.</inline> They were all published by the Newton Press soon after they were in the custody to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pratt</inline> had access. I am bound to say with some respect - I hope not a disproportionate degree - for my own opinion, that I hold the firm opinion that there was not only some evidence but strong evidence that those manuscript documents copying cables from the Department of Trade and Industry, which were found printed a few days later in the Newton Press, not on one occasion but on three occasions, were communicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pratt</inline> to the Press. </para>

            <para>- I wish to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Is it not true that the Australian Wheat Board and wheat growers of Australia are deeply concerned about lack of storage for surplus wheat, of which there is known so far to be over 200 million bushels? In view of the fact that there are about 20 million starving sheep in Queensland and West Australia which are dying to act as storages for surplus wheat, when will the Government practise what it preaches and eliminate starvation, in the midst of plenty, in the breeding stock of Australia? </para>

          <para>The broad scope of the research programme of the scientists working on chemical and biological defence at the Defence Standards Laboratories is formulated within existing Government policy and submitted through the appropriate Committees of the Department of Defence to the Minister for Defence for approval. These scientists are then obliged to work within that approved programme. Any change in policy as to the scope of the work would require consideration by the Cabinet. </para>
          <para>From the outset of this work in Australia, the Government placed an absolute prohibition on experiments using bacteriological agents. In fact, as I have advised the Senate previously, no pathogenic agents are used in Australia in relation  to  biological defence. </para>

For strict comparability, an amount to cover freight and cartage would need to be added to the price quotations for other countries. National average charges on fertilisers for freight and cartage are not available. As an indication of the importance of this component, prices paid by United States farmers for urea varied from  a  low of SA72 per ton in Arkansas to a high of SA106 per ton in Florida. A similar situation applies in Australia; freight and cartage are significant elements in the cost of fertilisers delivered on farm. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I understand that the question refers to the preliminary results of a professional staff requirement survey conducted by the Australian Mining Industry Council during 1968. I am informed that the survey report included a table indicating shortages of engineers as at December 1967 and estimated requirements of engineers in 1972. The 1972 estimates suggested that the mining industry would need a considerable additional number of engineers over and above its requirements in 1967. </para>
            <para>We have been unable to trace any suggestion by the Council of&#39;special Federal Government assistance to universities&#39;. The executive of the Mining Industry Council in Canberra has been contacted and in unaware of any such suggestion having been made. </para>
            <para>Shortages of labour have been  a  fairly general characteristic of the Australian economy ever since the end of World War II. Generally speaking, shortages of skilled personnel are greater than for the unskilled, and within the skilled groups, shortages of engineers are among the more noticeable. In the case of the mining industry, locational differences are also particularly important. Many jobs for engineers in the industry require residence in remote locations. At the same time engineering is, to some extent, an international profession and mining companies, particularly those with international affiliations, are in  a  position to attract qualified engineers from  a  variety of overseas countries. </para>
            <para>The following table shows the additional number of graduates in mining, civil, electrical and mechanical engineering which the universities estimate will be produced in the years up to and including 1972, compared with the Australian Mining Industry Council&#39;s estimate of requirements: </para>

          </para>
          <para>In addition to the graduates of the universities, there will also be the output of qualified personnel from the colleges of advanced education. In 1969 the total enrolment in colleges of advanced education in civil, mechanical, electrical and mining engineering, and allied disciplines such as applied and mining geology, is 9,430 - comprising 4,481 full-time and 4,949 part-time students. These courses are provided in 19 colleges in the six States and the enrolment in them represents approximately 25% of the total enrolment in all college courses. The projections show significant increases in enrolments in engineering courses over the 1970-1972 triennium. </para>
          <para>One-third of the joint Commonwealth/State capital programme at colleges of advanced education during the 1967-1969 triennium is being devoted to the provision of facilities for engineering, metallurgy and mining courses. This capital expenditure is being incurred on fifteen projects in eleven colleges. </para>
          <para>There is no reason to suppose that the mining industry will not be able to recruitthe numbers of engineers of different kinds which it estimates it will require by 1972. </para>

            <para>Since the inception of the Australian Tractor Testing Scheme in 1954 the Commonwealth has met one half of the costs of establishment and operation of the Tractor Testing Station at Werribee, Victoria.

            <para>The operation of the Station is currently being financed under an interim arrangement between (he Commonwealth and Victorian Governments. Representations have been made by the Premier  of  Victoria and the Minister  of  Agriculture, Victoria proposing longer-term arrangements for financing the operation  of  the Station and for some expansion  of  its activities. These representations are being considered by the Government and I will arrange for the Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator to</inline> be informed as soon as a decision has been reached. </para>

              <para>The purpose of the National Service Scheme is to provide the Army with sufficient manpower to meet its military commitments, and the allocation of national servicemen to the various corps is geared to meet this requirement. The Army endeavours to utilise the professional qualifications of its members in appropriate military postings where this is possible. However, where the number of professionally qualified national servicemen exceed the requirement or where no need exists for a specialised skill, they must be allocated in the most efficient military manner and trained in other fields where their services are required. </para>

              <para>Army records indicate that, of approximately 16,000 national servicemen at present serving, 396 hold degrees or diplomas, 179 of this number were accepted for officer training, while 34 are serving as other ranks in the Infantry Corps. In this regard, Infantry is the Army&#39;s largest Corps and its allocation of national servicemen whose professional skills cannot be used could be expected to be proportionately high. </para>

              <para>In introducing National Service, the Government made it clear that, apart from the exemption from military service of ministers of religion, which is of long standing, and of those who are training to this end, there could be no provision for exemption from liability to render service on occupational grounds. There are, as the honourable senator will appreciate, quite a number of professional or occupational groups on whose behalf seemingly persuasive reasons can be, and indeed have been, advanced for exemption including their value to the community in civil life. It is inescapable that once breached for any such group the fundamental bases of the National Service Scheme of universality and equity would fall. </para>

              <para>Under the Australian Constitution the assessment and development of water resources in the various States is the responsibility of the State Governments.

          <para>The underground water resources of the Peninsula have been assessed where they are usable both with regard to quantity and quality. Approximately 90% of the area contains ground, water which because of salinity is unsuitable for nearly all uses, and assessment of these areas is not warranted. Better quality water is found in several basins along the west coast of the Peninsula. </para>

              <para>Yes. This project was considered with others submitted by State Governments under the National Water Resources Development Programme. It was not included in the short list of projects for closer examination, which was announced by the Minister for National Development in May 1968. It will no doubt be realised that there is a limit to the amount of finance which can be made available for development projects and consequently an assessment of those submitted was made on the basis of greatest national benefit. As the honourable senator already knows, a sum of$6 million has been made available to the South Australian Government for a pipeline from Tailem Bend to Keith, and associated rural distribution works. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>and (2) The present staffing structure in Post Offices and Mail Exchange Branches does not effectively meet modern demands and there is a real need to revise the current organisation. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The revised structure takes account of the following requirements, some  of  which have been represented  by  the Staff Associations concerned: the number  of  work levels should  be  at the minimum necessary for full and effective working; reasonable career prospects should  be  provided for those, with the necessary aptitude and ability, entering at the base level; the number of tests, examinations and barriers to advancement through the structure should  be  at a minimum; classification levels should  be  simplified and rationalised consistent with action taken in relation to other work areas in the Service; there should  be  an adequate flow  of  officers  to  higher positions in the structure; juniors in Post Offices and Mail Exchange Branches should receive salary treatment not less favourable than juniors in other areas  of  the Service or in private industry; the nature and requirement  of  functions at particular levels should not require limitation  of  staffing to persons with Third Division qualifications (only 600 Postal Clerks, Third Division, are available for promotion yet approximately 2,000 fully trained Postal Clerks, Fourth Division cannot advance to higher positions because  of  the Divisional barrier); barrier tests for advancement within the salary scale  of  particular positions should  be  rationalised and simplified. </para>
          <para class="block">The new Postal Levels Structure, having been based on the foregoing, provides benefits both  for  the staff concerned and the Department. </para>
          <para>The Amalgamated Postal Workers&#39; Union and the Postal Overseers&#39; Union have accepted the revised structure without prejudice to claims previously lodged with the Public Service Arbitrator  by  those Unions for higher salaries. These two Unions represent approximately 77%  of  the work force employed in the area affected  by  the new Postal Levels Structure, namely, the Post Offices and Mail Exchange Branches. The Administrative and Clerical Officers&#39; Association, the Australian Postmasters&#39; Association and the Union  of  Postal Clerks and Telegraphists have not yet accepted the structure. Discussions with these Unions are continuing. </para>
          <para>Under the new structure, emphasis is being placed upon tests designed  to  measure aptitude and ability for particular work rather than upon formal educational levels. The new approach will make possible a career uninterrupted by lack of formal educational qualifications but requiring the passing of tests specially related to the type of work to be carried out in the new structure. Special training courses will be introduced which will include guided educational qualification in subjects pertinent to the work. </para>
          <para>The Department and the Public Service Board do not believe that this change in the method of qualifying for certain positions in the new Postal Levels Structure will depress educational standards, hamper recruitment, break down the career quality in training or lessen efficiency. In fact, it is expected that the opposite will be the case in each instance. </para>
          <para>Except for the occupants of positions of Postal Clerk-in-training, all officers and employees serving in positions covered by the new Postal Levels Structure at the time of application of that structure receive increases in salary. These increases result, firstly, from higher classifications attached to working levels and, secondly, from the translation of personal salaries in moving from the old structure to the new. Also, the new structure has given the Unions an opportunity to have the salaries of positions in this area of employment determined by the Public Service Arbitrator in their own right. The public hearing before the Public Service Arbitrator commenced on 4th February 1969, and is continuing. </para>

              <para>The Australian Government has made strong formal representations to the United States Administration over the recent proposal adopted by the U.S. Senate Finance Committee recommending the imposition of quota restrictions on imports of Iamb into the United States. In these representations the Australian Government has emphasised that there is no sound economic justification for restrictions on lamb imports, particularly since U.S. Iamb production has declined steadily in recent years and prices are currently at very high levels. lt should be noted that Congressional pressure for restrictions on lamb imports has apparently abated in recent weeks. Indeed, I understand that it is now unlikely that further moves will take place in Congress in the near future. Nevertheless, the Australian Government is maintaining a close watch on the situation and will make further representation to the United States Government if such action is considered necessary. </para>

That is what I endeavoured to indicate to him at the time. Unfortunately, the phrase that the Minister used is rather offensive to me, I do not doubt that he made it in the heat of the moment, but I feel that I should make an explanation. Perhaps he will accept the fact that I did not require a repetition of information that he had given to me previously. I asked a simple question which he could have answered by a yes or a no and he would thus have saved the Senate a considerable amount of time. </para>

            <para>- I would not like to hurt the honourable senator&#39;s feelings. He made an interjection when I was speaking. It was a quite inappropriate interjection made in the middle of an answer to a question. I would be quite prepared to bring it back to that position. I would go on to say that there is no such thing as a simple question or a simple answer in the Senate, least of all in an election year. </para>

He was an inspiration to everybody who served on the Committee and particularly to those who were new to it. Because of his complete impartiality, nobody who listened to what he had to say during the meetings of the Committee could tell from his remarks to what party he belonged. He refused to allow anybody to bring party politics into the meetings of the Committee, which is a joint standing committee representing both sides of the Parliament. Although I may have infringed the Standing Orders, I could not allow this occasion to pass without paying tribute to a very great man who today tendered his resignation from the Public Works Committee, which he has served well for 1 9 years. </para>

            <para>- by leave - this statement is concerned with the recent incidents near Kieta, Bougainville, in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, in connection with the provision of land for the Bougainville copper project. On 31st July a lease was issued to Bougainville Copper Pty Ltd under the Territory Mining Ordinance over 175 acres of land at Rorovana. On 1st August surveyors commenced marking the boundary of this land. In view of reports that there might be violence, 100 police were sent to the area in three groups. A group of approximately 20 women crowded around police guarding a concrete survey peg. The police did not use force and eventually the peg was removed and carried away by the women. Clearing and marking of the area continued on 2nd and 4th August without interference. On 5th August a bulldozer clearing scrub for the survey team was confronted by a group of approximately 65 men and women. There were approximately 70 police present. The officer in charge warned the people to disperse on at least two occasions. He then ordered a group of 15 police carrying shields and batons to move in front of the bulldozer and attempt to push the crowd away with their shields. There was a general melee and at this point the officer in charge decided to attempt to disperse the crowd with tear gas. The tear gas used is nontoxic. It was only partially effective. After further warnings police were ordered to use their batons about the legs of the natives and after a very short time the crowd dispersed. There were no injuries other than one man who appeared to have grazed his leg falling over a log. No-one was injured by the police. Minimum force was used. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The members of the Papua and New Guinea constabulary acquitted themselves with distinction in these incidents behaving with the greatest restraint and discipline. Their actions were at all times fully in accordance with the fine traditions of this force. These are the facts of the incidents. I turn now to the situation behind them. </para>
          <para>For many years there has been some knowledge of&#39; the mineral wealth at Bougainville Island but it was not until 1960 that an Administration geologist reported the possibility of a major low-grade copper deposit. Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd began prospecting the area in 1964. In 1967 after more than 12 months of negotiation an agreement was signed between the company and the Administration. This agreement was tabled in the Commonwealth Parliament. It was debated in the Territory House of Assembly and a ratifying ordinance was passed by the House. The House consisted of 54 elected and 10 official members. The House also amended the Territory mining legislation so as to provide that <inline font-style="italic">5% of</inline> all royalties for minerals should be paid to the owners of the land from which the minerals were taken. This was accepted by the Government. </para>
          <para>In June of this year the Territory House of Assembly, now consisting of 84 elected and 10 official members, debated a comprehensive White Paper on the Bougainville project and again endorsed it. The motion passed by the House on this occasion described the project as &#39;a major and essential development in the economic future of the Territory&#39;. </para>
          <para>In relation to the situation at Rorovana as well as at Arawa, the Administrator consulted the Administrator&#39;s Executive Council, which has a majority of elected members of the House of Assembly. The Council gave unanimous support to the Administrator&#39;s proposals for further direct consultation with the people, to be followed if unsuccessful by leasing under the Mining Ordinance or by compulsory acquisition under the Lands Ordinance, and endorsed the employment of police if necessary to ensure protection of those going about their lawful business in the area. The Council also expressed an earnest wish that the Rorovana and Arawa villagers would sell their land to the Administration. </para>
          <para>The Bougainville copper project offers gigantic benefits to the Territory as a whole. These benefits will include jobs for 2,500 New Guineans within the next five years, a township of 10,000 people, a $2m training programme for indigenous people during the period to 1973, revenue to the Administration of between S200m and $300m in the first 10 years of operation and export income in excess of $100m per annum. </para>
          <para>In addition, the Administration, on behalf of the people of the Territory, has the option of a 20% equity interest in the project. C.R.A. has indicated that it may also provide opportunities for individual equity participation by the people of Bougainville. The project therefore offers a tremendous opportunity for the Territory to lift itself up out of the field of competition of low priced tropical products in international trade, and to make a giant stride towards economic self reliance. </para>
          <para>In view of its importance to the Territory and in view of the nature of the problems involved, the Government and the Administration approached this whole question wilh great and careful consideration of the problems extending over many months. Advice regarding particular aspects of the attitude of the local people from expert anthropologists and psychologists has been carefully examined and the whole matter has been the subject of the most careful study. </para>
          <para>Certain difficulties were experienced in 1966 and 1967 in the actual area of mining operations at Panguna, where the open pit mine, the concentrate plant, the mine town and a location for stacking waste rock will be sited. The 10,000 acres of this land is covered by a special mining lease. </para>
          <para>The people of Guava, Moroni and Dapera who occupy or own land in this lease were originally antagonistic to the project as are the coastal people of Rorovana and Arawa now. The problems were handled patiently and sympathetically. These inland people are now reconciled to the mining operation. They are receiving full compensation for loss of housing and gardens and there will also be annual cash payments for the loss of use of land and for royalties, hi summary there are about 1,000 men, women and children involved and when the mine is fully in operation cash payments arc expected to total approximately SI 00,000 per year. Not all the compensation for loss of houses and gardens etc. has yet been determined by the mining warden but some fifty people in the village of Moroni have been awarded cash and kind compensation valued at approximately S40.000. </para>
          <para>Other leases required for roads, disposal of tailings, sources of aggregate and limestone etc. may total up to 40,000 acres. Much of this area will be swamp. It is not expected that village dwellings will be involved. </para>
          <para>The incidents on 1st and 5th August that I have referred to above relate only to requirements for the port. The company had however proposed that the town be sited on the coast in an area of some 2,000 acres south of the site proposed for the port. This location would have deprived some 650 villagers of their houses, gardens and economic crops. To avoid this the Administration decided to locate the town at Arawa plantation of 998 acres and to supplement this area with some 640 acres of adjacent sparsely planted village land which contained no village houses. </para>
          <para>The arrangements for land for the port and for the town that were decided upon were chosen so as to cause the least disturbance to the minimum number of native people. The land is uninhabited. No homes are lost. No villages are displaced. The people have other land. Full compensation will be paid. If need be, however, the Administration will also make other land available. </para>
          <para>In providing land for the port or for the town associated with the copper project the Administration is acting first and foremost in the interests of the Territory. The Territory gets more out of the copper project than the company does. The project will not be on full stream until about 1980. When that happens however the following points will apply: (a) Fifty per cent of the taxable income goes to the Territory Treasury, (b) Royalties are payable to the Territory Treasury in accordance with the Mining Ordinance scale, (c) If the Administration&#39;s option on 20% of the equity is taken up then one-fifth of the dividends paid or profits accumulated but not distributed will accrue to the Territory, </para>
          <para>Quite apart from these financial considerations and the indirect tax benefits flowing from the huge payroll that will be financed by the project there are the jobs, training, and development benefits I have already referred to. The people of Bougainville have known for years that the project would require substantial areas of land but until the detailed investigations were completed it was not possible to specify the particular areas. </para>
          <para>In March this year the company applied for its special mining lease. This brought into operation major aspects of the agreement, including the obligation by the Administration to provide land. For over 3 years the Administration has used all possible means to explain to the people of Bougainville the nature and implications of the mining project. The construction of Radio Kieta was expedited in 1967 to facilitate communications with the native people. </para>
          <para>Since mid-1966 over forty Administration patrols have been made in the area affected by the mining project. A primary objective of the patrols has been to explain to the people the nature of the project and how it would affect them. In addition individual officers have spent in the aggregate hundreds of days visiting villages and individual families for this same purpose. The Administrator himself visited Bougainville earlier this year and spoke to the people and talked over Radio Bougainville. Last month an Assistant Administrator led a special mission to the Island and held meetings in the villages most affected. This mission included indigenous Ministerial Members of the House of Assembly and all three Bougainville members of the House. Radio and news sheets have been used extensively and the elected members for Bougainville have been given every opportunity and encouragement to inform themselves and their people of the project and the consideration it had been given by the House of Assembly. </para>
          <para>As an example of the detailed and painstaking effort on the part of the Administration to achieve communication with the local people I refer to the fact that the Assistant District Commissioner of the area visited Rorovana 4 times in the past 4 months and the people of Rorovana themselves visited the District Headquarters at Kieta 12 times in the past 5 months for discussions. There have also been frequent discussions with the councillors of the Rorovana Council and the Council  President. </para>
          <para>It appears that the opposition of the Rorovana people to the sale of their land to the Administration is not related to lack of information or, indeed, to the amount of compensation offered to them. Some 175 acres of Rorovana land is required for the port area. The Rorovana people number some 4S0 and they have total land of approximately 1,600 acres. The loss of this 175 acres will not seriously affect their economic livelihood. They have been offered a good price and alternative productive land. There has never been any real indication they they would sell at any price. On the other hand, not all the native people are opposed. At the village of Lonsiro only a few miles from Rorovana, one native land-holding family concluded arrangements for the Administration under which they were paid $5,600 for a 42-year lease of 49 acres of land. </para>
          <para>The Administration&#39;s position in relation to negotiations for land for such public purposes as ports, town sites, airfields and so on has to take account of the need for these public facilities throughout the Territory. The proposed port for which the Rorovana land is required will be for public and not just for company use. The legal authority for compulsory acquisition or lease of land exists in the Territory as in other countries to avoid the need for excessive payments out of the public purse, that is, to serve the interests of the public as a whole. Compulsory acquisition is an essential power in all communities, lt is used in Australia more freely than in the Territory. Individuals or small groups are not allowed to hold the whole community up. In the Territory as here the amount of compensation is in the last resort subject to law. </para>
          <para>The Agreement between the Administration and CRA which the Commonwealth Government is backing is modern in its approach and enlightened in its ideas. There will be adequate return to the Territory Government in terms of taxes, royalties and dividends from the profits of the operation. There are those who would accept the merits of the Bougainville Copper Agreement but who would criticise the way in which the Government or the Administration have handled the matter. This is easily done. Nevertheless it ignores the tremendous difficulties of communication and of comprehension which have confronted the Administration in this matter. I have explained the painstaking nature of the Administration communication activity. There has been no effort spared. The basic difficulty has been that people of this area are living in one world and the problems of development and the requirements of development confront them with another world. </para>
          <para>In the absence of skill and patience and moderation on the part of the Administration, especially its field officers, we could easily have had a much worse situation than that which confronts us. As it is we cannot expect easy solutions. We must understand that what happened at Rorovana and what may happen elsewhere reflect the problems of transition into a modern world and a modern society. These cannot be sidestepped by an Administration that must act in the interests of the Territory as a whole. The Government, however, is grateful to the officers of the Administration for the extent to which their efforts have so far contained the problem. </para>
          <para>The Government makes no apology for the Agreement. It considers that the Agreement is a spectacular contribution to harnessing the interests of private capital and the skills of the large corporation to the development requirements of the Territory. Not many developing countries are fortunate enough to have the prospect of so large and so remunerative a development within their boundaries. In this, confidence plays a major part. The investment of S300m demands confidence. In this case the investors are showing their confidence not only in the Commonwealth Government but in the people of the Territory themselves because the mining project looks ahead to the time when the people will be running their own affairs. In this respect the projected investment is an act of imagination and confidence. There are many who seek to knock it but it has the backing of the Territory people through their House of Assembly. It will survive. </para>
          <para>The Government considers the Administration&#39;s actions are fully in accordance with the law. Action has been taken in Papua and New Guinea to test the law. The Government will welcome an authoritative and definite judicial interpretation of the legal position. Since 1964, the Government has made available to the Territory by way of grant in aid sums totalling $400m. The Government and the House of Assembly have last year jointly backed a 5-year Sl,000m development programme for the Territory. The Bougainville project offers a unique opportunity for the Territory to make a dramatic advance towards these objectives of development. </para>
          <para>The attitude of a handful of people may attract our sympathy, and we may go to considerable lengths to resolve their problems. But in the last resort we cannot allow them to block this great prospect and thus throw into doubt the policies on which the future of more than 2 million people depend. In the structure of ignorance, superstition and prejudice, persuasion and explanations are not easy, but with other expatriate influences working in the opposite direction - some not without prestige in native eyes - difficulties become great. </para>
          <para>The present choice before the people of this Territory is whether to drift into a primitive and backward situation in close dependency on the generosity of the Australian taxpayer to provide a modicum towards health, education and the preservation of law and order and burdened by their ancient custom or whether to advance as a modern state financed substantially by its own resources. These resources lie dormant and will continue that way under traditional attitudes. Developed they will provide the revenues for the hospitals, the schools, the better standard of life and, most important, a nation not only able to stand on its own feet economically but able to opt for a meaningful independence should this be desired. This progressive transition has been the way chosen by the people of the Territory. Its achievement needs sympathy and understanding from us in Australia as well as our continuing support. </para>

        <para>For both output and employment, 1968-69 was an exceptionally good year. Gross national product increased by 12% at current prices. Measured at constant prices the growth rate in real terms was more than 8.5%: approximately 2% being the result of the big increase in rural output following the drought of 1967-68. With allowance for this, a real growth rate of about 6.5% for the rest of the economy was a notable performance. </para>
        <para>Net immigration was at the highest level since the 1950&#39;s and added about 60,000 migrant workers to the workforce. Employment rose by about 150,000. Outside the rural sector, productivity seems to have risen by about 3.5%. </para>

        <para>Last year&#39;s increase in output was matched by rising demand, except in the over-supplied world wheat market. In the earlier months of 1968-69, consumer spending increased rather slowly. It gained strength as the year went on and, for the year as a whole, increased by 6.7%. </para>
        <para>Private capital expenditure accelerated  in  1968-69 to reach boom levels. Expenditure on dwellings increased by 16% over the previous year. Expenditure on other buildings and construction rose by 15%. After rising by only 3% in 1967-68, expenditure on plant and equipment last year increased by 10%. Private investment can therefore be clearly identified as the driving force behind the expansion of the economy that became apparent in the latter half of 1968-69. </para>
        <para>Total spending by Governments and their instrumentalities also increased - by 9%. This was slower than the rate of increase in gross national product at current prices - 12% - and slower also than the 12% increase in public spending in 1967-68. Outlay in Australia from the Commonwealth Budget was 7.6% greater than in 1967-68 when it rose by 8.5%. </para>
        <para>The  effects  of the strong rise in demand began to show up in the labour market half-way through last financial year. At the end of December 1968 the seasonally adjusted figure for persons registered for employment  exceded  that for untitled vacancies by 30,573. By the end of June the gap was reduced to 10,897. This tightening occurred despite the big migrant inflow and the continuing addition of large numbers of married women to the employed workforce. There is no sign yet that pressure in the labour market is being reduced. On the contrary, the information available to us indicates a continued tightening. </para>

        <para>An unwelcome feature of the rising pressure on resources has been the overrapid increase in costs. In the March quarter of 1969 average weekly earnings were 8.6% above the level of the year before and for 1968-69 as a whole the increase was about 7.25%. As a consequence of these higher costs, the consumer price index increased by 2.9% during 1968-69. The non-food groups in the index increased by about 3.75% - a much faster rate than in 1967-68. </para>

        <para>Last year more than $200m was added to our holdings of gold and foreign exchange. On official account, external payments exceeded external receipts by more than $400m. On private account, the opposite occurred. An excess of external receipts over external payments of more than $600m added considerably to monetary liquidity in Australia. The big increase in Rural Credits advances by the Reserve Bank, mainly to finance the record wheat harvest, also added to the money supply. On the other side of the ledger, the domestic surplus of receipts over outlay in the Commonwealth Budget reduced monetary liquidity. Despite this, the money supply in the form of trading and savings bank deposits and notes and coin in the hands of the public increased by 9.1%. The increase in the previous year was 8.3%. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para>At this stage indications are that 1969-70 will be another year of strong economic growth. Except in parts of Queensland and Western Australia, seasonal conditions are promising and rural output should again increase. We could not, however, expect to repeat last year&#39;s gain in rural production which followed the recovery from the drought of 1967-68. The output from other sectors of the economy also should rise well even though, with unemployment at a low level and mainly of the short-term kind, the labour market is now much tighter than it was a year back. With not much change in the present low level of unemployment, it seems unlikely that this year&#39;s increase in the numbers employed will be as great as last year&#39;s. Nevertheless, given productivity increases comparable with those of last year, non-farm output should expand at a rate not far short of that achieved in 1968-69. An increase of at least 6% in gross national product at constant price seems a reasonable forecast to make. </para>
      <para>With the expectation that there will be another good year for output we have to ask how the trends in demand are likely to develop. The rate at which incomes are rising leaves no doubt that consumption expenditure will continue to gain strength. </para>
      <para>Spending by Governments and their instrumentalities for both current and capital purposes increased last year by 9%. This year it seems likely to rise at much the same rate. </para>
      <para>Another year of large-scale private capital outlay seems certain. How strongly this expenditure will be supported by capital in How is one of the uncertainties we have to allow for. Present conditions in capital markets abroad suggest that it would be prudent to allow for a reduction in capital inflow this year. If that occurred, it could have a direct effect on capital expenditure and would tend to modify the influences adding to monetary liquidity. </para>
      <para>At present, however, capital expenditure is imposing a considerable strain on the economy. At least in some States, the demands now being made on the building industry in particular must be pressing closely against the limit of resources. Shortage of building materials have shown up, costs have been rising at an increasing rate and construction times have lengthened. Any aggravation of these conditions must be harmful both for homebuilders and the industry. </para>

        <para>It has to be recognised that any tendency for demand to outrun supply in the home market will have adverse effects on the balance of payments. In looking ahead, then, we must take account of the implications of excessive pressure developing in some sectors of the economy. </para>
        <para>The prospects for exports seem reasonably good except in the overseas wheat market. Rural exports should increase in volume and, provided prices hold, should once more add to our export earnings. Another big rise in exports of minerals is certain and it is reasonable to expect exports of manufactures to improve. </para>
        <para>A rise in domestic demand is bound to attract additional imports. There could well be a trade surplus but the deficit on invisible payments will increase. Whether the net inflow of capital will balance the deficit on current account is difficult to assess. Excluding defence credits, official capital transactions abroad involve debt repayments amounting to some $200m and conditions in the international capital markets are not at the moment particularly favourable to loan raisings. Summing up, we can reasonably hope that there will be an approximate balance in our external transactions. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that we may have to draw to some extent on our external reserves. These reserves are, fortunately, strong enough to enable us to cope with a temporary oversea payments deficit. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para class="block">In determining the structure and consistency of this year&#39;s Budget, we have endeavoured to make it fit the prospective economic conditions, including likely movements in monetary liquidity. In last year&#39;s Budget, the deficit - or the amount borrowed to make up the difference between expenditure and all revenue receipts - was reduced, as compared with that of the year before, by $257m to a net amount of $3 85m. This year we are budgeting for a deficit of only $30m or $356m below last year&#39;s deficit. </para>
      <para>We estimate that total receipts will rise by $825m or 13.5% to $6,954m because of buoyant conditions and strong demand. Expenditure is estimated to rise by $469m or 7.2% to $6,983m. </para>
      <para>The direct demand the Budget expenditure will make on resources is measured by the estimate of net expenditure on goods and services. This excludes transfer payments, such as pensions or interest, and net advances, such as those made to the States. In this Budget, this expenditure is estimated to increase by only 1.2%, compared with an increase of 7.8% in 1968-69. The much slower rate of increase is accounted for largely by a substantial reduction in defence spending abroad. lt has to be emphasised that it is expenditure in Australia that adds directly to demand on local resources. Net Budget expenditure in Australia on goods and services is estimated to increase by 7.3% - a significant reduction on last year&#39;s 10% increase. </para>
      <para>We expect total outlay in Australia, including welfare and other transfer payments and advances, to increase by 9.6% compared with last year&#39;s rise of 7.6%. In the main, this is accounted for by increased welfare payments and the additional funds going to the States. </para>
      <para>We estimate that total receipts in Australia will exceed outlays in Australia by about S500m in 1969-70. This domestic surplus would bc about $3 00m greater than that achieved in 1968-69. Since it represents a net withdrawal of a comparable amount from the private sector&#39;s monetary holdings in Australia, the domestic surplus should have a considerable effect in modifying the expansion of domestic monetary liquidity. This effect would be strengthened to the extent that net sales of Commonwealth securities were made to the non-bank public in Australia. Less buoyant liquidity conditions will, of course, help to contain increases in spending from local borrowings or other capital raisings in the Australian market. </para>

        <para>Defence expenditure overseas is expected to be about $243m or $87m less than last year. </para>

        <para>It does not amount to a reduction in our defence effort. </para>
        <para>As has been announced, the defence programmes of the future will not be limited to set 3-year periods but will always look 5 years ahead aud be kept under constant review. In accordance with this concept, studies have been undertaken in the Defence Department and equipment and works proposals have been brought forward and approved for inclusion in this Budget. Studies are continuing on other projects and as these are approved they will be admitted to the programme. The projects so far approved include ship construction and various items of capital works and equipment. The ship construction programme will include a fast combat support ship, a hydrographic ship and an oceanographic ship for the Navy and heavy landing craft for the Army. It is also proposed lo put in hand a preliminary design study for new light destroyers for the Navy as replacements for some of the R.A.N.&#39;s existing destroyers. There will be technical items of equipment ordered for all Services. The Army will be authorised to enter into forward commitments this year with the object of acquiring additional arms and armaments. This authorisation could involve expenditure of up to $60m next year but, as the orders placed will include long leadtime items, there will be a continuing commitment for expenditure in later years. A decision has also been taken to proceed with major airfield works at Learmonth, Western Australia; it is unlikely that there will be any expenditure on the project in 1969-70. AH of these proposals, about which details will be given in the course of the Budget debate, will add substantially to our defence capability. </para>
        <para>Further additions to the strength of the Forces are planned for the year ahead.

These additional numbers are required to man new ships and aircraft coming into service, meet operational commitments overseas and provide supporting clements in Australia. The Citizen Military Force is expected to increase from 34,256 to 36,000. </para>

          <page.no>41</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The maximum weekly rate of pensions payable to single age and invalid pensioners and widows with children will be increased by SI to $15 per week. For widows without children the new weekly maximum rate will be &#167;13.25. The pension payable to a married pensioner couple will increase for each by 75 cents a week so that the maximum rate of their combined pensions will be $26.50. Persons in receipt of service pensions - which are repatriation benefits - will receive similar increases as will tuberculosis sufferers in receipt of allowances. For the future, the hitter will, in addition, be eligible for certain benefits and concessions available to social service pensioners. </para>
        <para>The Government has given particular attention to the needs of widows with children and proposes to introduce special measures to assist them. The allowance payable for each child, after the first, of a widow pensioner will be increased by $1 a week to bring the total payment, excluding child endowment, for each such child to $3.50 a week. This benefit will also be extended to children, other than the first, of age, invalid and service pensioners. As a further measure of assistance, the mother&#39;s and guardian&#39;s allowance is to be increased from the present rate of $4 per week to $6 per week in cases where there is a child under the age of 6 or an invalid child requiring full lime care. As well, the deduction from income for means test purposes for a dependent child of a pensioner is to be increased by SI a week to S4 a week. A widow pensioner with, say, three dependent children may thus earn $22 a week, hold property of a value up to S4,500 and still receive full pension and allowances. All these new benefits will be extended to age, invalid and service pensioners in appropriate cases. </para>
        <para>We have also decided to modify the residence qualifications for widows&#39; pensions so that certain women who are widowed overseas may be eligible for a widow&#39;s pension on return to Australia provided they have lived in Australia for a continuous period of 10 years. Because of the number of persons who have, in the past, migrated to Australia, and now wish to visit their home country, it is intended to permit pensioners making temporary visits overseas to receive payment of pension for up to 30 weeks absence on return to Australia. The present limit is 12 weeks. </para>
        <para>Persons who become pensioners because of the proposed increases in basic rates of pension will become members of the Pensioner Medical Service, giving them entitlement to free medical and hospital treatment and free pharmaceutical benefits. They will be entitled also to other subsidiary benefits provided by the Commonwealth, such as reduced radio and T.V. licence fees, telephone rentals, hearing aids and funeral benefits. Persons who become pensioners for the first time because of the introduction of the &#39;tapered&#39; means test - to which I shall now refer - will not, however, be eligible for membership of the Pensioner Medical Service or entitled to any other subsidiary fringe benefits. </para>
        <para class="block">Liberalisation of the Means Test 1 now come to the liberalisation of the means lest. Liberalisation has been the continuing policy of the Government, and the proposal I now outline will represent the most significant move forward since the Government assumed office. </para>
        <para>Under present pension arrangements, where a pensioner has means in excess of the &#39;free&#39; level - $10 per week in the case of a single pensioner and $17 per week in the case of married pensioner couples - the pension payable is reduced by $1 for every $1 of means in excess of these limits. This provision does not provide any incentive to earn or provide for additional income. The Government proposes, therefore, to introduce a &#39;tapered&#39; means test under which additional means in excess of the &#39;free&#39; limits to which I have referred will, in future, reduce the age, invalid, widows&#39; or service pension by only 50 cents for each additional dollar of means. As a direct consequence of this change, single pensioners with means in excess of$ 10 per week will all receive increased pensions and eligibility for some pension will not cut out until their means reaches $40 a week instead of $24 - the cut-off point at the existing pension rate. In the case of married couples, both being pensioners, eligibility for some pension will continue until their joint means reach a level of $70 per week. </para>
        <para>When I come to the revenue estimates I shall outline additional concessions we propose to give under the Income Tax Age Allowance to take account of the &#39;tapered&#39; means test. </para>
        <para>It is expected that approximately 250,000 persons will become eligible either for pension for the first time or for increased pensions under the proposed &#39;tapered&#39; means test. </para>

Where there are children in the family of an unemployed or sickness beneficiary, the allowance for children under 16 will be raised by $1 to $2.50 a week in the case of a first child under 16 and by $2 to $3.50 a week for second and subsequent children. Appropriate increases will be made in the allowance payable to unmarried minors. Where they have no parent living in Australia they will receive the adult rate of benefit. At the same time the amount of income which may be received without affecting entitlement to the full rate of benefit is to be increased by $2 to $6 a week in the case of adults or married minors and from $2 to $3 per week in the case of unmarried minors. </para>
        <para>In order to relieve hardship in cases where there are frequent periods of unemployment or recurrent sickness, beneficiaries will in future need to serve only once in any period of 13 consecutive weeks the waiting period of 7 days before unemployment or sickness benefit can be paid. The Director-General of Social Services will also be authorised to exercise a discretion to waive recovery of all or part of sickness benefit in. cases of hardship or special circumstances such as where inadequate compensation or damages are obtained. At present full recovery is mandatory. </para>
        <para>The total cost of all of these proposals is estimated to be $73m in 1969-70. In consequence, total expenditure on social services this year will be $999m. </para>

We propose to increase this allowance by $2 per week so that a general rale pensioner who qualifies for the allowance will receive $17 per week where his incapacity is assessed at 100% and $12.75 where the assessment is at 75%. The rate of pension payable to those able to work only part-time or intermittently because of a war-caused disability - the intermediate rate - will be increased by $2.25 to $26.50 a week. </para>
        <para>War widows&#39; pension will be increased by $1 to $15 a week, and in addition, the domestic allowance payable to most war widows will be increased by 50 cents a week.

        <para>The Commonwealth has progressively increased the scale and broadened the scope of its financial support for education. Through specific purpose payments and general financial grants assistance is being provided at all levels and for all types of schools. Over $265m will be appropriated in the Budget for education this year, or 38% more than last year&#39;s expenditure. Within the total, payments to the States specifically for education will increase by 53% to $165m. </para>
        <para>Payments will include the full-year cost of the new programmes of capital grants for secondary school libraries and pre-school teachers colleges introduced last year. Provision is being made for the programme of development of Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education in prospect for the 1970-1972 triennium, as well as for other new policy proposals, to which I shall refer shortly. </para>
        <para>Detailed statements about education, including the recommendations of the Australian Universities Commission and the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Advanced Education for. the 1970-1972 triennium, will be made shortly. </para>
        <para>Broadly stated, the triennial programmes are based on the expectation that by 1972 total student enrolment, full and part-time, in Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education will be more than 45,000 greater than in the current academic year. To meet this expected demand, these institutions will need better capital facilities and greater appropriations for recurrent costs. </para>
        <para>The recommended programmes for these institutions in the 1970-1972 triennium aggregate $9 10m - an increase of $263m on tha programmes of the 1967-1969 triennium. The recommended programmes for Colleges of Advanced Education will account for $127m of this increase. Reflecting the growing national importance of applied science and the technologies, expenditures on these Colleges will be more than doubled in the coming triennium. </para>
        <para>Of the amount of $9 10m recommended for Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education during the next 3 calendar years the Commonwealth will provide approximately $420m, the remainder being provided by State Governments and by the fees and other income of the institutions themselves. </para>
        <para>During the triennium, grants to the States for Universities and Colleges of Advanced Education are expected to amount to $227m and $93m respectively. In 1969-70 the grants will be $96m, or $19ra more than last year. Grants for science laboratories, technical training facilities, teacher and pre-school teacher training colleges and secondary school libraries will, in the aggregate, increase by $21.5m. </para>
        <para>For the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education, we will provide S30.2m in 1969- 70, of which S22.5m is for recurrent expenditure and S7.7m is for capital expenditure. For the next triennium as a whole, the estimated provision will be about $100m. </para>
        <para>We share with the States the conviction that the training and education of teachers is critical to help us achieve our objectives. We have reviewed our policy relating to teacher training and have made two decisions. First, we will continue with unmatched capital grants for the construction of teachers&#39; colleges by the States after the present programme is completed in June 1970. These grants will increase to $30m in the 3 years to June 1973 as compared with $24m in the previous 3 years. Second, we will support expenditure both capital and recurrent on teacher education within Colleges of Advanced Education and, indeed, have given the first approvals for the 1970- 1972 triennium. </para>

          <page.no>44</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>I come now to an important new aspect of policy relating to education in independent schools. This is a significant development in the policy introduced about 5 years ago. From January 1970 the Commonwealth will contribute towards the running costs of independent schools throughout Australia. A subsidy at the rate of $35 per primary pupil and $50 per secondary pupil per annum will be paid to the schools. With the assistance State Governments will be providing, the Commonwealth subvention will both help the parents and enable the independent schools to improve their standards. </para>
        <para>The State Governments will be offered grants under Section 96 of the Constitution for transmission to independent schools in their respective States. The necessary legislation will be introduced later in these Sittings. In the case of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, payments will be made direct to the independent schools as an addition to the present per pupil subsidies. </para>
        <para>The estimated cost of this new measure is $16.3m in 1969-70. Of this amount, S16m will be paid to the States. In the first full year, the comparable figures are $24. 5m and $24. lm respectively. </para>
        <para class="block">Subsidies on Fertilisers </para>
        <para>Turning to our rural industries, I now outline proposals that will continue our aim to assist them with their more pressing problems. </para>
        <para>A subsidy of $6 a ton on standard superphosphate used in Australia was introduced in August 1963. Last year we decided to extend to October 1971 the operation of the authorising legislation and to increase the standard rate of subsidy to $8 a ton with effect from 14th August 1968. This year we have decided to increase the rate of subsidy still further. As from tomorrow the standard rate will be $12 per ton. At the new rate the subsidy is expected to cost $50m this year or $19m more than last year. </para>
        <para>In August 1966 we introduced a subsidy on nitrogenous fertilisers, for which the authorising legislation is due to expire in October 1969. We have now decided to continue the subsidy for a further 3 years at an estimated cost in 1969-70 of $l5m or $4m more than last year. </para>

        <para>To afford further assistance to the wool growing industry, the Government has decided to offer the industry a more generous arrangement for the financing of wool research and promotion. For 3 years commencing 1st July 1970, the growers&#39; levy would be reduced from two to one per cent and the Government would meet the balance of the expenditure required for research and promotion, provided its contribution does not exceed an average of $27m per annum. In effect, the growers&#39; levy would be halved and the Government&#39;s contribution approximately doubled. The Government&#39;s offer will have to be negotiated wilh the Australian Wool Industry Conference together with any changes that might be required in the areas of responsibility for the administration of wool research and promotion by virtue of the increased financial commitment assumed by the Government. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Since 1960-61 the Commonwealth has each year made payments to the wheat industry to enable returns to growers to be raised to the guaranteed price in respect of specified quantities of exported wheat. In 1968-69 the payment involved was $43m. </para>
        <para class="block">This enabled the return to growers to be raised by more than 28 cents to $1.64 per bushel f.o.r. on 1 50 million bushels of export wheat in respect of the 1967-68 season. The Wheat Industry Stabilisation Act 1968 provides a guaranteed price on exports of up to 200 million bushels in respect of each of the five wheat seasons 1968-69 to 1972-73. For the first of these seasons the guaranteed price is $1.45 per bushel f.o.b. and for subsequent seasons it will be adjusted in accordance with movements in cash costs. It is expected that a wheat stabilisation payment in respect of the 1968-69 crop will be made in 1970-71. No provision will be needed for a payment this year. </para>

The increase in this year&#39;s provision over actual advances in 1968-69 is due in substantial measure to two special circumstances; first, in 1968-69 the Post Office was able to achieve a greater improvement in its net cash operating surplus than is expected in 1969-70 and second, payments on some large equipment orders, which were expected to fall due last year, now have to be met in 1969-70 instead of hist year. </para>

        <para>The largest absolute increase in any of the main classes of expenditure is the rise of $l86m in payments to or for the States - an increase of 12.8%. In addition, the Stale works and housing programmes will increase by $48m to $758m. Of this amount SI 32m has been allocated under the CommonwealthSlate Housing Agreements. </para>
        <para>Departmental running expenses are estimated to increase by $43m to nearly $443m, or 10.6% higher than last year&#39;s expenditure. </para>
        <para>External economic aid will be increased by $13m, or 9.3%, to total more than $150m. This figure includes $96m for assistance to Papua and New Guinea, which will be $9m, or 10.3% greater than last year. </para>
        <para>Commonwealth payments to industry will, on present estimates exceed $200m, a decrease on last year of $ 10.3m. As I have said, no wheat stabilization payment is expected this year. Last year the cost was $43m. Devaluation compensation for primary industries is estimated at $29m, a reduction of $6m. Partly offsetting these decreases are the increased subsidies on superphosphate and nitrogenous fertilizers, and the increased grants for industrial research and development to which I referred earlier. </para>
        <para>We propose to pay a further amount of approximately $7.2m to the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account to meet special expenditure in 1969-70, in particular in the fields of health, education and housing. The balance of about$1. 3m in the Trust Account at 30th June 1 969 will be used to meet outstanding commitments under similar programmes commenced last year; expenditure in 1968-69 on these programmes was approximately $4.0m. </para>
        <para>Of the$10m appropriated to the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account last year, $4.7m was subsequently paid to the Commonwealth Capital Fund established under the Aboriginal Enterprises (Assistance) Act 1968. It is not expected that any substantial addition to this Fund will be required in 1969-70. </para>
        <para>This year we are seeking an appropriation of $2. 85m for grants in support of the performing arts, an increase of$1.2m over expenditure in 1968-69. The Australian Council for the Arts, now in its second year, has provided valuable advice to the Government. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para class="block">Another year of high and rising incomes and buoyant expenditure in all sectors of the economy is expected and we have based our revenue estimates on this expectation. </para>
      <para class="block">Receipts from all sources except borrowing are estimated to rise to $6,954m - an increase of 13.5% on last year&#39;s receipts. Total taxation revenue is estimated to be $6,237m, an increase of 14.7% on last year. </para>
      <para>With a large increase of revenues in prospect we considered, in the overall budget strategy, whether greater expenditure than those proposed could have been financed or whether we could have given greater tax concessions than those I am about to mention. </para>
      <para>The essence of the situation we face is that, if our revenues rise as much as expected, it will be largely because of highly expansive economic conditions. If there were, in these circumstances, greater increases in expenditure than those proposed, we would have added further to demand on resources already under some strain. It would be much the same if we reduced taxation substantially. </para>
      <para>We have not therefore considered it prudent to give general concessions in taxation. We have, however, thought it desirable, in order to deal with special circumstances, to propose some changes in taxes and rates of charges. </para>

        <para>Under the present age allowance an aged person is exempt from tax if his or her own taxable income does not exceed $1,248 while a married aged person is exempt if the combined taxable income of husband and wife does not exceed $2,184. </para>
        <para>For 1969-70 no tax will be payable by an aged person whose taxable income does not exceed $1,300 or by a married aged person unless the combined taxable income of husband and wife exceeds $2,262. </para>
        <para>In order to cushion the transition from complete exemption to taxation at ordinary rates of tax, the age allowance provisions include &#39;shading-in&#39; arrangements to limit the amount of tax payable by an aged person with a taxable income somewhat in excess of the exemption levels. To take account of the new &#39;tapering&#39; provisions for  age pensions to which I have already referred, we propose to reduce the tax payable under these limiting provisions and to extend the ranges of income within which the limitation confers a benefit. </para>

        <para>We propose also to amend the income tax law as it now applies to convertible securities. In 1960, the income tax law was amended to disallow the deduction of interest payable by companies on convertible securities. This action was taken because it was evident that convertible notes were being used largely as a means of avoiding taxation. In many cases, the convertible notes were essentially deferred issues of shares. </para>
        <para>The Government recognises that convertible issues can serve legitimate business purposes, it has therefore been decided to restore deductibility of interest for income tax purposes on convertible issues but this will be made subject to conditions designed to minimise tax avoidance. </para>

          <page.no>47</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The Government has also decided that the present law granting tax deductions for subscriptions of capital to certain kinds of companies can, for some taxpayers, confer unjustified benefits. lt is a general principle of the tax law that where a deduction for an amount of expenditure is authorised by more than one provision only one deduction is allowed. There is under the existing law an exception to this principle, with the effect that where certain shares are sold by a share dealer, deductions granted with the general aim of facilitating the financing of mineral exploration or afforestation arc disregarded in calculating the profit or loss on sale. In effect, a taxable profit on a sale of the shares is reduced through the allowance of two deductions for the cost of the shares and a deductible loss on a sale is likewise increased. In some cases, the reduction in tax liabilities can be as great as the total cost of the shares. lt is proposed to amend section 82 of the income tax law so that dealers in shares will be allowed only one deduction for capital subscribed to mining or afforestation companies. The amendment will affect moneys paid on shares after today, except where the dealer owned the shares on or before today, or became the owner after today pursuant to an application lodged, or an agreement made, by today. People who are not regarded as dealers for tax purposes will not be affected by the amendment. </para>

In reaching this decision we had in mind the desirability of providing assistance to discourage the break ing-up of economic rural holdings because of the need to pay estate duty. </para>
        <para>Relief will be granted in two ways. The existing exemption levels will, for primary production estates, be raised by 20 per cent. Some additional relief from duty will be granted in respect of land and other assets normally used in primary production such as livestock and farm plant and machinery, in broad terms, an estate will qualify for these reliefs when the assets arc predominantly of the kind I have mentioned and the income of the deceased person was derived over the preceding five years principally from primary production. Relief will be granted for estates of a net value of less than $250,000. </para>
        <para>The relief will apply to estates of persons who die after the authorising legislation has been assented to. </para>
        <para>As a complementary measure some administrative requirements of the estate duty law are to be relaxed. The necessity to lodge security in order to obtain an extension of time for payment of duty is to be eliminated and the statutory limit of two years on extensions of time is to be removed. </para>

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para class="block">Last year, despite a domestic surplus of about $200m in the Budget, the money supply increased by $1,1 69m. The rate of change in bank customers&#39; accounts suggests that the turnover of funds, or velocity of circulation, also increased. As I have already said these monetary influences undoubtedly contributed to the rise of inflationary pressures. </para>
      <para>This year we expect the Budget to produce a domestic surplus of about $500m. This would withdraw a similar amount from the money supply. Against that, receipts will exceed payments in private transactions abroad - possibly by much the same amount - and this will add an equivalent amount to the money supply. Further additions to the money supply will be made from other sources. In particular, the Reserve Bank will again add to Rural Credits advances outstanding as it finances payments on delivery of wheat and other commodities pending sale. </para>
      <para>Loans and advances by the banks will again add to the money supply. Action has been taken to moderate the rate at which the banks increase their lending. Trading banks are being called upon to transfer to their Statutory Reserve Deposits and additional amount equivalent to 1% of their deposits. This action has been accompanied by a rise of 0.25% in maximum trading bank fixed deposit and maximum overdraft rates of interest. A new maximum rate of 5% now applies to both fixed deposit and certificates of deposit and within this maximum the term and rate structure has been made more flexible. </para>
      <para>To counter the influences which add to monetary liquidity, the Reserve Bank has been a net seller of Commonwealth securities in its open-market operations. Last year it made net sales of about $78m. A new pattern of rates emerged and was reflected in the Commonwealth loan floated last month, with the yield on the long-dated securities rising from 5.4 to 6%. We have aimed at consolidating the strength of Commonwealth securities in the market. </para>
      <para>These measures are part of a precautionary move against inflatinary trends. They will not in any way inhibit the real growth of the economy. The fact is that a large volume of monetary liquidity has been carried over from the past financial year. In the interests of stability and sound growth, we must limit the amount that will be added to liquidity this year. The real problem is to keep the increase within safe bounds and to prevent it becoming excessive. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para>This financial year will take us over the threshold of the next decade, the 1970&#39;s. From an economic point of view, the prospects are basically favourable. The new resources being opened up must add increasingly to output both for domestic use and for export. Our productivity has risen and will continue to rise. Migrants are pouring in and the workforce is building up rapidly. We are attracting a good flow of capital from overseas. Our reserves are reasonably strong and, despite monetary and trade disturbances abroad, our exports are growing, diversifying and reaching out into still wider markets. </para>
      <para>This provides a margin of safety. It gives us some scope and time for any adjustments needed to keep the economy on a sure and steady course ahead. </para>
      <para>The broad promise of future growth does not however reduce, or change essentially, the continuing problem of economic management, that is, of keeping the national effort close to the limit of available resources but not allowing it to exceed this limit. The problem is with us this year in characteristic form. Rapidly though our supplies of labour, equipment and materials are increasing, demand is right up with them and is growing fast. There is a clear possibility that excess demand, helped by excess liquidity, could upset the balance of the economy. This Budget, in its economic aspect, together with the monetary measures taken lately, is primarily directed to minimising this risk. </para>
      <para>But budgets are much more than instruments of economic policy. This Budget is designed to share some of our growing wealth with the less fortunate, to provide still better educational facilities for the young, to help rural industries improve their productivity and to meet competition abroad, and to expand great developmental works in many parts of the country. </para>
      <para>Although economic feasibility will, in the end, set limits to what can be done in any field, economic purposes will have little meaning unless they contribute to personal and humane values. It is the physical and intellectual progress of the community and of the individual human beings in it that ultimately counts. It will be seen that humane values are in the forefront of the purposes this Budget is designed to achieve. </para>
