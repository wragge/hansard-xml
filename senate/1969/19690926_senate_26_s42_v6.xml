            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Education and Science a question. When the distribution of the $9m of Federal money for libraries in secondary schools is being made in 1970, will the Government, if it is still the government of the day, endeavour to lay down principles as guidelines for the apparent arbitrary discrimination in favour of certain schools? </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister a question, ls it a fact that in June 1965 the Australian forces in Vietnam totalled 1,100 men, in September 1965, 1,700 men, in June 1966, 4,500 men and in December 1966, 5,760 men? Why does the Prime Minister insist that it would be impossible to reduce the number of men in Vietnam because 8,000 men make a viable force? Were the Australian forces not viable on the dates I have mentioned? </para>

            <para>- lt is true that at certain times there have been variations in the strength of the Australian forces in Vietnam. Tt has to be understood that, once the force is made into a new viable force, quite obviously it has all the accompanying things. This is a logistic problem and a problem of Army establishments. In any event, the situation is that the Government has made a statement that at this point of time there are no proposals to vary the force. I think I made that statement in this place last week. </para>

In view of the considerable interest throughout the whole Australian community in all forms of scientific and technological development in this age, can the Minister indicate steps taken or to be taken to afford to as wide a cross-section of the public as possible a chance to view exhibitions provided by his Department in Tasmania? </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> made certain representations to me some time ago, and it was decided to provide an exhibition in Tasmania. But, since he has now widened his question, perhaps 1 should give the information as I understand it to be. Three exhibitions containing an Apollo display, a WRESAT panel and spacecraft models will be shown at Devonport at the Reece High School from 27th September to 1st October as part of a scientific and industrial exhibition. The same display is to be included in the Home and Trade Fair which is to be held at Launceston from 27th October to 1st November and which is to be sponsored by the local radio station, 7LA. The same display will be presented in Hobart from 10th November to 21st November at the Commonwealth Bank Building. </para>

In the case of the officers from Victoria, will compensation be received for the loss of the public holiday yesterday - Show Day - in that State? </para>

            <para>- The terms of employment of these Commonwealth officers, as is the case with other Commonwealth officers, are prescribed in the Commonwealth Public Service Act. I cannot give a particular answer in relation to the circumstances of officers who have been in attendance in connection with the Estimates debate. All I wish to say is that as a result of discussions that we have had over the last 24 hours, J anticipate that we will be able to dispose of the Estimates today. Therefore, the officers concerned will be able to return to their various departments on the completion of the debate. The terms and conditions under which these officers make themselves available to the Parliament are covered by the Commonwealth Public Service Act. </para>

              <para>The areas and the facilities provided for staff in Parliament House are kept under review and, when necessary and if practicable, improvements are made. It will be appreciated, however, that a limiting circumstance in this is that many areas were not designed for their present usage but have been made over to meet a need. Also the acute shortage of accommodation for staff facilities, as well as for other purposes, is a continuing problem and one that limits what might otherwise be possible. </para>

              <para>Continuing steps have been taken to make the best use of the limited available library space from the point of view of staff comfort. The problem of too little available space is recognised, as indicated by the fact that the Presiding Officers have obtained from the Library Committee a review of Library space problems. This review will be taken into account when it is possible to provide additional space in Parliament House. (31 The salaries of the staff of the Parliament are kept under review by the Departments to which the officers belong. Such reviews are a continuing process and they are not conducted on a periodical basis. When general salary increases occur as a consequence of Public Service Arbitrator's determinations, these are applied to Parliamentary staff to the same degree and from the same date as they apply to the Public Service. In so far as individual cases are concerned, a review of the salary classification is made when a change in the functions, responsibilities, or circumstances occur that appears to make this necessary. </para>

Subsequently on 2nd September the Director-General of Civil Aviation visited Lismore for discussions with the Lismore City Council. As a result of these discussions further technical investigations will be made by the Department into safety considerations relating to the question of night operations at Lismore Aerodrome. </para>

            <para>The statistics sought by the honourable senator do not exist in any readily quotable form. Separate statistics are not maintained for Aboriginal Australians by the authorities cited. Moreover, there are now no Government Settlements in Western Australia. </para>
            <para>Notwithstanding this absence of statistics, it can be said that the rate of infant mortality among Aboriginals is in many areas clearly higher than that for the community as a whole. This is a matter of very great concern to the Government. By means  of  its own efforts in the Northern Territory and through its grants to the States for Health the Government is already engaged in genera] programmes which will, it is hoped, have some effect by way  of  reducing the rale of Aboriginal infant mortality. In addition, and possibly of more importance in the long term, the Government is, through the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of Health, and in association with State Aboriginal affairs and Health authorities, seeking to determine the magnitude of the problem, the precise causes of Aboriginal infant mortality and the remedies therefor. </para>

I do not wish to add substantially to the information already given, except to indicate that the extent of the Commonwealth response to educational needs is very clearly shown by its greatly increased financial contributions towards both the Government and private sectors of education. In 1963-64 the Commonwealth share of total expenditure by the Commonwealth and State Governments on education was $68 million (12%); in 1969-70 Commonwealth expenditure is expected to rise to$266 million (23%). </para>

            <para>The Government has kept developments in the Indian Ocean area under close observation and is aware that other countries continue to do likewise. The United Kingdom continues to have defence commitments in this area, lt does not follow from the presence of some Russian naval ships that we are moving towards a situation in which the important international sea lanes and lines of communication across the Indian Ocean will be threatened. Many other countries share our concern for the security of the region and as opportunities arise exchanges of view take place al various levels concerning the future security requirements of the area. </para>

Although the requirement in the 1964 legislation that at least 40% of the Commonwealth Aid Roads grants be spent on 'minor' rural roads is not continued in the new arrangements, the grant allocated for such roads in Tasmania should enable a significant increase in expenditure to be achieved. Thus, over the next five years, a total grant of over $ 1.9.7m will be available for expenditure on rural roads other than arterial roads, an increase of more than $4. 7m on the amount required to be spent on 'minor' rural roads for the 5 years ending in 1968-69. A further grant of almost $ 10.9m has been allocated by the Commonwealth for expenditure on arterial roads in rural areas of Tasmania. Thus, over the 5 years, a total grant of $30.6m will be available for expenditure on rural roads in Tasmania, which is more than twice the amount required to be expended on rural roads during the previous 5 years. In addition, the State Government is free to make allocations from its own resources to local authorities for expenditure on roads. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>Under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act 1969 provision has been made for grants totalling $56.25 million to be paid to Tasmania over the five year period commencing 1 July 1969, an increase of50 per cent on the amount provided in the preceding five years. In 1969-70 a grant of $9.1 million will be paid to Tasmania which is $0.6 million or 7 per cent greater than the grant in 1968-69. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>An important aim of the new roads arrangements is to direct Commonwealth assistance for roads more specifically than in the past to the development of particular classes of roads. Thus, the new Act provides for specific allocations of the 'principal' grant for urban arterial and subarterial roads, rural arterial roads, rural roads other than arterial roads and for planning and research. The amount allocated for urban roads in Tasmania over the five year period is $22.59 million or about 40 per cent of the total roads grants to that State. In 1969-70 the amount allocated for urban arterial and sub-arterial roads in Tasmania is $2.98 million or about 33 per cent of the State's total roads grants for the year. </para>
          <para>In addition to the principal grant there is payable to Tasmania a 'supplementary grant' which is available for expenditure on any class of road. Over the five year period, the amount of this grant will be $2.25 million, of which $1 million is payable in 1969-70. </para>
          <para>I am not aware that the specific Commonwealth allocation for urban roads has caused any imbalance in the pattern of the State's roads expenditure. In this regard, it is relevant that the State undertakes a considerable amount of roads expenditure from its own resources. For example, in 1967-68 the State Government expended $6.76 million on roads from its own resources. </para>
          <para>I should mention, however, that the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act includes provisions to meet the situation where a State experiences serious difficulty in expending the Commonwealth gran! for a particular road class. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The Commonwealth has taken the view that, as local authorities are constituted and function under State laws, it should be the responsibility of the State Governments to determine to what extent the financial resources available to municipal and local authorities should be supplemented, and what form any such supplementary assistance should take. For this reason, it has been the general policy of successive Commonwealth Governments not to make subventions directly to or on behalf of local government authorities. However, the honourable Senator's request has been noted for consideration when the next aid roads grants arrangements are under examination. </para>

          <para>It is taken for granted that the question relates to jet aircraft operations since the night restrictions do not and never have applied to other types of aircraft. Accurate records are available only for 1969. To date the number of take offs and landings by jet aircraft at Sydney Airport between the hours of 11.00 p.m. and 6.00 a.m. are 97 and 105 respectively. It is believed that the 1969 figures would not be significantly different from earlier years (1965 onwards). In fact it is believed that the figures for the earlier years would have been higher than for 1969. While there have been increases in jet aircraft operations at Sydney Airport the night curfew which applies to these operations has been more rigidly applied in recent years especially in 1969. </para>

            <para>Can the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service recall the bitter strike which took place at Mt Isa and the arguments that were put up by Mt Isa Mines Ltd to avoid providing improved pay and working conditions to its employees which led up to the strike? Can the Minister supply the Senate with informal tion as to whether some consideration will be given to sharing some of the tremendous rise in profits of 158% above last year's figures with the men who made it possible - the employee who performs the arduous underground work? Is it a fact that dividends will be increased by 50%. Is this merely another example of how the average worker in Australia misses out on the benefits gained from the exploitation of his country's mineral wealth? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In reply I said that I well recalled the disastrous strike which was caused at Mt Isa some two years ago and its economic disadvantages. I was unable to inform the Senate on arrangements for profit sharing in the company and I undertook to obtain information on this at the earliest opportunity. The Acting Minister for Labour and National Service has now advised me that preliminary press announcements of a rise in profits by Mt Isa Mines Limited during the financial year ending 30th June 1969 have been made; but he also notes that the final figures for the year will not be known until the company's full report and accounts are issued on 27th October. </para>
          <para>He is net aware of any new proposals regarding profit sharing at Mt Isa, but points out that a form of profit sharing has been in operation there for some years. Following very harmonious and successful negotiations late last year between the company and the unions, a consent variation to the award was made whereby increases ranging from $1.50 to $3.50 per week were granted to classifications below tradesman level. A new agreement to operate for two years from 9th December 1968 was also negotiated late last year and he understands was ratified by unanimous decision at separate mass meetings of the Australian Workers' Union and of the craft unions. Details of the agreement have not been made public. In addition, the bonus payments of $16 per week and the prosperity bonus of $10 per week made under the previous agreement of December 1966 was continued. Subsequently, in March of this year, a further agreement was made between the company and four unions representing underground maintenance employees at the mines, whereby an incentive bonus scheme making provision for at least $10 per week for those employees was introduced. </para>

            <para>Is it true that a staff cadet at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, slashed his wrists in a suicide attempt on 1st September because of what is known as the bastardisation system in operation there? Is the cadet still in hospital in a severely depressed condition? </para>

            <para>The cadet did cut his wrists on 1st September. However, in the light of the medical and psychiatric evidence received in the course of the investigation into this case, the Commandant of the Royal Military College was satisfied that there was no attempt at suicide. The cadet himself attributed his action to his unhappiness with his academic progress and denied it had anything to do with the suggestion that senior classes were ill treating the junior class. </para>
            <para>The cadet concerned is still in hospital under observation. His condition is quite satisfactory. He is not in a depressed condition. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>There have been earlier enquiries on incidents concerning alleged ill treatment of cadets at the Royal Military College. As the College was founded in 1911 complete records are now probably not available and in any case the research involved would be considerable. However formal enquiries are known to have been conducted in 1956, 1952, 1935 and 1934. In regard to the remainder of the question, the research involved would extend back almost to Federation, if the relevant records could be located. However there have been some fairly recent instances such as the enquiry at the Apprentices School in 1967; the enquiry by a Committee appointed by the Minister for Defence into all practices and procedures at detention barracks arising from allegations concerning treatment of soldiers undergoing detention at the Military Corrective Establishment at Holsworthy, the enquiry into 2nd Recruit Training Battalion at Puckapunyal in 1969. </para>

        <para>The Postmaster-General has now furnished me with the following information in reply. </para>
        <para>In the statement which I made on 15th May, 1969, when I announced the Government's decision to extend television by means of low powered television stations to a further thirty-eight areas of the Commonwealth, I emphasised that it should not be concluded that other remote centres would not in due course be provided with service and that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board would continue its examination of ways and means by which service might be provided to the people resident in other remote areas. In this connection I have asked the Board to keep in mind the Thursday Island, Bamaga, and Weipa areas which the Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator has</inline> mentioned.  At  the same time, as I said in my statement, I should point out that there are difficult problems involved in the further extension of the services, which are not easy of solution; these problems are both  of  a technical and economic nature arising from the remote location of the areas remaining without service and their relatively sparse population in relation to the costs involved in the provision of service. In this connection it is pointed out that the approved extension to a further thirty-eight areas involves an expenditure of $5,000,000  to  achieve a population coverage of the order of 110,000. </para>

        </interjection>
        <para>When the investigation into the establishment of low power television stations in Western Queensland is conducted will the Minister ensure in the case of towns such as Longreach, which is surrounded by smaller towns, the station be  of  sufficient range to cover these outlying areas  or  alternatively the local authority be given every assistance if it desires to relay programmes to these communities. </para>
        <para>The Postmaster-General has now furnished me with the following information in reply. </para>
        <para>The honourable senator's question refers  to  the extension of television to a further thirtyeight areas of the Commonwealth in the seventh stage of television development as announced in my statement of 15th May, 1969. The extent  of  the coverage which will be achieved by these stations can only be determined after the necessary site surveys have been completed and I am not in a position at this stage to comment on the coverage which will be achieved by any particular station, however, as the stations will be low powered installations, it is not to be expected that their coverage will be very great. It is not expected, therefore, that the coverage area of the proposed station at Longreach would include any centres at a substantial distance from Longreach. </para>
        <para>However, I emphasised when making my statement of 15th May, 1969, that it should not be concluded that remote centres other than those in  the seventh stage would not in due course be provided with service and that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board would continue its examination of ways and means by which service might be provided to the people resident in other remote areas. At the same time, as I said in my statement, I should point out that there are difficult problems involved in the further extension of the services, which are not easy of solution; these problems are both of a technical and economic nature arising from the remote location of the areas remaining without service and their relatively sparse population in relation to the costs involved in the provision of service. In this connection it is pointed out that the approved extension to a further thirty-eight areas involves an expenditure of $5,000,000 to achieve a population coverage of the order of 1&gt;10,000. Any proposals from local government and authorities for provision of television service will, of course, be fully considered. </para>

            <para>- Yes. We will make what progress we can on the Estimates and then I will bring on the matter of the papers relating to the purchase of the Fill aircraft, which is listed on the notice paper. We anticipate that about half an hour will be occupied in discussion of that issue. We plan then to resume the debate on the Estimates. Perhaps I should indicate now that in a few minutes I will move to vary the sitting times for today. We hope to conclude our discussion of appropriation and supply matters by 2.30 p.m., leaving us the time from 2.30 to 4 p.m. to deal with the National Health Bill. I will be bringing on a formal matter in relation to Standing Orders which I suggest will be no more than a formality. We will then have a little time until 4.30 p.m. to deal with those matters appropriately dealt with before a parliamentary recess. The programme I have outlined will require a high degree of mutual co-operation. I know that on all sides there will be a ready response to keep to the planned schedule. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I wish to speak to Division  352 -  Real Estate Management. I wish to indicate to the Senate that last Friday, on behalf of the Senate Select Committee on the Canberra Abattoir, I tabled in this chamber a report setting out the findings of that Committee as a result of a quite exhaustive inquiry into the affairs of the Canberra Abattoir. It was stated in the report that the works had been sold, to an organisation which did not want to buy them, for the sum of  $100,000  when they were valued at  $500,000.  In other words, it was a sale at an undervalue of  $400,000  on the basis of a payment of  $10,000  down, no further repayments for the next  5  years except the servicing of interest, and then for a period of  15  years thereafter the servicing of the interest and the repayment of the capital sum. In the opinion of the Committee this represents - in fact it is stated in the report - a serious neglect of the public interest. There was absolutely no reason at all why those works should have been sold in the first place and there was certainly no justification whatsoever for allowing the property of the people to be sold for  $100,000  when it was worth  $500,000. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The position is that there are two substantial cottages on the site conservatively valued at  $20,000,  there are  83  acres of land upon which the works are sited which must surely, seeing the area borders on the town of Queanbeyan and is in the area of the Australian Capital Territory, be worth  $80,000  at least. Therefore, in view of those two items alone, which make up the sale price of  $100,000,  the works were absolutely given away. The Government recouped nothing at all for these substantial works and the installations in them. Why was this done? The Senate has a right to know the answer to this question. Was it on the basis of the poor performance of the abattoir? Certainly not. The administration of the works was such that the medical officer said that the hygiene standard had for some time past been at zero, and when further questioned at a subsequent hearing of the Committee he said that the standard was as low as it could be. I refer to those matters because, consequential upon the attitude adopted by sections of departments of government which had the responsibility for running this works, a determination was made as to the value of the building. Apparently if a government or an instrumentality managing a business of this kind wants to sell it, the course to take is to let it run down until it gets to such a state that somebody in the community can find the necessary funds to purchase it at the reduced figure. That seems to be the implication of the Government's action here. </para>
          <para>The report contains a statement to the effect that the wholesale operator, Red Hill Meat Supply Pty Ltd, did not want to buy the abattoir but believed it ought to have been retained by the Government and run as a public instrumentality. This point of view was confirmed by witnesses from the Queanbeyan section of the Graziers Association of New South Wales, by witnesses representing the  64  retail butcher outlets in the area and by other witnesses who appeared before the Committee. The same view was held by at least one of the adjoining shire councils. The general view seems to be that the works should have been run as a public enterprise in the interests of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
          <para>The Committee found no justification for the sale of this asset, even though it attempted to find some justification for the Government's action. The report indicates that for 6 out of the last 8 years the abattoir made a profit - leaving aside the factor of notional interest. It made a profit when the practices carried on there were the least desirable practices that could be carried on in a works of this kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Towns,</inline> an expert on abattoirs, who runs the Goulburn abattoir for the Goulburn City Council, referred to the inadequacies of the practices there, including the solo system. Bearing in mind that reports had been received from responsible authorities on the way to operate a works of this kind, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Towns</inline> believed that the way that this abattoir was operated was the least desirable way and the least desirable method of those that could have been employed there. During the early part of its deliberations, the Committee visited the works and found it to be in a dirty, filthy, run down condition. The place looked decrepit. It was run down. </para>
          <para>The report contains a statement that it will cost $200 to replace broken windows. Probably some of the windows were broken in order to let the light in because the rest were so filthy that daylight could not filter into the works. The practice there has been alluded to in the evidence. If any honourable senator wants to query what I say, he can read the evidence himself. The practices there were highly undesirable and most unhygienic. How this situation could have been tolerated by the Department of Health in the Australian national capital, one would not know. </para>
          <para>Subsequent to the initiation of this inquiry, I inquired of witnesses whether the Department of Health would permit works in this condition to be operated by any other operator under the system employed there and under the conditions employed there. I was advised by the Department of Health authorities that they would close such works. I agree with them. I have never seen such dismal working conditions and I have never seen a more decrepit looking situation in all my life. The crude and inefficient administrative and managerial practices carried on there were no credit to anybody. </para>
          <para>I believe that this Government is deserving of the most severe censure possible. I believe its actions are symptomatic of the arrogance, contempt and cynicism of a government which has been in power too long and which refuses anybody the right to inquire into what it is doing. It does not matter how much the public interest is neglected, the Government is king, master and overrider. It does not matter what anybody else says, what it says will go. The report, which has been tabled in the Senate, is couched in the most restrained terms. The Committee could very well have been much more critical than it was of the practices there, but believed it had a duty to be restrained particularly as the Government did not provide members for that Committee. We were restrained to a very large degree in the kind of language we used to describe the dirty, filthy, rundown conditions at that place at the time. I must say to the credit of the organisation which purchased the abattoir that within one weekend it had spent $700 to clean the place up. The sort of thing that had happened was that the blood line which carried blood from the slaughter floor to the cookers had become blocked. The cookers were falling to pieces anyway and were in such a state that they could no longer be used. Although the blood line had blocked, no-one had sufficient initiative to do anything about it, but within a few days of the new operator taking over he managed to poke a hole in the line or in some other way to clear the blockage in the pipe to restore it to working order again. </para>
          <para>When we went to the by-products section of the abattoir, the section where the cooking of the meat meal and blood and bone was carried out and other activities of this kind were going on, we found that of the three cookers two had fallen apart. In the words of the operator, it was not unusual to see bolts coming out from the cookers and going into other valuable plant further along the line and in the process doing further damage. Honourable senators can imagine the dismal looking place that we found and the broken down decrepit atmosphere of the abattoir at the time that our Committee commenced its activity. </para>
          <para>The Committee attempted to find out the justification for the sale of Commonwealth property. I suppose it would be reasonable to expect that if the Committee were inquiring into the reasons for the strong desire to sell these works some reasons must have been advanced. The position is that in 1957-58 about $360,000 was spent on improving the chillers at the abattoir in the certain expectation that the capacity of the slaughter floor would be built up at the earliest possible date to match the capacity of the chillers and to provide in the Canberra community a works which would serve the requirements of the community for years in the future. </para>
          <para>The report sets out for the Senate the fact that funds were voted for the purpose of improving the capacity of the slaughter floor. Those funds were provided for a number of years, but after about 4 years the Government decided that the funds would be no longer provided. That in itself inhibited any chance that the abattoir had to perform its function, to show its ability to make a profit and to serve the needs of the Canberra community. This was an instance of one leg being taken from under the establishment and of its then being unable to stand on the remaining leg. </para>
          <para>The situation now is that the new operator has a bonanza which he had not expected. He did not want to buy the abattoir but was compelled to buy it, as the report states, because it was the only way in which he could preserve his interests. I want the Minister to tell the Committee what justification there was for the sale of this asset worth $500,000, which was the estimate of the Commonwealth valuer. The book value of the works stood at about $445,000, the Commonwealth valuer's figure was $500,000, and the valuation placed on the works by Consolidated Abattoirs Services, an organisation which it was not denied was capable of making a reasoned and sound judgment and assessment of the value of the works, was $575,000. The new operator over the next 2 years, I believe it is, has to spend $225,000 to bring the works up to an acceptable health standard. I repeat those words because we are dealing with an undertaking which was run by the Commonwealth Department of Health: The new operator has to spend $225,000 to bring the works up to an acceptable health standard. But when he does that, taking into account that he has spent or will be required to spend $100,000 and a further $225,000 for these works, he will have an asset worth not $325,000 but $800,000. Is there any justification whatever for a Government entering into a contract of this kind when the Australian Capital Territory </para>
          <para class="block">Advisory Council, a responsible organisation in this community, for many years had made an offer which would have returned $259,000 to the Government over the period of the lease? It would have expended about $300,000 on these works and at the end of the period of lease - in fact, right throughout the life of the works - the works would still have remained the property of the Government and therefore of the people of the area. I believe that this whole matter indicates a very, very serious and culpable neglect on the part of the Government of a valuable asset. The Government was not prepared to come clean with the Committee and reveal all of the facts of the situation and I suggest that it has something to hide. If honourable senators can draw any other conclusion I invite them to say so. I should like to know why any responsible authority, be it a government or otherwise, should sell for $100,000 an asset worth half a million dollars when it did not have to, against the resistance of the person who bought the works. In all of the circumstances I believe that this represents a serious neglect of the public interest and I therefore move: </para>

            <para>At the end of motion add: but the Senate is of opinion that the Government has been responsible for maladministration in connection with the operation of the Canberra Abattoir and in selling that public asset at a gross undervalue.' </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- The honourable senator raises a question in relation to the selling of the Canberra Abattoir. He states that we as a government should run it and should have kept it rather than allow private enterprise to run it. This abattoir was established in 1943 and at that time it cost about $80,000. It was built to provide  sufficient meat for about 23,000 people. The price of meat from the abattoir to butchers became so high in the early 1950s that the Commonwealth Government decided that in 1958 it would allow free meat to come into the Australian Capital Territory for sale by butchers. When it allowed the meat to come into the ACT this reduced the price of meat to the housewife and this, of course, was the aim of the Government. The prices of meat to the housewife having been reduced the production or output from the abattoir was reduced because very few were buying from it. We then got to a stage where a lot of money had to be found for repairs. We had to decide whether we would go on with this project as a government run enterprise or sell it and allow private enterprise to run it. As we are a private enterprise government we decided we would call tenders for it. We did so and it was sold to Red Hill Meat Supply Pty Ltd for a price of $100,000. I understand that now that the company has spent money on the abattoir it is running successfully. We as a Commonwealth are pleased to be out of it, because we do not want to control the abattoir in the ACT and we do not want to control abattoirs in other parts of the Commonwealth Territories. That is the reason why we decided to relinquish control of the Canberra Abattoir. </para>

            <para>- The opportunity has been taken, in this debate on the estimates for the Department of the Interior in these last hours of sitting, to make some comments on the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Canberra Abattoir. This occasion highlights a situation which, in these dying hours of the Twenty-sixth Parliament, must give grave concern to those who constitute the Parliament. I refer to a trend which is becoming increasingly manifest and which has been most evident during the last 3 years; that is, the tendency for the Executive Government to bypass the Parliament of Australia. This is highlighted in the fact that when a Senate Select Committee had been established to look into this vexed question the Executive took action to dispose of the abattoir before the Select Committee could bring in its report. This is a very serious situation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This was the second manifestation of the same kind during this Parliament. The other was the decision regarding the siting of the new parliament house. A brave effort was made to establish the opinion of the Parliament, whether in conjunction with the other House or in an assembly of all members. When a slight impasse arose, the Executive Government immediately stepped in and made its decision. That decision was contrary to the expressed will of the majority of the members of the Parliament. A further manifestation of this trend - one that is perhaps even more dangerous - has been the bypassing even of the Executive Government in some cases by means of individual statements and personalised government. </para>
          <para>Therefore, as the Senate has now embarked upon the constitution of select committees to look into particular aspects of government, as we have achieved a greater sophistication in our form of government which is evidenced in the electorate by the emergence of new parties which represent certain sections of the community and are represented in this place, as we' require closer examination of legislation and as we can expect that legislation coming into this place in the future may well be referred to select committees of the Senate, are we to face a situation in which the Parliament will constantly be laid aside by the Executive Government? </para>
          <para>These are trends in government which must cause grave concern. I do not think we should allow this Twenty-sixth Parliament to be dissolved without registering our concern. In the coming years the Parliament may have to look at the parliamentary procedures governing the passage of legislation through the Parliament and the Administration. This is a matter that may well come before the Parliament in some form or other. This tendency, which is of constant and increasing danger, may well come up for scrutiny in such an examination. Without going into the merits or demerits of the question of the disposal of the Canberra Abattoir by the Government, but looking at the implications of this action from the point of view of parliamentary control, we register our concern. We trust that this concern will continue to be reflected in the incoming Parliament and that steps will be taken at all times to ensure the supremacy of the Parliament of Australia over the Executive Government, which is subject to its jurisdiction and control. </para>

              <para>- I am obliged to the honourable senator who has seen fit to interject before I even commence my speech, because my statement that the Government has mishandled the purchase of the Fill aircraft is the understatement of the century. This is the most expensive of the Government's chickens coming home to roost. Back in 1963 on the eve of a Federal election the Government decided to take a punt and order the Fill which was then only on the drawing board. Six years later on the eve of another general election the same Government is still undecided whether it finally will accept the Fill aircraft, the price of which has escalated from an original $100m to approximately $300m not out. It is the view of the Opposition - indeed I cannot see how the statement can be contraverted - that the situation in which the Government found itself this week is the result of its own bungling. It had finally to come to grips with the matter and try to make a decision to deal with a desperately unhappy situation created, firstly, by its own political opportunism in making the original decision to buy the aircraft in unseemly and indecent haste, and secondly, by its indefensible ineptitude in entering into an open-ended contract and by its subsequent dealings in relation to the contract and the negotiations with the United States authorities. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The case which can be made against the Government over the whole of this issue is fully documented and has been made on a number of occasions inside this chamber and outside it. Everyone in the country knows that the Government has blundered with the Fill purchase. </para>

              <para>-  Everyone is dissatisfied, and according to a recent gallup poll 62% of the people of Australia favoured cancellation of the contract. Irrespective of whether that percentage is statistically accurate, it is obvious that the people are thoroughly fed up and disillusioned with the way in which the Government has handled this contract. It is the high water mark of irresponsibility. It took 2 or 3 days to make the decision. It was a political decision. Since that time, and as time has gone on, costs have escalated. Already we have paid $183m without getting a single aircraft. We are due to pay another Si 5m by the end of this month and another $9m or so by the end of the year, when we will have paid out virtually $200. </para>

              <para>- That is right. 1 meant to say $200m. In any case, I think everyone knows that when you talk about the Fill aircraft you talk in hundreds of millions of dollars, not hundreds of dollars. Everyone knows that the Government has not had a clue for a long time about what is happening. The Government itself must have had for several years a chill feeling in the pit of its collective stomach that the gamble it took in 1963 might not pay off. This week the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> has made another statement in which he again is hedging his bets. He is saying: 'We have now decided that we will take this aircraft subject to testing and to our being satisfied.' Another $1.5m for each aircraft has been added to the ceiling price of $5.95m each of the original contract. But what is an extra $1.5m for each one of these two dozen aircraft, when the Government has lost touch with reality? We have to relate the whole of the exercise to the purpose. The original purpose was to buy the Fill because of a potential confrontation with Indonesia. That was the basis upon which the aircraft were ordered. Now the Government is looking around to find and to justify a use. of a proper defence character, for these highly expensive aircraft - these breath-takingly expensive aircraft, as one of the respectable journals of public opinion in Australia has recently described them. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Frankly, it is very difficult to find such a use. A good deal of material suggests that there is a big doubt about the use to which this plane can be put. Assuming that the aircraft is accepted by the Government, this question arises: Has it a range adequate to meet its intended role? Obviously that is a critical point in relation to the aircraft's performance. My colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> has drawn attention to an article in the August 1969 edition of 'Armed Forces', a journal specifically published for the top echelon of military personnel in the United States of America. 'Armed Forces' has stated that a big query is raised by the experts about this particular aspect of performance. The Fill needs refuelling facilities. No provision has been made by the Royal Australian Airforce for in-flight refuelling facilities. </para>
          <para>I believe that the Government is not at all clear on where it will use the Fill or where it thinks it ought to be used in any given situation. At least we ought to be clear about its purpose. We are proceeding with the purchase of these very expensive machines. We are on the eve of an election in which the people of Australia will judge between the contending parties as to the level of responsibility exercised in the conduct of public affairs. The Opposition believes that the Government must be condemned for its mishandling. I put to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> that that is a mild word to employ. </para>

              <para>- I think it would be impossible for anyone but a person who has just returned from a trip to the moon and has not been in Australia for the last 5 or 6 years to vote against the amendment I have moved. I will make my speech short. I invite the Senate to join the Opposition in voting for the amendment. Back in 1963 everybody except the Australian Government knew that there were problems about the costing of these aircraft. I remind honourable senators of the several debates we have had on the subject. In November 1963 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gilpatric,</inline> then Assistant Secretary of Defence in the United States of America, was questioned by a special United States Senate investigating committee on the order by Australia for the purchase of the aircraft, then known as the TFX.

            <para>- The Government does not accept the amendment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> has moved. I suggest that most of what he has said has been dealt with before. The honourable senator talked about irresponsibility and mishandling. I think that the conduct of the Australian Government in relation to the acquisition of the FI 1 1 has proved the Government's responsibility. It has at all times seen to it that when Australia accepts the Fill it will have a capability to perform the things required of it. In that sense, contrary to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> says, the whole conduct of the Fill acquisition is a story of responsibility. The Government, with the best advice available to Australia, has acted with propriety. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> moved into the wider sweep of tactical situations and defence policy. It must become apparent that the Labor Party sees no merit in the acquisition of the Fill aircraft because it is contrary to Labor's defence policy which is based on a Fortress Australia concept. How a country of Australia's size and population could ever hope to survive in this modern world with a Fortress Australia policy is difficult to comprehend. Still, that is the basic defence policy of the Labor Party for a continent which, I think, has a coast line of about 12,000 miles, an area of 3 million square miles and a modest population of 12 million people. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Apparently the defence policy of the Labor Party is to sit back within Australia and hope and pray that we never have to do anything beyond the breakers, as it were. The fundamental basis of Australia's acquisition of the Fill aircraft is the capability to meet forces as far away from Australia as possible with the help of our allies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> talked about the capability of the Fill. I noted with interest an article in the 'Australian' on 24th September 1969 to the effect that the United States has decided to increase its FI 1 1 order. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> made the position abundantly clear in the statement that we are debating at the present time. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The United States Force fleet of Fill aircraft have now been flying for a total of more than 40,000 hours, including more than 25,000 hours in the operational command, and it now has an accident record better, for example, than the Super Sabre or the Phantom and better than any other F century series of aircraft. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The suggestion that there was a degree of insecurity in relation to the aircraft is not sustained by comparison with the experience of other military aircraft. It is interesting also to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> talked about the capacity of the aircraft to be refuelled in flight and so on. He suggested in his comment - his very brief comment, I acknowledge - that the aircraft would not have a defence capability because of problems associated with refuelling. </para>
          <para>The testimony given by the pilots who have flown the Fill in Vietnam, published in 'News of the World Report', pointed out the Fill's peculiar capacity to approach the target under the radar, in all kinds of weather, to drop its bombs with complete accuracy and to disappear from the scene before the enemy is even aware that it has been there. Because of its range it does not need tankers; because of its extraordinary weapons system capability it does not need electronic counter measures; because of its speed it does not need fighter cover. On the testimony of the pilots who have flown these aircraft in battle, two pilots and one Fill can do a job in bad weather, with complete accuracy and with safety, which could only be done half as well by 5 or 6 other aircraft. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fairhall,</inline> the Minister for Defence, said, this in itself must indicate a tremendous cost benefit advantage to the Fill. </para>
          <para>The Government does not acknowledge or accept the criticism inherent in the amendment. The whole history of the acquisition of the Fill aircraft is based on an Australian requirement to meet our recognised defence responsibilities. Throughout the history of this acquisition the Government has taken the view that it should accept the advice of its best technical experts. That advice has been that the Government should take the aircraft when it is satisfied that all requirements have been met. There is not any doubt that, in the near future, when the Fill comes to Australia it will be a fundamental support in relation to the defence of Australia. In my view, denigration of it is a failure to recognise its importance and a failure to recognise the importance of the defence of Australia away from Australia. </para>
          <para>It is true that the Government found it necessary to send to the United States of America some of our best technical experts. Some were employees of my own Department and indeed the head of the Department of Defence was included in the team which studied the possible problems that emerged in the initial stages in relation to the wing carry through box. As the Prime Minister made clear in his statement, there is a viable solution provided for that which will enable us very shortly to acquire these aircraft. </para>
          <para>Finally I say that, contrary to the argument about lack of responsibility, this Government has shown significant responsibility in making certain that we get the aircraft and that when we have it it will be the best and most sophisticated aircraft in the world and it will have outstanding and significant attributes for the ultimate defence of Australia. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable senator wants to be pedantic, I will change that statement to 'I believe'. I think I have quite a lot of support on this. Originally when we became interested in this aircraft there was supposed to be a possibility of its use, and the purchase of it was an urgent necessity. We rushed in and signed the contract to buy the aircraft without looking at the contractual arrangements. It was done on a government to government basis which excluded any contractual arrangement that could have been agreed to if it had been between the Department and the General Dynamics company. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The second thing that I want to say about this aircraft is that it is the most sophisticated aircraft in the world for carrying nuclear bombs, but the one that we are getting cannot carry nuclear bombs. This means that instead of getting a supersonic aircraft we will get a subsonic aircraft. No-one on the Government side of the chamber mentions this. The aircraft originally ordered was supersonic, but now we are to get a subsonic aircraft. Why do we not have a statement from the Minister concerning this matter? Surely that is one of the most important things in the purchase of this aircraft We order a supersonic aircraft for the delivery of nuclear weapons and we are to get a subsonic one which cannot deliver nuclear weapons. Because it will be carrying conventional bombs it will have a lower speed and the best distance that it will be able to achieve will probably be as far as Singapore. So we -are to have an aircraft with a very limited range. Where can we use it? Everyone believes that it is supposed to be for the Australian requirement, but that is not so. The members of the mission that went to America agreed to the purchase of this aircraft after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Townley,</inline> the Minister for Defence at that time, went over to America in a hurry because the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies, wanted it in a hurry. </para>

We all want to have a Rolls Royce if we can have one, but many of us have to drive Holdens. That is what happened in this case. Any man who flew the aircraft could see that it was the type of plane that he would love to have, just as I would love to drive a Rolls Royce. But can we afford it?

              <para>- We could. We could buy Phantoms today if we wanted them. About 2 years ago we were offered Phantoms, and even the British offered us aircraft, but the Government would not accept them because it was so tied up with American policy.

              <para>-  The honourable senator may say that the Government did not kill it, but I inform him that in my belief the Government did kill that project This was an aircraft that the British were planning and the prototype of which had already flown. Who is to say that it would not have been the most sophisticated plane that there was? Are they not using parts of that plane in the present American FI IIA? Because the project was killed, no one can tell how good the TSR2 would have been. One of the factors in the death of the TSR2 was that we refused to purchase them and purchased the American plane instead. Forgetting whether it was a suitable plane, forgetting that we could have bought Phantoms, and forgetting that the British offered us manned squadrons of bombers and that the Government would not accept them, the situation now is that we have the problem of still waiting for a plane that we think will fly and that we think will have no problems when it arrives here. The Government's attitude is: If any problems do occur, do not worry because the American people will supply further wings for the aircraft. But what happens to the plane when it crashes? Will the Americans supply a new plane if one crashes because of this wing carry-through box? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>What are we going to do with twenty-four planes? I ask the Government to tell us what we can do. What are Australia's requirements today for twenty-four planes which have a life of 15 years? Can any honourable member opposite envisage any war in the next 15 years or anyone coming to attack us? And if it did happen, what would we do? These aircraft are to be our defence. It is necessary to have sophisticated ground equipment as well as sophisticated aircraft and we do not have that. The Government is ashamed to tell us of the millions of dollars that it has tied up in the Air Force station at Amberley or of the millions of dollars that have been spent to keep that aerodrome open. The Government hides all of this. If it were honest it would get the Americans to buy back the spare parts because it will have plenty of spares as each plane crashes in this country. </para>

            <para>- -I wish to indicate that the Democratic Labor Party feels that the amendment to this motion is a reasonable one. It states that the matter was mishandled. We make no criticism of the aircraft. We believe that the investigations that have taken place in the last 12 months were justified because of some doubts that had arisen. The Government and its technical experts seem to be satisfied now that a situation has been reached where the aircraft will be a valuable part of the defence of this country. We have always been sympathetic to the attitude of the Government and to the risks that have to be run if we are to have an up to date defence structure. We have to buy a sophisticated item of defence equipment such as the F111 virtually from the drawing board rather than wait until it is a reality because if we waited we would always be behind the times. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Our criticism of the mishandling goes to the letting of the original contract which was made on an election eve. There has been plenty of evidence to show that Britain, which also committed itself to the purchase of the aircraft had a distinctly different and much more advantageous contract than we were able to get. We feel that that is where the original mishandling took place which involved us in the situation that we have faced recently. We hope that this aircraft will fulfil every expectation that arose from the original contract, although there is reason to doubt whether it can quite reach those specifications. It is in the interests of Australia's defence that the contract be proceeded with now if the aircraft can approach the performance set out in the original specifications, because Australia at the moment is so desperately in need of a reasonable forward defence programme, in which the F111 can play at least a reasonable part. </para>
          <para>For that reason we think that the Government's statement should be accepted but we do not see any reason to kill completely the justifiable criticism that has been expressed here previously. Indeed, the Government was forced by a vote of the Senate to put a paper before the Senate to give us the details of the letting of the original contract. In that paper we believe plenty of reasons can be found to justify criticism of the concept of the original contract and the rapidity with which it was entered into on the eve of an election. We believe there is justification for criticism of the contract, not necessarily of the aircraft. The contract was received on about a Friday and with a weekend intervening, it seems that it was signed on the following Tuesday. We think that a deal of this magnitude is just a little bigger than that indicates and requires far more mature consideration than could be given in such a short period. It is on that basis that the criticism of the Democratic Labor Party is levelled, not at this Government but at the Government that proceeded it which accepted the contract some 6 years ago. We hope that the F111 fulfils the expectations of the Government, because we feel that Australia today needs it. </para>

            <para>- The Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Anderson)</inline> will remember that yesterday I asked him a question concerning the agreement on the FI 1 1 aircraft. He suggested that I raise the matter in the Estimates debate. As I understand the position, the agreement that has been made is subject to a number of conditions. I want them to be cleared up. As one reads the statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> and the speech made by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairhall),</inline> one comes to certain conclusions. I would like to know whether I am correct in concluding that the aircraft will be accepted only if the present modified wing carry through box is proved or is successful under test. I take it that that is one of the conditions. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>But satisfying that condition does not really determine that the aircraft will be accepted. The Prime Minister has stated that arrangements have to be worked out in relation to a new modified wing carry through box, which is not yet designed and which will probably be available in 1972. There is a further arrangement that if any of the existing wing carry through boxes fail during the flight of the aircraft the United States Government will replace those boxes. </para>

              <para>- That is the point. What I am trying to find out is whether there are those three conditions. Are they practical conditions which mean that the aircraft is in a condition in which it might be acceptable for use in Australia? In relation to the point that has just been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull,</inline> has it been considered that, if the carry through box that is now under test fails in an aircraft, the failure may take place while the aircraft is in flight? As I see the matter, there are three basic questions. I believe that they should be cleared up and that it should be made clear to the Australian people whether in fact there is a practical acceptance of the aircraft at the present time. </para>

            <para>- I understand that we are dealing with the remaining estimates in globo. I wish to ask a number of brief questions in connection with the administration of the Department of Civil Aviation. I have alerted the appropriate Minister. With reference to the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> stated that tenders had been called for a number of retail shops. I wanted to know about the position of somebody who wanted to establish a florist shop. I was told that it was not contemplated. I want to know whether anyone who has a concession at the airport at the moment is entitled to change to a florist shop without ministerial approval. Does the Minister's letter of 28th August mean that if either an existing tenant or somebody else wants to establish a florist shop the matter will be reopened? </para>

          <para>The other matter to which I wish to refer is one on which I have alerted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> as Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service. On Sunday, 10th August, the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury)</inline> issued a Press statement in which he said that 44% of the young men called up for national service were rejected because of physical defects. He did not say what those physical defects were. I believe that as the percentage is so high we should be told what they are. I am thinking not so much of the Army call-up as of the future of a man of 20 years of age who has something wrong with him and has 40 years or so ahead of him. Surely we can be given some idea of whether the Government intends to leave these young men as they are or to rehabilitate them if they have foot ailments, deafness or defects of that nature. </para>

However, should space become available at a later date the provision of a florist shop will be taken into consideration. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is not difficult to see the reason why there is a backlog of about 44,000 applications in the Patent Office and it is <inline font-style="italic">4i</inline> years behind. The fact is that the salaries that these people are receiving are completely out of relationship to what they could receive outside the Public Service or in any other government organisation such as the Weapons Research Establishment or the Postmaster-General's Department. </para>
          <para>I point out to the Minister and the Committee that the salary of an A grade examiner in the Patent Office, who is comparable with a senior technical officer grade 3, is $800 a year behind the salary of that officer. In other words, if an A grade examiner went to the Weapons Research Establishment or the Postmaster-General's Department and did the same job and used the same qualifications he would receive $800 a year more. Going down the scale, the salary of a B grade examiner in the Patent Office, who is comparable with a senior technical officer grade 1, is $740 a year behind the salary of that officer. </para>
          <para>The situation has become worse since 1961. After the engineers No. 1 case a base grade engineer received $4,400 a year at the top of his salary range. He could be compared with a clerk of a particular grade receiving $4,660 a year at the top of his salary range. At the present time the base grade engineer, who is now called an engineer class 1, receives $5,118 a year at the top of his range. He has received an increase of 16.3% in that period, but the clerk with whom I am making the comparison, without promotion to a higher grade, now has a maximum salary of $6,997 a year. He has received an increase totalling about 50%, compared with the increase of 16.3% received by the engineer class 1. In 1961 the base grade engineer had a status equivalent to that of a clerk class 7 - that is the current classification. However, an engineer class 1 now receives a salary below the bottom of the salary range of a clerk class 4. He now has a status between that of a clerk class 3 and that of a clerk class 4. </para>
          <para>In 1962, after the engineers No. 2 case an engineer class 3 received a salary of $6,382 a year at the top of his salary range. The equivalent grade clerk at the top of the range received $6,542 per annum. Today the same engineer at the top of his range receives $7,177 per annum having had a salary increase totalling 12.4% as against the clerk, without promotion, who has received an increase totalling 44.7%. </para>
          <para>I do not think it is hard to find the reason why the Patents Office is behind with its work. It is because of this gross difference between the salaries that these people working in the Patents Office receive and those paid to people working in other areas where the same qualifications are required, as is the case in the examples that I have mentioned of the senior technical officer, grade A, who is down $800 a year and the senior technical officer, grade B, who is down $740 a year. I wonder whether the Minister can explain to me the reasons why there is this big discrepancy and why a person holding these qualifications in the Patents Office can move into other departments and immediately receive an increase of $800 per annum and $740 per annum in the respective cases that I have mentioned? </para>

          <para>As I understand the position, there have been up to 4 years of abortive salary negotiations and what the officers consider to be excessive delays in arbitration. The stumbling block apparently is the rigid attitude of the Public Service Board in relation to the fixation particularly of professional salaries in these areas. I am told that in an unprecedented protest last April 80% of the CSIRO professional staff signed a petition to the Minister for Education and Science drawing attention to their extreme dissatisfaction with the present position. I think it is very bad when a situation like this can lead to a deterioration in relationships. I would like the Minister, if he would, to give me some indication of what the present position is. </para>

            <para>- I wish to deal with the Department of Primary Industry. In the 'Australian' of 19th September, a statement by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> appears in which the Minister sets out to try to recover a position that the Government had allowed to deteriorate in the wheat farming areas following a lot of discontent expressed by those engaged in the wheat industry. A few days ago, I asked the Minister who presently represents the Minister for Primary Industry in this place, the Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Scott),</inline> whether the Australian Wheat Board operated a capital account that would allow it to carry out works. I have not received an answer to that question, but I do know that the Australian Wheat Board does not operate a capital account. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Therefore, it is necessary to try to find out just where the Wheat Board will obtain the $10m of urgent money to construct additional storages at the present time for 60 million bushels. The ultimate objective is to provide additional storages for 170 million bushels. This work will cost $28.3m. At this time, the additional storages will amount to $10m. One of the greatest confidence tricks that has ever been put over people is being put over about the use of this money. I want the Minister to explain it to me. The only way that the Australian Wheat Board can get money is out of an overdraft that has been made to it by the Reserve Bank for the first advance payment on wheat. The farmer is paid $1.10 per bushel as the first advance guaranteed payment less freight and service charges. So, that amount of money is not drawn until such time as the wheat is shifted and services money drawn. The freight money would not be drawn until such time as the Commonwealth or State railways moved the wheat into places for shipment. </para>
          <para>It seems to me that what will happen is that the Australian Wheat Board will use this retained freight money for the purpose of constructing additional storage. I notice that, in this statement, the Minister refers to available storages in Australia at the present time for 610 million bushels. This is quite a meaningless statement for the Minister to make because where is the 600 million bushels? Will the storage space serve the purpose for which it is required? It is known that in Western Australia there will probably be a shortfall in the amount allowed to that State under the quota system this year. Storage will be available in that State but a shortage of storage space will occur in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. If there is storage space for an extra 140 million bushels in Western </para>
          <para class="block">Australia it will be useless to those three States or to talk in globo about the amount of storage space available without having regard to where the wheat will be produced. This just does not mean anything to people who like to make an examination of the matters. </para>
          <para>The vital question on which I wish the Minister to give me some information is this: Where is the $10m to come from? If the Australian Wheat Board uses the retained freight funds out of the first advance of SI. 10 per bushel because last year's crop is still in the country silos, what happens in regard to freight payments when the time comes for the delivery of the wheat? Will wheat farmers be expected to pay an additional freight rate? Will the Government appropriate moneys to reimburse the Australian Wheat Board? Will a further advance be made by the Reserve Bank to cover the amount that has been used in advance? </para>
          <para>Further, there is storage space for approximately 200 million bushels in Western Australia. At the present time in that storage space is a carryover of approximately 60 million bushels. It is expected this year that the wheat crop will amount to approximately 80 million bushels with about 20 million bushels of coarse grains. This will leave Western Australia at the end of this year with storage space for approximately 400 million bushels. Surplus storage space is available in Western Australia. None of the additional storage to be provided by the $10m will be constructed in Western Australia. I want a comment from the Minister on this point: If Western Australia, which we all hope will have a normal year next year, produces the amount of wheat allowed to it under the quota system, will further moneys be taken out of the retained freight money, if there is any left, or will further advances be made to accommodate the normal Western Australian wheat crop which under the quota system is set at 85 million bushels, 5.2 million bushels more than it should have received under the 5-year averaging system? </para>
          <para>It is now expected that the quota will fall by another 40% next year so that not only the farmers but also the State will be deprived of the income from the 5.2 million bushels that the farmers were cheated out of last year and which now will be com pounded to about 8 million bushels. I think that the Government has to look at this position very closely. </para>
          <para>It is obvious that this year the greatest bulk of Western Australia's production of wheat will be left in the silos. Whatever wheat is sold will be directed mainly from the silos in eastern Australia, firstly, because of the over-production in that area, and secondly, because Western Australian wheat stores very much better than does eastern Australian wheat due to the nature of the climate. Western Australian wheat is produced in a much drier condition and it stores and handles a lot better than does wheat grown in the more moist areas of eastern Australia. So it can be confidently expected that little wheat will be shipped from Western Australia this year. This is another reason why there will be heavy pressures on storage in Western Australia if there is a normal crop next year. </para>
          <para>Taking the position overall, the statement by the Minister for Primary Industry must be criticised because he has tried to tell the people that there is available storage space for 610 million bushels without giving, siding by siding or even State by State, any breakdown of the storage space which will be required. What does the Government propose to do about Western Australia in this context next year? Where will the Australian Wheat Board obtain the money necessary this year and next year? </para>

            <para>- I should like to direct two questions to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> who represents the Attorney-General. Firstly, when may we expect a new consolidation of Commonwealth statutes? From memory the statutes were last consolidated in 1950, and I think before that in about 1938. It has been almost 20 years since the last consolidation, and that makes reference to the annual volumes very difficult. I know that this is associated with another problem which is the second matter that I wish to place before the Minister, namely, the plight of the Parliamentary Draftsman. It is not easy to attract recruits to the staff of the Parliamentary Draftsman whose work, which is always highly responsible, is becoming increasingly burdensome and increasingly complex. If the work of consolidation of the statutes were presented to the existing staff it would place an impossible burden on them. I am not aware whether the work of consolidation is passed out to private contractors or whether it is done by the Parliamentary Draftsman's own staff. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the past few days we have had a situation here in which, as is usual at the end of the sessional period, there has been a tremendous congestion of legislation. That may be due to many causes - I appreciate that some of them are unavoidable - but it must impose an extremely heavy burden on the staff. Therefore the staff must be adequate to handle such congestion. Legislation which is very hastily drafted and belatedly comes before the Parliament and denies the opportunity for scrutiny in that detail which I think this chamber should devote to such scrutiny is the conjunction of two very dangerous situations. 1 always have the greatest admiration for the staff of the Parliamentary Draftsman. It must show initiative, a high degree of skill and a great command of the many aspects of law - common law, statute law, equity and other fields of commercial law. I do not know the system of recruitment but I often wonder whether a better system could not be discovered to attract recruits to this branch of legal administration. Perhaps the Department could embark upon the institution of fellowships by which young men could go to university under a contract to spend so many years on the staff of the Parliamentary Draftsman on graduation. In that way we could build up our own highly skilled and adequate staff of draftsmen. If something is not done, the Parliament and the community will suffer by the absence of well-drafted statutes. That does not occur at present due substantially to the dedication and devotion of the staff we have, but I often wonder whether the burden is just too much for them to bear and whether they can bear it for an unduly lengthy period. </para>

We have at hand details in relation to only two categories. The first indicates that 38,403 examinees were determined as medically unfit but at this stage we have no information as to the various specific reasons. I will see whether the Department has analysed the number and has the information available at head office. If it has, I will advise the honourable senator.

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline>referred to the comparative salaries of patent examiners. The Patent Office comes within the responsibility of the Attorney-General, whom I represent in this place, but the fixation of salaries and the general inter-relation of salaries as between departments is the responsibility of the Public Service Board. Insofar as the material relates solely to comparisons between the salaries of engineers and the salaries of clerks, it is a matter specifically for the Public Service Board. The Board, however, has equated the salary of examiners of patents, class 1, and the salary of engineers, class 1, and the maximum salary of both is $4,890. Class 1 is the base grade of the professional structure. </para>
          <para>The existing salaries of examiners of patents were reviewed by the Public Service Arbitrator who confirmed the equity of engineers' salaries fixed by the Board. The Department has recommended to the Public Service Board that the salaries of professional examiners of patents be raised because of difficulties of recruitment and retention. The Board has not made a decision on the departmental recommendation, no doubt because a claim for higher salaries for professional engineers is presently being heard by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It will be remembered that I gave the Senate information on the progress of that case within the past few weeks. That case will be the determinant for comparable salary scales in comparable fields. </para>
          <para>Insofar as technical examiners of patents are concerned, that is, those in grades A and B, the Department has recommended reclassification based on a comparison of the salaries of other positions in the technical grades which recently received increases. The Public Service Board has not made a decision on the departmental recommendation, no doubt because there is a nexus between the salaries of examiners in the technical grades and the salaries of professional examiners. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> also referred to scientists employed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cohen</inline> that I gave particular details of that position in answer to a question asked within the last few days. In that answer I told him that the question of CSIRO scientists is wrapped up in or interrelated with the engineers' case. The case to which he refers is at present before the Public Service Arbitrator. It has been under consideration for some time and is part heard. A decision is expected by December next </para>

            <para>The Government has reviewed continuously all aspects of its domestic airline policy and a separate inquiry into the operation of the airlines agreement would serve no useful purpose. As a result of the Government's policy the two major domestic airlines one of which is Trans-Australia Airlines have continued to provide airline services of world class standards. On a number of occasions other countries have expressed keen interest in the Australian air transport system because of its leading position in the world aviation scene. </para>

              <para>- Often of 4 hours. The Minister has been misinformed by whoever gave him that reply. Today it has been announced that TAA warns that rising costs may force up fares. But the Commonwealth Government received last year from aviation fuel tax $1.4m; air navigation charges $3.1m; payroll tax $629,000; and sales tax $330,000. Last year TAA paid altogether $9. 3m into Consolidated Revenue from a capital investment of $15m. This places a great imposition on the travelling public who are asked on the one hand to pay more, while on the other hand a poorer service is provided. </para>

          <para>Trans-Australia Airlines states in its report that it has 53 aircraft, and a Boeing 727 and 6 DC9 aircraft are on order. It has seventeen aircraft retired from service awaiting disposal. This fellow who provided the Minister with the guff I have quoted, instead of giving wrong information should get out and sell those seventeen retired aircraft and pay the proceeds into Consolidated Revenue. Then TAA might be able to replace the Friendships. In my view the Friendships provide second class accommodation for passengers. Too many people are crowded into them in order to make the flights economical. There is not enough room for the comfort of passengers. People like myself who do a lot of flying do not want to be cramped up in accommodation below tourist standard as is provided on the Friendships. The sooner they are phased out and converted to freighters the better it will be for TAA, at least. </para>
          <para>Last year TAA earned a great profit despite a crippling strike by transport workers. But TAA had to bear the brunt of the industrial dispute. Its opponents carried on business as usual during the strike. Why was TAA placed in that position? I admit that it was a good thing that one airline was able to operate during the strike, but it shows an unfair bias against TAA. Generally speaking the travelling public is becoming very disappointed with the operation of the airlines agreement. I have referred before to TAA's great safety record, which is shared by all our airlines. While the schedules are important to TAA, the safety of passengers is of the utmost importance. I appreciate that the safety of passengers is vital, but the running of the schedules appears to be a disgrace to people who travel a lot on Australian airlines. </para>
          <para>A great deal of time is wasted and frustration is felt when planes run late. Appointments in other capital cities are made but cannot be kept. It has become part of our way of life to organise our appointments in accordance with flight schedules. We keep appointments in one place today, finish one job, and then board a plane to keep an appointment in another State. I guarantee that every public servant present today to advise Ministers has felt the same sort of frustration as that to which I have referred. I believe the Minister has a responsibility not to supply me with guff that states that everything in the garden is rosy, lt is not good enough. The Department should have another look at the working of the airlines agreement. </para>

I wish to comment on some of the statements he made. He claimed that the travelling public is losing faith in the Government's dual domestic airline policy because of inconvenience resulting from holdups in the schedules. The number of domestic passengers using the airlines in Australia last year was over 5 million. The two major airlines have decided to phase out aircraft other than jets or turbo-jets by 1971. This involves the need to sell those planes. No doubt they are being offered for sale throughout the world today, but probably a second-hand aircraft is hard to sell. I do not know. I think that the dual airline policy operating in Australia provides one of the best and safest services of any country in the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> should be proud of the service provided by Ansett-ANA and TAA to the travelling public. </para>

The matter with which I am concerned is not directly related to that subject but rather to the effect of pine plantations upon water availability. The report states: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Land use can have an important effect on recharge. The (Division found that the evaporation from pine forests in south-eastern South Australia during winter and spring equalled the rainfall so that there was no recharge of the underground water beneath the forests. lt also found that the evaporation from the forests was about twice that from neighbouring grassland. This result probably applies to most catchments other than high mountain catchments. It seems likely, therefore, that stream flow from forested catchments is less than from catchments in grassland or crop land. </para>

          <para class="block">My interest in this problem arising from our practice of introducing exotic pines into the Australian economy was first aroused when farmers in the south-west of Western Australia reported that wells which had never gone dry in living memory had gone dry soon after considerable pine plantations were established there. In the Perth region, particularly north Perth, pine plantations which are very successful in terms of growth are to be seen but these pines are planted in an area where there is a considerable recharge of the potentially valuable underground water supply. </para>

              <para>- From rainfall on to an aquifer at reasonable depth. If the findings in relation to South Australia have general application I think we should devote considerably more than the allocated amount of $256,245 to land research under which this work was done because we could be creating a major problem if we continue the practice of planting pines in water catchment areas. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution I raised this question with officers of the National Capital Development Commission who were concerned with pine plantations in the Canberra area but I failed to get any satisfactory reply to my query about their effect upon water yield in the area. But from the evidence now available it seems that we need to direct considerable attention to this problem which could be one of some national concern if we proliferate pine plantations without regard to their effect on the water catchments and water yields in the areas in which they are established. I hope that more attention will be directed to this problem, particularly as the report is to a certain extent delayed, I tried to check on the matter in the Library but I found that it was not sub-headed and that there was no reference directly to it. I had some difficulty in finding just where it was published. I hope my expression of concern will assist in having some further work done on this urgent problem. </para>

            <para>- My query is about the appropriation of $2,600,000 for railway standardisation works in South Australia under Division 891. To what extent is any part of this money now being used for consulting work going on at the present time as agreed between the South Australian and Commonwealth Governments? Or is it to be used exclusively for works projects? As honourable senators know, in 1 949 the South Australian and Commonwealth Governments entered into an agreement to standardise the railway gauge in South Australia, including that of some of the northern lines. The gauge of the southern lines was converted as part of an arrangement that when the 4 feet 8i inches gauge became fairly general in that State would convert its 5 feet 3 inches lines to standard gauge. Last year the South Australian Government wrote to the Commonwealth Government in respect of the standardisation proposals which were then necessary because of the early completion of the east-west system. In 1964 the Playford Government wrote to the Commonwealth Government and said that the Commonwealth ought to consider standardising the South Australian railway system as had been agreed. In all those years no satisfaction was gained. No allocations could be obtained from the Commonwealth Government to do the necessary work in South Australia to link Adelaide with the standardised system. So we have the situation where the east-west line will be open next year but where South Australia is still battling with the basis of the consultant's opinion which will not be available until 1970. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The South Australian Government put it to the Commonwealth in June 1968 that grants should be made to standardise the link. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> wrote back on 23rd October 1968 and said that he would offer a feasibility study which would be restricted to a link between Adelaide and the interstate railway but that he was not prepared to expand the study to include the basic agreement to standardise the South Australian railway system which had been agreed to in 1949. There was a great deal of resistance from the South Australian Government and the Labor Opposition of the time, but finally after a lot of frustrating discussion with the Commonwealth the South Australian Government decided to advise the Commonwealth in November that it agreed to these terms. This, as honourable senators can imagine, was greatly criticised. </para>
          <para>The consultant's report will not be available until early next year and when the report is available there will be a wrangle as to whether the work which has been recommended ought to be started and restricted only to the link between Adelaide and the standardised system or as to whether the Commonwealth should comply with the contract it made in 1949 to standardise the whole system. If the South Australian Government accepts this position it simply means that it will have break of gauge problems at every junction on northern country lines and the Government and the railways will suffer heavy expenditure to install bogie systems. That is the issue, and it is an important one. I would like the Minister to tell me why the Commonwealth </para>
          <para class="block">Government cannot decide the matter at this stage instead of waiting for a consultant's report. It is appreciated that there are already rumours that before the election some grants will be made to Victoria and New South Wales for railway work, and I think it is very important for the Minister to state at this time whether consideration might be given to an immediate grant to make the connecting link that we are talking about; otherwise South Australia will be shut off from this east-west standardised system, probably for another 12 months or 2 years. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator asked two questions in relation to Division 891. Provision is made under this vote for financial assistance to the State of South Australia, within the terms of the Railway Standardisation (South Australia) Agreement Act, for the purpose of converting the permanent way between Port Pirie and Cockburn to standard gauge. This project extends over a distance of approximately 215 miles, and track laying is virtually complete. Expenditure by the Commonwealth on this project to 30th June 1969 was $34,283,237 and as the project is now nearing completion the estimated expenditure for 1969-70 is down to $2. 6m. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In relation to the expenditure under the Railway Agreement (Western Australia) Act, provision is made under this vote for financial assistance by the Commonwealth to the State of Western Australia within the terms of the Act for the purpose of construction within the State of a new standard gauge railway linking Kalgoorlie, Fremantle and Kwinana, a distance of approximately 428 route miles; together with associated narrow gauge railway works from East Northam to Midland with necessary deviations of the Northern and Great Southern railways in the vicinity of Northam, a mileage approximating 74; and the acquisition of rolling stock. The estimated total cost of these projects is $160m. Of this, $110m will be provided directly by the Commonwealth, partly by a grant and partly by repayable loans. Main line track laying is complete and the line is in use for most traffic between Kalgoorlie and Perth. Since June 1969 interstate passenger trains have been operating direct between Port Pirie and Perth. The estimate each year is based on a programme of works put forward by the State and $7.9m is the amount that the State has indicated that it will require from the Commonwealth during 1969-70. These are the two matters which the honourable senator mentioned. </para>

            <para>- 1 wish to raise a matter in relation to the Department of Primary Industry, Division 410 - Administrative. That must take into account the administration of soldier settlements. Tasmania is an old State in regard to soldier settlements. I have heard a lot of contention about the scheme among departmental officers in Tasmania. Who fixes the option of purchase price with respect to soldier settlements? Is it a State responsibility or a Commonwealth responsibility? Who fixes it and on what basis is it fixed? There has been a lot of  contention about this among soldier settlers. They have expressed dissatisfaction. I want to clear up the doubt.

            <para>- I want to direct my remarks to the Department of Shipping and Transport and specifically to page 224, paragraph 218 of the Auditor-General's report. Before doing so I want to raise a matter which has been well canvassed in this place during the past 12 months by senators on both sides of the <inline font-style="italic">chamber. 1 refer to</inline> the role of the Federal Government in bringing north Queensland and Tasmania into the overseas container service. I will not dwell on this because the subject has been well canvassed. Suffice to say that the Commonwealth abrogated its responsibility in this matter. It said to the overseas container companies: 'This is your responsibility. Let us know what you intend to do about it.' This is why the Commonwealth asked the overseas container companies to submit a report to this Government before the Budget session so that the Government would have some idea of what was going on. I think this should be placed on record. I have no doubt that before the middle of next year Tasmania and north Queensland will be brought into the service, but it will not be because of any efforts on the part of this Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Specifically on the question of the revenue item in paragaph 218, to which I referred earlier, for the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission the estimated revenue is over $2m. Some weeks ago the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> made a statement, I think in Queensland, to the effect that the dividend return to the Department could not be maintained on the present freight rates being charged and that therefore there would be an increase in the overall freight rates on the Australian coast. This would include the Tasmanian service. Like many others, in recent months I have been concerned about and suspicious of the fact that the Tasmanian searoad service has been a money spinner for the Australian National Line. I asked a question of the Minister seeking information about it and details of the net profit being earned by the Australian National Line in its Tasmanian searoad service. I have been refused this information. The reason, ostensibly, according to the Minister's reply, is this: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission operates as a commercial undertaking actively competing with other lines. It is not therefore the practice to disclose to the public and its competitors such details as those sought of the results of its individual operations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I suggest that the real reason why we have not been given this information is that there would be a public outcry in Tasmania if the facts were made known. I could understand the position if, from one of the mainland States, the Australian National Line were earning an undue proportion of its profits. The exporters and the importers in that State could use an alternative means of transport. But in Tasmania, as is well known, we are over a barrel in regard to transport problems and we depend on shipping services. It is an imposition on and an insult to the people of Tasmania that this increase should apply to us as well. Of course there is the other reason and that is that the Federal Government hangs on precariously to two seats in southern Tasmania. I believe this is another reason why this information has not been made public at this stage. I assure honourable senators that these facts regarding the nondisclosure will be made public before 25th October. </para>

            <para>- My question is in relation to the estimates of the Department of Labour and National Service, Division 370 - Administrative. I rise only to express my disappointment that the Government again this year has failed to appoint anyone from Queensland as a conciliator or a commissioner on the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. To my way of thinking, it is disgraceful that no representative from Queensland has ever been appointed as a conciliator or a commissioner. Queensland has long been an industrial State and it is useless the Minister saying, as he has in the past, that the Government does not look at States but looks at the ability of the people to do the job. I say, without fear of contradiction, that many people in Queensland would be capable of carrying out the job of conciliator or of commissioner. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>At present one member of the Public Service, whom I shall not name, is a Deputy Industrial Registrar in Queensland and is carrying out the job of conciliator and commissioner, but he is not given the status of those positions nor is he receiving the remuneration payable to either position. I believe that the situation is scandalous and that it is almost an insult to the State of Queensland that no-one from that State has ever been appointed as a commissioner or conciliator. It must be obvious to the Minister and to the Department that there are approximately 100 federal awards which have operation in either the metropolitan area of Brisbane or in other places throughout the State. I suggest that if the Govermment believes that that is not sufficient justification for someone from that State to be appointed to police those awards and to attend to the difficulties that confront the respective industries then the Government does not know ils work in the industrial sphere. </para>

            <para>- It will be remembered that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> asked me a question about parliamentary draftsmen. I remind him and the Committee that early this year the Parliamentary Draftsman undertook a personal inquiry overseas into the possibility of recruiting additional staff.  His  inquiries established conclusively that there was a world-wide shortage of qualified draftsmen in common law countries and that none were available. Fellowships are not considered to be the answer. Only a small proportion of graduates in law prove to have those special qualities which enable them to give an interest to and to develop a skill in draftsmanship. This matter is of ever-continuing concern to the Department, but I think the Committee would generally acknowledge that during this session we have experienced less retardation of our legislative programme on the basis of drafting difficulties than hitherto. </para>

              <para>asked about a consolidation of Commonwealth statutes. He pointed out that the last consolidation was in the early 1950s. The situation, as I understand it, is that one item of $95,000 appears in the Estimates for all publications but that no special provision has been made for a consolidation of the statutes. However, I understand that consideration has been given to the possibility of dispensing with periodic consolidations and keeping up a revolving edition of statutes by a leaflet system. Honourable senators might have noticed in recent times that annual volumes of statutes have been reprinted on a continuing basis. Whether that will be finally adopted in substitution for a consolidation has not yet been determined. </para>

When matters of this kind  have  been raised the Minister has made it clear that he is concerned with appointing the most suitable available person,  and State boundaries  have little relevance. But as a matter of interest, five of the six most recently appointed commissioners were employed at the time of their appointment in organisations with Australia-wide activities. It could not be said that they were attached to any one particular State. The fact that amongst the existing ranks of the Commission there is nobody appointed from a particular State cannot be taken to mean that people in that State or in other States were not considered for appointment or were not offered appointment. </para>

              <para>asked a question concerning the administration of the Department of Labour and National Service in relation to standards of safety of plant. Legislative responsibility in relation to industrial safety, including that of plant operators, lies wholly within the States, except so far as Commonwealth responsibility for its employees and for conditions within the territories is concerned. Nevertheless the Government can and does exercise a considerable influence on the overall matter of minimising accidents at work. Much of this influence is exercised by virtue of the Department of Labour and National Service's membership on the Departments of Labour Advisory Committee, which comprises the permanent heads of the Commonwealth and State Departments of Labour. Probably about half of the business at each of the annual meetings of the Committee is devoted to industrial safety. Over the years the many papers based on research brought forward by the Department of Labour and National Service to the Committee have, I believe, had a considerable influence on thinking and policies in the States. Conversely, the Committee's discussions, supplemented by continuing contacts with the State departments, are an important determinant of the research programme conducted by that Department. The Department co-operates actively with the Australian Standards Association in the development of national safety standards. The honourable senator will be aware that the Government has for some time been giving each year a grant of $10,000 to the National Safety Council of Australia to help it in developing its activities at federal level. At the international level the Department is also closely in contact with the work of the International Labour Organisation in the field of occupational health and safety. </para>

The scheme operates under State legislation and the relevant statutes provide that the State Minister will fix the auction price. However, the State has a responsibility under the conditions attached to the grant made by the Commonwealth to agree with the Commonwealth on auction prices. The basis of the auction price is the cost or market value, whichever is the lower, at the time when the leasehold valuation was made. The cost of work done subsequent to the time of leasehold valuation can be added to the auction price but in practice this is only taken in at value. </para>

It is intended that a residual service with conventional vessels will continue to be provided to those outports which are not at this stage to be serviced by container vessels. The residual service will cover the refrigerated cargoes that are so important to Tasmania. There is an obligation to provide an adequate and sufficient service for these ports and at this stage an inquiry is being undertaken by the shippers association and the shippers conference into ways and means by which these outports can be brought within the service at the standardised rate. It is my hope that this will result in a satisfactory solution and that the ports of Tasmania will be given the same opportunities to ship their goods by this improved form of transport as they have enjoyed in the past. </para>

            <para>-  I refer to Division 130 which provides for salaries and payments in the nature of salary in the Attorney-General's Department. The first matter to which I wish to refer arises from a question asked earlier by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> to which the Minister has already given a reply. It concerns problems connected with the Parliamentary Draftsman's office. I believe that these problems and the difficulties under which not only members of that office but also those who are dependent on the output from that office have to labour make this a matter that should be of prime concern to the Parliament and the Public Service generally. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The particular difficulties that arise from the Parliamentary Draftsman's office have been referred to recently in a number of committee reports. At the end of 1968 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts submitted a report in which it stressed the delays and difficulties confronting various departments in the promulgation of regulations. It stressed what it found on investigation to be difficulties in recruitment and difficulties in attracting people to the work of the Parliamentary Draftsman's office in  a  variety of ways. In 1968 the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee, in its twenty-fifth report, stressed that delays in the promulgation of regulations were creating and over a number of years had been creating a serious problem because retrospective payments going back for 4 or 5 years in some cases were involved in regulations. Let me read one passage from that report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The second area of delay occurs in the drafting of the necessary statutory instruments by the Parliamentary Drafting Section of the Attorney-General's Department. Whilst the Committee accepts the explanations given over the last 8 years and realises that there are difficulties in recruiting staff with sufficient training and experience for this specialised work, it must be stressed that this situation cannot be allowed to go on indefinitely. </para>
            <para>The Committee was pleased to note that investigations have recently been carried out over- seas, and that plans are at present being formulated in an attempt to overcome the lengthy period of delay which occurs in the drafting section. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was 12 months ago. I know that since that time the Parliamentary Draftsman has been overseas. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has informed the Senate, he has confirmed that there is a world-wide shortage of parliamentary draftsmen. Although the Minister also says that this is a matter of ever increasing concern, it appears to me that we are reaching a stage at which a number of very real problems have arisen and are mounting in their complexity and consequence. Some radical solution will have to be undertaken. </para>
          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> said and as the Minister has conceded, it is not only a question of delay in preparing legislation for this Parliament, although the Minister indicated that there had been fewer problems in thai regard in the current session. There are a number of other fields. There certainly is a need for the consolidation of statutes. It is 20 years since the last consolidation of the Commonwealth statutes. The procedure that is being adopted in some States is to have periodical consolidations of individual statutes made available. I know that that matter has been under consideration for a number of years. One would hope thai some activity could be achieved in that field. </para>
          <para>Then there is the consolidation of particular regulations. Last year I asked a question about the Public Service Regulations, which were last consolidated in 1962. By the end of last year there had been ninetytwo separate amendments and they had not been brought into another consolidated set of Public Service Regulations. The average of 15 or 16 Public Service regulations each year has been maintained in the 12 months since then. Many people in the Public Service are dependent in many ways on what the Public Service Act says and what the Regulations say as to their entitlements. I know that people who want to find out what their entitlements are cannot obtain a set of the Regulations. I believe that that is a matter that should be remedied. </para>
          <para>I appreciate that one of the very real problems is that the draftsmen are not available to do the job. We can also look at the need to have regulations brought down speedily. That is a matter to which the </para>
          <para class="block">Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee has referred. Another field is the whole question of law reform in the Australian Capital Territory. This is dependent for its development upon draftsmen being present, ready and available to undertake what is necessarily the drafting work of bringing together existing ordinances and relevant law from New South Wales and advising on a proper and up to date code for the Australian Capital Territory. Here again it is in the field of drafting that the real problems must lie. </para>
          <para>This is merely a statement of the problems. I have stressed earlier that in my opinion the question of salaries is one of the vital factors, and linked with salaries is the prestige of the office. Lawyers outside the Public Service in these days can receive remuneration that is attractive. In those circumstances they will not be induced to come into the Public Service, where the rewards are not high and the prestige is not high, lt is very difficult for those who are interested in raising the standard of the Parliamentary Draftsman's office to obtain any satisfaction from the Public Service Board or the Public Service Arbitrator because essentially the way in which the Board and the Arbitrator look al problems is to do some industrial justice; whereas what is really required is the raising of the office, and that ought to be a matter of concern basically for the Parliament. </para>
          <para>Whether one solution would be to take the Parliamentary Draftsman's office away from the Attorney-General's Department and make it a separate department or put it under the Parliament so that it would be a section over which the Parliament would have control, wilh the Attorney-General's Department being able to make use of it - undoubtedly that Department would make the major use of it - is a matter for investigation. It appears to me that this is a matter which should be of more concern than I suggest, with all respect to the Minister, has been expressed year in and year out in saying that it is a matter of ever-increasing concern. 1 hope that in the next Parliament this matter will be seized by members of all parties on a non-partisan basis. It is a problem of mounting complexity. 1 believe that what is done at the moment by the draftsmen in the Public Service and by the Parliamentary Draftsman himself reflects a remarkably high degree of service and dedication to work which is far beyond what should be required of people in the Public Service. They perform their work tremendously well. Notwithstanding that, they cannot do everything that has to be done. Wilh so many things not being done, the problems will so mount that we will have a crisis on our hands and will not be able to cope with it. I would like the Minister to make some comments on what is being done in this field in order to remedy the situation. </para>

            <para>- I. wish to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who represents the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury),</inline> to look into certain matters. That may take some time. Firstly, I refer to the appropriation for payments for the services of State officers and agents under Division 370. It has been reduced from $95,100 to $75,000. I would like lo know why it has been reduced and to what extent agents are still used. I refer now to the appropriation of $460,000 for financial assistance in respect of apprenticeship training under the same division. Does that amount include money provided under the recognised subsidy system by employers? Could the Minister supply me with information on that item on an Australia-wide basis? 1 also refer to the appropriation of $15,000 for technical training of ex-servicemen. 1 would like to know whether that amount is appropriated for the training of national servicemen as well as other members of the Services. Could the Minister supply me with details of that item? I refer now to the appropriation for the Flight Crew Officers Industrial Tribunal. The Tribunal was set up 2 or 3 years ago as a result of a pilots' strike. This year the appropriation has been reduced to 37,000. What is the reason for that reduction? 1 have two general questions that 1 would like the Minister to consider. One relates to the administration of the National Service Act under Division 755 and the re-establishment provisions - particularly section 9 - of the relevant Act. In South Australia in the last 12 months we have had two cases of young people being dismissed from their employment, in connection with national service. In one case in Whyalla a boy who had just recently completed his time as an apprentice was called up for national service, and he was dismissed. He could not get another job in e area because the employer who dismissed him has a fairly strong influence in the area. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Two inquiries were held. The Department itself held an inquiry. A request from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Birrell</inline> and myself was directed to the Minister for Labour and National Service, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bury.</inline> The Department as a result of its investigation of that request, decided to hold  a  second inquiry. 1 received advice that no action would be taken to prosecute the employer concerned. </para>
          <para>The second case is a recent one. In June, I wrote to the Director of the Department in South Australia in relation to the dismissal of a casual employee. The reply was that no substance was to bc found in the case. In respect of the last case, I make the point that it took 3 months for advice to reach me that an investigation had been carried out.  I  am not complaining that the Department did not do its job. 1 ask the Minister whether he can tell me what sort of special machinery the Department has set up to cope with the situation? Is it a case where separate sections of the Department work separately? On a matter like this within the Department, for example, does the section that deals with arbitration check the relevant awards and then pass the matter across to the section that handles national servicemen or to other sections such as the one which deals with prosecution? It seems to me that there ought to be some special liaison in the Department or a group committee comprising representatives of the sections of the Department to act in respect of investigations and to recommend speedy action rather than have this long process of wailing. </para>

          <para>My last question deals with automation. The Minister announced recently that a special section of his Department deals with the question of automation. Some special information has been put out on this subject. I ask the Minister whether at this stage it has been possible to establish criteria for procedures in relation to redundancy, reemployment and retraining and whether these criteria have been recommended to employers Australia-wide through the various States? I conclude on this point. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Archer,</inline> the Commonwealth Statistician, recently said that Australia was fortunate that the introduction of computers had coincided with the rapid expansion of the economy. It seems to me that these basic or foundation principles ought to be established and that, where necessary, they ought to be placed in industrial codes. </para>

            <para>- Referring to the questions asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> concerning the Attorney-General's Department, particularly the Parliamentary Draftsman's Branch, J am grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> for keeping attention directed to this matter. The Committee will realise that a specific inquiry was undertaken by the Parliamentary Draftsman in an overseas examination of the situation. That inquiry did not produce any solution. There are and have been also some matters of a personal nature within the Department at high level that have made it difficult to proceed with the energies that this situation calls for this year. These difficulties will be resolved at an early date. I do not wish, if I may, to be pressed upon that matter any further.  I  would wish the honourable senator to know that the figure provided for the establishment of the Parliamentary Draftsman's Branch is about 40 positions. As 1 read the Budget papers, referring to Division 139 I see that the estimate for staff this year is 35 and last year was 34, although I am instructed that the professional staff has increased by a net figure of only 2 during that period. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to the Public Service Regulations, I inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> that they are included in a special volume issued by the Public Service Board. A copy is available for reference by any public servant within a department. I realise that that is not what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> seeks. He seeks that these Regulations should be available to anybody who is concerned to become a public servant, who wishes to be advised of regulations governing public servants or is concerned as a matter of public interest to know the terms and conditions upon which public servants are employed. I am fully alive to and myself have criticised the delay in making freely available to the public printed authentic expression of the laws of this country. But 1 trust that the Committee will take the indication that has been given in my preliminary remarks that concentrated attention will be placed specifically upon this problem, if not in December, early in the New Year. </para>
          <para>With regard to law reform lo which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> also referred, I wish him to know that staff dealing with matters of law reform has been strengthened over recent years. New positions provided are one position of First Assistant Secretary and two positions of Senior Assistant Secretary, plus subordinate staff. Matters dealt with over the past 2 years exceed those of previous years and further improvement is expected when all the new positions are operating on a settled down basis. </para>
          <para>On the subject of criminal law, two senior officers have been detached from normal duties to concentrate on reform. 1 think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> would like me to remind the Committee that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bowen)</inline> laid down the draft of a code completely codifying the criminal law for consideration by members of this Committee and others only this year. That code was a product of very intensive work much of which was contributed by the Australian Law Council. But it was under the guidance at all times and was performed with the assistance of the Attorney-General's Department. I would submit the view that that one contribution alone is a very notable contribution in the field of law reform for the work of 1 year. 1 will defer at this stage replies to the questions that were posed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> and which were rather detailed until I have an opportunity to reply at a later stage. </para>

Perhaps the Minister might arrange to have incorporated in Hansard at a later stage the replies that will be forthcoming to the questions raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> 1 wish to respond to a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> When I first spoke on this matter, I said that the answer was to be found in the statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton).</inline> If one analyses very carefully the statement made by him, one will find that the statement by the Prime Minister indicated quite clearly that, provided tests are satisfactory and give an assured life for service in the Royal Australian Air Force until the new box is fitted in 1972 at no cost to us, then we will take delivery of the aircraft. The recent mission indicated to the Government that it had every confidence on information given to it in the United States of America that these tests should be satisfactory. If for some reason tests shortfall in giving us the complete endurance we require to 1972, the matter will be examined in the light of the results. Again, there is no reason to assume that this would mean we would still not take delivery, particularly in the light of the assurance we now have that the United States Air Force will provide, at no cost to us, modified present-type boxes to the RAAF to enable it to operate completely safely until such time as the new design box has been manufactured and proved for introduction into both the United States Air Force and the RAAF. </para>

            <para>-  I take this opportunity to ventilate in this Parliament two matters exercising the minds of the citizens of Canberra. The first is the prolonged uncertainty about the proclamation of the Mount Kelly region as a national park. On a previous occasion when I raised this subject I was assured that there was not much likelihood that the land would be used for other purposes, but in the meantime a study has been taken of multiple land use in the Canberra region. The result of that study showed the need for an ironclad defence of this land against the depredations of mining interests. I say that deliberately because of the dilemma of the Commonwealth and State governments over the Great Barrier Reef through attempts to get the best of both worlds. I emphasise the need for the Commonwealth at all times to state clearly that the land is to be used as a national park with appropriate wilderness areas, so that if mineral deposits are found or suspected it can stand firm and resist the approaches. This will avoid a situation as has arisen in the States which have tried to get the best of both worlds and have finished up with the worst. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The second matter I wish to raise is equally important, and relates to the agitation of the Australian Capital Territory National Parks Association. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Stephen</inline> Boyden is the instigator of a move to establish a biological centre on the western slopes of Black Mountain. He believes that there should be a region provided with better access to Australian fauna. I am not ignoring what is being done at Tidbinbilla. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lindsay,</inline> the Mayor of New York, has explained a concept of pocket handkerchief parkland areas. I pay full tribute to the decisions taken by the National Capital Development Commission, particularly when the results it achieves are compared with the shocking situations that exist in most areas around our State capital cities. On behalf of the electors of CanberraI make the plea that surely in the area of Black Mountain the suggestion of a biological centre can be implemented. Any action taken to reserve land there in the next  3  years will probably be the best we can do. Sometimes developers and other people beat the big drum and claim it is virtually the end of the world if they are not able to make a quick quid. The supporters of park lands quite often do not have the finance to support their ideas by propaganda. </para>
          <para>I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> that we have had vague assurances. I direct his attention to the Canberra 'Courier' of 11th September. It points out that surveys indicate it is necessary to have greater husbanding of land for recreational purposes. I have always believed that Canberra's planning has been far superior to that of the States, but Canberra should not rest on its laurels. The sooner we get two smart decisions the better, the first of which is needed for the Mount Kelly region. I have in mind particularly the Nursery Creek area. Honourable senators engaging in a get fit campaign should hike there and spend a pleasant day. I pay a tribute, as I did last year, to the officers in the Department of the Interior who have plans for the area. </para>
          <para>I emphasise that time is running out. If a rich mineral discovery is made there will be all the squeals in the world about a change in policy if action is not taken until then. The second decision needed is in regard to a biological centre on Black Mountain. This position should be looked at speedily so that the planning for Black Mountain is not devoted only to roads. </para>

              <para>- During the course of taking note of the paper two resolutions were carried by division. Then when we came to report to the Senate they were incorporated in the report from the Chair.  1  moved that the Committee lake note of the paper and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> moved two resolutions which had previously been carried by division at the Committee stage. I quite obviously said no to the second and third resolutions because we had voted against them at the Committee stage. lt transpired that there was a misunderstanding in relation to a senator who was led to believe that he was paired, lt is quite clear that there was a misunderstanding. If we do not now vote again on the resolutions <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> will have his option to raise the matter again and we could go through the whole exercise on the Appropriation Bills. There would be a division and the will of the Senate would bc expressed. </para>

          <para>I suppose every honourable senator realises that it is rather difficult for me, having won a division, to have to vote again on the two resolutions, in view of the fact that they are critical of the Government.

I think morally I should seek a re-vote on resolutions Nos 2 and 3 and I ask for leave to do so. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- J  do not rise to  oppose this  Bill. The Government  knows  that  we  are placed in  a  dilemma. We cannot oppose the Bill because it confers benefits on some people. But the Government again stands condemned not only for the unseemly haste associated with the proceedings of this week but because of its approach to the problem of health. In bringing down this Bill it might appear that the Government has acted graciously and decently. This is a Bill to amend the National Health Act. The Government has not limited us to specific details as it has in the past but it has limited us by virtue of the nature of this week's proceedings and in the time available to us. Consequently we are not at liberty to utilise the maximum amount of time to portray the position of our present unsatisfactory and inefficient health service. The people are accorded a patchwork health service and each time a defect develops another patch is added. It is like a housewife calling in a plumber to repair a leak in a pipe; the plumber repairs the pipe, which is rusted, and finally after he has put about 100 patches on it he has to replace it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Is it not about time that the Government had a decent look at the health services of Australia? The deficiencies have been pointed out often enough. Ever since I arrived here I have pointed them out and have asked for an inquiry almost every year and, on occasions, I have asked for the appointment of a royal commission. Nothing was done until last year when the Government appointed the so called Nimmo Committee and the Senate appointed a select committee. Honourable senators know from the findings of those two committees how ineffective this particular approach to the health problem of the nation is. 1 think the Nimmo Committee made forty-two recommendations. The Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs has made a greater number, because it had authority to investigate on a wider basis. </para>
          <para>There are three provisions in this Bill - one to make benefits available to persons on an income of $39 a week or less, the second to make benefits available to the unemployed and the third to make benefits available to migrants for 2 months after they arrive in Australia. But these are only stop gap alterations. How repeatedly do we come forward and talk about improved amenities and facilities in the field of education? I know how desirable and necessary education is if we are to enjoy society to the fullest. An uneducated person can work but a sick person cannot. The Government did not seek to improve the scheme which it inaugurated some 17 years ago until there was a public outcry against it because of its ineffectiveness and its failure to provide the full facilities necessary for optimum health. Consequently we should have a full investigation and the incoming government, whether it be Labor or anti-Labor, should do something about this. </para>
          <para>We on this side of the House are partly to blame because we are now taking to the public a so-called alternative health scheme. It is not an alternative health scheme at all; it is the same old ineffective, inefficient system being financed on a different basis - a compulsory basis through taxation. Whether or not it is argued that it will cost more, it will still be an ineffective scheme. It will not provide the maximum number of measures necessary to obtain an optimum of health in the community. It is desirable that full health, medical, hospital and associated services should be available to the people. This year over $ 1,200m will be spent on health, hospital and associated services. Surely there must bc a more effective way of mobilising this tremendous sum of money. This is the money provided by the Federal and State governments and the people themselves. After all, in the ultimate it is the people themselves who provide the lot. Surely this tremendous sum can be mobilised in a more effective way to provide a more efficient overall health scheme. But nothing is being done about it. </para>
          <para>The Government has done nothing. All it has done over the last 12 months has been to patch up various defects that it has seen in its present inefficient service. I appeal to the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> and the Government, if they are returned, to do something about it. It is questionable whether they will be returned. This is a matter for the people, but judging by the way the newspapers are reporting at this time it may not be as easy for them as it was last time. When one realises the deficiencies pointed out in the Select Committee's findings and when one realises that the Nimmo Committee, limited as it was to inquiring into the present unsatisfactory so called voluntary health insurance scheme, made forty-two recommendations it is appalling to think that after 6 months the </para>
          <para class="block">Government has only acted on one. I agree that investigation of these recommendations takes time, that finding a solution takes time and that possibly finding the money is a problem; but it should not have taken this long. The Minister has at no time signified that any of the other recommendations will be considered or introduced to rectify the anomalies that exist. Surely this is the responsibility of a central government. We do hear people, particularly the health funds, quarrelling about the cost of central administration. Central administration does not seem to be defective in the case of mining concerns or merchandising firms. The policy of such concerns is determined by a central office. Even the sales targets in outlying areas are determined by offices in Sydney or Melbourne, and they do not seem to find that this is a costly way of doing business. More and more we see one enterprise taking over another 1.000 miles away and then determining the policy of that organisation. If we have an efficient man at the head determined in his own way to bring about that which is most effective and most economic, why should that be more costly than having a scheme of the nature we now have which does not completely meet the needs of the people? </para>
          <para>What I am concerned about is that people should have facilities provided for them so that they may attain during life the optimum of health. In this way they become greater economic assets in the community and can make a contribution to their own economic welfare and the economic welfare of the nation. Surely it is not too much to ask the Government to have an inquiry with a view to establishing an effective and all embracing health service. Much commendation is being heaped upon Scotton and Deeble. I am not denying their industry in the economic field, but frankly they did not set out to find an alternative health scheme. All they did was an economic exercise and found an alternative basis of financing the unsatisfactory scheme at present in existence. </para>
          <para>This present unsatisfactory scheme has so many deficiencies that time would not permit me to detail them. In past sessions various speakers have outlined some of the defects. Tens of thousands of people can speak of the defects that they have experienced with the schemes. They are in the schemes. Over one-tenth of our population is not covered by any scheme. Over one million arc not covered by any scheme, bc it a repatriation, voluntary, pensioner or any other type of scheme. Some may elect, through their own affluent circumstances, not to bc in a scheme. Many cannot afford to be in schemes. No inquiry has been made and no systematic endeavour has been attempted to find out the reason why these people are not covered. A large number of people have not available to them, the health services so necessary to maintain a condition of wellbeing. Consequently we cannot do other than condemn the actions of governments over successive years in not facing up to their legitimate responsibility to provide an effective service. The Minister should make representations lo the Minister she represents. </para>
          <para>A person goes into hospital. On his discharge he gets a hospital bill. That is the basic charge. The voluntary insurance covers a greater or a lesser proportion of that bill. In the case of medical services, it is usually a lesser proportion. Most of the other services rendered are not covered. The associated services, mostly those embraced by the ancillary services that are so necessary to the wellbeing of people, are not covered at all. These services have to be provided. They have to be paid for. In many cases people, through economic necessity, have to deny themselves of these not only desirable measures but also these absolutely essential measures for their physical and mental wellbeing. No attempt is made to cover hospital or similar charges. </para>
          <para>The Government cannot arrive at an equitable distribution of the burden between the Commonwealth and the States, lt introduced a hotch potch arrangement and said that it would give £2 for every £1 the States paid for buildings. The Commonwealth said that the maintenance of the buildings was the responsibility of the States. The Government, knows the state in which many of these hospitals are. At present there is a so called enlightened outlook towards mental diseases. Throughout Australia, as with many other countries, the position is nothing less than a disgrace. I am prepared to admit that Australia is not alone in that regard. It is so difficult to improve the conditions of hospitals. We have before us now the report of the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs. You, </para>
          <para class="block">Madam Acting  Deputy President,  had the honour to be  Chairman  of that Committee. A number of distinguished senators served on it. We have not time to debate the report. I think the incoming government should study carefully the report and should facilitate debate on it. I hope that, irrespective of the worthwhile suggestions made by the majority on that Committee, the Government neglects those and accepts that part of the report which suggests that there should be an all-embracing health scheme financed in accordance with the economic capacity of the people to pay. Only by that means can we get an effective and an efficient service that will improve the wellbeing of the people, to which the people are entitled, and will make a substantial contribution to the economic welfare of the nation. This is the responsibility of the Government of the  day. lt is no good the Government using arguments about the constitutional difficulties between the States and the Federal Government. They should be concerned about this particularly important condition and position. Surely they should be reasonable enough to arrive at some measure of compromise which would provide the maximum benefits to all and which will make a real contribution to the wellbeing of the nation. Professor Griffiths, Professor of Hospital Administration at the University of New South Wales, has said that in New South Wales alone $ 1 ,000m is required to rehabilitate the existing hospitals and to provide adequate hospital services for the people of New South Wales. Simply dealing with the problem on a mathematical basis, the Government must realise the tremendous amount required throughout Australia. I do not suppose the position in New South Wales is any better or any worse than the position in the other States. An overall approach to the problem is called for. 1 think little less than a royal commission, with experts in the purlieu I infields, is required. The Royal Commission in Canada sat continuously for 4 years and had 167 research workers engaged on projects. That is what the Canadian Federal Government thought of the tremendous size of this problem. </para>
          <para>In Australia we are lagging far behind. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page introduced a scheme which he thought would please the doctors and which he thought would be pushed onto the people. It has been pushed on to them more and more. As its apparent weaknesses have become real weaknesses, successive Federal governments have made minor alterations, picking up one patch here and putting it over there, shifting another patch to another place and picking up what they thought were deficiencies. They have not adopted an overall approach to the problem. I suggest that the Government investigate the medical and hospital needs of the people, not forgetting the associated services which mean so much to so many people who are the victims of unfortunate circumstances. There is no provision for people who require wheelchairs, crutches, calipers or anything like that. Some hospitals help to provide these. Voluntary agencies have been culled upon. I have been called upon to assist people to get a wheelchair or an artificial leg. Many of us have met people in similar unfortunate and sad circumstances and they have had to help such people, lt should not be the responsibility of individuals lo provide these aids, except through a central form of control and through a taxation measure, lt is no use saying that the provision of these aids will not cost money; it will cost a lot of money. Today the people are providing over SI, 200m. With the increasing nature of and complexity of medical care and with increasing costs, this amount must increase. The people must face up lo increased taxation. In return they will get a benefit of: a reasonable character and a reasonable and efficient service will be provided to the people. As human beings, they are entitled to that. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McMANUS</inline>(Victoria) [2.521 - Because this Parliament is in its last 2 hours prior to the election there is not the time to debate fully a measure such as this. Therefore my remarks will be extremely brief. The Democratic Labor Party supports the Bill because it proposes to offer remedies for the disabilities suffered in regard to the national health benefits by two sections of our community - one, the underprivileged section; and the other, migrants who are new to the country. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dittmer</inline> pointed out, these are small matters even though they are acceptable to those concerned. As yet we have no substitute for or no offer of the comprehensive national health or insurance scheme which, in my view mid in the view of my Party, is the only effective remedy for the problems with which we are faced today in the national health arena. A foreword to a booklet on the guide to national health benefits, issued by the Department of Health some time ago, claimed that Australia's national health scheme has been developed as a joint exercise in private and public responsibility. Essentially it is a voluntary service in which individual responsibility is balanced with Government protection to cover the great majority of the population against major medical, hospital and pharmaceutical costs. </para>
          <para>For a period the health scheme functioned reasonably well, but problems arose with the increases in costs associated with health. At certain stages the Government attempted to assist by increasing its contributions. In many cases the public assisted by transferring to higher and higher tables, but a danger point finally was reached so that a growing number of people were starting to think and say that the Government was not doing enough. The result was that many people were unable to contribute to the tables which they would have needed to contribute to provide adequately for their own health problems. As a result we had the inquiry which has just been held and which has presented an interesting report. There have been other interesting reports. I hope the Government will study those reports, from which I hope will come a much better system for providing for the health needs of the community. I would like to see some system whereby dental expenses are covered. Quite a number of other possible benefits will occur to the minds of honourable senators. I. know that members of the public and people associated with our universities and hospitals have devoted their attention also to inquiring into these matters. A number of these people have put forward proposals which they believed would be of benefit to the community. We have all been studying those proposals and we shall continue to study them. I know that the question of national health will be much discussed during the coming election. I hope that from the discussions and the vote will come a scheme that is suitable to the needs of our people. </para>
          <para>In the view of my Party, dealing with this matter on a piecemeal basis will never be satisfactory. I. conclude by repeating the policy of my Party which was put to the people by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> at the last election. The present Democratic Labor Party policy is to provide a comprehensive national health insurance scheme to cover sickness, accidents, unemployment, death of a breadwinner and old age. Ours is a comprehensive policy and the sooner it is adopted, the better it will be for Australia. </para>

            <para>- As one of that band of distinguished senators referred to by my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dittmer,</inline> a member of the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs which has just brought in a plenary report on hospital and medical costs, I wish to say a few words only on this Bill. The Bill follows the report of the Health Insurance Committee of Inquiry, which is known as the Nimmo Committee, which recommended that the low income group in the community should be insured. The Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs found from its investigations that there is an area of need in this field. We found also that at any one time there seems to be a proportion of the population - it was estimated as varying between 10% and 15%  -  which is either not insured or is under-insured. The reasons for this situation are somewhat complex and there does not seem to be available any definite information as to why some people are not insured or are under-insured. The Bill seeks to overcome this deficiency. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The three groups which are affected are the low income group, which in the Bill are deemed to be those whose income does not exceed $39 per week; those who are receiving unemployment or sickness benefits; and migrants, temporarily, when they come into Australia. There is no question that we all accept that the community has a responsibility to care for the less fortunate ones among us. One might wonder whether an arbitrary figure of $39 a week is best. The Committee gave a great deal of thought to this subject and we felt that in the time available we could not come to any definite conclusions, but in paragraph 172 of the report we suggested that perhaps the amount should be based upon the entitlement for a pension. We suggest that this is one matter which requires further investigation by any future committee which may be set up in relation to this matter. </para>
          <para>I express some little concern that the Commonwealth alone is carrying this burden. There was available to the Committee much evidence to suggest that the medical insurance funds could bear at least a proportion of the burden. There is one section of the community - the pensioners - who are at present covered under the pensioner medical service. The Committee said in its report that it had given consideration to this group. We had evidence from some of the funds to show that they were prepared to provide, and indeed had an obligation to provide, with the Commonwealth, assistance towards the pensioner group who would be insured under the normal hospital and medical insurance scheme, the cost to be borne by the Commonwealth and the funds in a combined operation. This suggestion, quite frankly, has considerable appeal, but we recognise that there are involved some complex problems which require further investigation. One rather fears that the Commonwealth's acceptance of the full responsibility might well undermine any attempts to bring the funds in with the Commonwealth to provide a scheme for pensioners. </para>
          <para>Apart from the social or humane question involved in this there remains the question of the difference that this would make to the finances of our great public hospitals. There is no doubt that at least a substantial portion of their debts, which are extremely high, are caused by this group being unable to afford any payment for their hospital treatment. I believe that this scheme would assist the public hospitals financially and, from that point of view, would indirectly lower the costs to the taxpayer in another field. While (he taxpayer provides for the insurance for these people he will gain some benefit because the indebtedness of public hospitals will be substantially lower. </para>
          <para>I do not want to present any argument as to the desirability of the national health scheme proposed by the Australian Labor Party. Although I believe that the present scheme has some very grave deficiencies, just as any scheme which is introduced will develop deficiencies unless it is overhauled continuously - 1 believe that this should not be a patchwork operation - it is immediately meeting an area of great need. 1 have little doubt that the present scheme when reformed will meet adequately the health needs of the community. I have pleasure in supporting the Bill with the qualifications that I have stated. I believe that it will help people in a section of the community who are in need. </para>

            <para>- This Bill, which has as its purpose the provision of free medical and hospital insurance to persons in receipt of an income of $39 or less a week, is supported by the Opposition. We of the Labor movement believe that voluntary health insurance has completely failed the Australian people. Because of the shortage of time and the lateness of the hour in this sessional period of the Parliament, my remarks must necessarily be brief. I suggest that it is a great pity that a measure so important as this has to be debated in the dying hours of the Parliament. I understand that about 100,000 Australians will receive some benefit from this measure and, for this reason, we do not oppose the passage of the Bill. But notwithstanding this legislation there will remain in Australia about 900.000 people still uninsured. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We say that a system must be devised whereby all people will be roped into a national health scheme. To date it <inline font-style="italic">would</inline> appear that there are three great areas of voluntary health insurance which have been ignored by the present Government. Firstly, the Government appears to have ignored the problems of those who are underinsured. Their problems are quite distinct from those of the uninsured. Certainly there are still many thousands in this economic category. Secondly, it has been ignoring for some considerable time the very pressing problems of the family man who finds that he or his family runs into a bout of prolonged illness and that he cannot cope with the very wide gap existing between the doctor's fee and the inadequate refund provided to him by the medical benefit insurance fund and the Commonwealth contribution thereto. Thirdly, the Government has for some considerable time chosen to ignore what I would regard as excessive and in some cases unjustifiable administrative expenses of large insurance funds. The Government appears to be prepared to close its eyes in this regard. In my opinion this has been one of the great mistakes and one of the great tragedies of the existing scheme, and one of the reasons why it has failed to serve and cater for the needs of the Australian people. </para>
          <para>I do not think that anyone can condone the expenditure by one fund of some $40,000 on the purchase of an aircraft, which incidentally crashed subsequently and was not replaced by the fund. I suggest that it was a purchase designed as a status symbol for the executive of the fund - keeping up with the Joneses, as it were - and it certainly in my opinion could be regarded as an act of self-interest on the part of the management of that fund. There is also the question of excessive advertising which has been referred to in the interim report of the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs, of which you Madam Acting Deputy President, were Chairman. The Committee found that excessive advertising was being directed towards the transfer of contributors from one fund to another, thereby unnecessarily increasing management expenses. There is the question of commissions paid by funds to agents to get people to transfer from one fund to another. In my opinion, no-one can condone a commission payment of $8 to $9 by a fund to an agent - referred to in evidence before the Committee - merely to get a contributor to transfer from a fund to which he already contributes, to another fund. </para>
          <para>Then there is the question of the establishment of a political fighting fund to preserve - and only for the purpose of preserving - voluntary health insurance in Australia. In 1961 when an election was being closely fought a document headed 'Public Relations and the National Health Scheme' was prepared and circulated by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> W. Wyett who is connected with one of the funds. Amongst other things he called on the Blue Cross funds to set aside a sum of $20,000 a year for a period of 5 years, to be raised from contributions made by each member and to be related to the size of the funds. The purpose of this sum was the employment of a public relations consultant to wage nothing more or less than a political campaign. </para>

              <para>- The unions are voluntary organisations for the purpose of improving the industrial conditions of their members and they arc registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, but these funds are non-profit organisations for the purpose of providing health insurance for their members and I suggest that it is very scandalous indeed that there can be such a misue of contributors' moneys for political purposes. Indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner,</inline> the Director and Public Officer of the Hospital Contribution Fund of Australia, called the Voluntary Health Insurance Council of Australia a misleading name adopted by a closed body created by three registered benefit organisations to present their own views on matters within or complementary to the field of voluntary health insurance, and he said that this organisation must not be regarded as the voice of the voluntary health insurance industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> went on to say in evidence before the Committee that the original proposal put forward by Eric White Associates bore heavily upon medical politics and upon the manner in which medicine should be provided for by the public and it had a political motive. I agreed with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> when he added in evidence: </para>

          <para class="block">As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dittmer</inline> has already said on behalf of the Labor movement, voluntary health insurance has failed the Australian people. A dissection of health services expenditure with a percentage apportionment of cost in 1966-67 shows that public finance provided for 51.8% of the cost of health services, the Commonwealth bearing 29.3%, the States 21.5%, and local government 1%: private finance provided for 48.2%; patients' fees provided for 34.2%; voluntary health insurance provided for only 13%; and other sources provided for 0.9% . </para>
          <para>We say that the cost of the present scheme is too great. I commend the courage of the Deputy Director-General of Health in telling the Committee in evidence that he saw nothing in the Nimmo Committee's report which in the light of what the Department knew was considered to be exaggerated. I congratulate the Director of the Research Section of the Commonwealth Department of Health for saying in evidence before the Committee that as far as he had been able to check the figures submitted for a health scheme based on a surcharge on taxable income the figures were soundly based and were based on solid assumptions. The plain fact is that this nation is faced with a breakdown in effective health care unless more determined and concerted action is taken by the Government to improve the situation that has existed for some considerable time. </para>
          <para>The Government has a responsibility for leadership in promoting a change. I suggest that as this Parliament comes to a conclusion and parliamentarians leave Canberra to return to their electorates for the holding of a general election it is only the Australian Labor Party which has come up with a soundly based plan and we as members of the Labor Party leave tha question lo the Australian people to decide, and we believe that they will decide that it is time for an alternative health scheme to be introduced in the interests of Australia and the Australian people. </para>

            <para>- 1 support the Bill because one has to support the Bill, but one must lake exception lo the fact that the Government continues to introduce piecemeal legislation instead of looking at the problem as a whole. Instead of the problem being tackled properly we find that here again there is another little handout to two groups of people. Mind you, I think that the provision relating to migrants is an extremely good proposition and should go a long way towards helping in the immigration programme. The question of supporting those who unfortunately are not able to be insured is not such a serious problem. The public forgets that there is a service - admittedly it is not the best service - for people who cannot afford to pay. It is provided in our public or general hospitals. If the Government is to adopt the principle that anyone earning less than S39 a week should be entitled to be insured, this worries me, because one can see that the Government might say that all pensioners should be insured. I am not so sure whether or not this will be a good thing, but I will not debate it because it is one of the matters upon which the Committee has not yet reached a conclusion, and 1 am not sure of my position in regard to the Committee that may be formed next year. 1 want to sound a note of warning. 1 have not been convinced that insuring pensioners will be in the best interests of the pensioners. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let us get down to the facts of voluntary and compulsory insurance. The Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs has voted, by a majority, for voluntary insurance. Let me say that there need not have been anything wrong with voluntary insurance. But there are many things wrong with it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> enumerated some of them, but he did not mention the fund reserves, which have become colossal. One fund has reserves of $22m. He did not mention the abuse of the special account system. These things should never have arisen. There would be nothing wrong with the voluntary health insurance scheme if the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> am i/or his Department paid attention to it. </para>
          <para>I do not know who is to blame. If the Department of Health advised the Minister and he did not accept the advice, he is to blame. If the officers of the Department of Health did nol give him advice, they should be sacked because they are the people who have brought the voluntary health insurance scheme into disrepute. So. whichever way one looks at it, the Minister or his Department is responsible for the present controversy over voluntary and compulsory health insurance. The voluntary health insurance scheme would have been all right if the Department had watched it. lt knew all along about these reserves, lt knew all along about the administrative expenses. But not a thing was done. Do nol let officers of the Department say: 'We cannot do anything'. Had they just asked the Minister to bring in legislation and ensured that it was done, most of the faults that lie in the scheme at present would never have been the basis for controversy, as they are at the moment. </para>
          <para>The faults of the scheme have been enumerated. But let me refer to the major fault in the whole scheme, namely, the failure of the Government to support its own voluntary health insurance scheme. I cannot understand how people in the Labor Party and in the Liberal Party can stand up in public and talk about a voluntary scheme and a compulsory scheme when the fault lies with the Government itself. The Government introduced the scheme. We know that every time any. social service benefit - maternity allowance, child endowment, pensions, health insurance or medical insurance - is introduced, the Government lakes all the credit, throws out its chest and says: 'Look what we did. We introduced this. You did not introduce it. Vote for us'. But then the Government just lets the scheme wither on the vine. That is what has happened in the field of voluntary health insurance. </para>
          <para>As I said only last week, for general practitioner consultation services item 1 the Commonwealth contributes 80c. That has been the Commonwealth contribution for 10 years. Since the inception of the scheme it has been raised from 60c to 80c. In that period the average weekly earnings of Australians have increased by about 1 12% but the Commonwealth Government has increased its contribution by only 334%. I suppose that parliamentary salaries have increased by about 120% in that period. But we do not count that. The Government introduces the scheme and then leaves it to wither on the vine. Then it tries to blame everyone else but itself. </para>
          <para>No-one but the Department of Health and the Government is to blame for the fact that today the Commonwealth benefit of 80c is the same as it was 10 years ago. In the period that it has been 80c the value of money has depreciated by about half. So the contribution should be $1.20 if the Government wanted to give it its true value. No-one minds when Second Division public servants receive salary increases of $2,000 a year. It is said that they are justifiable. But the Government does not raise its contribution one iota. Then it wonders why there is so much dispute about its scheme. </para>
          <para>If the Labor Party gets into office at the next election - mind you, 1 doubt that it will - the Government will have only one person to blame, and that is the Minister for Health. If the people are swept away on the domestic issue of voluntary or compulsory health insurance, the fault will lie with the Department of Health and its Minister because they have let the people of Australia down in that year after year they have refused to increase the Commonwealth contribution. </para>
          <para>I have supported the voluntary scheme. At one stage I was in two minds as to which way I should go. If we patched up the voluntary scheme and had a real look at it, it would be ail right. I cannot see why, instead of introducing legislation to do a bit here and a bit there, we cannot have a comprehensive new scheme of voluntary health insurance - one that the people can enjoy and one to which the Government can contribute on a proper basis. So, 1 am quite happy to stay with the voluntary scheme for the next couple of years and see what happens. If it fails and the Government fails, I will say: 'Let us drop it in favour of a compulsory scheme and see what happens then. At least let us give it a try'. </para>

          <para>I want to make a couple of comments on doctors' fees. Firstly, one hears time and time again that they have reached a point where the public cannot pay. That is utter nonsense. Figures that were given to the Senate Select Committee showed that in spite of increases in fees the number of people visiting doctors is increasing. So do not let anybody try to tell me that doctors' fees have reached a peak. What about parliamentary salaries? What about public servants' salaries? Have not they reached a peak? </para>
          <para>Secondly, there has to be some stability and some appreciation of the three bodies concerned, namely, the Government, the doctors and the health insurance organisations. Some method must be arrived at by which we can achieve some stability in fees. I am totally opposed to the fixation of fees. . I have never practised it myself. Our fees have always been 50c dearer than those of any other doctor in town, and that has never stopped our practice from growing. So, 1 do not believe for one minute that the level of fees has anything to do with whether people will see a doctor. But this is not of much use in a scheme in which there are three partners. I believe that the doctors must come to heel and accept some form of common fee. </para>
          <para>The only trouble is that the common fee is largely misunderstood by doctors as representing the lowest fee. That is not so. This system still does not stop a doctor from charging more than the common fee. But there has to be some basis for stability. At first I was opposed to the common fee. But now I believe that it is quite a good solution, provided - I emphasise this proviso - that the fee is fixed for a limited period and is subject to revision and is tied to some index. 1 will not have a bar of any scheme that is not tied to an index, because one cannot trust governments. We have seen that in the field of health insurance the Commonwealth contribution has stayed at 80c for 10 years, when it should now be $1.20. If we do not have some scheme that is tied to an index there will be (rouble. </para>
          <para>Evidence was given to the Senate Select Committee that one just cannot trust the Government. I am not arguing whether the Government's decision in regard to the chemists was right or wrong. The Government said to the chemists: 'We will have a look at your fees by arbitration'. But when the arbitration decision went against the Government, the Government said: What a lot of rot. It was not done properly'. Whether the Government was right or wrong 1 do not want to argue in the short time that we have available. But that is the sort of thing that will happen. That is why I say that there has to be an automatic review. If there is an automatic review every 2 years and the scheme is tied to an index, there can be no dispute about the fee being adjusted. The system would probably operate in the same way in that doctors would still be entitled to increase their fees if they wanted to do so. I do hope that in the policy speech of the Government, which will be so full of bribes that one will wonder where they will stop, at least a new health policy will be included and that a promise of doing something about the health scheme instead of leaving it as it is will be forthcoming. </para>
          <para>I am most certain that most of the recommendations that the Committee of which I was a member will be accepted by the Government - they will certainly be accepted by my Party - to improve the health scheme. But that is not good enough. Let us hope that, when we return next year, instead of a Bill like this one we will have before us a Bill which clears up all the misunderstandings in the scheme and makes it work. Believe me, if this scheme does not work within the next year or 2 years the Government has had it. lt will have a compulsory scheme because people will just not tolerate the present scheme any longer. </para>

This Bill is just one more piece of legislation introduced by this Government to assist those people who are in need. This time, those assisted by this Bill fall into two special groups. Those who will receive adequate medical and hospital insurance benefits are those in the low income group and migrants.

            <para>-  by leave - In the Budget Speech it was announced that the Government intended, subject to conditions, to restore income tax deductions for interest on convertible note issues. A statement which I made on Tuesday evening last week gave a broad outline of the conditions that are proposed. It will not be practicable for the amending legislation - which, because of the intricate nature of the subject, will require some time in the drafting - to be introduced before the Parliament rises. In these circumstances, the purpose of my statement today is to give honourable senators a fuller picture of our proposals before the amending legislation is brought down. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In proposing to restore tax deductions for interest on convertible notes the Government has in mind that this type of security can play a useful and legitimate role in company financing. For a new and developing company that is unable to complete for equity capital in terms of the dividends it can offer, convertible notes can provide a means of keeping down the cost of capital until such time as the company is performing well enough to offer attractive dividends. On the other side of the coin, they can give the investor, in a developing company with good, but by no means certain, prospects for future growth the advantages - in terms of income and security - of a fixed interest issue combined with the opportunity to convert his loan into shares if the company eventually fulfils its early promise. </para>
          <para>Convertible notes have worthwhile advantages apart from considerations such as those I have mentioned. They have been widely used as a means of raising capital on international markets and could, therefore, place Australian companies in a better position to raise funds overseas. Quite importantly, too, they offer a convenient means by which Australians might be given the opportunity to acquire equity holdings in overseas-owned ventures in Australia. As I said in the statement last week, the Government has in mind particularly ventures of this kind in the extractive industries. On the other hand, the Government has no wish to re-open the opportunities for tax avoidance that unconditional restoration of deductibility of interest on convertible notes would provide. </para>
          <para>As mentioned when this proposal was announced, the income lax law was amended in 1960 to disallow the deduction of interest payable by companies on convertible notes, to prevent the use of these securities to avoid tax. In many cases there was little to distinguish the convertible notes being issued in 1960 from deferred shares. By one means or another the companies issuing the convertible notes virtually ensured that the notes, on maturity, would automatically be converted into shares. In effect, companies were issuing notes that really amounted to shares and were obtaining tax deductions for interest payments that really amounted to dividends. They were thus able to breach a fundamental rule of our tax system that, while interest is tax deductible, dividends are not. </para>
          <para>It is proposed, therefore, to restore the tax deduction for interest on convertible notes, largely to assist Australians to acquire a stake in major ventures undertaken here. This will, however, be on conditions which while not stripping convertible notes of their advantages for legitimate business purposes, will minimise their use for tax avoidance purposes. The first condition that is proposed is that it must be the noteholder and not the issuing company who has the option to convert or take repayment in cash. The option will, broadly, be one to have shares in that company or another company allotted to the noteholder. In a fixedinterest borrowing the lender must have the right to repayment in cash of the full amount he has lent. Clearly, if the borrowing company had the right to make the notes convertible it would be able to give a deferred issue of shares the form of a borrowing and thus obtain tax deductions for interest payments that were essentially disguised distribution of income. </para>
          <para>The second condition is that the noteholder's right to exercise the option lo convert is not to be deferred longer than two years after the date on which, broadly speaking, subscriptions to the particular convertible issue can first be made. In the absence of such a condition, noteholders could be put in a position where they would have to go on holding the notes and not convert them for an unduly long time after the issue of the notes, simply because the issuing company had drawn the terms of issue in such a way that the option was to be deferred until the company was ready to redeem its debt by an issue of shares. This second condition will not require the option to be deferred for 2 years - it will be open to the issuing company to make the option exercisable immediately if it wishes. Nor will there be any obligation on the noteholder to exercise his option at the end of the two-year period. If he chooses to do so he will be able to continue holding the notes and determine for himself the time to convert or, alternatively, wait and take repayment in cash when the notes mature. </para>
          <para>Another condition concerning the noteholder's option will be that it must remain open up to a date not more than 1 2 months earlier than the maturity date of the note. The option could, of course, remain open right up to the maturity date - but not later - if the issuing company wished. In other words, the condition allows the option to be terminated as much as 12 months before maturity so as to allow the issuing company, if it wishes to have it, reasonable notice of the funds it will require on the maturity date to repay in cash notes that are not converted. </para>
          <para>It is also proposed that the convertible note must have a currency of not less than 7 years or more than 10 years. The minimum borrowing period of 7 years is designed to give noteholders a reasonable period in which to judge the performance of the issuing company and decide whether or not to exercise their options. The maximum period of 10 years is considered to be long enough to permit the investment to become sufficiently revenue-producing to justify a share issue. Once that stage has been reached there would seem to be no justification for exclusion of noteholders from the company's equity or for the continued distribution of income in the form of tax deductible interest instead of as nondeductible dividends. </para>
          <para>Another condition will be that the terms and conditions applying to the convertible notes are to be fixed and not subject to any variation throughout the period of their currency. That is, the rate of interest on the notes must not vary and the terms of the issue, such as those governing conversion of the notes into shares, are not to be shaded' in such a way that a noteholder is induced to convert at one time rather than another. This condition is, therefore, essentially a backstop lo other conditions. </para>
          <para>Finally, it will be a condition for deductibility of interest that the conversion price for shares is not to be less than 90% of their market value when the convertible notes are offered for issue, or par, whichever is greater. As background to this condition, I mention that in convertible issues on the international market it is usual for the conversion price to be fixed at a premium on the current market price. In the pre- 1960 situation in Australia, however, it was not usual for conversion prices to be fixed in this way. As often as not the conversion price was par. </para>
          <para>Looking to the present situation, and even with convertibility being at the option of the noteholder, the absence of a conversion price test such as the one the Government proposes would mean that companies could make conversion in due course a more-or-less practical certainty. In this way the convertible notes could, to all intents and purposes, be a deferred equity issue. The proposed minimum conversion price is intended to discourage this substitution of convertible notes for equity issues. As I have indicated, the price which a noteholder must pay to have shares allotted to him when he exercises his option will need to be at least 90% of the market value of an equivalent share in the company when the note issue is made. For shares that are listed on a stock exchange, the market value will be based on the market prices of the particular class of share in a period shortly before the note issue is floated. The market value of other shares will be determined by a valuation of a company auditor. </para>
          <para>It is proposed that the conditions I have outlined will apply to convertible note issues made after the necessary amendments become law. These amendments will be introduced as soon as possible. Restoration of deductibility on the basis of the proposed conditions will, the Government feels, make available a useful and suitable means of financing companies through periods of establishment or expansion without opening the way to large-scale tax avoidance, lt will also pave the way for wider participation by Australians in the ownership of the great <inline font-style="italic">ventures</inline> that are doing so much to promote our development and prosperity. </para>

            <para>- With the concurrence of honourable senators, I circulate and incorporate in Hansard a statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> relating to the subject of a central Queensland powerhouse. Honourable senators will note that where the first person personal pronoun T appears, it refers to the Prime Minister. The statement reads: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In September 1968 the Premier of Queensland wrote to me concerning negotiations between the Queensland Treasurer and industrialists interested in major development in Queensland. The Queensland Government intended to build a power house in central Queensland to feed electricity into the Queensland grid, and proposed that the Commonwealth might provide capital so that the power house would be larger than one required solely for this purpose, and so that the additional capacity could be used to attract industries to central Queensland. The basic requirement for such industries, if they are to be so attracted, is the provision of large blocks of power on a continuous load basis, at tariffs comparable with those offering in major industrial centres overseas. If this could be attained it appeared there was a real possibility of the development, in that underdeveloped area, of a new industrial complex that would grow - and become a tangible expression of our interest in decentralised development. </para>
          <para>At this point I stress the advantages which this underdeveloped part of Australia possesses. There are vast coal deposits and cheap steaming coal is available as a by-product of the coking coal export industry. There are extensive brine deposits as raw material for a power intensive chemical industry producing caustic soda for the alumina industry and chlorine for export. The existing alumina industry will expand with consequent opportunity for aluminium production - which requires large amounts of power. A deep water port and harbour facilities suitable for bulk carriers are ready at hand in Gladstone. All in all it is an area crying out for that development, and for that use of its natura] resources, which will benefit the area and add to the greatness of the nation. It offers an exciting opportunity for a great stride forward in national development. And it offers opportunity to increase our exports. </para>
          <para>After preliminary consideration I arranged with the Premier that Commonwealth and State officials should examine the proposal. In March 1969 our officials met with their Queensland colleagues to consider the technical proposals prepared by the State Electricity Commission of Queensland; these official discussions continued in April and May. At that time the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority was retained as consultants to make an independent study of the proposal. The Authority presented a comprehensive report. Following study of it by the officials, the Premier of Queensland, on 25th August 1969, presented the State's financial proposals for the development of the project. An interdepartmental committee, after examining the project in depth, reported to us on 19th September. The Government is greatly impressed with the potential of the project both for the development of central Queensland and for the development of exports. We are convinced that the project is feasible from a technical point of view. We believe the estimates of cost are soundly based technically and financially. And we believe that - given the establishment of certain key industries - there is a real prospect of attracting a variety of other important industries in the future. Given an initial stimulus we think that growth will continue and that the wide spaces of central Queensland, presently under-populated, will be able to develop natural resources to the full and will see towns grow to cities. </para>
          <para>Therefore, on behalf of the Commonwealth I have advised the Queensland Premier and Treasurer that we are prepared to advance up to $80m to the State over a 6-year period to help with this scheme. It is proposed that the advance should be repayable over 30 years and that it should bear interest at the semi governmental rate. This offer is made for the purpose of financing that part of the power station which will meet the requirements of the special industrial development envisaged and it is hoped that this will enable the power station to sell bulk supplies to the industries at rates which will enable them to compete in world markets. The offer will enable the Queensland Government to proceed further with its negotiations with industry and to settle with the Commonwealth, as a result of such negotiation, the exact amount of the advances which will be required and the final terms and conditions for the servicing of the loan. The offer is, of course, conditional on the State being able to satisfy the Commonwealth that it can attract a viable export-oriented industrial complex in central Queensland with a demand appropriate to the output of that part of the station which the Commonwealth contribution is intended to finance. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave  -  In the course of his statement on 1 6th September on overseas investment in Australia, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> announced new guidelines in respect of borrowings in Australia by overseas interests. I now wish to provide more detailed information on the borrowing guidelines for the information of honourable senators, and for the guidance of companies and financial institutions concerned. The borrowing guidelines have been in operation since May 1965 when, following measures taken by the United States Administration to limit capital outflow from that country, the then Treasurer, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harold</inline> Holt, requested overseas interests operating in Australia to consult with the Reserve Bank concerning any proposals they might have for financing their activities here by means of local borrowings. A year later, the British Government took action to limit the movement of funds from the United Kingdom to Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In circumstances in which United States companies and, later British companies were being urged by their respective governments to finance investment overseas to the maximum extent possible by borrowing overseas, and in which Australian interest rates were lower than in many other countries, the initial objective of the guidelines was to avoid excessive calls being made by overseas interests on Australian sources of loan capital and substitution of local borrowings for funds that, if previous practice had been followed, would have been remitted from overseas. If borrowings in Australia by overseas interests had increased substantially, this would have led to a largely commensurate reduction in the amount of overseas funds brought into this country and therefore to a slower rate of growth of the Australian economy. It would also have made it more difficult for Australian enterprises to borrow. </para>
          <para>Since their inception, approvals under the guidelines to borrow in Australia have been related to the amount of overseas funds invested here and to the extent of Australian equity participation in the borrowing company. In the case of wholly or substantially overseas-owned enterprises established in </para>
          <para class="block">Australia prior to the introduction of the guidelines, approvals to date have also taken account of the financing practices that were previously followed by the companies concerned. The broad principle has been to allow such companies to continue to have access to Australian borrowings consistent with their past financing practices, but this has been subject to certain maximum and minimum limits and to adjustment according to the extent of Australian equity participation. In the case of enterprises established subsequent to the introduction of the guidelines by or in association with overseas interests not previously operating in this country, the general principle followed to date has been that the proportion of local borrowings to total borrowings should not exceed the proportion of Australian equity to total equity. Additionally, approvals have readily been given for local borrowings for certain short-term purposes such as the financing of export transactions and fluctuating seasonal requirements. </para>
          <para>The guidelines as they have operated to date have therefore provided a protection against undue reliance by overseas interests on borrowings in Australia and have consequently provided support for the Australian balance of payments. At the same time they have provided an inducement for overseascontrolled companies to admit or to increase Australian equity participation. Experience in their operation and changing circumstances since their introduction showed that they were in need of review. The Government's review of the guidelines has had as a prime objective an increased inducement to overseas-controlled enterprises to admit or to increase local equity participation. A further objective has been to remove certain unsatisfactory features in regard to the equitable application of the guidelines. </para>
          <para>Under the new guidelines announced by the Prime Minister, all enterprises in which overseas interests directly or indirectly own more than 25% of the equity are requested to consult the Reserve Bank in respect of proposals to borrow in Australia. For the purpose 'borrowings' include borrowings of all kinds - bank overdrafts, term loans, mortgage loans, debentures, most types of preference share issues, convertible notes, unsecured notes, deposits, inter-company loans, loans from the short-term market, and so on. Such financing arrangements as leasing finance of the type provided by finance companies and banks, vendor's credit on property sales, and large hire purchase transactions may also need to be taken into account in particular cases. </para>
          <para>The new guidelines take as their starting point the situation of each company as at 30th June 1969. Borrowings approved as acceptable as at that date under the old guidelines may, without further approval, be continued and re-financed as they fall due for repayment. </para>
          <para>In relation to increases in funds requirements after 30th June 1 969, the new guidelines provide, first, for reasonable access to Australian borrowings for financing normal requirements of funds for working capital. For the purpose, working capital includes fluctuating seasonal funds requirements and bridging finance as well as continuing carry-on requirements. The individual circumstances of each case will be taken into consideration in determining the amount of borrowings for working capital considered reasonable. Cases in which working capital requirements represent a large proportion of total funds employed - a situation that commonly obtains for such enterprises as finance companies, import trading firms and construction companies - will require special consideration. </para>
          <para>As was the position under the old guidelines, in all cases approval will readily be given in full for borrowings for that part of working capital requirements that is for the specific purpose of financing export transactions in circumstances where full payment for the goods is not received at the time of shipment of the goods. </para>
          <para>In respect of borrowings to finance capital investment, wholly overseas-owned enterprises that are regarded as having been established in Australia for a period of 4 years or longer will in addition be allowed to borrow in Australia up to 10% of the increase in funds employed subsequent to 30th June 1969. For this purpose 'funds employed' means total of shareholders' funds (including retained earnings) and other funds financed from overseas sources, plus local borrowings including bank overdraft limits but excluding borrowings to finance export transactions and other increases in working capital. </para>
          <para>Companies wholly owned by overseas interests established in Australia for periods of less than 4 years will be allowed access to local borrowings on a basis of up to 2i% of the increase in funds employed in the foregoing sense, for each year the overseas interests have been established in Australia. Such companies will for the purpose have a moving base until the overseas interests concerned are regarded as having been established here for 4 years. </para>
          <para>For enterprises with Australian equity participation, additional borrowings will be allowed according to the proportion of tola! equity held directly or indirectly by Australians. In respect of an enterprise's requirement of funds additional to any new share issues, retained earnings, and local borrowings allowed under the provisions I have already explained, local borrowings will be allowed on a proportionate basis to overseas borrowings, the proportionate basis being related to the proportion of equity held by Australians. Australian equity will be weighted on a 4 for 3 basis, so that the proportion for an enterprise with 30% Australian equity, for example, will be 40%. Enterprises with 75% or more Australian equity will have unrestricted access to Australian borrowings regardless of whether Australian borrowings are accompanied by overseas borrowings. </para>
          <para>There may be cases in which the overseas participants cannot for special reasons arrange overseas borrowings to match local borrowings on the foregoing basis. These cases will be considered in the light of all the particular circumstances. The guiding principle will be that Australian equity will increase access to local borrowings. For the purpose of calculating the extent of Australian equity, account will be taken of outright offers to Australians of new or increased equity which are not taken up but which the Reserve Bank considers to have been genuine and reasonable offers of local equity participation in the enterprise. </para>
          <para>Convertible note issues by overseascontrolled companies to Australians represent a form of local borrowing of a special kind in that, provided the terms of the conversion option are genuine and reasonable, they confer on the Australian lenders the opportunity, which depending on circumstances might or might not be exercised, to take up equity at a future date. If and when the notes are converted, they cease of course to be a borrowing and become actual equity. Under the guidelines, convertible note issues while remaining unconverted will be treated as borrowings, but in calculating the extent of Australian equity one-half the future increase in Australian equity that would result if the notes were converted will be taken into account. If there are proposals for making convertible note issues for amounts in excess of the amounts of local borrowings qualifying for approval under the provisions I have outlined, such proposals will receive special consideration under the guidelines. </para>
          <para>As was the case under the old guidelines, approval will not normally be given for borrowings that would facilitate the remittance of funds abroad for such purposes as the repayment of overseas borrowings and the diversion of the financing of imports from overseas to local sources. In support of long-standing exchange control policy under which overseas interests taking over or acquiring participation in Australian enterprises are required to bring in cash to the full extent of the purchase price, approval will also not normally be given to local borrowings for these purposes. In the event of an overseas takeover of an Australian company wilh outstanding local borrowings, the overseas interests concerned will be asked to consult the Reserve Bank concerning the local borrowings involved. It is not intended that overseas interests should necessarily consult the Reserve Bank on each individual proposed borrowing operation. The consultation will relate to total borrowing programmes; after approval has been given under the guidelines to a borrowing programme the detailed manner of implementing the programme, within the limits approved, will be a matter for the company concerned. </para>
          <para>Local borrowings of up to $100,000 in total in any one year by any one overseas group will not be subject to the guidelines. Such borrowings do not in the aggregate represent significant amounts for guidelines purposes, and this exemption will operate to simplify administration. </para>
          <para>For the information of companies concerned, I point out that it would be helpful if overseas interests, when submitting borrowing proposals to the Reserve Bank, were to furnish details of funds employed at 30th June 1969, supplemented by forward estimates of funds proposed to be employed over the period- concerned. This should include separate information on projected changes in working capital requirements and consolidated group or individual company balance sheets. Normally borrowing proposals will be considered on the basis of funds requirements during an individual financial year. In respect of proposals for the financing of projects extending over longer periods, consideration will be given in appropriate cases to the funds requirements over such longer periods. In the case of undertakings which are members of a group of overseas-controlled subsidiaries, the usual procedure is to consider borrowing proposals by any one subsidiary on the basis of consolidated balance sheets for all members of the group. This is usually more convenient for the companies concerned and it reduces the number of occasions on which referral under the guidelines is necessary. However, this may not always be appropriate and consideration will be given to dealing with submissions on an individual company basis instead of a group basis if desired by the companies concerned. 1 emphasise that the guidelines are concerned with the sources of finance for investment in Australia by overseas interests, lt is not part of the purpose of the guidelines to attempt to influence the kinds of investment undertaken by overseas interests or to make administrative judgments on the relative merits of investment projects. Nor are the guidelines used in any way to attempt to <inline font-style="italic">regulate the</inline> distribution of local borrowings by overseas interests or the interest rates to be paid on such borrowings. These are matters for each company concerned to decide in the light of its own circumstances and what can bc negotiated with lenders. 1'also emphasise that although the guidelines had their origins in measures taken in the United States and later in the United Kingdom, the same rules are applied to all overseas interests, whatever their country of origin. </para>
          <para>The Government appreciates the cooperation that has been forthcoming from both borrowers and lending institutions in the administration of the guidelines to date. </para>
          <para class="block">We have no doubt that this co-operation will continue, if anything in a strengthened way, in the light of the full explanation that has been given of the purposes and objectives of the guidelines and of the manner in which they will operate in the future. The new guidelines are, we believe, eminently fair and reasonable and we hope they will be accepted as such. They will remove certain unsatisfactory features of the old guidelines and will at the same time give added emphasis to the Government's wish to encourage greater Australian equity participation in the activities of overseas enterprises in this country that are making such a major contribution to the quite spectacular rate of growth and development of our economy. </para>
          <para>Under the new guidelines some companies will in future obtain greater access to local borrowings, and others less, in comparison with the borrowings that would have been approved on the basis of the old guidelines. The effect, in the aggregate, will depend on a great many factors and cannot be estimated with precision, but it is considered that total borrowings qualifying for approval under the new guidelines will not be significantly different from the total that would have resulted from continuance of the old guidelines. </para>

          <para>I draw the honourable senators attention to the following answer which I gave to a question in the House of Representatives on 26th August 1969 (Hansard page 640): </para>
          <para>I believe that the Barrier Reef, being one of the great wonders of the world, should not be in any way endangered and should not in any way run the risk of having its ecological balance disturbed, or in other ways put in jeopardy. There were a number of leases issued, as the honourable member will know, by the Queensland Government before the introduction of the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States for off-shore petroleum. On entering into the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States on off-shore petroleum, the existing leases which the State had given were protected. That is the situation as it stands at the present time. But I can only repeat what I said before, and which I say to the honourable member now, that anything which in any way would seem to endanger the Great Barrier Reef, not only on the question of drilling for oil, is something which should not, as far as legal possibilities are concerned, take place. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Fees charged by doctors show considerable variations according to the nature of the case, the district and the status of the medical practitioners concerned. Because of the variation in the level of fees charged for a particular service it is inevitable that cases will arise where the total benefit paid will fall short of a reasonable proportion of the fee charged. These cases may arise from some special or unusual circumstance or because a doctor makes a charge higher than that customarily made for the particular service. The Government is well aware of this problem. The Nimmo Committee has made certain recommendations designedto bridge the gap between the cost of services received and the insurance benefits payable. One of the main questions to be resolved is the concept of common medical fees. There is a basic agreement between the Government, the Australian Medical Association and the health insurance funds that the general concept of common fees can be made to work. The Government has already begun talks with the AMA and it is hopeful of a worthwhile outcome. When the common fee concept is introduced, it will help to bridge the gap between benefit entitlements and actual fees and give health insurance contributors a greater degree of certainty about their costs than exists at present. </para>

              <para>Has the Minister noted the recent statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Williams,  Chairman  of the Australian National Line, in which he said that delays in shipbuilding in Australia are disastrous and that a ship which takes 3½ years to build in Australia can be built in 9 months in Japan, and very often ships built in that time in Japan are larger. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>What is the reason for this very great disparity in the time of building, which must obviously be penalising the Australian shipbuilding industry and seriously jeopardising its further expansion. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator SCOTT-</inline>The Minister for Shipping and Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>Yes. At the opening of the Australian National Line's new terminal facilities in Townsville on 15th August 1969, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Williams referred to delays being experienced by the Line with the delivery of its three 'Searoader' vessels at present under construction. These delays have been overcome and the delivery dates for these ships are now expected to be early October and mid-December 1969, and April 1970. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>While delivery delays have occurred in the Australian industry, recent performances overall have been quite satisfactory. Of the last ten ships completed to the order of the Australian Shipbuilding Board, five were handed over on time or earlier than the contract delivery date, including force majeure extensions; two were only 1 or 2 days late while three were between two and a half weeks and 2 months late. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Japanese construction times are often misleading when compared with Australian delivery times because they are based on the time of construction on the building berth and, generally, do not take into account the time of pre-production preparation. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Nevertheless, Japanese construction times arc consistently shorter. This can be attributed to the greater capacity of the industry and the continuous use made of facilities which enable, amongst other things, the employment of large numbers of planning and purchasing staff and the holding of larger stocks of steel plate and ship engines. The full utilisation of available labour through shiftwork, and the investment in highly mechanised plant are other factors which contribute to the reduction of delays to a minimum. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>The Australian Government has consistently opposed French atmospheric nuclear testing in the Pacific, and will continue to do so. The French Government is aware of this attitude. </para>

          <para>As regards the remainder of the honourable senator's question the National Radiation Advisory Committee has informed me as follows: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>No. The fallout rate in North Queensland is very similar to that over most of continental Australia. Tasmania, however, happens to be an area of particularly low fallout from French weapons tests. The factor of 13 which is mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> refers only to one special radioisotope in fresh fallout - Iodine 131. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>However, as radio-iodine has a short half-life of only 8 days it decays very quickly. It therefore contributes very little to total fallout effects. </para>
          <para>It happens that, for geographical and climatological reasons this isotope was deposited rather more heavily in Northern Queensland than elsewhere in Australia and there was, in fact, a factor of 13 between the two areas, Northern Queensland and Tasmania, in relation to the estimated thyroid doses for young children due to Iodine 131 in milk consumed following the nuclear weapons tests by France in Polynesia in 1967 and 1968. </para>
          <para>Nevertheless, the maximum thyroid dose of Iodine 131 accumulated in any 12-month period in Northern Queensland during 1967 and 1968 was only one-seventh of the limit considered safe by the N.R.A.C. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>After assessing the biological aspects of fallout in Australia from the French Nuclear Weapons Explosions in the Pacific, the N.R.A.C. stated that 'fallout over Australia from the 1968 French weapons tests is of no significance as a hazard to the health of the Australian population'. In reaching this conclusion the N.R.A.C. took particular care to assess the thyroid uptake of Iodine 131 in young children. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In view of these facts it will be seen to be quite unnecessary to undertake any tests on children in Northern Queensland. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- On 22nd May, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> asked me, as Leader of the Government, the following question without notice: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Does the Leader of the Government feel that Australia, together with world food agencies, is doing all that is possible to achieve an acceptable distribution of food supplies to those people who are said to be living at starvation levels? Can he refer to any report that indicates a decrease in the number of people throughout the world who are said to be suffering from malnutrition? As certain primary industries in Australia feel it is essential that the production of essential foods should be curtailed, is this not an obvious indictment of this country for its inability, together with others, to solve the greatest problem of the world today? Will the Minister alert the Australian Government to the importance of Australia giving urgent consideration to taking a world lead in this matter with a view to bringing about a new deal in the distribution of food supplies throughout the world? </para>
          <para class="block">I said that the question deserved a detailed answer to explain Australia's role in the provision of food aid. I have obtained the following information from the Acting Minister for External Affairs: Since the food crisis period of 1965 and 1966. when the production of major food grains in several less developed countries, and notably India, Pakistan and Ceylon, fell significantly, the situation has improved both through increased production in the developing countries and through the food aid policies of some developed countries. </para>
          <para>The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations has estimated that the 5% rise in food production in the developing countries in 1967 was the largest for many years and on a per capita basis made up much of the ground lost in 1965 and 1966. Present estimates by the FAO show a rise of 3% in food production in the developing countries in 1968. No data is available for 1969, but the FAO expects a further rise this year if seasonal conditions remain favourable. The recovery in agricultural production is not only due to more favourable weather conditions. An important factor has been the more systematic and widespread use of agricultural inputs. This has included the application of fertilisers on a large scale and the introduction of improved seed varieties, particularly the new high-yielding varieties of wheat, rice, corn and sorghum. </para>
          <para>In many developing countries agricultural investment now takes up a larger share than ever before in national budgets. Aid programmes - multilateral and bilateral, public and private - are supplementing the efforts of developing countries to help themselves in meeting their food requirements. The most important factor is the community efforts which the less developed countries themselves are making. Many experts believe that further increases in agricultural output in the developing countries can be expected in the future, although the uncertainty of weather conditions will, of course, affect the situation from year to year. The Director-General of the FAO, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Boerma,</inline> has stated recently that improvements in the world food situation 'gave grounds for cautious optimism'. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government's policy towards food aid is that it should be given to meet genuine requirements in recipient countries, lt should not be seen merely as a means of disposing of surplus production but in response to the needs of developing countries. Also, the Government docs not wish to hinder agricultural development in recipient countries by causing a lowering of price of agricultural products, brought about by the increased supply and hence giving rise to disincentive effects upon local producers and discouraging them from using more fertilisers and new seed varieties. Food aid has to be part of a balanced aid programme which includes funds for agricultural development in the regions concerned, the sending of experts to assist in expanding agricultural production and the offering of scholarships for people to train in agricultural science in Australia. </para>
          <para>Australia has provided significant amounts of food aid since the inception of the Colombo Plan in 1950. The most recent and largest gifts have been the four gifts of wheat and other foodstuffs to India valued at $33,224,000 to help alleviate the effects of the droughts in 1965 and 1966. Under the Food Aid Convention, which forms an integral part of the International Grains Arrangement, Australia has a formal obligation to contribute, over the period 1st July 1968, to 30th June 1971, 225,000 metric tons of food grain annually to developing countries. Australia's contribution represents <inline font-style="italic">5%</inline> of the total contribution. A Food Aid Committee, whose membership comprises the food donor countries, supervises the functioning of food aid arrangements, and examines the manner in which obligations under the food aid programme have been fulfilled. </para>
          <para>Australia's contribution is a significant one by comparison with other countries and in relation to our population and national income. Australia not only made this commitment under the Food Aid Convention but has actively implemented it. In .1968-69 Australia contributed 224,080 metric tons of wheat or flour equivalent valued at $A 11.8m to India. Indonesia, Ceylon, Pakistan, Fiji, Korea, Afghanistan and Nigeria. </para>
          <para>In addition to the FAO commitment which is administered on a bilateral basis, Australia has contributed to multilateral food aid under the World Food Programme. The objective is to use food aid lo support economic and social development projects in the recipient countries. Commodities can be used as part payment of workers wages in labour intensive projects, to supplement the diet of farmers while land settlement projects are getting under way or as food-stuffs in annual husbandry projects. The WFP's resources also provide emergency relief to countries and people affected by natural disasters, as well as supplementary feeding programmes for children in developing countries. The Australian pledge for the 2-year period 1969-70 amounted to $US 1,650,000 which represented an increase of 10% over its annual rate of contribution during the preceding period. </para>

        <para class="block">In speaking to the motion, I simply wish to say that a general election will be held on 25th October which by nature of the Constitution does not affect the personal membership of the Senate. But we have in the Senate two honourable senators who are filling casual Senate vacancies and who will be going to the electors on the same day as the general election for the other place is held. Whilst we are putting politics to one side in these matters, I am sure that, within the limits of our political convictions, we all wish those honourable senators well. Speaking for the Government side, I know that we would hope to see those honourable senators back here again as robust as they usually are. </para>
        <para>I know that we all recognise that, while the role of the Senate is somewhat different from that of the other place, nevertheless it is a tremendously stimulating thing to be a member of the Senate. I think that we can all take pride as senators that in this place we represent the people of Australia. I know that this is a situation where politics inevitably must intrude and does intrude in terms of personalities. But, speaking on behalf of the Government, without getting into the area of politics, 1 do wish to say that we express the hope, the wish and the confidence to those honourable senators that they will be returned to us when next we meet in this place. </para>

We hope that their experience in the Senate has been a good one for them. As those honourable senators come from the Government side and not from my side of the Senate, I cannot wish that their term be extended any further.

        <para>It has been a very heavy sitting of the Senate. As a mark of that fact, I might point out that reports have been presented by Committees of this Senate, I think, in unprecedented number. During the current sitting, there have been ten parliamentary committees which have made a total of thirty-one reports to the Senate. Those reports were presented by Committees of the Senate and by Joint Committees. With the concurrence of honourable senators, I incorporate in Hansard a document setting out those reports to the Senate by Committees. It reads: </para>

Whatever the political fortunes may turn out to be, this Parliament has contributed a great deal. I should like to express my thanks to those who have presided over this House, whether in the Senate, in Committees of the Whole or, for that matter, in the select committees of the Senate. I express my thanks also to the officers and staff but I will not say any more than that because we do not want to have now the valedictories which are delivered at Christmas time. </para>
      <para>I am grateful that this has been a full term for me as Leader of the Opposition. I have enjoyed the relationship of cooperation and often tolerance which has existed between the Government and the Opposition generally and between (he Leaders on both sides. I thank my  Deputy  Leader and my Whips without whose assistnce the work could not be done. We hope to be here again shortly with many new faces in the other place and perhaps several here. Until then I wish all honourable senators well. </para>

          <para>- I think I have sufficient voice to express a few thoughts with regard to the work that we have done during this sessional period and with regard to the future of the Senate following the election for the House of Representatives on 25th October. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>This has been a fairly heavy session and I believe that much of the legislation will be of great value. Mention has been made of co-operation. I think that both the </para>
        <para class="block">Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Anderson)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> are indebted to members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party for the co-operation that we have given because, in the position that we occupy, no submission of the Government and nothing that the Opposition advances as an amendment can be carried without our support. So both the Government and the Opposition are dependent on the Australian Democratic Labor Party. </para>
        <para>There was reference to the impending election. I point out that we can go into the election knowing that our numbers cannot be decreased. Instead, there is a chance that our numbers will be increased. I am speaking now not only of the Senate but in the overall as well. We have no fears that our numbers will be reduced at this election but we can look forward with some optimism to the possibility that our numbers will be increased. On the other hand, the Government could have an alteration in its personnel because two of its members in the Senate have to face their masters on 25th October. Whether they will be returned is a matter for the people. In the other place both major parties may win some seats but they run the risk of losing some. </para>
        <para class="block">We are not in that position. As I have said, we can only increase our numbers. I. have been in political life since 1932 - that is a long time ago - and I have learned that there is never an election, just as there is never a battle, without casualties. I can recall only one election when both the Government and the Opposition were returned without the loss of a seat. There were no defeats on either side. That was in a Queensland election some years ago. In the present circumstances we cannot look forward to that, lt is most unlikely that it will happen. There will be defeats and there will be victories. </para>
        <para>No doubt the election will be fought with great vigour. The campaign will not be free of inaccuracies, to put it mildly, or political lies and exaggeration. Of course the most important ingredient in the election will be the great competition in promises. Whether the people will be gullible enough to fall for all the promises that will be made remains to be seen. The ballot box will answer that question. </para>
