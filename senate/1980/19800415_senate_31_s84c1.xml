        <para>The current review of invalid pensioners by the Department of Social Security is being conducted in an atmosphere of intimidation and harassment. While we do not wish to reflect on the staff of the Department, the Director General of Social Security. P. J. Lanigan, has stated that the present number of invalid pensioners &#39;seems rather higher than might have been expected from the normal growth in the people eligible for this benefit.&#39; The clear implication is that the Department should seek to reduce the number of invalid pensioners. Further, the Director-General&#39;s directive that the state of the labour market must be disregarded&#39; is absurd when disabled people are victimised in the labour market and when there is a permanent high level of unemployment. </para>

            <para>VISITING FELLOWSHIP AT UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE </para>
            <para>Some weeks ago I raised with you the possibility of my receiving a visiting Fellowship at the University of Adelaide. Further discussion of this possibility has taken place, and I am able to report that the proposal now appears to be firming up. Only today I had a lengthy telephone discussion with the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stranks, who informed me that my written response to the original proposal had been accepted by the administration, and was fully supported by him. The Vice-Chancellor expressed his full support for my nomination, and said that the matter would finally be resolved in about three or four weeks. </para>
            <para>The Fellowship will carry the title Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Residence, and it will last for one year. Under the proposal the University will pay my normal salary, plus an allowance to help me meet extra expenses involved in going to Adelaide, and presumably being separated from my family for at least some of the time. The Vice-Chancellor suggested that the Fellowship might start at about the end of June or early July. During the twelve months period I will complete my book on East Timor, and deliver a number of lectures on general aspects of international relations. </para>
            <para>If all goes well, I propose to apply for one year&#39;s leave without pay. I have been informed by an officer of the appropriate division of the Public Service Board, that, in the case of a Public Service Department, leave without pay in these circumstances would come within the terms of section 72A of the Public Service Act, according to which such leave counts as service for all purposes except recreation leave. This would mean that I would continue to contribute to superannuation, and that the leave would count as service. </para>
            <para>As you know, I have now been in the Public Service for more than twenty five years and, although I have been involved in research-related work for nearly all of that time, I have neither sought nor obtained leave without pay for such a purpose before. As my career moves into its last phase, I feel the need for rejuvenation, as well as an opportunity to be away from the pace and pressures of work in Parliament House. I suggest that the University of Adelaide will offer an appropriate environment for this purpose, as well as an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding among the teaching staff of important aspects of Australian Foreign Policy, that are often neglected in formal academic studies. </para>

            <para class="block">Dear Jim, </para>
            <para>After our long discussion last Wednesday evening it was understood that you were to talk with me again on Monday 14 April 1980 about the kinds of Foreign Affairs projects in which you would like to engage as a &#39;Special Projects Officer&#39;. Because our discussion ranged over a wide area and also because you are on leave today and I shall be away on duty until next Monday it seems desirable to make my decisions clear to you in writing. </para>
            <para>In response to wishes you have previously expressed to me and others you are to be freed from responsibilty for a Research Group administration and given time for in-depth research and writing. </para>
            <para>You will be transferred from Position No. 76 in the Legislative Research Service to Position No. 120 and designated as a Special Projects Officer with effect from the commencement of business on Monday 14 April 1980. In that position you will be subject, as at present, to the supervision of the Senior Research Director, Position No. 129. </para>
            <para>Your occupation of that position will remove what would otherwise have been an impediment within present policy to the granting of leave without pay for the one-year Fellowship at Adelaide University which you have told me you are keen to accept if it becomes available. </para>
            <para>Until further notice you will be located in the presently vacant office which is situated within the working area allocated to the Statistics Group in the Parliamentary Annex. </para>
            <para>In your new position you will, of course, continue to have access to the resources of the Library including serials on the distribution list and daily newspapers but not the communications from the Department of Foreign Affairs. </para>
            <para>The duties on which you are to be engaged will be discussed with you as we arranged. You will not undertake duties other than those assigned to you, without the concurrence of the Senior Research Director, and the completion of requests you already had in hand on 2 April 1980. Requests which formerly came to you as Director of the Foreign Affairs Group of the Legislative Research Service are to be handled by the Foreign Affairs Group of the Legislative Research Service according to the usual routine. </para>

            <para class="block">Subject: Proposed transfer to Position No. 76 </para>
            <para>I have now read your letter of 8 April, 1 980. I wish to inform you that I cannot accept the arrangements you have outlined in the letter, nor your presentation of some aspects of the discussion we had on Wednesday 2 April. It was my understanding that the proposal you had in mind would be discussed further on Monday 14 April, yet it is apparent from your letter that you chose to make a decision in the meantime, the consequences of which are clearly serious both for me and for the Parliamentary Library as a whole. I regret to say that I regard your move to make that decision without further negotiation as an abrogation of a verbal agreement. May I remind you that before I left you on 2 April, I had informed you that I was very disturbed at some aspects of the proposal to move me, but that in deference to you I wished to consider it seriously, and to have some days in which to reflect on it before a final decision was made. May I also say that such a procedure is common to most moves of this kind in the public service. It is certainly the case when a disciplinary action is involved, and you will recall that you repeatedly assured me that my transfer was not for disciplinary reasons, and had nothing to do with the issues of East Timor and the so-called &#39;ONA Affair&#39;. </para>
            <para>When I returned from the coast on Tuesday evening my transfer had already become a subject of interest in the press some of whose representatives had already established to their satisfaction that it was being carried out for political reasons. Although you denied this at the time and have since continued to deny it, some of your own remarks during our discussion plus your description of the position I am now listed to occupy, strongly suggest that there are political motives for my removal. May I recall, that in our discussion of the sort of work the new position would entail, you stressed that I would not be permitted to write on East Timor. In your letter, you have specified that in this position, although 1 would continue to have access to the resources of the Library, I would not have access to the communications from the Department of Foreign Affairs. This is to me an extraordinary step to take, particularly as most communications from the Department of Foreign Affairs are unclassified. It is also extraordinaary because this arrangement was in fact negotiated by me some years ago on a personal basis, and at no stage has the Department suggested that it be terminated. </para>
            <para>Your description of the duties of the position in the letter of 8 April differs substantially from the impression I gained at our earlier discussion. It is clear from your letter that I would have limited access, and this limitation, particularly to material from the Department of Foreign Affairs, would limit the scope of my research. Your letter implies that I would not have contact with members of parliament. In effect my long experience in the area of foreign affairs would be completely wasted, and would be irrelevant to the work of the research service, at a time when the Foreign Affairs Group is under greater pressure than ever before in its history. </para>
            <para>Your letter also seriously misrepresents an important aspect of our discussion. In your second paragraph you say that I am to be free from my present responsibilities in response to wishes I had previously expressed to you and others. This is simply untrue. You raised this very matter during our discussion, and I emphatically informed you that I was quite happy with my present position and was content to remain here. I also informed you that at no stage had I hinted that I would like to be replaced as director of the Foreign Affairs Group. What I have said in the past is that all specialists in the Research Service could benefit from a break in their work here. What I envisaged, and indeed proposed, was that officers of this Group from time to time be given the opportunity to spend some months, or perhaps one year, in the Department of Foreign Affairs, or in a university, in order to broaden their experience in foreign affairs work. As you are aware, 1 am the only officer of this group to have served in the Department of Foreign Affairs. I have placed on record my belief that our specialists should develop detailed knowledge of the working of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and of diplomacy in general. Again, however, I must restate the fact that I am quite happy in my present position and 1 have no wish to be relieved of my responsibilities. Your suggestion that this is not the case is therefore grossly inaccurate. </para>
            <para>As for the question of my obtaining a fellowship at the University of Adelaide, as I repeatedly explained to you, a formal offer has not yet been made, and therefore it is not appropriate that this issue be raised at this stage. May I also remind you that at our discussion I expressed my regret that you felt it necessary to remove officers from their positions in the event of their going on leave without pay for a period of one year. You said you favoured the idea of fellowships and other forms of study leave which would be of benefit to the Library, yet how can this benefit be applied if the officer concerned is not able to return to his post? At our discussion, I did say that if it were necessary for me to vacate this position, why could I not retain it until I left for Adelaide. </para>
            <para>It is hardly necessary to say that the events since last Wednesday have caused me and my family considerable distress. I believe that had this matter been handled differently such a situation might never have arisen. What has in fact happened, and emerged from public discussion oft has raised important matters of principle. I thereforew remain in my present post, and to serve the Parliament as have done in the past. If I am in fact offered a fellowship at the University of Adelaide, we will then have an opportunity to renegotiate the circumstances under which I might obtain leave without pay from this Department. </para>

            <para>For sometime I have been concerned at the evidence that there is a need for a code of ethics and/or professional conduct in this Department. Various statements on the subject have been collected and during my recent overseas study tour I discussed the matter of professional conduct of Parliamentary Officers &#39; with a number of people in the Parliamentary Service. In particular, the recent Act was accepted as definitive in Washington, D.C. </para>
            <para>It is clear that the indiscretions of some members of our staff, newspaper publicity in August 1979 about a research paper prepared by the F.I.T.D. Group and other matters have caused some doubts as to the integrity and political objectivity of the Department as a whole. </para>
            <para>There are no sanctions which can be applied against people whose behaviour is questionable in terms of professional practice and while it is true that careful screening at the point of recruitment may prevent later indiscretions this is no solution to the indiscretions of permanent officers already in the Service. </para>
            <para>Today I have told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MacLean, Mr. Lawton</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brudenall</inline> of my concern about this matter and my belief that the time has come for us to provide a statement of acceptable practice and ethics in this Department. This should at least provide the guidelines and be useful in recruitment procedures. It could also demonstrate to others our awareness of the need for desirable standards. </para>
            <para>I have suggested that the best way to handle this may be to set up a working party within the Department to study the matter and to consider the statements of practices and ethics put forward by professional associations and to consider the special circumstances particularly those relating to political objectivity, which should apply in a Department such as this. </para>

Considerable supporting material has been incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Obviously, it is impossible for anyone to comment on it immediately. I trust that the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> will give the Senate the opportunity to debate this material, either later today or tomorrow, if we in the Opposition or the Senate collectively feel that it should be the subject of debate. </para>

            <para>- by leave- The difficulty with debating this matter  today, of course, is that the Estimates committees will sit. Otherwise, I would have been happy to suggest that the matter could be debated at, say, 10 o&#39;clock tonight. However, the Senate will sit at 10.15 p.m. before adjourning. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> were to indicate to me that he wanted to make a statement and if within that compass there were no need for an extensive debate, we could deal with the matter at that time. Alternatively, judging what is required, I will try to fit in a debate at another time, but it will be possible to debate the matter today at 10.15 p.m., perhaps for a quarter of an hour. </para>

            <para>- I suppose that no government is ever wholly satisfied with the state of security. Governments are always keen that matters of security should be strengthened. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> is referring to a matter concerning the Office of National Assessments. As I understand it, the Director-General of ONA invited the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to study the security of ONA and to report upon any weaknesses that might lie there. I am not aware of any suggestion that any definitive defects have been detected in ONA. </para>

I refer the Minister&#39;s attention to a recent report alleging that Western intelligence sources expect the Kremlin to depose Barbrak Karmal, the puppet leader it installed as president of Afghanistan some three months ago, and that his possible successor, it is mooted, will be chosen from a group of Afghanistan leftists recently released from prison in Afghanistan. Can the Minister advise the Senate whether this report is correct? If so, is the Minister aware of the name of the possible successor or his antecedents?

            <para>- I am not aware of the letter that the Minister for Defence has written to the University of New South Wales to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> refers. The Government&#39;s attitude on this matter is known. It is discussing with universities the question of some association between the academy and a university institution as an alternative to the actual establishment of a separate university, as proposed, with the name of Casey University. The Government has made clear its position, that is, it supports the concept of the Australian Defence Force Academy. The Minister made a statement to the Parliament in response to the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Works. No doubt that matter will be the subject of further debate within the party and the Parliament. But as I understand it, the Government is having specific discussions in relation to an association ofthe academy with a university. Presumably the letter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> refers was written in pursuance of that policy. I will refer the question to the Minister for Defence and ask for more specific details in relation to the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline></para>

Did the New South Wales Premier, during his recent trip to the People&#39;s Republic of China, issue a Press release to the effect that Australian oil companies had committed what he called a great error in rejecting the prospect of Chinese oil? Is the Minister aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran&#39;s</inline> claim that, as he put it, he would like to reverse a bad decision of a few years ago, or of his other claim that, in his words, there is the possibility of Chinese oil exports to Australia? Is it a fact that Australian oil companies and the Australian Government have neglected opportunities to import Chinese oil? Is the Minister able to say whether there is a possibility, in the short term, of Chinese oil exports to Australia and whether Chinese oil is suitable for refining and use in Australia in large quantities? In short, I ask whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> has dealt accurately in this matter with the Australian Press and the Australian public? </para>

            <para>- I have read a number of media statements by the New South Wales Premier regarding Chinese oil. The fact is that both the Australian Government and Australian refiners have shown considerable interest over the years in Chinese crude oil. However, of the three types of oil potentially available from China, none is suitable for use in Australian refineries. Taching crude is the only one that is remotely suitable. It produces 40 per cent fuel oil compared with 20 per cent fuel oil from Saudi Arabian light crude and 5 per cent fuel oil from Bass Strait crude. Such a large volume of fuel oil in the Sydney market would be an embarrassment, and substantial volumes would have to be exported. The refinery balance for light products would also be upset, leading to a requirement to import those products in order to meet the market demand. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In summary, Chinese crude oils, which are very waxy, are extremely heavy for the Australian market, with its low demand for fuel oil. Taching crude is solid at room temperature, and investment in handling facilities, which would require two to three years to install, would be very costly. Furthermore, we are advised that Taching crude commands a premium price in Japan, where there is a high demand for fuel oil and where its low sulphur properties are valuable. We are also advised that there is little or no surplus production available in the short term for additional export markets although this will change as the Chinese production facilities increase later in the 1 980s. Whilst the Government would be very pleased to see trade with China increased, the suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> of largescale imports of oil from China does not appear realistic at this stage. The Government, as it has in the past, will keep in touch with China on this matter. We will always be interested to receive any offers of quality oil which can be handled in the refineries at a price suitable to enable the Australian people to get petrol at the very interestingly low price that it is today. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question to the Minister for National Development and Energy by commenting that the Minister will remember conceding to me, in answer to a question, that oil companies were selling petrol in their own outlets at some cents below the price set by the Prices Justification Tribunal. I believe that he also conceded that this practice at least put in doubt the accuracy of the price set by the Prices Justification Tribunal. Because this means that oil companies could be making super profits of several million dollars a month, why did the Minister send telexes to oil companies reminding them to apply to the Prices Justification Tribunal for price rises? How does this fit in with the fight against inflation? To be consistent, will this Minister therefore send telexes to trade union leaders inviting them to apply to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for wage rises when inflation increases as a result? </para>

              <para>-No, the draft legislation has been in circulation, subject to correction, for less than two months. I imagine it is in that order of time. It is true that some oil companies are discounting, probably to a degree that independent operators could not do because they would not be buying the oil wholesale at that price. Having said that I have to say that I did not send a telex inviting the oil companies to approach the Prices Justification Tribunal.

          <para class="block">In other words we had discussed with the companies what we were doing. We had told them that any price rise would be marginal. What my telex said was that any price rise would be so marginal that we suggested that they not approach the PJT now but wait until they have a future reason for approaching the PJT. That is what, in plain words, was said. Some of the oil companies said: &#39;No, we intend to approach the PJT now &#39;. In other words, the reverse of what the media has taken this to mean was done. The Government realised that they had the right to approach the PJT. We suggested that the companies not approach it now but wait until a future opportunity arises. I am bound to say that this matter has been grossly misunderstood. The fact of the matter is, as honourable senators are aware, that there is a report. I would be very happy to have the clear situation exposed to the Senate. I understand from the media that yesterday the PJT- in response. I think, to an approach by BP Australia Ltd- said that the maximum increase would be 0. 1 8 cents for a litre of petrol. </para>
          <para>The fact of the matter is that when the PJT made its decision in January it most heavily overloaded the price of liquefied petroleum gas, thereby virtually subsidising other products. Past figures show that when the price of LPG was $1 1 0 a tonne the price of indigenous oil was $ 1 08 a tonne. When LPG was $147 a tonne indigenous oil was $147 a tonne. However, in January when the PJT virtually doubled the price of LPG to $252 a tonne, it was some 28 per cent higher than the price of indigenous crude which was $196 a tonne. It is now by Government arrangement at $205 a tonne which is a much closer approximation to the figure of $196. This is a very sensible and appropriate arrangement. The Government did not approach the PJT in the terms suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp.</inline></para>

            <para>As you know from recent discussions with departmental officers, the Government has been considering proposals in relation to the pricing of LPG. I appreciate your company&#39;s contribution to those discussions which have helped to provide the Government with valuable information determining a pricing policy for LPG which I shall be announcing today. </para>
            <para>The principal elements of that policy in relation to refinery produced LPG are that: </para>
            <list type="lowerroman">
              <item label="(i)">
                <para>the maximum justified wholesale price for LPG exrefinery gate, at all refineries, for both propane and butane (other than for petrochemical or nontraditional usage), shall be established at a level not exceeding the price at which naturally occurring LPG (other than as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry or in non-traditional industrial uses) will be sold in the domestic market from Long Island Point, that is $205 per tonne. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(ii)">
                <para>future adjustments in the maximum justified wholesale price for both propane and butane, established in accordance with (i) above, will be made in accordance with the percentage increase in the price of indigenous crude oil from the Gippsland fields as announced from time to time by the Minister for National Development and Energy; and </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(iii)">
                <para>the maximum justified wholesale price for both propane and butane established in accordance with (i) and (ii) above shall not exceed the price received by Esso and BHP for the sale by those companies of exported naturally occurring propane. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
            <para>In the context of the pricing policy expressed above, the Government is requesting you to adjust the price of exrefinery LPG with effect from tomorrow, 9 April 1980, to $205 per tonne ex-refinery gate. A similar request is being made to the producers of naturally occurring LPG in respect ofthe Long Island Point price. </para>
            <para>I understand that your company may wish to approach the PJT to have compensatory adjustments made to the prices of other petroleum products which you produce. I expect such adjustments will be marginal and, in those circumstances, your company may wish to approach the PJT at a convenient time in the future when other cost claims might be made. </para>
            <para>An appropriate directive to the PJT will be made by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, stating the pricing policy the Government is adopting. </para>

              <para>- I would be very happy to table it. In fact, I will get copies made of it if that is desired. Over the course of the past three or four weeks considerable discussions have taken place with the whole of the oil industry, including the producers at Cooper Basin and Bass Strait and the refiners, regarding LPG. This telex contains the final resolution. I am bound to say that the companies had been informed of our proposals and had the opportunity to comment on them prior to my sending the telex. But it is indeed a frank statement of the discussions and the dialogue with the companies. </para>

            <para>- During the discussions with the companies on the implementation of this matter a number of companies indicated to officers of my Department that if we took the steps that we did take they would approach the Prices Justification Tribunal to get a determination on the matter. With that knowledge, I indicated to them in my reply that I understood that that may be their intention but I suggested to them that they may in fact defer that approach until they had more substantial reason to go to the PJT. My judgment on that matter was impeccable. There is no substantial reason to go to the PJT when the PJT grants a maximum rise of 0. 18c a litre. That, of course, is not of substance at all. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate who will recall that on 6 March 1 980 1 directed to him a question about the Parliamentary Library research staff arising from the criteria laid down by the Prime Minister following the removal of the two officers from the Office of National Assessments. I put the question to the Minister that there was some suspicion that parliamentary research officers could be inhibited by not being given access to special information which could be transferred and advised to members of Parliament. The Minister will recall that he promised to discuss the matter and to clarify it with the Prime Minister. He expressed the view that he understood that that flow of information would not be disturbed. In view of the publicity, too, about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunn,</inline> I wonder whether the Leader of the Government in the Senate has yet had an occasion to discuss this matter and whether there is any suspicion that our research officers of the library will not be able to give the best advice to members of the Parliament and to the committees. </para>

            <para>- What I did initially was to assure myself that there was no apparent inhibition upon the flow of basic information to research officers and therefore to parliamentarians, but I did not have the time to probe the matter in greater depth than that. I acknowledge now that events of recent days and weeks may make the question even more relevant. May I take the question on notice on that basis and see whether I can get further in-depth information? </para>

As the honourable senator would be aware, several meetings were organised by a task force from my Department which were attended by many Aboriginal individuals representing many Aboriginal organisations. The most substantial suggestions which have been put forward came from the National Aboriginal Conference and the Council for Aboriginal Development, although substantial suggestion? were also made by other individuals and organisations. I would expect to be advising the Senate within the next week or so of the changes which the Government proposes to make to the Bill following those consultations. </para>

I refer to the Police Act Amendment Bill 1980 recently passed by the Queensland Parliament, a copy of which I have drawn to the attention of the Attorney-General. Is the Minister aware that under clause 4 of that Bill, the Queensland Government may appoint persons employed by the Commonwealth as special constables and that they will have the power to exercise the full rights of ordinary police officers? Is the Minister also aware that under section 69C of the amending legislation, information may be disclosed to Commonwealth Government departments that may well either violate the privacy of individuals whose personal details are included in police files, or be libellous in its content? Is it correct that the Queensland Bar Association, the Queensland Law Society and civil liberties bodies have strongly criticised the legislation? Will the Minister comment on these provisions and, in particular, the implications which they have for the rights and civil liberties of citizens living in Queensland? Will the Attorney-General assure the Senate that Commonwealth employees will not be permitted to exercise such powers that could defeat the privacy and liberty of the individual citizen? </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Missen</inline>has drawn my attention only recently to the Police Act Amendment Bill passed recently by the Queensland Parliament. The particular clauses to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> refers are those dealing with the appointment of Commonwealth officers as special constables and the disclosure of information to Commonwealth departments under another clause of the Bill. I have not had the opportunity to consider in any depth the matters to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> refers. The appointment of Commonwealth officers as special constables under State legislation is by no means novel. It has been done in New South Wales. The point about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> is concerned is the nature of the powers that special constables would have under this legislation. I appreciate that that is the real concern as is also the question of disclosure of material to Commonwealth Government departments. The matters that the honourable senator raises are serious ones. They need to be given a good deal more attention than I have been able to give them since he drew them to my attention. I will certainly undertake to do this as soon as possible. </para>

Is it also a fact that almost 400 meat workers have been sacked from the meatworks of Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Australasia) Ltd in Portland, Victoria over the last four weeks, including 40 yesterday? Did ships carrying 132,000 live sheep leave the port of Portland in recent days destined for Iran? Has the management of the Borthwick company at Portland given as the reason for the sacking of workers the shortage of sheep for killing?

The Government is most concerned that the slaughter industry in Australia should be maintained and expanded. It constantly keeps this matter before it in consideration of live sheep exports. There has been an undertaking to achieve a certain balance between live sheep exports and the slaughtering of sheep in Australia. That is the Government&#39;s view and its objective. I shall refer the question to the appropriate Minister and supply him with an answer. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, follows the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley.</inline> Is it not a fact that in the case of social security recipients, where overpayments are made by government mistake, recovery of those payments is also made, if necessary taking people to the courts to obtain those recoveries? Can the Minister explain to us what the difference is between the case of the chemists who were overpaid some $253m by government mistake and the case of age and invalid pensioners and unemployment beneficiaries who also sometimes receive overpayments through government mistake and yet are pursued to the courts? </para>

              <para>-I do not want to go into detail on a matter that is the province of my colleague the Minister for Health, as I referred to his earlier statement on this matter. However, I did say on his behalf that the amounts which can be termed overpayments by some with regard to pharmacists are not amounts that are legally recoverable. It is not a matter that is able to be pursued because it was the subject of an agreement or an arrangement between the Government and chemists. We could pursue the matter that the agreement was inaccurately based because of the error that occurred in 1974 in the compilation of the base on which those payments were made. </para>
            </talk.start>
          <para>The overpayments which are made in the course of social security payments under the Act and for which legal entitlement can be determined are a different matter. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> would be aware, in some cases where overpayments have occurred as a result of departmental error, recovery is not pursued. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> has been successful in pursuing some of those matters on behalf of constituents. I think I should refer the Senate again to the statement of the Minister for Health, which sets out in sequence the events which led to the discussion on the payments made to pharmacies. I restate that anything that could be regarded by some as an overpayment during the years since 1974 is not legally recoverable. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. During the proceedings in the Senate on Wednesday, 2 April, I raised some matters of concern in the area of social security. One of those matters concerned the practice of her Department in withdrawing money from pensioners&#39; bank accounts because of overpayments. This has led to an amount in excess of the overpayment being withdrawn. The other matter concerned occasions when officers of the Department have, without the knowledge of pensioners, broken into safety deposit boxes, inspected the contents and left the boxes broken and open. Will the Minister comment on the legality of these practices? Does the Minister approve of them? Will they continue? Will compensation be paid to the people involved? </para>

          <para class="block">My attention was drawn to the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> on 2 April. I asked the Victorian office of my Department to get from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> &#39;s office details of the pensioners who were aggrieved in the way she mentioned. I understand that my Department is still waiting for that information so that we may ascertain whether there is some explanation for what has been related to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer.</inline> It is not the practice of my Department to follow the procedures outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer.</inline> There is no authority under the Social Services Act for any officer of my Department to break open a safety deposit box. I would be surprised if any bank manager would permit an officer of my Department to have access which would enable the officer to open a safety deposit box. I have asked for the details to see whether we can determine what occurred in this instance. </para>
          <para>With regard to the matter raised concerning withdrawals from bank accounts, I think that in order to make this matter fully clear I ought to have leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the relevant instructions from the Department&#39;s manual and also to draw attention to the amendment to the Social Services Act that was introduced in 1 974 by the then Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden.</inline> That was an amendment to the Act which enabled payments to be made into a person&#39;s bank account and also enabled payments to be withdrawn from a person&#39;s bank account. The authority to recover an overpayment from a credit balance in a bank account was inserted in 1974. This method generally arises when payments have been credited to an account following the death of a pensioner, for instance. It would be unusual for those provisions to be used to recover overpayments arising from other causes. </para>
          <para>Whilst the Social Services Act does provide authority for the recovery of pension overpayments from bank accounts, this method is used only when alternative means of recoveryfor example, cash refunds or withholding money from future benefits or pensions- are not available, or when such means would cause distress or inconvenience to the pensioner concerned. Recovery from savings bank accounts is not sought in any case when credits already have been entered into the pass book. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the relevant section of the Social Services Act and an extract from the manual of the Department of Social Security, which clearly show that the procedure  outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> was a departure from the administrative practices of the Department. </para>

Is the Minister in a position to indicate what is the present stage of development of a new terminal building for the Darwin Airport? When is it planned to take the matter to a public hearing and what is the probable planned date for the commencement and completion of the project? Having in mind the expressed wish of the people of the northern suburbs of Darwin who live north of McMillans Road that they be not exposed unduly to aircraft noise, will the Federal Government inquire into the matter or accept a proposal to build the terminal on the Winnellie side of the airport which would facilitate the servicing of the proposed new terminal and would give vehicular traffic access to the </para>

            <para>-Senator Kilgariff has raised in the Senate before questions relating to the Darwin Airport. I think most honourable senators would be familiar with the evident inadequacies of that airport as far as civilian traffic is concerned. I think many honourable senators would be aware also that the matter of improving the airport is complicated by the fact that it is both a civil and a military airport. It was in the latter half of last year that the Department of Defence, following a review of defence planning, decided that the area which currently is used for civil aviation would be required for defence needs by 1985. Consequent upon that decision, the Department of Transport is now actively planning for the relocation of the civil terminal. It is a fairly large project. As suggested in the question asked by the honourable senator, there will have to be detailed investigation into alternative schemes before the final plans can be submitted to government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is expected that the work will continue throughout the remainder of this year, leading to a firm proposal to government in the first half of 198 1. Discussion of the project is continuing with the appropriate departments of the Territory. When preliminary proposals are formulated they will be open for public scrutiny and comment. The final proposal will be subject to the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. The Government will refer the proposal to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for public examination. Although the details cannot be fully known at this stage, as I indicated previously, it is expected that the program will be complete by 1985. </para>
          <para>The honourable senator also raised the question of building the terminal on the Winnellie side of the airport. The Department of Defence plans to develop the whole of the area to the south of the main runway. Therefore, it is not available for civil aviation development. A civil terminal on the Winnellie side would simply increase the existing difficulty where the military use is split. It would cause problems of control and security. For those reasons and also for safety reasons, civil aircraft operations and public areas will not be located adjacent to aprons where military aircraft are operating. My advice from the Department is that aircraft noise effects are being given very careful consideration in the review of possible sites. There is a problem of aircraft landing and taking off rather than of aircraft using taxiways. But the selection of a site and the design of facilities will be such as to minimise the noise impact consistent with other constraints. </para>

The Law Reform Commission in its report entitled &#39;Unfair publication: Defamation and privacy&#39; dealt with some aspects of privacy but not with the general aspects to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neal</inline> has referred. It also dealt with some privacy aspects in its report entitled &#39;Privacy and the Census&#39; which was tabled in the Senate on 15 November 1 979.

          <para>My Department has been very conscious of the needs of the residents of the hostel and has maintained very close liaison to ensure that they will not be seriously disadvantaged by its impending closure.

In respect of one aspect of the questions, the issue of leave without pay for extended periods at the present time presents major difficulties to any department. It raises the question of staff numbers and so on, and is a difficult matter to get around. I should like to look at the other questions more closely, and I will give the honourable senator an answer as soon as I can. </para>

            <para>- Earlier today I was asked a question about Cuban refugees in the Peruvian Embassy. It has been indicated to me that the Department of Foreign Affairs is monitoring the situation of the Cubans who sought refuge in the Peruvian Embassy in Havana. Although estimates vary, the Peruvian Governments has said that 10,800 Cubans are seeking entry to Peru. The Peruvian Government has consulted its Andean Pact partners about the situation. It is understood that some of these partners in Spain and the United States have offered to assist in resettling the people concerned. The Government has received an approach from the Peruvian Foreign Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arturo</inline> Garcia, asking that Australia also resettle some of these people. The Peruvian Charge has also made representations to the Department of Foreign Affairs. In addition, the Intergovernmental Committee on European Migration, on which Australia has observer status, has made a similar request and has sought financial assistance for this purpose. The Government is conscious of the urgent humanitarian situation that exists. The Department of Foreign Affairs, together with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, is examining these requests with a view to determining a response as quickly as possible. </para>

The Minister for Post and Telecommunications has received a large number of representations on this matter and is very much aware of the concern expressed by many of the organisations to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> referred. The Minister has in fact had meetings on this matter with several associations. Because of the obvious concern in the community on this matter the Minister asked his Department to finalise urgently the review which was being undertaken into the restructuring of radiocommunications licence fees. It is proposed to offer significant relief to many organisations in this area and a submission for the Government&#39;s consideration is presently being finalised. The matter is being handled expeditiously and an announcement will be made as soon as decisions are made. </para>

          <para>- by leave- As honourable senators are aware we are  starting three weeks of sittings after which two sitting weeks will remain before the winter break. Today, on Thursday and on Monday next the Senate will adjourn during the day so that Estimates committees can meet. Consequently, there are tight constraints on the time available to complete the Government&#39;s program. I have had prepared and am circulating for the information of all honourable senators the proposed program of legislation for these three weeks. I should mention also that some 30 Bills will remain for consideration during the last two weeks of the sittings. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Whilst the Government is confident that the program can be achieved, it is clear that orderly progress will be necessary week by week. If there are delays it may be necessary for the Senate to sit on the following additional days: Monday, 28 April, Friday, 16 May and also Friday, 23 May if business is not completed on the previous day. These additional days would provide the equivalent of an extra sitting week. I also propose that Government Business should take precedence over General Business on Thursday, 1 5 May and Thursday, 22 May. I now invite the goodwill and co-operation of all honourable senators in achieving the program in an orderly way so that we may all give due attention to matters of interest to honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. </para>

            <para>- I wish to speak very briefly tonight ona matter which I raised in a question I asked this afternoon in the Senate relating to the Darwin Airport. When one speaks about airports in the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Northern Territory and air schedules one could go further and discuss the two-airline agreement and the scheduling of aircraft which creates overcrowding of air terminals, particularly in Alice Springs and Darwin. One could discuss also the way in which aircraft are re-scheduled at night, particularly on long weekends, to the discomfort of the people of the Northern Territory. However, discussion of those aspects must wait until later in the week. This afternoon I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> as Minister representing the Minister for Transport, a question regarding the proposed Darwin Airport terminal because of leaflets which are being put in mail boxes on the northern side of McMillans Road- in the northern suburbs of Darwin. Those leaflets have caused considerable concern among the people living in that area. I suggest that prior to those leaflets being placed in the mail boxes little concern was felt about this matter because people believed, as they should believe, that they would be given a fair go, that they would be consulted and would be allowed to express their views. </para>
          <para>However, the placing of those leaflets in mail boxes has caused very great concern because they charge the Government with having done nothing other than to break promises and to do certain things which will bring about the construction of a new airport terminal in Darwin which will not be beneficial to the people but will create an extreme noise nuisance. The leaflet makes the following charges: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Noise levels will be intolerable- there will be no night curfew as applies in Sydney and Brisbane - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That bit about night curfews is true-  and with more tourist flights expected in future the noise from planes landing, taxiing and taking off will increase dramatically. </para>
          <para>There will be greatly increased traffic on roads near the new Terminal and again this will add to the noise level. </para>
          <para>The noise will affect people&#39;s lifestyles, the area will become a less desirable place in which to live, and property values will drop considerably. </para>
          <para class="block">So it goes on. In fairness to the people of the northern suburbs of Darwin, this afternoon I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> as Minister representing the Minister for Transport, what the situation was with regard to the proposed new Darwin Airport terminal, which is much needed. The old terminal was constructed prior to the Second World War. It was damaged during that War and it was damaged by Cyclone Tracy. All in all, it is a most unfit place to act as the front door to Australia for passengers arriving by air from overseas. I asked the Minister what the situation was with regard to the proposed new terminal, what stage the planning had reached and whether it was intended to take those plans to a public hearing. The Minister indicated in his reply that discussion on the project was continuing with the appropriate departments of the Territory, bearing in mind that it was a Federal responsibility, involving the Department of Defence and the Department of Transport, not the Northern Territory Government. He indicated too that the final proposals will be subject to the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and that the Government will refer proposals to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for examination. </para>
          <para>I suggest that the people of the northern suburbs of Darwin have three forms of protection which have not been outlined in the leaflet. First of all, the preliminary proposals will be open to public scrutiny. Secondly, the final proposals will be subject to the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. Thirdly, the proposals will go before the Public Works Committee, which will review the plans for the proposed new terminal. I ask the Government to come out and reassure the people of the northern suburbs of Darwin that what they are being told is completely misleading. It is causing them concern when there should be no concern. </para>
          <para>In closing, I add one point concerning the siting of the proposed new terminal. I suggest that the authorities concerned should look very closely at the situation. I see no reason for siting the proposed new terminal in alignment with McMillan&#39;s Road on the northern suburbs side of Darwin. It would be well suited to siting further down the runway on the Winnellie side, the Stuart Highway side, of Darwin, where it would have access to the facilities of Stuart Highway, would be closer to the city of Darwin and servicing would be much more convenient. </para>

I am well aware that my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne, knows the district quite well because he worked in that area for many years. I wish to outline how the local residents feel about the possibility of losing their post office. I shall quote parts of a letter I received from a person at Hungerford, in which she stated: </para>

            <para>These were the two choices we were given even though one of the local people asked &#34;Why couldn&#39;t we have 24 hours telephone service and a Post Office?&#34; The reply from the government representatives was that this was not possible and if a vote was taken, it would be an unanimous decision. </para>

            <para>I call upon you, sir, in your capacity as a parliamentary member and a representative of the people to protest about unfairness of our proposed situation. Even if Telecom does put in 24 hours telephone service, then there is no reason why we should lose the post office after 1 1 2 years. We have just taken one step forward and that is the connection of rural power. Why should we step back by losing our post office? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Although this may be a very small matter to some people, it is a large matter to the people of Hungerford. I made certain inquiries about it, and in a reply I received from an officer of the Australian Postal Commission it was stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Telecom Australia will be converting the telephone exchange to a remotely controlled electronic exchange this month and the Postmaster has tendered his resignation effective from 30 April 1980. The Post Office will then be closed and a community mail agent will be appointed to distribute mail to the community. The agent will also be licensed to sell stamps. </para>
            <para>Whilst I appreciate local residents may feel a sense of loss when a facility to which they have been accustomed is removed, it is considered that the arrangements made at Hungerford should involve little inconvenience for residents. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There will be some inconvenience to residents. Apparently they will still be able to buy postage stamps from a person who is licensed to sell them. Apparently mail will be distributed through a community mail bag. But these people will not have banking facilities with the Commonwealth Savings Bank and they will not be able to obtain a money order if they wish to do so. A definite vacuum will be caused by the removal of the post office in Hungerford. I must say in fairness that a reason was given to me in the letter from Australia Post as to why the post office might be closed. Part of the letter stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Under the terms ofthe Postal Services Act 1975 Australia Post is required to price its services so as to recover all of its operating costs and at least half of its capital expenditure from revenue. Against this background Australia Post is continually reviewing its services and methods of operation to ensure that the facilities provided are adequate to meet the reasonable needs of the community and that the resources available are used to the best advantage. These reviews have resulted in the closure of post offices where little use was being made of the facilities and where satisfactory arrangements could be made for the distribution of mail. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Against the background of the possibility of Hungerford losing its post office, I came into Parliament House this week and was absolutely amazed when I went down to our own post office in Parliament House and found that it is now an agent for Lotto. For those who are not aware of what Lotto is- I imagine that some of my constituents in Queensland will not be- it is a type of lottery, or what we in Queensland call the Golden Casket. Where are our priorities? After 112 years Hungerford will lose its post office. After 53 years we in Parliament House, through our post office, will have an agency for Lotto. </para>

I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> that he make available to the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt),</inline> a copy of the circular so that additional information beyond that which I was able to provide at Question Time might be provided to him. The Minister may think it necessary to give some reply to the pamphlet after he has seen it. I note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> in his speech this evening isolated the protection the community already has against anything which might be to its detriment with respect to the development of the airport.  His  comments no doubt will ease the fears of his constituents. </para>

          <para>I note the concern <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> expressed on behalf of the citizens of Hungerford about the possible loss of their post office. As I keep repeating in this place on behalf of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, following the reforms instituted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> the Australian Postal Commission is an independent statutory authority and is not subject to direction on these matters. However, I am sure that the Minister would be prepared to ask the Postal Commission to examine the matters which have been raised by the honourable senator. I refer to the point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> with respect to the provision of an agency for Lotto in the Parliament House post office. That innovation was probably directed by the Postal Commission towards enabling it to provide a broader service throughout the remoter parts of Australia. I have little doubt that it is trying to reduce its costs and increase its income, thereby ensuring its ability to provide better services to areas of Australia which are extremely expensive to service in the traditional way. </para>
          <para>The matter <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> has raised is no doubt a matter of very great importance to the citizens of Hungerford. I have heard similar representations from citizens in other small and remote communities in Australia, and I can understand what brought the honourable senator to put the matter before the Senate. I will refer the matter to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, who I am sure in turn will refer it to the Postal Commission. I thank both honourable senators for bringing before the Senate matters which are obviously of concern to their constituents. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I refer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> to my personal reply to him of 23 January 1980. This reply was as follows: </para>
            <para>I refer to a parliamentary question without notice asked by you and directed to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> on 20 September 1979 and your subsequent question on notice of 22 November 1979, concerning the Government&#39;s decision to discontinue deducting union dues from the salaries of members of the Australian Public Service Association (Fourth Division Officers) APSA(FDO). </para>
            <para>Firstly, may 1 apologise for the delay in responding to this question. </para>
            <para>I confirm that the Government is not providing an automatic payroll deduction facility in respect of the union dues of Commonwealth Public Service Act employees who are members of the Association to which you referred. </para>
            <para>As you are aware, an industrial campaign had been waged by APSA(FDO) and the Administrative and Clerical Officers &#39; Association which frustrated the process of Government and severely disrupted some departmental operations. A direction by the  Deputy  Public Service Arbitrator to lift bans was not complied with and the unions did not heed a Government warning that deductions would cease where unions engaged in disruptive industrial action of the type then being pursued by the two associations. In such circumstances the Government was left with no choice but to take firm action. </para>
            <para>Approaches have since been made to Government by the Council of Australian Government Employment Organisations and the ACOA seeking restoration of the deduction facility. </para>
            <para>Following consideration of those approaches, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters wrote to CAGEO and ACOA on 18 October 1979 and informed those organisations that the Government had decided not to accede to those requests. </para>
            <para>Finally I have written to the ACTU, CAGEO and CPA informing them of the Government&#39;s preparedness to take similar action in response to future strikes or disruptive industrial action in Commonwealth Government employment. </para>

              <para>1 ) Fluorocarbons are used in the heat exchange mechanisms of air conditioning and refrigeration systems. In particular, the chlorofluoromethane chemical species referred to as F. 1 1 and F. 12, which are used extensively as propellants in aerosol sprays, are both also used in heat exchange mechanisms. F. 12 is used predominantly in mobile air conditioning systems and in residential refrigeration. F. 1 1 is used to a lesser extent than F. 12, primarily in some commercial air conditioning. Apart from use in such heat exchange systems, and as propellants in aerosol sprays, the most significant use of these chemicals is as blowing agents in the production of plastic foams. To a minor extent they are used for liquid fast freezing and in some chemical sterilisation procedures. Related chemicals are used as solvents for degreasing, cleaning and drying, and for solder flux removal. It is the chlorofluoromethane species, F. 1 1 and F. 12 in particular, which have been of concern as a possible cause of atmospheric ozone depletion. </para>

              <para>Australian market surveys indicate that during 1978 the consumption of F. II and F. 12 was approximately 8500 tonnes in aerosol sprays, 2500 tonnes in refrigeration and air conditioning units, 2000 tonnes for plastic foam production. </para>

              <para>1 ) A vast amount of research has been carried out on the chemicals 2,4,5- T and 2,4- D. This has been done over many years and all available data has been reviewed by the National Health and Medical Research Council (N.H. &#38; M.R.C.) on several occasions. The most recent intensive study by a specially convened Working Party was made in June 1979. It must be accepted that many substances have the potential for causing birth defects if improperly used during pregnancy. The investigations, however, which were done by the N.H. &#38; M.R.C. showed that there was no evidence that either of the substances referred to, when used according to responsible agricultural practice, resulted in birth defects. </para>

              <para>The dioxin (Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) TCDD is present in 2,4,5- T in minute amounts. State and Territory legislation in Australia stipulates an upper limit of 0. 1 parts per million (ppm) and checks have demonstrated that average levels are well below this limit. Such low levels are not considered to be a health hazard when 2,4,5- T is used according to accepted practice. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Levels of TCDD in agent orange have been reported to have averaged around 2 ppm but sometimes to have approached possibly 50 ppm. I am unaware that levels as high as 5 parts per thousand (or 5000 ppm), as referred to in the question, have ever been previously suggested. Health effects associated with TCDD have been demonstrated in humans exposed to unusually high concentrations. This has occasionally been reported in the past when unacceptably high levels have occurred during various manufacturing processes, not exclusively related to 2,4,5- T production, or following industrial accidents. The health risk is determined not only by the concentration of dioxin and total quantity present in a formulation but also by the duration of exposure, and the mode of absorption. The range of dioxin concentrations in agent orange as manufactured appears to have been subject to marked variation and the subsequent methods of product dilution may also have varied. Consequently it is not possible to give a precise answer to the question. At the same time it must be stressed that the permitted level of dioxin in Australia of 0. 1 ppm allows for a very wide margin of safety. </para>

            <para>The figures quoted in the honourable Senator&#39;s question are compatible with those held by the Government. I am informed, however, that while the figures give some indication of the relative stages of development of these two economies, some of the statistical items chosen for this purpose do not provide an adequate comparison. </para>
            <para>The first two figures listed in the honourable Senator&#39;s question, relating to per capita income in the PRC, are misleading in that they exclude income from the services sector (accounting for up to one-third of total income). In addition, those figures relating to food consumption and calorie and protein intake in the PRC are likely to understate the true position, in that a significant proportion of food production for personal consumption goes unrecorded. Finally, the last two statistics relating to the distribution of television sets and motor cars in the PRC and Taiwan, while accurate, are not very meaningful, given the industrial and consumer policies pursued by the Chinese Government since 1 949. </para>

            <para>The following information has been provided by the Reserve Bank of Australia: </para>
            <para>The Reserve Bank appreciated the constructive suggestion ofthe Ombudsman and has been giving it careful consideration. Since the episode to which the Ombudsman referred, the Bank has introduced a new centralised system of handling documents in Sydney, without receipts. The Bank has also instituted a program of returning approved exchange control applications against bulk receipts in Melbourne, where the volume of traffic is much smaller. </para>
            <para>Experience is that even a simple system of receipts, to be of some effectiveness, incurs expense in use of resources. While the Bank has not yet decided future arrangements on the basis of this experience, its preliminary assessment and its general experience in administration of exchange control over a long period points to the view that the expense of a system of receipts over the whole range of exchange control approvals would not be justified. </para>

            <para>The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that, in the case mentioned by the Ombudsman, the taxpayer had lodged his income tax return at a branch office after moving from interstate. Shortly after lodging the return he advised the branch office of a further change of address. </para>
            <para>At that time a manually kept register of returns lodged by taxpayers for the first time with the branch office had not been updated because of other demands imposed during the peak of the refund-issuing season. This inability to keep the registers up to date resulted in the assessment notice and refund cheque being forwarded to the taxpayer at the address shown in his income tax return. The notice and cheque were returned unclaimed before the register had been brought up to date with the result that follow-up action to issue a fresh cheque to the correct address was frustrated. The manuallykept registers have since been replaced by microfiche copies produced by computer. These copies are now updated each week. The Commissioner considers that this change in procedures should prevent a repetition of the circumstances reported by the Ombudsman. </para>

Statistics in relation to Tasmania are excluded for all months and the data for October also exclude Victoria. Difficulties have been experienced in extracting statistical data on terminated cases from the computer masterfile. The vetting and validating ofthe information is currently being undertaken and the collections must be regarded as being only in the development stage. Some preliminary data on the matters you have raised are shown in the following tables. The reasons given for termination of benefit in Table 2 are broad since detailed data on the precise reasons for terminations are not reliable. The quality of data should improve with the progressive introduction of the new national benefit system covering the ADP processing and payment system for unemployment sickness and special benefits. The new system is intended to be introduced initially with South Australia commencing in April 1980. </para>
