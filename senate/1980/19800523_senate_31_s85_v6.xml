            <para class="block">To the Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate of the Parliament of Australia Assembled. </para>
            <para>The undersigned citizen of Australia, representing the Australian Legal Workers Group, respectfully showeth: </para>
            <para>Since the effective abandonment of the Australian Legal Aid Office in Western Australia and the transfer of responsibility for legal aid to the Western Australian Legal Aid Commission, legal aid is often denied to poor persons on trial of serious crimes. </para>
            <para>On 18 October 1978, Brian Mclnnis of  Her  Majesty's Prison, Fremantle, was tried in the Supreme Court of Western Australia on a charge, the penalty for which is a maximum of life imprisonment. He could not afford a lawyer, his application for legal aid was rejected and he was forced to trial with almost no notice that he would be unrepresented. The circumstances are set out in Mclnnis v The Queen in the March issue of the Australian Law Journal reports. He was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment which he is now serving. </para>
            <para>In Western Australia, denial of legal representation in very serious criminal cases is not unusual, as the Crown counsel informed the High Court. It also occurs in other States. This means that Australia is violating universally accepted fundamental standards ofjustice and the rule of law. </para>
            <para>Your petitioner therefore humbly prays that the Senate refer this petition to the Standing Committee on Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report on whether the universal standards of justice are being observed in Western Australia in regard to provision of legal aid for poor persons on serious criminal charges; if not, why there is no judicial remedy; and what measures the Commonwealth alone or in co-operation with the States take to ensure that the universal standards are observed. </para>

It gives some very interesting information. For those who cannot or will not read, may I give some indicators. On long term investment and anticipations data made by the Australian Statistician, there is a very strong growth in business investment in 1980-81.

According to the labour force survey, April was the sixth successive month in which the levels and rates of unemployment for both the total full time labour forces were below those recorded in the corresponding month a year earlier.

The tap system for issuing of Commonwealth bonds commenced on 30 April, and there have been large sales of the medium term tap stock. A record trade surplus led to the virtual elimination of the current account deficit in April, notwithstanding a large net invisible deficit. The facts are overwhelmingly pointing to a very strong and vigorous economy. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Education. By way of preface I inform the Minister that the Preston Institute of Technology will be interested in the answer to this question. A course for chiropractors is conducted at that institute. Five States now require chiropractors to be registered. I refer the Minister to the fact also that they have to pay fees approximating $2,500 a year for a four-year course. I ask the Minister: What steps, if any, are being taken to obtain approval from the Tertiary Education Commission as a matter of urgency in order to avoid the rather discriminatory treatment presently placed upon students of chiropractic and the profession of chiropractic and in order to avoid the danger that students will not even be able to complete their courses because of high fees? </para>

            <para>-I do not know that I undertook to do so. I said that it was my intention to do so and that I certainly hoped to do so. There should be an understanding in the Senate of the problems of government and the manifold problems that there are, particularly at the end of the session. Many questions have to be dealt with by the Government. This is a very major recommendation by the Committee. I think that over 100 recommendations have been made. They go to the whole framework and basis of freedom of information concepts. <inline font-weight="bold">Major questions</inline> have to be resolved. I would not expect either the Senate or the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee to want a response which was not fully considered and which did not deal fully with every aspect of the report.

        <para>It is a major report and I think it deserves a major, careful and detailed response. It has not been possible to achieve that in recent weeks, since the Government has had my submission before it. I must also confess that my absence overseas for three weeks has contributed to the delay. The fact of the matter is that the Government has made very substantial progress with the consideration of the report. Until the beginning of this week I had hoped that it would be possible to make the response this sitting. I think that that work will now be completed by the Government within the next few weeks. I will certainly undertake to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> that a response will not be made until the Parliament reassembles for the Budget session and that it will be made in the Senate and to the Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> raised another matter about which he asked me a question some days ago. He made an interesting suggestion which I have noted. I have not yet pursued it because, as I said, I was hoping that an official response would be made during this session. I think one must bear in mind that a delay of only a few weeks over the recess is involved. I certainly intend to give further consideration to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> 's proposal. </para>

            <para>- Clearly there are some signs of instability at both the political level and the social level in South Korea. As can be seen from the news, there is clearly some significant instability in one city. I cannot say what that means in toto, over the whole nation. I do not think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> inferred that it could be said to refer to the whole nation. That will take some assessment. It is quite clear that ever since the assassination of  President  Park there has been a significant degree of instability in South Korea. That is a matter of assessment. I cannot make a prognosis as to whether the nation will remain destabilised or whether it will find unity for the future. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to the purport of his question, which is whether we regard the nation as being one to which we should sell uranium, I say that when we sell uranium we sell it under the strictest nonproliferation conditions and supervision. Therefore, we sell it only to those nations that are parties in good standing to the Treaty on Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Of course, that Treaty has been accepted up to now by the Republic of Korea. Australia and Korea signed a bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement on 2 May last year, which incorporated all the requirements of the Australian Government's stringent nuclear safeguards policy. In tabling that agreement in the Parliament the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that its conclusion provided a basis for shipment of Australian uranium to the Republic of Korea under commercial contracts. The fact of the matter is that no one can say whether any nation with which one trades will continue to be stable a few months later. For example, we saw the destabilisation of the ministry in Japan only recently. The fact is that Australia will pursue stringently all the elements of the non-proliferation pact. If any nation changes its structure or conditions and cannot adhere to that pact, of course the trade will not persist. </para>

In view of the fact that in fiscal year 1 979-80 expenditure on education is estimated to be 8 per cent of Budget outlays and is exeeded only by payments to the States and expenditure on social security, health and defence, can the Minister indicate whether there is any validity in claims that the Commonwealth Government is avoiding its commitment to education? </para>

          <para class="block">Commission set up targets to be achieved years ahead and that, in fact, under the funding of this Government the targets were achieved two or three years ahead of the specified time. So the funding by the Commonwealth has surpassed the targets set. I make only one qualification; that is, that the progress made by the non-government sector, having 90 per cent of its schools in a sub-economic sector, has lagged, although under this Government the gap has narrowed. There is every need, as the Schools Commission indicates, to narrow that gap. Indeed, the guidelines that have been pursued are doing that. There is every reason to believe that the funding by both State and Federal governments, taken together, has produced a major and most rapid reform in Australia in the volume of money flowing to schools. What is in question is whether, qualitatively, the processes being pursued throughout Australia in different ways are as realistic and as valuable as they might be. There are two elements to education: The volume of money and the quality of the resources, both the human and the physical resouces, applied. A great deal of soul-searching has been done in recent years to get qualitative reforms. This Government, through the Williams Committee and other sources, is pursuing those reforms. </para>

I cannot answer the question about what information has been distributed to make this fact known, although there has been a lot of public comment about the appeals system and it should be known fairly widely. I will inquire whether fuller information should be made available. </para>

As I said, I cannot say how widely the matter has been publicised, other than in the publicity given to statements that have been made by the Minister and me.

            <para>-I am aware that the independent operators of service stations have expressed considerable concern at what they regard as the deteriorating conditions of trade arising out of their relationship with the oil companies and their claim that they are discriminated against as between their franchise and that of the commission agents who operate oil company sites. I am acutely aware of that situation and that matter has been under intense examination over a period of months. That examination resulted in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> rightly calls the Fife package. It resulted in the emergence of a draft Bill on franchise, which has been circulated. The public discussion on that Bill and the response from the operators and others will be of enormous value to the Government in formulating its policies. So a great deal has been done already in seeking information and in the movement towards positive measures. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are two other matters that the operators claim need attention prior to any policy formation. One is their claim of price discrimination; their claim that the wholesale price and conditions of sale to them by the oil companies are detrimental to them compared with the conditions of wholesale supply to commission agents. The other factor is their claim that unless there is divorcement by the oil companies this matter will not be resolved. These are major matters that need the most careful attention. </para>
          <para>The Government has indicated that it is awaiting keenly the report of the Trade Practices Commission on this whole matter. My understanding is that the Trade Practices Commission will be reporting in a week or two. The Government will have that report before it and it will put it under study. We will have the evidence that the Commission has been able to get from discussions on the franchise Bill and from other discussions, and then the Government will be in a position to formulate its future policies. I make it perfectly clear that the Government is giving very great attention and concentration to what is a difficult and very complex problem indeed. </para>

Has the Minister frequently stated the Government 's view that correct prices are the basis for a national energy policy? Does his Government's failure even to keep itself informed on electricity prices charged to aluminium smelters mean that he cannot implement a national energy policy? Why has the Government decided to take no interest in the energy prices paid by the largely overseas owned and controlled aluminium industry while closely overseeing rapidly rising prices for fuels used by Australian motorists, farmers, small business and many other industries through its world parity pricing policy for indigenous oil? Will existing and planned smelters consume for electricity up to 9 million tonnes of black coal and 6 million tonnes of brown coal per annum by 1990? </para>

            <para>- Both in the Whitlam Government's time and in the Fraser Government's time it has been traditional that electricity generation in Australia should be done by the States. Both in the Whitlam Government's time and in the Fraser Government's time the tariffs charged by the States to individual industries and to domestic consumers have been the decision of the States. As I understand it, there was no attempt by the Labor Party to intervene when it had the opportunity. The fact is, and it is an old fashioned view, that if a sovereign government is doing its job it is at least as wise as those who may be in Canberra. That of course is not the Labor Party's thesis, because the Labor Party wants to abolish the States. </para>

I believe that honourable senators, particularly those on this side of the House, are observing the rulings you have given by cutting their questions short. The Minister is once again making a long second reading speech. He has not yet referred to the subject matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren's</inline> question. I ask you again to remind the Minister of his obligations. </para>

              <para>-I face a very real dilemma. The question was long, complex and important. Therefore I intend, with the indulgence of the Senate, to reply to that question. I have said that the proposal for an electric power grid is to ensure an adequate supply ahead of demand so that jobs can be created in Australia and the most practical methods can be employed throughout the various States to provide the cheapest electricity possible in Australia. Absolutely vital and fundamental to the question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> asked is the fact that we are taking such steps. </para>

          <para>I hope that in Australia no one will start a campaign to reject the idea that Australia should be providing aluminium smelters. Australia is now producing 280,000 tonnes of aluminium metal a year; in five years time we will be producing 1.3 million tonnes; and a few years after that we will be producing two million tonnes. Australia will be a significant producer in the world. We will be enormously stronger in job creation in industry and defence. I regret very much that anyone should be finding fault with the development of such a great industry in Australia. </para>

              <para>- I wish to ask a supplementary question. It arises out of the fact that the Minister did not answer my question in full, as I required. In fact, he made the statement that certain things were Labor Party policy years ago. The Minister knows full well that he tells us repeatedly that the Government has overturned Labor Party policy. He says that it was not good policy. But the Government is not prepared to overturn this one. Is the Minister relying on the committee which is examining the south-eastern Australian power grid for the information which we are seeking? Will the committee be able to take evidence in public rather than in camera? </para>

The Government will be seeking to talk to the States to see whether there can be an expansion of infrastructure financing for electricity generation. This will be a major indication on our pan. There will be attempts- I do not know whether at committee hearings or in other informal discussions- to get the necessary information. I am not able to say whether <inline font-weight="bold">Sir David</inline> Zeidler 's committee proposes to meet in public or in private. That is a matter for the committee to decide.

Some of the automotive industries have announced that they will be producing them in about three or four years time. I do not know whether they will be produced in Australia. The question of duty and sales tax on them is a policy matter. It also depends, of course, on an evaluation of whether they would be a successful operation and therefore ought to be encouraged as such. I will continue the study in my Department. I will refer the policy nature of the question to the Treasurer. </para>

            <para>-My understanding is that there have been media reports that a retired Army officer has made accusations against  President  Suharto in a petition to the Indonesian Parliament. That may be the source of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> speaks. I am also aware of another critical petition, signed by a number of Opposition figures, which was presented to the Indonesian Parliament last week. Neither the Government nor I am able to say what is the truth or otherwise of the substance of such matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> will know that within parliaments, including the Australian Parliament, a considerable number of allegations are made which, upon examination, are found to be either totally false or put in another perspective.

          <para>It is true that the Australian Government presented a stud bull to President Suharto for use on his farm at Ciawi near Bogor following a visit by the Prime Minister to the farm in 1976. Gifts to national leaders are common by all governments, of all political persuasions. I do not think there is anything significant in that, but fundamentally it would be wrong of course if there were a connection between such things and any form of corruption. I cannot comment on it. I will refer the question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and seek further information. </para>

The information I have is that Australia recognises the international definition of a refugee, which can be paraphrased as being a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of persecution, is outside his country of origin or habitual residence. Members of minority groups who are still in their country of origin or citizenship cannot be regarded as refugees under the international definition. Australia already provides places in its refugee program for Assyrian christians who have fled persecution in Iraq. This year we expect to receive about 600. Australia also provides more generally for the acceptance of refugees from elsewhere who apply for resettlement in Australia through Australian missions abroad. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is currently examining the treatment of various minority groups in several countries in the Middle East. This study includes those countries about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> has expressed interest.

            <para>- Is the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry aware that since the removal of the wheat ship <inline font-style="italic">South Esk</inline> from the Tasmanian run and its replacement by the larger 'Lake' vessels, feed wheat is no longer available in northern Tasmania, so that livestock producers depending on grain feeding are forced to pay a very much higher price for higher grade wheat, thus causing some financial problems? This, together with the rapidly rising price of wheat, is causing difficulties especially to pig and poultry producers. Will the Australian Wheat Board consider building additional storage facilities to service producers with a wider variety of wheat grades to meet the larger volumes which are now carried by the ' Lake ' vessels? </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Following the large increase in March 1980 estimated total employment decreased in all States in April to a level of 6,192,100 persons, 18,000 above the estimate for February. However, as survey estimates are subject to sampling variability large-short term fluctuations in them must be interpreted with care. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Is it a fact that the sampling variability is as minute as one in 100,000? Is it also a fact that if the Bureau had compared the April figures with the March figures, which is the normal practice, instead of the February figures, they would have shown a decline in total employment of 5 1 ,000 and not an increase of 1 8,000? Finally, has the Bureau given up its independence and now become merely a political arm of the Government? </para>

            <para>-I find offence in the last pan of the question. It suggests that public servants are becoming political and are losing their objectivity. I reject outright any suggestion that any officer of the Bureau of Statistics is doing other than an honest objective job and providing honest objective comment. I hope that the public servants of Australia understand the implications of that gratuitous insult. </para>

              <para>- Let me respond to the first three factors raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt.</inline> I believe that he has quoted accurately and selectively from the report of the Bureau of Statistics. But, of course, he should first of all note that the Bureau states that there may be a statistical aberration there. In any case he should note that the month itself is likely to be an aberration because, according to the labour force survey, April was the sixth successive month in which the levels and rates of unemployment for both the total full time labour forces were below those recorded in the corresponding month a year earlier. I also repeat that total employment has continued on a firm upward trend, with the average level in the March quarter being 2.6 per cent higher than in the same quarter of 1979. So without being narrowly selective, I believe the message to be taken from the report is one of good news- that the employment level in Australia is growing. </para>

            <para>- The fact is that the Government only said that it would not at this stage seek a total universal inquiry into the matter. It said that it was asking individuals, whether Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal, to come forward. It is eagerly seeking information from people who wish to come forward so that it can get expert advice and make an examination of the matter. I made that quite clear statement. Recently the Minister of Health in the South Australian Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Adamson,</inline> made a statement on the progress report upon a health study of Aborigines within that State and therefore in the Maralinga area. I do not have the statement immediately to hand, but from my recollection she said that from the evidence already obtained in the pursuit of this matter there was no indication of any undue incidence of illness which might suggest an effect of radioactivity, but that the State Government was pursuing a detailed study of Aborigines in South Australia. That information will be available; it will become public. </para>

Of course, it has indicated that it will use the expert advice of the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council to advise us on this. If it is revealed that there is a need for a more global study, that will come from those two expert bodies and the Government will evaluate the matter then. It would not be true to say that we have rejected study. In fact, we are eagerly advocating that people should come forward so that the available evidence can be examined. </para>

            <para>- My question which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs refers to the shortfalls in skilled workers in most industries in Australia and indications that these shortfalls will limit Australia 's capacity to expand and create other job opportunities. Is it a fact that the failure to attract the necessary numbers of suitable young people to apprenticeships, with the attendant hard slog of three or four years further study and development of skill of hand, can be attributed to, firstly, the inadequate margin in pay between skilled and unskilled or casual workers and, secondly, the reluctance of trade unions to allow industry to increase the numbers of apprenticeships? Would not the solution be for the Government to intervene to negotiate meaningful margins for skills so that just rewards for training are provided? Will the Government examine the possibility of introducing civilian apprenticeship training schemes similar to those used by the armed services and using technical and further education facilities rather than simply funding TAFE colleges to engage in all sorts of community oriented courses that do not lead to improved job opportunities. </para>

Can the Minister confirm that the simulator is located in Hong Kong and, if that is so, can he tell the Senate how many RAAF personnel have travelled from Australia to Hong Kong to undertake the conversion course, how long each group stayed in Hong Kong, and the total cost to the Australian taxpayer of the Government's scandalous extravagance? </para>

            <para>-If it were not for the melodramatic rhetoric of the last part of the honourable senator's question I would have to draw attention to the fact that that kind of question should be put on notice. It is seeking information that no Minister would have available. I will seek the information regarding the arrangements for the simulator training; I will seek the information as to whether it is located in Hong Kong and how many Service people have travelled there. I could not know all of that, and I must be able to obtain such information. As to the claim that this is a scandalous waste of money, I point out that the purchase of those two aircraft was as a result of the highest intelligence reports that could be given to any government. The fact of the matter is that the best security and intelligence advice available to this Government and to governments overseas is that if a national leader were to continue to travel on commercial aircraft- this applies, both in Australia and overseas- there would be likely to be an enormous risk to the lives of innocent passengers travelling on those aircraft. I stress that that is the advice given to us by the security people of Australia and the advice given to other countries. Apparently the Labor Party is willing to do two things- to be selective as regards the chartering of Boeing aircraft to take <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> to look at the ruins in Greece - </para>

          <para>Equally, I remind the Senate and the public that 80 per cent of the flying time of these aircraft is used for normal defence transport purposes, carrying troops and carrying refugees. So there is no scandalous expenditure. The training of the pilots involved would be training for the normal defence requirements of a transport aircraft and, indeed, for carrying troops and refugees. But presumably the Labor Party does not want that training to take place. </para>

            <para>- During Question Time today <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> I believe, stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laurie</inline> Power was a public servant and was not employed in a political role and that, therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laurie</inline> Power did not write <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> 's Press statements. I have here a Press statement dated 11 February 1980 which reads: 'By the Minister for National Development and Energy'. Appended to the Press statement is a note with the words: 'Inquiries: Laurie Power'. It gives a work telephone number and a home telephone number. Whilst that does not necessarily prove that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Power</inline> wrote the Press statement, it certainly implies that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Power</inline> did write the Press statement. I think it was very reasonable for me to draw the conclusion that he wrote it since his name is appended to it. </para>

            <para>The Petroleum Refineries (Australia) Pty Ltd (PRA) refinery at Port Stanvac was closed down from 12 March 1980 to 16 March 1 980 following the refusal of the Seamen's Union of Australia to allow the tanker 'Philippine Star' to berth on 27 February 1 980. As a result of the ban, the vessel was unable to discharge her cargo of about 800,000 barrels of Middle East crude and the refinery was forced to commence close-down operations on II March 1980 when supplies of crude feed stock ran out. The bans were lifted on 14 March. The refinery took two days to recommence its refining operations and it was a further week or so before the facility had regained full production. </para>
            <para>Another tanker, the 'Mobil Brilliant' arrived at Port Stanvac on 3 March 1980 carrying 500,000 barrels of Middle East crude but this cargo could not be discharged until the </para>
            <para class="block">Philippine Star' had unloaded and departed from the loading berth. The 'Mobil Brilliant' eventually unloaded on 22 March 1980. </para>
            <para>The Seamen's Union of Australia (SUA), in company with the Merchant Service Guild and the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, had been imposing bans on selected foreign flag tankers for some years in support of claims for the employment of more Australian flag vessels manned by Australian crews in the carriage of foreign crude oil to Australia. The campaign was reactivated by the Unions in the last quarter of 1 979. </para>
            <para>I would point out that a feature of the maritime unions' campaign, not only at Port Stanvac but also at Kurnell and Kwinana, was their tendency to maintain bans on tankers until stocks of crude feed stock at the refineries were almost exhausted- the bans would then be lifted. Such a set of circumstances arose at the PRA refinery on more than one occasion, but, during the period referred to, the continuation of SUA bans necessitated the complete closure of the Port Stanvac refinery. </para>
            <para>About mid-March, the maritime unions decided to discontinue their campaign against foreign tankers as a result of assurances given by oil companies that additional tankers, carrying the Australian flag and manned by Australian crew, would be secured for the purpose of importing foreign crude into Australia. </para>
            <para>In recent times Caltex, Shell, BP, Mobil and Ampol have been involved in negotiations with the unions concerning manning levels and other conditions of employment relating to the introduction of the new tankers into our overseas oil trade. </para>
            <para>The Government remains firm in its policy applying to the use of Australian flag ships in overseas trade that Australian flag participation is to be encouraged, provided it can be obtained on a commercially negotiated basis without additional cost to taxpayer or consumer. </para>

            <para>If so, why has the Government not yet taken action to install the translator and give the citizens in this area adequate television reception. </para>
            <para>Answer: </para>
            <para>A site has been chosen for the television translator station. </para>
            <para>Translator and aerial are in store. The lattice tower has been diverted for other urgent radiocommunication use. A decision is yet to be reached as to whether, for aesthetic reasons, a slimline tower should now be substituted. If so, then different aerials will have to be procured as well as the slimline tower. If a lattice mast is finally agreed on it is anticipated that one could be diverted for use when required from another project. </para>
            <para>The question of access to the site has remained unresolved with the result that the project has inevitably been delayed. </para>
            <para>Negotiations with the owners of the selected site (Two World Holiday Pty Ltd) have been protracted and in fact the most recent meeting between that company and the Department of Administrative Services has been held in the past few days. </para>
            <para>I have been advised that the parties have agreed on all but two points. </para>
            <para>The main point of contention is the standard of road access. Two World Holiday Pty Ltd still require the building of a superior road to that proposed. The Department of Administrative Services are liaising with the Department of Construction on the cost of this road so as to establish its estimated cost as soon as possible. </para>
            <para>Two World Holiday believe that if the Department will accede to the request for a higher grade road then the council will in turn accede to the requests for dedication of the site. </para>
            <para>The Honourable Member for Dawson has expressed a consistent interest in this matter and has indicated his willingness to do what he can to assure agreement between the parties on the matter so as to enable those residents in the area to receive improved reception. </para>

            <para>- When Malcolm Fraser became Prime Minister the cost of super grade petrol at the bowser was 13c a litre. It is now between 32c and 34c a litre. Almost all of that 150 per cent increase in price is due to the oil taxing policies of the Fraser Government. The Fraser Government has added $ 1 5 to the cost of a tank full of petrol for an Australian-made 6-cylinder car. Every time a Holden or a Ford is filled with petrol an extra $15 in tax is paid to the Fraser Government. The present position is that Australian oil is priced to refiners at $24.70 a barrel. That $24.70 is distributed in this way: It costs something less than $2 a barrel actually to produce the oil, which includes amortisation of capital. These are average figures. Australian producers on average receive just over $6 a barrel. The difference between that $6 and the $24.70-$ 18.70 a barrel- is Government taxes: almost all of it is Fraser Government taxes. The Fraser Government's oil tax is currently producing revenue at the rate of $3 billion, or$3,000m, a year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>That massive indirect tax is superimposed on the highest ever level of income tax imposed on the Australian people in peacetime. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> who promised to end the great tax rip-off, now presides over the highest levels of income tax ever imposed, in addition to this massive $3,000m a year indirect tax which is equivalent on average to a 1 6 per cent increase in personal taxation. For a person on average weekly earnings, a tank full of petrol a week is equivalent to 30 per cent increase in income tax. So much for the ending of the great tax rip-off. This policy is directly responsible for inflation, which again is back in double figures and going up still. It has added directly 4.5 per cent to the consumer price index in the last two years. When all the indirect effects are added, it has probably increased the consumer price index by 8 per cent. It is the direct cause of inflation being again in double figures and rising. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to note that the annual rate of inflation now is just 3 per cent below what it was at the end of 1975. It has come down from just over 13 per cent to just over 10 percent. We were given dire warnings of catastrophe by all the Ministers of this Government and by all their back benchers in 1975. They said that that situation was absolutely catastrophic and that Australia could not live with inflation approaching those levels. They now preside over an almost comparable, almost equal, rate of inflation; it is still going up instead of coming down, as it was in 1975. The reason for that, the direct cause of that, is the Fraser Government's oil taxing policies. They are the indirect cause of interest rates being at record levels. Government interest rates are the highest they have ever been. So much for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser's</inline> assurance, his solemn promise in November 1977, that interest rates would fall by 2 percent over the next 12 months. It is a target that can and will be met', said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser.</inline> Interest rates are now 2 1/2 per cent higher than they were when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> gave that solemn promise that they would fall by 2 per cent. They have not come down by 2 per cent, they have gone up by <inline font-style="italic">2lh</inline> per cent, and the major cause of that increase is the Government's oil pricing policy. </para>
          <para>Unemployment remains at record levels. It is now statistically acceptable to seasonally adjust Australian Bureau of Statistics monthly employment figures and on a seasonally adjusted basis unemployment too is again rising. It had stabilised at record levels; it is now going up. That also is an indirect effect of the Government's oil pricing policy. </para>
          <para>The economic recovery that clearly was in the pipeline in 1 978, and which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> among others detected at the time, has been aborted by this oil taxing policy. The burdens it has imposed are also distributed very inequitably. The people who suffer most from this Fraser Government policy are lower income country families. The most recent survey of household expenditure shows that these people spend almost 10 per cent of their income on petrol and oil. The average for all households is 3 per cent, and the average for the higher income groups is 2 per cent. So the Fraser Government has decided to impose this burden on probably the most disadvantaged people in Australia, short of the Aborigines, and many of them come into this category anyway. The Fraser Government has singled out members of lower income rural households for a punishing tax which hits them proportionately three times as hard as it does the average household. Of course, the originators of this policy, the architects, were ironically the National Country Party, and especially <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> who claim to represent the interests of these people. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> of course, is more interested in the kickbacks they can get from Esso-BHP on the Fortescue oil field than he is in protecting the interests or compensating - </para>

              <para>- Order! I have heard sufficient argument relating to this alleged breach of the Standing Orders. Whilst it has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> that the words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> could not refer to a member of Parliament specifically, in the context of what he was saying I took the inference to be a personal reflection. I think it is only reasonable and fair to rule that there are indications of a personal reflection that should be withdrawn. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> I ask you to withdraw that very gross reflection. </para>

              <para>- I withdraw. I have a lot more damaging charges to lay against the Government than that one anyway. The Government's record is one of economic vandalism. It has a record of high income tax, high interest rates and record unemployment which is still going up. It has made an abortion of the economic recovery that was in the pipeline two years ago. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The excuse for that economic vandalism rests on two propositions. The first proposition is that it is necessary to encourage exploration and the second is that it is a conservation measure. With regard to the first proposition the truth, of course, is that import parity pricing for new oil discoveries has applied ever since it was announced by the Whitlam Government in September 1975. There is a bipartisan policy on the pricing of oil from newly discovered fields. So that is irrelevant. The second excuse for this economic vandalism is that the high price being charged is a conservation measure. Of course, it would be foolish to argue that there is not some inverse correlation between price and consumption. Immense price increases will have some effect on consumption, at least in the long term. The point, however, is that we have long since passed that stage where further increases in price, where the miniscule gains in terms of reduced consumption flowing from further increases in price, are offset by the enormous damage to the whole economy which is caused by the inflation which flows from those further increases in price. The miniscule gains are far more than offset by the economic damage. </para>
          <para>It is for that reason that the Labor Party proposes to have a freeze on Australian crude oil prices for 12 months. Thereafter prices will be increased by the increase in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries prices or the Australian consumer price index, whichever is the lesser. If we are seriously interested in conserving fuel there are far more effective ways of going about it than doubling the price of petrol. More attention should be paid to public transport in the urban centres, smaller engines in cars and lower speed limits to mention just a few. These would have a far greater effect on petrol consumption than the 150 per cent increase in prices which this Government has thrust upon the motorist in the last two and a half years. Incidentally, in the United States of America which has not experienced nearly the same increase as Australia has experienced, petrol consumption fell for the first three and a half months of this year by 10 per cent. In Australia it has fallen by less than 2 per cent. A major factor in that fall is, very likely, the disruption to fuel supplies caused by industrial troubles in refining and distribution. It remains to be seen whether there has been a recordable decrease in consumption in Australia at all. In the United States petrol consumption has gone down by 10 per cent mostly for other reasons. </para>
          <para>As the public perceives the realities of the Government's petrol taxing policy and the superiority of the Labor Party's proposition the Government responds with two variants of the Goebbels technique. The first variant is that it says that Labor will impose a resources rent tax and, therefore, the price of petrol will be even higher. I will deal with that matter at a later stage. The other variant of the Goebbels technique is to launch, at public expense, an enormous propaganda campaign designed to brainwash the public. For example, the Government is distributing at public expense to schools in South Australia, and probably by now in other places, a propaganda document which purports to tell the facts about the Government's oil pricing policy. </para>

Import parity pricing for new discoveries has applied since 1975 and not one cent of that S3 billion crude oil tax a year is being used to finance exploration.

              <para>- The paper and the Government assert that Australia has the third cheapest petrol in the world. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> made these statements in March- when I think that paper was prepared- at the exchange rates prevailing on 1 March, converted into Australian dollars, retail petrol prices for super petrol in some countries were as follows: In Australia it was 32c or 34c a litre depending upon whether it was bought at a discount or at a standard price. In Bahrain it was 1 4.2c a litre; in Canada, 21c a litre; in Indonesia, 13c a litre; in Kuwait, 8c a litre; in Mexico, 16c a litre; in Nigeria, 26c a litre. In the Philippines it was 22.75c a litre; even the Philippines was selling petrol at 75 per cent of the price in Australia. In Saudi Arabia it was 3.46c a litre. In Singaporetiny Singapore which imports all its oil- the price was 32c a litre, the same price as in Australia. In Venezuela it was 7.4c a litre, and in the United </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">States 30c a litre. That list is not an exhaustive one. </para>
          <para>Another example of the Government's attempt to seduce the electorate of course, was the scandalous advertising campaign that it ran in literally hundreds of newspapers throughout Australia to inform the public that as from 1 April the Government would be increasing the subsidy paid for the freight on petroleum products. At the Estimate committee hearings the Government told us that $ 1 7,000 was spent on that advertising campaign- a scandalous misuse of public funds for Liberal Party political propaganda purposes. In answer to a question on notice yesterday I was informed, in fact, that it was $21,000. When asked what was the reason for the advertisements, the Government said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The purpose of the advertisements was to publicise the extension of the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme, which came into effect on 1 April 1 980. </para>

          <para class="block">The point is that the public does not have to apply for that subsidy; it is paid automatically.

            <para>- The matter of public importance is alleged to be the economic consequences of the Government's oil pricing policies. The test of the economic consequences of any oil pricing policy in a constructive way is twofold. Is it capable of providing over the years and decades ahead a sufficiency of petroleum products and other energy products for the people of Australia, not only at its present volume but also to allow for the great national development that will happen in Australia? Secondly, would it do so at a price which would be competitive with those of the trading nations of the world? The real test of the oil policies of a government is whether they are conducive to providing us with the oil that we need and whether it will be provided at a price that is competitive. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me deal with the latter statement. It has been alleged that we made a misstatement. We became a little old fashioned, having heard the Australian Labor Party's comments, and we asked the countries concerned about their prices. The confirmation by the Singapore High Commission is that petrol prices have been shown to have increased from approximately 32c per litre- probably at the 1979 price- to 41c per litre today, which is, of course, something like 8c above the cost in Australia. The Singapore High Commission has completely refuted the figures that the Labor Party is putting out. Let us get a little more juicy on this. Petrol prices in the Philippines are shown as having increased from 22c per litre to about 36c per litre in March. The Philippines Embassy, however, informed us today that in January 1980 the petrol price in the Philippines was about 54c per litre. </para>

              <para>- As the dollies go over, there is no argument left. What nonsense it is to include in this tatter of a list the oil producing countries- Bahrein, Indonesia, Kuwait, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Of course, we admitted that Canada was in fact cheaper than us, but for only one reason. The Minister for Energy told me in Canada a few weeks ago that Canada would raise the price except that it has a real problem in Alberta. The fact of the matter is that, leaving aside the members of OPEC, Australia today, under our import parity priceing, is producing the second cheapest petrol as such. We are right in saying that it is less than half the price in France, which is 72c per litre, and Italy, which is 71c per litre, and that it is about half the price in Japan, which is 66c per litre. The fundamental test is: Are we producing it in sufficient volume and are we producing it competitively against the rest of the world because energy will be the test?

              <para>-I am very happy to let the honourable senator look at the document. I only wish that those on the other side of the House would reciprocate in similar circumstances. Having said that, I come to the fundamental question that the Australian Labor Party put namely, whether the people of Australia knew that the excise duty on oil was yielding some $3,000m to the government coffers? The Labor Party thought it horrendous that that massive amount of money should be taken by way of taxation. However, we have it on firm record that the Labor Party spokesman on energy, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Keating,</inline> has admitted that the resource tax that a Labor government would apply would almost certainly yield more than our excise duty. The Labor Party has a policy which would take more tax than we are; yet it raises this matter of public importance today. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> talked with a sob in his throat about the Government taxing the people. Let us look at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Keating</inline> 's favourite expression that every petrol pump is a branch of the Taxation Office. A writer for the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gittins,</inline> spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Keating</inline> about his policy. He said: </para>

            <para>That sounds to me as if a resources tax is just a different version of ' a branch of the tax office at every petrol pump '. </para>

          <para class="block">What did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Keating</inline> say? It is on record that he said: </para>

            <para>Well it is to some extent. </para>

          <para class="block">It is on record that a Labor Government would raise more money in tax and that, in fact, the petrol bowser would be a taxing office. Down go the dollies about the prices of countries overseas. Let me state quite clearly what ought to be the tests of a good oil, petroleum or energy policy. It ought to have four ingredients. The world is running short of oil. It is consuming 22 billion barrels a year and only finding 18 billion. Australia is producing from its Bass Strait and Barrow Island wells about 67 per cent of what it needs today. Unless we find more or develop alternatives, by 1985 we will produce 55 per cent; by 1990, something like 35 per cent, and by the year 2000, 10 to 20 per cent. </para>
          <para>The idea that we can waste oil and hope for the best in the future is the corruption of an idea that the Labor Party is putting forward. The fact is that, if we are to have a sufficiency of oil tomorrow, we have to work for it today. We have to put it into position. It is no good saying that we have 67 per cent now. We will not have it in five years time. Indeed, had the Liberal Government not come into office the reserves in the Bass Strait would have fallen. By our policies we have extended the reserves by some three years. Without our policies the disaster area would be 1 982 instead of 1985. Our policies are working. Any decent policy must conserve what we have because the world outside is perilous. No one can say that tomorrow we will be able to get our supplies from the Middle East or elsewhere. Events in Afghanistan and Iran have destabilised the world, so we must conserve. We must switch from oil to alternatives such as coal, gas and electricity. We must get exploration going and above everything else we must stimulate the development of alternative fuels. </para>
          <para>It is clear- it has been said by all the nations around the world- that the price rises established by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will go on and on and the world, including Australia, will be held to ransom until synthetic fuels come on the market in volume and at prices that will compete with OPEC prices. Let me repeat that in simple terms. Until we can get the Rundle shale oils and the coal liquefactions coming forward at prices that will compete with OPEC prices, OPEC will hold the world to ransom. The test to be applied is: What kind of policies will turn Rundle oil shale into oil and what kind of policies will turn brown or black coal into liquid fuel? The Rundle partners have said one thing emphatically. There will be no Rundle shale oil unless there is import parity pricing. The Labor Party is opposed to import parity pricing. It follows therefore that under the Labor Party there would be no shale oil alternatives in Australia. There would be no development of alternative fuels. The only weapon we have to restrain OPEC, the only weapon we have to stop the rise in prices, the only weapon we have to get more fuel would be gone under Labor Party policies. I repeat, the only way that we will stop the OPEC jacking up of prices year by year is to bring on alternative fuels and to find more, of course. </para>
          <para>We are doing so in Australia where we have the start of the greatest synthetic fuel enterprise in the world. It is a project of enormous importance. It is a project that in eight years' time will yield about 240,000 barrels a day, which is equal to the total we import day by day from the Middle East. So here we are waterproofing ourselves against the threat of the Middle East, and here is a party coming forward with a policy which would sabotage that project, because only an import parity price, only the knowledge that they are to compete with the scarcity value of oil in the world will bring the Rundles and the oil shales on. If we want a coal liquefaction plant, we are talking of $3 billion to $4 billion for 100,000 barrels. If we want a Rundle project, we are talking of $8 billion to $ 10 billion. </para>
          <para>But let us test these things. We must conserve. That is the first thing. We must show the people that it is necessary to save petrol. The world knows that we are conserving. The use of gasolene in Australia is falling in a very significant way. The world knows that the people of Australia are switching to smaller fuel effective cars. Honourable senators ought to know that the Chamber of Automotive Industries has agreed to develop engines which will reduce the consumption of petrol. It has advised me that, whereas today an average car uses 1 1.2 litres per hundred kilometres, by 1983 it will use 9 litres, and by 1987, prospectively, 8 litres. That is a huge gain in conservation. </para>
          <para>The liquefied petroleum gas policies that we put into effect recently encouraging its total use for the automotive industry will displace the use of gasolene by 14 per cent. Yet who mocked and knocked and tried to destroy this LPG policy? The Labor Party wanted to white ant the conservation policies for Australia. But the conservation policies are going on. In the alternative, it is clear. In Sydney alone last year the switch from fuel oil to gas and electricity saved two million barrels of oil. Every day a new industry switches from fuel oil to an alternative fuel. We have the pipeline development to Canberra, the pipeline development from Young to Wagga to Albury, the Lithgow-Bathurst-Orange prospective pipelines and the Sydney-Newcastle pipeline. All of them are saving oil, all of them are saving LPG, and all of them are being criticised. Conservation is going on and alternative use of fuels is going on. </para>
          <para>I come to the third factor and that is the need for exploration in Australia. Exploration and development in Australia are at record levels today. Under the Labor Party, oil development virtually came to a halt. As a project the North West Shelf was wiped off the slate. Indeed, <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is full of evidence that Labor policies brought exploration and development to a virtual halt, and made it impossible for the North West Shelf project to go forward. </para>
          <para>Today we have exploration and development. If Labor were to be given the opportunity to apply a resource rent tax at the profits level of the oil companies and the profitability of the oil companies were removed from them, they would have only one recourse. They would say ' Why do I have to drill in Australia or to explore in Australia, the country of greatest risk in the world? I will take my money, I will take my oil rigs and go away', as they did in 1974 and 1975. Here is the alternative situation. As for synthetic fuels, we have a clear situation. Rundle has said that it will go forward only if import parity pricing is in position. There are four tests. What did members of the Australian Labor Party do? In relation to the conservation of petrol they have said: 'In our first year of office we will freeze the price of petrol. Come in spinner. We will inveigle you in an election year'. The Australian Labor Party is therefore urging the greater use of fuel. Every litre of fuel that is used because of this encouragement will have to be bought at higher than import parity prices on the spot market. Every time members of the Labor Party say: 'We will freeze the price of petrol. Use more; buy more ', it is putting Australians in peril in the Middle East. Let nobody doubt that. The claim by the Australian Labor Party that it would freeze the price of petrol is absolute humbug. </para>
          <para>Some four years ago the people of Australia said: 'The inflation policies of the Labor Party have costed us out of world markets. We cannot trade any more. Put the Fraser Government in office to rectify that situation'. That has happened. Australia is in a . better trading position now than it has been in over the past seven years because of the anti-inflationary policies adopted by this Government. We have the most unique opportunity in Australia to develop our great, God given resources. This applies particularly to minerals and energy. If only we can keep down inflation and keep down industrial unrest in Australia we will be able to do all these things. Today Australia has better prospects than it has ever had. The Government has an import parity pricing policy that virtually every country in the Western world believes is right. Indeed, the Middle East countries of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries believe it is right, and they are aiming towards the policy adopted by this Government. Only the Labor Party says this policy is wrong. The policies put forward by the Australian Labor Party would not conserve petrol. If implemented, they would waste petrol and would stop the switch to alternative fuels. This would dry up exploration and stop research into synthetic fuels. The Senate has been asked to adopt the economic policy of the Whitlam type that put Australia into ruin and out of the trading market. The oil policy of the Labor Party, on examination, is seen to be humbug and cant. In fact, it would cost more. Under a Labor government petrol would be dearer and scarcer. Under this Government, Australia has the second cheapest price for petrol of any of the countries with which we trade. This Government's policy is successful. The dollies fell down a little earlier when reference was made to Singapore and the Philippines. The Government would be very interested to pursue that matter. The debate leaves the Labor Party in tatters. I move: </para>

The fact of the matter- I want to make this clear- is that I wanted to incorporate a document in the record which showed the relative prices in a number of countries. It so happened that in the dozens of things that I do, I had scribbled a number of messages on the bottom of the document. What was provided was, in fact, exactly the table shown on the document. I am prepared to get that table certified by the National Energy Office. There was no scribbling on the original document at all. The last thing I want is to bring the Senate to this situation.

              <para>- No, the point of order must be ruled on. The fact is that on the one hand there has been a physical variation to a document. That is one side of the matter. On the other side is the imputation to which I object- the reflection cast on an honourable senator that he had some ulterior motive or a dishonest motive. There is an inference of a dishonest motive to say that something was 'doctored'. It is that word which is offensive to honourable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> I ask you again to withdraw. </para>

        </motion>
        <para class="block">The guidelines brought down by the Government in respect of education expenditure for the year 1981 overall demonstrate the Government's lack of concern for education and its consistent policy of downgrading education as an instrument for the betterment of the Australian population and particularly the young population of Australia. The guidelines are designed to give effect to this philosophy without stirring up more opposition than is necessary in the process. It indicates again a rather slick attempt to continue this process of attrition in relation to education expenditure. It is often said in this place, notably by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> that what the Government is concerned about in relation to education is not so much funding as quality. Quality does not cost anything except a lot of words from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> but many of the quality of opportunity facilities which the education system does and should provide require funding. That has been the role of the Commonwealth in relation to education expenditure. </para>
        <para>I will deal, first of all, with the area of tertiary education. There are no obvious inititatives arising from the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training which was set up in 1976 and which reported in 1978. The Senate has been told for two years, in answers to questions about the education system, that we could not obtain answers to these matters because they were all being dealt with by the Williams Committee of Inquiry. When this Committee finally reported, half of its recommendations were referred to the Tertiary Education Commission for further consideration and the other half were just noted by the Government. If any initiatives had emerged or arisen from the Williams Committee of Inquiry they would have been trumpeted by the Government in its education guidelines for 1981. One suspects that the Williams Committee report on education and training is yet another report of the Fraser Government or of conservative governments destined for a quiet burial and one which will rank with the report of the Vernon Committee of Economic Inquiry of 1965 as one of the great dust-gathering reports of conservative governments. </para>
        <para>The guidelines are silent on the decision of the Government to proceed with the building of the Defence Force Academy. It may, of course, be a college of the University of New South Wales and, if so, it can no longer be passed off merely as a defence item as it is having a direct impact on education expenditure. If one looks at the matter in another way, the Australian Maritime College is an item of education expenditure; it is not an item of transport expenditure, for example. Similarly, the Australian Defence Force Academy should and probably would be dealt with as an item of education expenditure. This is not being done, for obvious reasons. If it were dealt with as an item of education expenditure it would demonstrate more clearly the Government's priorities in relation to education funding. It costs $33m a year to run a defence force academy. When one looks at the figures and the guidelines in respect of matters such as university research and so on, one can see very clearly where the Government's priorities lie. </para>
        <para>I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that on a number of occasions the Tertiary Education Commission has complained of the squeeze on funds for universities and colleges and particularly funds in respect of research in universities. Presumably, this squeeze will continue because recurrent funding is frozen for universities and colleges. So much for the </para>
        <para class="block">Government's concern in relation to policies of science and technology, a matter that we have debated in this Senate on a number of occasions. It is very bad luck for medical research in Australia, which has suffered because of a particularly hard line on expenditure from the Government in recent years. </para>
        <para>I note in the guidelines that $0.4m has been set aside in the tertiary education sector, for what is described as evaluative studies. There is no explanation of what 'evaluative studies' means in relation to tertiary education. The expression is there and $0.4m is to be spent on it. One would have hoped for some explanation of that, because did not the Williams Committee, which cost $750,000, make evaluative studies in relation to the education system? Does not the Tertiary Education Commission regularly evaluate tertiary education in Australia? What is meant by this new grant of $0.4m for evaluative studies? Perhaps some honourable senator on the Government side, which has the benefit of wisdom in relation to facts, if nothing else, might be able to help me with an explanation of what evaluative studies means in the context of a tertiary education budget and in the context of the Williams Committee of Inquiry, the Tertiary Education Commission and regular evaluations and reports. I assume that university and college academics will be very concerned to know what evaluative studies ' in relation to the tertiary education system means. </para>

            <para>-Sure. I take it that is meant to indicate vernality on behalf of academics which is not present in politicians on the Government side, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume.</inline> The question that I raise is a much more serious one. I take it that evaluative studies means that even under the Fraser Government evaluations would be made by somebody independent of the education sector. It is in respect of that matter that one seeks some enlightenment in the guidelines which prescribe an amount like that without any explanation. The guidelines should explain that expression. I indicate briefly that, as far as we are concerned, when a Labor government is elected we will spend a lot more money on increases in research funding in universities. We will do that not just for the reason suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> 's interjection, but because the expenditure of research funds in universities, if properly applied, has very great relevance to the future of this country in terms of industrial development, the development of the manufacturing sector, in terms of technology and a whole range of disciplines which can become important in the context of the nature of the Australian economy as it ought to be and as it is likely to develop in the remaining years of this century. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>We had arguments and discussions in the Senate about that question. But I indicate clearly that there is a need for increased research funding. That is not a comment which has come just from me in a partisan sense; it is a comment which has been made by people, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development examiners, the Tertiary Education Commission, the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training in Australia. The recommendations of all those bodies have been ignored by the Fraser Government in relation to that issue. </para>
        <para>I think that we also have to argue that there is room for very sympathetic consideration of the tertiary sector in relation to capital expenditure on buildings and equipment. Again I would draw the attention of the Senate to the last report of the Tertiary Education Commission, which made the comment that what was happening in the tertiary sector of education was that there was a backlog of requirements building up in relation to capital expenditure. In essence the problems have been swept under the carpet for the time being by the present Government. </para>
        <para>I want to deal now with the technical and further education sector, which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis</inline> at Question Time today. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that in the education guidelines for 1981, expenditure on technical and further education buildings has been frozen, and one has only to look at these buildings in most States of Australia to see that they are old, obsolete and run down. There will be no increase in expenditure for capital equipment in the TAFE sector in 1 98 1 . It is a growing sector in terms of students and one about which the Government talks a lot- indeed, it attaches a great deal of importance to technical trainingbut no new assault will be made on the obsolete buildings as a matter of priority by the present Government as a result of these guidelines. </para>
        <para>I again draw attention to the fact that the Government's proudest boast in relation to educational expenditure has been in relation to the TAFE sector, and, that sector has been treated in a very parsiminious and shabby way in the guidelines which have been brought down. If, indeed, it is a sector which will train the new generations of technicians and skilled personnel for Australian industry, then it needs a little more sympathetic consideration than has been given in the guidelines announced. I again draw the Senate's attention to the fact that the Williams Committee of Inquiry and the Government committee recommended a 10 per cent increase in recurrent expenditure for TAFE, and they recommended it as a matter of urgency. The Government has ignored that recommendation. The increase in the recurrent expenditure for TAFE in the guidelines is of the order of $2m. I have not worked that out as a percentage, but it is nothing like 10 per cent. </para>
        <para>I turn now to what the guidelines say in relation to schools in Australia. In these guidelines the Government has again hidden behind the over-simplification that there will be a decline in school enrolments and that growth in the school sector in terms of the number of pupils is levelling off. That, of course, is a glib statement, made in ignorance or deliberately ignoring the fact that the Schools Commission has properly pointed out that the deficiency in capital needs in schools is getting greater and that there is an increased need for capital expenditure in the schools area. This is happening, of course, because we live in a country with a highly mobile population. It is a very glib sort of solution to say that the whole school population of Australia is not increasing and therefore there are no needs in terms of buildings and so on for schools. The Schools Commission has given examples of places like Gosford in New South Wales, which has a relatively soaring population rate, where schools are overcrowded, and where there are inadequate facilities in terms of school buildings because of population movements. It is not good enough to say that across the board there has been no increase in the school population. One has to look at the particular needs of particular areas and districts. The Gosford-Wyong area to which I referred and the Gold Coast are areas which have very demonstrable needs in terms of new buildings and new capital facilities. One cannot move schools from areas of declining population to new areas of development, whether it be in the areas I have mentioned orin the outer suburbs of the big cities of Sydney and Melbourne. Once again, the Government has taken a very parsimonious approach to the educational needs of Australian school children in the new areas and new suburbs of the cities. </para>
        <para>No increase has been provided for in the disadvantaged schools program, which has been stationary now for four years. The Schools Commission has given particular emphasis to the program which in a very real way has done significant things for the deprived school children of </para>
        <para class="block">Australia in disadvantaged socio-economic areas. There are numerous examples about which any politician who is aware of the situation in his own electorate or in the electorates of big cities should be knowledgeable. The same is true in relation to these guidelines on the disadvantaged country areas program. I have raised this question again and again in the Senate. The Schools Commission recommended an expenditure of some $80m on the disadvantaged country areas program over a period. The Government has spent in that period $ 18m instead of $80m. </para>
        <para>Again, this demonstrates the great concern of the National Country Party which has so much influence on this Government. In other ways it expresses the great concern about the education of children in country areas. One suspects that members of the National Country Party are very worried about education being improved in country areas because the more highly educated the population is the much less likely it is that people will vote for National Country Party members of Parliament. One can explain only in that way the lack of diligence on behalf of the National Country Party in looking after children in country areas. For many years the National Country Party has talked about the importance of decentralisation but has been scared stiff that it will ever occur. Decentralisation means that people who would not be persuaded to vote for the party would be living in country areas. We express our concern about the way the Government has ignored the disadvantaged country areas program and, of course not in the context of these guidelines, the attention which has not been given to the problems of isolated school children. There is a considerable shortfall between the recommendations of the Schools Commission on these matters and the amounts which have, in fact, been recommended in the guidelines. </para>
        <para>Once again the link between the subsidy to non-government school funding and governmental schools costs is maintained. This will cause again the argument about the transfer of funds from government to non-government schools. This annual event will have to be dealt with at some stage. The transfer causes not only extra money to go to non-government schools as a whole but also, of course, extra money to go to the wealthiest schools in the non-government sector as well as the most needy schools in the non-government sector, namely, the Catholic parochial schools. When this Government talks about the non-government sector and tries to justify giving money to it the Government always talks appropriately about the poor Catholic schools. It is quite appropriate that it should do so because the poor Catholic schools have a lot of problems, particularly in the cities. </para>
        <para>However, at the same time as the Government goes to the wailing wall on behalf of the poor Catholic schools- which we understand- and the handkerchiefs come out on the Government side, the wealthiest schools in this country are getting a better sling, if I may use that expression, under this Government's policies. That is one of the hidden iniquities in education funding under the policy of the present Government. For example, the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> addressed the Slade School in Brisbane a couple of months ago. He said that the reason the Government supports these types of wealthy schools is that they produce the leaders of Australian society. </para>

            <para>-A11 right; the honourable senator did not limit his speaking time much last night. The Slade School is an example of the sort of school about which I am talking.

          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I will put briefly to the Senate the alternative view about these questions which I have just mentioned. One must assume a social responsibility for all schools in need. The Commonwealth must not become merely a funding agency for non-government schools. The Government had the gall to advance further towards its professed goal of providing for all non-government schools at least 20 per cent of the resources provided to government schools. There is a need to examine that policy closely in the light of what I have just had to say. </para>
        <para>There is in the statement also a clear noncommitment to the concerns of handicapped children and of multicultural education programs in any real sense. They are the only beneficiaries in terms of growth in education funding because of the vote-catching decisions of the Liberal Party and the emphasis which it  places on that process rather than on the needs of Australian children. That has about it exactly the same emphasis as that of the much-vaunted Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting Corporation, which we debated in this context yesterday and which came to grief. </para>
        <para>We condemn the guidelines generally as being parsimonious, as showing no interest in or imagination about the future of education, or its problems, and in being totally wrong in emphasis and priorities. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Western Australia Agreement (Ord River Irrigation) Act 1 968 so that loan funds still available under the Act can also be used for handling and processing facilities for produce from the Ord River irrigation area. The proposed changes to the 1968 agreement Act are relatively minor. The scope of Commonwealth assistance to the State for development of water resources in the Kimberley region will be broadened to include the construction of crop handling and processing facilities. Loan funds for these purposes will be provided on terms, conditions and rates of interest agreed to from time to time by the Minister for National Development and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> and the State Treasurer. </para>
          <para>It will be recalled that the report of the Commonwealth-State Ord River Irrigation Area Review Committee, under the independent chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Young, was tabled by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in the Parliament on 27 February 1979. Among other matters, it recommended that consideration be given to the use of funds still available under the Western Australia Agreement (Ord River Irrigation) Act 1 968 for crop handling and processing facilities when justified by successful commercial farming. The Government accepted this recommendation. </para>
          <para>There were difficult times for Ord River farmers after the cessation of cotton-growing at the end of the 1973-74 season, following the build-up of resistance by insect pests to commercial insecticides. Numerous other crops were then tried which, on the basis of past research and experimental results, appeared to offer prospects for success. Rice growing has had a long research experience at the Ord, and a serious nutritional deficiency limiting yields was rectified some years ago. The Ord has a significant advantage over rice-growing areas in southern New South Wales, in that two crops can be grown annually. Total yields of 10 to 12 tonnes of paddy rice per hectare are being achieved and varieties currently under test indicate the potential for further improving the performance of the industry. By courtesy of the Western Australian Government, honourable senators had an opportunity of sampling this quality long grain rice in the parliamentary dining room. </para>
          <para>Following this commercial success over the past few seasons additional rice storage facilities are required to cope with the projected expansion of the industry. The State asked for assistance of $500,000 for an additional 3,000 tonne storage and associated installations. Recently I have been advised that the estimated cost has risen considerably above the $718,000 mentioned in the other place, and the State has now submitted a modified proposal to construct a 1,200-tonne storage as a first stage at a cost of $350,000 in order to provide greater equity to current growers who will be financing the facility through storage charges. </para>
          <para>Other main commercial crops now being successfully grown are sunflowers, soybeans and sorghum. The first commercial crop of peanuts grown on sandy soil is approaching harvest. Crop forecasts for the current dry season are for 3,000 hectares of sunflowers, 1,000 hectares of sorghum, 550 hectares of rice and 1,500 hectares of other crops. Sugar cane is also being grown with encouraging results at the Ord. A commercial-sized trial plantation of sugar cane is now in its third year of operation, following an encouraging feasibility study by CSR Ltd in 1975, and yields from this plantation compare more than favourably with those from the best fully irrigated cane crops in Queensland. </para>
          <para>The establishment of the Ord irrigation scheme was an ambitious attempt to establish large-scale capital intensive irrigated agriculture to utilise the vast quantity of an uncommitted water resource in tropical Australia. To some extent, it is also a pilot project in that its successes and failures have important implications for water and associated land resources in many other regions in the north. The economic and social disadvantages inherent in the remoteness of the Ord from markets and sources of supply must be balanced by the advantages of a farming system which permits the full utilisation of a 12-month growing season, and abundant water resources and radiant energy. Recent results at the Ord appear to indicate that such a system is gradually evolving. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          </para>
          <para>The Customs Tariff Validation Bill provides for the validation until 3 1 December this year, of customs duties collected, or to be collected, pursuant to Customs Tariff Proposals No. 8 ( 1 980 ) which were introduced into the House of Representatives on 1 May this year and which are not covered by the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill presently before the Senate. Proposals No. 8 give effect to the Government's decision on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on gearboxes, gears and shaft couplings. </para>
          <para>Under section 226 of the Customs Act the collection of duties in pursuance of customs tariff proposals is protected against legal challenge for six months or the close of the session of Parliament, whichever occurs first. The introduction and passage of a validation Bill is therefore a necessary machinery measure which takes over from section 226 pending introduction of a customs tariff amendment Bill, anticipated for the Budget sitting, to enact formally the changes contained in these proposals. I commend the Bill. </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1980 now before the Senate proposes amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. The purpose of this Bill is to enact tariff changes made by Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 31-35 (1979) and Proposals Nos 1-7 (1980) which have been introduced into the House of Representatives at different times since 25 October last year. It also gives effect to a decision by the Government to add certain circular saw blades to Schedule A of the New ZealandAustralia Free Trade Agreement from 1 January this year. Changes contained in this Bill arise, in the main, from decisions by the Government on the following reports by the Industries Assistance Commission: Baby carriages and parts therefor; coated copying film; certain engines not exceeding 7.46 kW; rotary cultivators; tractors having a power of less than 15 kW; dental materials; furniture; grapes and wine; passenger motor vehicles and components- import restrictions; removal of primage duty; rubber products; ships, boats and other vessels not exceeding 6,000 tons gross register; and spirits, spirituous beverages, etc. </para>
          <para>The Government has generally accepted the recommendations made by the Commission in its reports covered by this Bill and notes the Commission 's findings that acceptance of recommended levels of assistance will allow local industry to maintain its share of the market and continue a relatively constant level of employment. In some instances the Government has decided to defer introduction or phasing in of the long term level of assistance recommended by the Commission in order to help local manufacturers consolidate their market position or assist in a period of development. The Commission's recommendations in its report on grapes and wine and on spirits, spirituous beverages, etc., were generally not accepted by the Government. The Government considered that it was not an appropriate time to reduce levels of protection to wine producers and grape growers as it could hamper their efforts to adjust production to market requirements. The Commission's recommendations for spirits which proposed slight increases in duties to most potable spirits were considered by the Government to provide little impact on imported spirit prices and would have required Australia to enter into negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to obtain release from tariff bindings on certain spirituous beverages. The Government did, however, reduce the excise rate for grape brandies to enhance the competitive position of these products. </para>
          <para>This Bill also contains amendments giving effect to Government initiatives on Australia's trade with developing countries. The Government decided that an anomaly existed in that developing countries were disadvantaged because of the existence of a preference available to certain goods from British sources and it was decided to eliminate the preferential margin on some 500 items from 1 January 1980. In addition, a review of developing country preferences resulted in the provision of new or increased margins of preference for an additional 66 products from developing countries. Other main amendments contained in the Bill arise from Australia's bilateral settlements with the United States of America, Japan and the European Community. As a result of negotiations, rates of duty applying to a number of tariff items  have been reduced. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will also recall that the Government introduced last year a 2 per cent revenue duty on certain imported products. At that time exemptions from the revenue duty were provided for goods bound at a free rate of duty under international trade commitments. However, subsequent examination revealed that certain goods were bound at levels between free and 2 per cent and the imposition of the special revenue duty on those goods constituted a breach of our international commitments. Corrective action is contained in this Bill to provide exemption from 1 July 1 979. A consolidated list of amendments setting out the nature of changes in duty rates and the origin of each change have been prepared and copies are available from the Senate Records Office. I commend the Bill. </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the protection of Antarctic wildlife and for the preservation of areas of outstanding ecological and scientific importance in the Antarctic. The conservation measures contained in the Bill arise from a long-standing international agreement first recommended at the 3rd Antarctic Treaty consultative meeting in 1964. The Antarctic Treaty is a corner-stone of international and Australian policies for Antarctica. Maintenance of Australia's sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory is, of course, the other major consideration in our policy. I should like to take this opportunity to inform honourable senators of the ways in which these national and international obligations come together in the Government's Antarctic policy. </para>
          <para>Australia was an original signatory to the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 and continues to play an active and positive role in the support and development of the Treaty organisation. The Antarctic Treaty has ensured that Antarctica remains a zone of peace and international co-operation. This is a remarkable and valuable achievement. The Treaty nations have established an excellent tradition of co-operation and open scientific investigation. The knowledge gained in the various national research programs is available for the development of management plans and guidelines for future development. I am pleased to say that Australia is at the forefront of this cooperation and that it is this Government's policy to maintain and stengthen that position through increased scientific research. I am especially encouraged by the progress made towards a convention for the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. These negotiations are likely to be finalised at a meeting in Canberra in May this year. The proposed convention will ensure that any exploitation of the living resources of the Southern Ocean is conducted according to sound ecological and environmental principles. </para>
          <para>There is widespread speculation that Antarctica may be the site of an unprecedented minerals boom in the 1980s and beyond. Investigations of the continent's resource potential are in a very early stage and the environmental and legal problems have yet to be fully assessed. It is the Government's policy that active programs of research will be directed to the possible environmental effects of exploration and exploitation so that future developments can be based on sound principles. Over the next few years, development of international guidelines for exploration and mineral development will have high priority at Treaty party consultative meetings. In the meantime all nations have agreed to refrain from commercial exploration and exploitation. Australia will be active in ensuring that any agreement made on this matter takes into account the special environmental problems of the Antarctic and includes rigorous controls to limit environmental impact. </para>
          <para>Antarctic nature conservation and environment protection rank high in priority in both the Antarctic Treaty and Australian Government policy. The Bill presently before the Senate gives effect to one of the major conservation agreements negotiated under the Antarctic Treaty. Known as the 'Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora' this agreement establishes a system of wildlife protection which is one of the most stringent internationally agreed conservation regimes anywhere in the world. The agreed measures have, until now, been implemented by means of administrative action by the Department of Science and the Environment. The Bill now before the Senate will give the agreed measures force of law. </para>
          <para class="block">Under the agreed measures all wildlife in Antarctica is protected. Indigenous animals and plants may be collected only when specific permits are given. The agreement ratified by this Bill makes provision for three categories of special protection: </para>
          <para>Specially Protected Species may be declared where there is evidence that the survival of the species is under threat. Collection of these species can be undertaken only for compelling scientific reasons. </para>
          <para>Specially Protected Areas may be declared to protect delicate habitats or the breeding grounds of birds or seals. </para>
          <para>Sites of Special Scientific Interest are reserves declared for their outstanding value as natural laboratories for scientific inquiry. Such areas are declared on the advice of the international scientific community. </para>
          <para class="block">Honourable senators will be aware of the damage caused in this country by feral animals such as rabbits and goats and of the way in which plants such as lantana and cacti have changed the Australian environment. The Antarctic Treaty nations are anxious to avoid such problems in Antarctica. Accordingly, the Bill establishes controls over the importation of animals and plants. This measure is also intended to avoid the introduction of diseases in the breeding colonies of native birds. The Bill covers both the activities of Australians anywhere on the Antarctic continent and the activities of any national in the Australian Antarctic Territory. The permit system to be established under this Bill gives the Minister power to regulate organisations and individuals in respect of activities involving wildlife and their habitat. </para>
          <para>The Bill also provides for the making of regulations to cover the control of pollution, the use of motor vehicles and other issues relating to environmental protection. As a consequence of Australian sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory we have a special responsibility to ensure that the Antarctic environment remains protected from any adverse effects of human occupation. Increased activity on the continent, whether stemming from tourism or resources exploration, must occur only within rational guidelines for environmental protection. This Bill provides these guidelines in the Australian Antarctic Territory and supports measures elsewhere in Antarctica. The provisions embodied in the Bill represent the culmination of long and carefully considered efforts by many nations including Australia, and constitute an important step forward in the protection of the Antarctic environment. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">War Graves  Bill 1980 </para>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to give statutory recognition to the establishment, care and maintenance of Australian war graves and to create the position of Director of War Graves. No legislation dealing directly with the administration of war graves, apart from inclusion in Appropriation Bills of proposed expenditure in this area of operation, has ever been passed by the Parliament. </para>
          <para>Before proceeding to the scope of the Bill, I feel that I should provide honourable senators with some background information on the ways in which Australia has commemorated those men and women who died in action, or afterwards. The practice of commemorating Service dead began when the Imperial War Graves Commission, later renamed the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, was created by royal charter in 1917 to act on behalf of governments of British Empire countries to mark and care for permanently the graves of men and women of the forces who died in the 1914-18 War. Later the royal charter was extended to include the graves of those members of the Commonwealth forces who gave their lives in the 1939-45 War. Whilst the Commission's responsibility is confined to war deaths during either one or other of the world wars, it has been the policy of successive Australian Governments since the 1 9 1 4- 1 8 War to extend equal commemoration to all Australians who, irrespective of cause of death, have been awarded the Victoria Cross; whose deaths have been accepted by the Department of Veterans' Affairs as being due to service in any campaign involving Australian forces; or whose deaths have not been accepted as being due to service, but who were receiving at the time of death a disability pension at the special rate for total and permanent incapacity. </para>
          <para>The Office of Australian War Graves, a division of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, acts on behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in caring for graves of those men and women who died in the two world wars, and also on behalf of the Australian Government in caring for the graves of other eligible Australian Service dead. The extent of the operations of the Office may be gauged by the fact that it cares for all Commonwealth war graves, cemeteries and memorials of the two world wars in Australia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon IslandsGuadalcanal and Norfolk Island. It also cares for war graves and memorials in Australia and Papua New Guinea of German, Dutch and French nationals on behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Under a special arrangement entered into with the Commission in 1974, the Office of Australian War Graves, as agent of the Commission, cares for and maintains the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery at Ambon, Indonesia. The Japanese War Cemetery at Cowra, New South Wales is also maintained by the Office of Australian War Graves by arrangement with the Government of Japan. </para>
          <para>The Office of Australian War Graves provides without cost to the relatives of deceased veterans a wide variety of assistance which includes kerbing, in filling, erecting of headstones and placing plaques on graves of veterans; plaques marking graves in lawn cemeteries; and placing ashes of deceased veterans in niches in Memorial Walls and sealing of those niches with plaques. The Office does not provide these services in circumstances where a private monumental work has been erected over a grave or where private arrangements have already been made for the ashes of a deceased veteran. However, it is policy of the Government that all ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen who died as a result of their service for Australia are equally commemorated. To that end gardens of remembrance were established in each State capital city and Launceston and suitably inscribed plaques bearing details of the deceased are erected. In this way, the deceased are honoured among those with whom they served in a place of dignity and peace. </para>
          <para>The scope of the Bill is limited to the purpose to which I have referred, namely creation of a statutory office of Director of War Graves. The function of the Director shall be, under the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, to administer the Department's war graves activities. The Bill provides for the Director to be appointed by the Governor-General and the terms and conditions of this appointment and the provisions for termination and resignation are spelled out in detail. The person appointed to the office will be responsible, under the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, for carrying out the activities of the Department in relation to war graves in Australia and overseas. It is further provided that an officer of the Australian Public Service if appointed as Director will retain all of his existing and accruing rights through the application of the provisions of the Officers' Rights Declaration Act. Provision is made in the Bill for an Acting Director to be appointed and for staff to assist the Director to be drawn from persons employed in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </para>
          <para>To allow honourable senators to be informed on the Department's war graves activities a provision has been included in the Bill that will require the Secretary to the Department to prepare and furnish an annual report to the Minister for presentation to Parliament. Provision has been made in the Bill for the Governor-General to make regulations relating solely to the office of Director. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>
          <para class="block">Australian War Memorial Bill 1980 </para>
          <para>The Australian War Memorial is the expression of the vision of that great historian <inline font-weight="bold">Dr C.</inline> E. W. Bean and the dedication of those responsible for its development over the years. It is well known as the nation's memorial to those who have fought and died for their country. It is also acknowledged as a major museum and the largest repository of relics, art works and memorabilia relating to war or war-like operations in which Australians have been involved. </para>
          <para>This Bill perpetuates and continues the Australian War Memorial. Its primary function has been a memorial and the Government is committed to the maintenance of this essential character. However, the Memorial has a number of other functions and following a request from the Board of Trustees, the Government agreed that they should be clarified and more specifically stated in the legislation. The opportunity has also been taken to update some of the provisions and bring them into line with the provisions of the statutes of other Commonwealth cultural institutions. Honourable senators will note, for example, that many of what might be called the administrative clauses of this Bill are identical with those in the Museum of Australia Bill which was introduced into the Parliament earlier this session. One of the changes originally proposed was that the title of the Institution be changed to 'The Australian War Memorial Museum '. After further consideration following discussions with the Board of Trustees and, may I say, a number of representations, the Government has now decided that the present name will be retained. </para>
          <para>I now turn to some of the principal features of the Bill. The 1962 legislation created a situation whereby part of the collections of the Memorial were owned by the Commonwealth and part by the Memorial. This, as honourable senators will appreciate, created administrative difficulties for the Board of Trustees. To overcome these difficulties, the Bill provides for the ownership of all the collections to be vested in the Memorial. This provision does not apply, however, to material deposited with the Memorial by other agencies. The Memorial will continue to have custody of such material but control over it and access to it will remain with the department or authority that deposited it. With the Memorial taking over ownership of the collections, it will no longer be appropriate for the governing body to be known as the Board of Trustees. The Bill, therefore, provides for the appointment of a council. The appointment provisions remain unchanged other than that members are to be appointed for specified terms instead of as at present at the Governor-General 's pleasure. </para>
          <para>For a number of years, the Memorial has been concerned to depict not only conflicts in which Australians have been engaged, but also the events leading up to conflict on all sections of the community. It has been increasingly important to explain the reasons underlying Australia's involvement in war and war-like activities as the changing population base in Australia has resulted in the majority of Australians having no direct association with our military history. It is a proud history, and whilst we do not set out to glorify warfare, we do have a responsibility to explain Australia's role in it- particularly to the younger generations and to those Australians who have recently migrated to this land and made it their own. For this reason, the Bill provides specifically for the educational responsibilities of the Memorial and for it to assist in the creation and maintenance of museums in military establishments. </para>
          <para>The Bill overcomes another anomalous situation. Whilst the trustees have been responsible for the management of the Memorial, staff provided and funds appropriated for the operation of the Memorial have not been under their control. The Department of Home Affairs has been responsible both for the provision of staff and for the expenditure of these moneys but in future both staff and funds will be under the direct control of the Council. </para>
          <para>There are a number of other provisions in this Bill which differ from the present arrangements. They relate to such matters as the office of the </para>
          <para class="block">Director, receipt and expenditure of appropriated and other funds and delegations. They are mainly standard provisions, similar to those in the legislation of other comparable institutions. </para>
          <para>The net effect of this Bill is to maintain the primary purpose of the Memorial and to update and clarify its legislation- in other words, to give it an up-to-date charter. I believe that the members of its Council will be able to exercise their responsibilities more effectively and consequently more Australians will be able to appreciate and to understand the heroism and the sacrifices of those who contribute to the defence of this country. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- The Western Australia Agreement (Ord River Irrigation) Bill 1980 is consistent with one of the recommendations in last year's report of the Commonwealth-State Ord River Irrigation Area Review Committee- chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Young-which suggested that some of the funds for which provision was made under an earlier Act for the distribution of water in the Ord Valley, should be made available to finance facilities to provide for the storage and processing of crops. That is what this Bill seeks to do. Apparently it will provide initially for the appropriation of $350,000 for the construction of storage facilities for about 1 ,200 tonnes of rice. It is a loan only, and for that reason the Opposition will not oppose the Bill. According to the second reading speech the capital is to be amortised by rice growers over the years. I presume that the Western Australian Government will be responsible for the repayment of the loans should the growers default. I invite the Minister for National Development and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> to clear up that matter when he replies to the second reading debate. I certainly hope that the Western Australian Government will be responsible for it, because that Government is responsible for the whole scheme. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The original Ord River scheme was bom out of political opportunism and intellectual sloth. It has been sustained ever since by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court's vanity. The original Act was pushed through in 1967 because the Liberal and Country Party coalition thought it would lose the fifth Senate seat in Western Australia. It thought $100m worth of pork barrelling in the Kimberley region was a quite acceptable price to pay for securing that fifth Senate seat. Since then, more than $ 100m- a good deal more than $100m if we use current value terms- has been sunk into the scheme, as well as an annual direct subsidy from the Western Australian Government of about $4m and an indirect subsidy greatly in excess of that because Cunnunurra is a government pensioner town. Half the work force are government employees and if anyone cares to stand in the street at any time of the day or night he sees that most of the vehicles driving up and down have Western Australian government registration plates on them. It is a Western Australian government pensioner town sustained by a Premier who claims to be an apostle of free enterprise and who is hostile to any suggestion that government bureaucracy should be expanded or, as he puts it, more bottoms should be put on more seats. All of that is to sustain a handful of farms. </para>
          <para>The nation will never get an economic return for the capital that has been sunk into this scheme, although some farms might at some stage be able to operate profitably provided the initial capital expenditure in excess of $ 100m is written off. With the return to rice growing in the Ord area, the wheel has turned a full circle. When the scheme was first seriously pushed by the Western Australian Government, a diversion dam was constructed in 1962, rice growing was carried out and was supposed to have had a great economic future. It was supposed to have been the major crop which would make the Ord viable. A rice mill was installed in the Ord in the early 1 960s. It was transported to Ayr in central Queensland after rice growing folded up in the Ord. Indeed, Queensland apparently has a continuing source of very cheap machinery available to it as project after project fails at the Ord River. Queensland has taken over the rice mill which was shifted away in the 1960s. More recently, it has taken the cotton gin since cotton growing was also abandoned in the Kimberleys. </para>
          <para>The rice growing fantasy is one of the later fantasies of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court.  His  latest fantasy is that the Ord is destined to become a major energy-producing region of Australia because, says he, it will be generating hydro-electricity for Darwin, although there has been no cost-benefit analysis done on that, and it will be providing ethanol from sugar cane. Whilst it is possible that ethanol production might be economically viable from sugar cane or from some other form of carbohydrate in Australia, the Ord region is one of the last places where this is likely to be viable, first because it will lack the essential pre-requisite for success- that is a cheap source of carbohydrate- and also because it will not have a local market of sufficient size to use the ethanol in the optimum way; that is, as an extender for motor spirit. That is the latest fantasy that the Premier has about this region. </para>
          <para>There have, of course, been a whole series of Court fantasies. Back in the early 1960s they involved rice, sugar and cotton and later in the sixties kenaf, safflower and lot feed beef. The fantasy of lot feed beef is a hardy perennial which ignores the fact that, apart from cost, the greatest limiting factor of the Kimberley cattle industry is the poor reproductive rate. The harsh conditions do not allow a very high turnoff. Indeed, the turnoff is only about 10 per cent of the herd. Therefore that essential pre-requisite for establishing a significant beef lot feed industry there will not be present. The raw material- the cattle- will not be available in large numbers until the poor reproductive performance of the herd can be improved. Now we have the fantasy about peanuts and rice the second time around. </para>
          <para>When one looks at the sorry history of this project and at <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court's primary, dominant role in it throughout one cannot avoid coming to the conclusion that it is just as well <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court got out of the private sector when he did because if he had managed his own business with the same degree of ineptitude that he has displayed in managing the Ord River he would have been bankrupt a couple of decades ago. It is also worth questioning, since he is a selfacclaimed apostle of free enterprise, why he does not back this project with his own money instead of conscripting taxpayers' money to do it. I have frequently put that question to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles.</inline> I have never previously had an answer. I invite him again to answer. As the leading apostle of free enterprise at least on the western half of the continent, why does he not back this project with his own money instead of conscripting taxpayers' money to do so? One could also ask, since he sells everything out to foreign interests, why he does not sell the Ord River scheme out to foreign interests. But I do not need his answer. I can answer the question. It is because he cannot find any foreigners silly enough to pay out the $ 100m that has already been sunk into this scheme. </para>
          <para>So much for the sordid history of this project. The capital will never be recovered. It was an irresponsible investment, as I said at the beginning, born out of political opportunism and intellectual sloth and sustained ever since by the vanity of the Premier of Western Australia. The capital is, of course, not recoverable. We are not opposing this Bill. Whether rice growing will become commercially viable remains to be seen. It is at least better to be using the unallocated funds which are available under the original Act for something like this than for a further extension of the basis of the scheme, that is, the water distribution system to expand the area of land available for agriculture. </para>

            <para>- The Australian Democrats also support this Bill. In the few notes which I made, my language to describe the origin of the Ord River scheme is nowhere near as colourful as the words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh.</inline> I look forward to reading his comments tomorrow in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Although I do not doubt the accuracy of his description, my description is that even if the scheme was based on a false premise, even a political premise, we cannot walk away from it now. Whether or not is was well judged in the first instance, there certainly is a need to develop the north west of Australia and to prove the viability of such development. We believe the scheme does have potential. There is a potential for some agriculture in the future. There is also a potential for the development of a power grid, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> mentioned. But I remind him that quite often what might well be not viable economically can immediately become viable by the stroke of a government pen. I refer to a power grid and also to the extraction of power alcohol from sugar cane. Sometimes it is politically wise and wise in the interests of the nation for governments to intervene in the free market place for the good of decentralisation, which I would very much support. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Australia is ripping resources and money out of the north west. I think those of us in the big cities, particularly in the east, must remember that Australia is ripping diamonds, iron ore, oil and gas from the north west of Australia. Those of us who live in Melbourne, Sydney and other locations in the east should not complain about putting some money back into the area. </para>
          <para>The aim of this Bill is to give the north west a more balanced development, not just development in minerals. The remoteness of the area cannot even be conceived by those of us in Melbourne, Sydney or in the Canberra parliamentary triangle. One has only to spend some time there, as I am sure all of us have, to appreciate that. Indeed the future fuel price rises may so greatly increase the cost of freighting food to the north west that localised food production in that area may become more competitive and even essential. Because of the shortness of time, I limit my remarks to those few comments and say that the Australian Democrats strongly commend this Bill. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I will be brief. I am grateful that the Bill is supported on both sides of the chamber. It amends the Western Australian Agreement (Ord River Irrigation) Act so that loan funds still available under the Act can be used for handling and processing facilities for produce from the Ord River irrigation area. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> posed a couple of questions. I indicate that the agreement is with the Western Australian Government, not with the rice growers. The Western Australian Government will be responsible in terms of repayment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> I think, gave the impression that the Commonwealth was committed to the extent of $ 100m. He may not have intended that. The Commonwealth in fact is committed under the agreement to a sum of $48. 18m of which about $24m is still available. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Ord River scheme is controversial. May I simply say this, and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> will agree with me: In the driest continent on earth, in a continent that lacks rivers, any water conservation scheme deserves the fullest testing because if there is one resource that we lack and one resource that we need, it is water. Although we have had difficulties in our journey so far, I think it is wrong and too early to condemn a situation in which with growing technology particularly in the area of irrigated tropical agriculture we may well develop abilities to put this area to very good use. I should think we all ought to strive towards that end, particularly, I reiterate, as water is our most precious asset. On that basis I commend the Bill. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition supports the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Bill. The Bill in effect ratifies Agreed Measures for the conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora. The Agreed Measures were decided upon at the Third Antarctic Treaty consultative meeting held at Brussels on 2 to 13 June 1964. At that meeting it was recommended that the Agreed Measures be approved and implemented by the Treaty countries as soon as possible. Yet now, almost 16 years later, after agreement has just been reached concerning the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the Government has finally seen fit to put the Agreed Measures into effect. One hopes that Australia, as the depository country of the recently agreed to Convention and with the international headquarters for the Convention to be established in Hobart, will take considerably less time than 1 6 years to ratify the Convention. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Opposition, in supporting the Bill, has some justifiable qualms about the Government's credentials in giving effect to it. This Government has a dubious record on environmental protection. We are all aware of the conflicting views of members of the Government on drilling of the Great Barrier Reef. They are strong on platitudes and weak on action. My main concern is that the Government adheres to the spirit of the Agreed Measures as well as to the legal terms. The Government's past record in that respect is not very encouraging. The Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Thomson),</inline> in his second reading speech in the other place, stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There is widespread speculation that Antarctica may be the site of an unprecedented minerals boom in the 1980s and beyond. Investigations of the continent's resource potential are in a very early stage and the environmental and legal problems have yet to be fully assessed, lt is the Government's policy that active programs of research will be directed to the possible environmental effects of exploration and exploitation so that future developments can be based on sound principles. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I am perturbed by the Minister's statement which, whilst stating that environmental research will go ahead, implied that future exploration and exploitation development will proceed regardless of the result of the research. At present Australia spends $2m a year on all types of research in the Antarctic. The Antarctic Research Policy Advisory Committee in November 1979 recommended greatly increased funding for a high quality research program concerning the living and mineral resources of the Antarctic and the environmental effects of their exploitation. Any exploitation or exploration of the resources in the fragile Antarctic environment will almost certainly have substantial environmental effects. I hope that the Government will be able to accept results of research which recommend non-exploitation strategies in environments which are shown to be very fragile. I would like to think that Antarctica will not be viewed by the same greedy eyes which at present are turning their attention to the Great Barrier Reef and that a sensible environmental policy will be established under the regulations of the Bill. </para>
          <para>The Bill before the Senate in its present form does little to provide for environment protection in Antarctica as such. Only by the implementation of programs under the regulations can this Bill be effective. The Government must carry out its responsibility and apply the spirit of this legislation. We note that the jurisdiction of this Bill applies to Australian citizens throughout the Antarctic. This means that an Australian citizen needs a permit to take flora and fauna out of as well as into the Australian Antarctic Territory. But if an Australian had a permit or authority of a government which approves the Agreed Measures, that person can act according to that particular permit or authority. This therefore takes into account the legitimate, scientific studies undertaken by other countries and illustrates the international interests and cooperation in respect of Antarctica. </para>
          <para>Countries which ratified the Agreed Measures and therefore those which are permitted to take flora and fauna, recognised by this Bill are Argentina, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Japan and Belgium have not ratified the Agreed Measures. These 12 countries, plus Poland, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany were the countries involved in meetings held over the past weeks in Canberra and which passed agreement on the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. This Convention will come into force when eight of these states have ratified it. </para>
          <para>Pressure has come from countries outside the Treaty nations for access to Antarctica's potential wealth. There have also been calls that Antarctica should be preserved as a heritage area for all of mankind. The lack of research, information and technology make the exploitation of Antarctica's resources- both living and nonlivinga very risky business, both in monetary and environmental terms. I feel that the Minister's statement made in the other place was rather bland and expansive about the development in Antarctica. It seemed to be based on rhetoric rather than common sense. I would hope that this Government gives much more thought to the subject of the Antarctic environment, both marine and terrestrial. </para>
          <para>Australia must use its influence to persuade those nations involved in the Antarctic to think first about the environment of the Antarctic. We in Australia are vitally affected by environmental conditions in the Antarctic. Our weather patterns are to a significant extent influenced by the Antarctic. Mindless exploitation of the Antarctic could detrimentally affect the future environment of Australia. I repeat that the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. </para>

            <para>- I also welcome the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Bill 1980 and will make a few brief remarks about it. I call the attention of the Senate to the fact that, in November 1977, the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment of which I have the pleasure of being  Chairman  tabled a progress report giving an outline of policy matters for science and technology. Antarctica was among the topics mentioned in that report. In particular the Committee drew attention to the research being conducted in Antarctica by the Department of Science and the Environment and pointed out that the results of this research had considerable significance for the growing awareness around the world of the resources and potential of the Antarctic. It emphasised that important, far reaching decisions were imminent regarding the future of the region and that Australia's science and technology policy must, before then, have developed to a point so that relevant contributions could be made to the international debate on the future of Antarctica. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Nothing has altered since then to reduce the relevance of those comments. If anything, awareness of our ignorance of the region has been heightened. Wise decisions concerning the future of Antarctica can only be made from a position of knowledge and that means scientific knowledge. I believe our knowledge of Antarctica for any purpose of conservation, let alone sensible exploitation and associated protection, is quite inadequate. </para>
          <para>The structure and composition of the continental shelf is also almost completely unknown. Our information concerning the <inline font-style="italic">wildlife of</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Antarctica is but sketchy, particularly that relating to the marine life. Its interrelationship and mutual dependencies have hardly been studied. The Antarctic ice mass has a profound influence on the world's climate. We are all aware of the various scenarios which could result in a melting of the icecap, yet the meteorological mechanisms involved are very poorly understood. In this connection, I cannot stress too strongly the role the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica plays in controlling the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Much of the carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels such as petrol, oil, or coal is eventually dissolved in the oceans. This is most fortunate, for were it not so, the greenhouse effect of this build-up would have led already to the melting of the ice and consequent inundation of much of the habitable world. </para>
          <para>The Southern Ocean is of particular importance in this situation because solubility of gases in water increases with the lowering of temperature. Yet the fate of carbon dioxide and other atmospheric pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, once dissolved in the ocean, is at best speculative. Nor is it really known what the absorptive capacity of the oceans for these gases happens to be. Already the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere has increased considerably in modern times. Even so, we contemplate with equanimity energy policies which cheerfully propose a fourfold increase in coal consumption before the end of the century, coupled with rising oil consumption. In view of our ignorance about the fate of atmospheric carbon dioxide, such energy policies may be completely mistaken. </para>
          <para>Accordingly, I urge that the maximum possible support be given to Australian Antarctic research, with particular emphasis on studies aimed at a proper quantitative understanding of the relationship between atmospheric carbon dioxide and the oceans. In the interests of time, I seek leave to have two articles incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>
          <para>The first article, entitled 'World ecology is endangered', is from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 16 April, and deals with an examination by a panel of internationally recognised scientists. They told the United States Congress:   . . that the world could face an ecological disaster unless the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is controlled. </para>
          <para class="block">The second article is older, having been written on 28 February 1977. It is entitled 'Heating Up: Global Race for Antarctic's Riches', and I wish to have only highlights of that article incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

            <para class="block">World ecology is endangered </para>
            <para>A panel of internationally recognised scientists has told the United States Congress that the world could face an ecological disaster unless the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is controlled. </para>
            <para>The scientists, testifying before the Senate energy and natural resources committee, said the increase posed a long term threat to the world. </para>
            <para>There is little question as to the reality of the increase, or the rate, ' said <inline font-weight="bold">Dr William</inline> Kellogg, one of the scientists. </para>
            <para>Increased burning of coal, oil and natural gas is the main cause, and clearing of the world 's forests also is significant. </para>
            <para>Within 40 or 50 years the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere may cause the so-called 'greenhouse effect' to begin- heating the Earth, possibly melting the polar ice caps and raising the level of the oceans. Coastal cities could bc flooded while inland crop lands could be turned into dust bowls. </para>
            <para>Decisions made now would determine how fast carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere and thus how warm the Earth becomes and how rapidly the changes occur. </para>
            <para>But political expediency- including the US decision to make coal its main fuel source in coming decades- is aggravating the problem. </para>
            <para>In the long run, the United States may learn to its discomfort that coal is as dangerous as nuclear power- and perhaps more so, the scientists said. </para>
            <para>The scientists include <inline font-weight="bold">Dr David</inline> Rose of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Wallace</inline> Broecker of Columbia University, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr George</inline> Woodwell of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Gordon</inline> Macdonald of the Mitre Corporation in Virginia, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kellogg</inline> of the National Centre Tor Atmospheric Research, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr David</inline> Burns of the American Association for the Advancement of Science </para>
            <para>The hearing was called to discuss recent research into the problem. In opening the hearing, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paul</inline> Tsongas noted that a report by the National Academy of Sciences had put carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere at 333 parts per million (PPM), an increase of 15 PPM in 20 years. </para>
            <para> If scientific estimates prove correct, continued carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning plants . . . will cause carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to double in a bout 50 years, ' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tsongas</inline> said. </para>
            <para>Given this increase, by the middle of the next century, we will find that the gradual rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide will have caused a conspicious warming of global temperatures, with related effects on rain and wind patterns. ' </para>
            <para>The scientists generally agreed with the figures, but noted that programs to restore the world 's forests and stop massive deforestation must also be a part of any solution. That will cause a problem in the Third World, they noted, because leaders there have strong incentives to clear forests for farming. </para>
            <para>If I can oversimplify things somewhat, the attitude of the developing countries is that they have problems much greater than carbon dioxide, ' <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kellogg</inline> said. </para>
            <para>The scientists also were critical of President Carter's decision to begin a massive program to develop synthetic fuel from coal and convert the nation 's power plants to coal. </para>
            <para>Confronted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tsongas</inline> 's hypothetical choice between coal and nuclear power, the scientists said they couldn 't decide which was safer for the environment. </para>
            <para>The choice you give me is an impossible choice,' <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Woodwell</inline> said. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kellogg</inline> called the two 'equally dangerous in different ways', but noted nuclear power carries 'psychic problems'. </para>
            <para>I would not rule out nuclear,' <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Macdonald</inline> said. 'In my view, ii can be used in such a way to pose less of a hazard than a much higher usage of synthetic fuel and coal. ' </para>

            <para>- I rise briefly to support this legislative measure, which places in statutory form the commitment already given informally, I believe, over the years by the Australian Government to the preservation, so far as is possible, of the fauna and flora of the Antarctic region, which grows and prospers in the delicate, fragile sub-environments within the cold wilderness that generally characterises the great continent to our south. The convention that the legislation purports to carry out has to do with the flora and fauna of that region. There is no doubt that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> indicated, in an energy-hungry world nations' commercial enterprises and ventures with the billions of dollars which are necessary to secure vast energy resources will be looking to the Antarctic region to secure the great reserves of coal and other minerals and energy resources that may be locked in that frozen wilderness. In doing so of course, they may very well disrupt the fragile microenvironments within which the flora and fauna of the Antarctic prosper. For that reason, every step that can be taken to secure those environments against the depredations of those whose only goal is profit is to be welcomed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is to be noted also that the Government took a leading role in the organisation of the conference held in Canberra over the last two weeks which dealt with the living marine resources of the oceans and the area of the Antarctic. As a senator for Tasmania, I have a very particular interest in the proposed convention which emerged at that meeting. </para>

              <para>- I attended the conference as an observer from this Parliament, along with many other senators from both sides of this chamber. I am pleased to say that one of the features of that conference was the total community support evidenced by the bipartisan political approach of senators and representatives and the total community support throughout Australia for the preservation of this area as a zone of peace and scientific development. The usual conflicts between nation states, which have characterised history, and the usual approach to resources which characterise mankind generally, may be put to one side in order that this area to our south may become a model of the future community within which we all try to co-operate to secure a habitable place for our children and our children 's children. </para>

          <para>In speaking as a Tasmanian senator, rather than simply a citizen of the world, may I say how pleased I was to see that the State Labor Government and the Federal Liberal Party and National Country Party Government were able to come to an agreement whereby the world Antarctic headquarters for the International Antarctic Commission are to be located in Hobart. This decision carries to its logical conclusion the initiatives of the Whitlam Government and in particular the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Coates, who will be joining this Senate after the next elections, which led to the decision to locate the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Antarctic Division in Hobart. That decision has been carried through with the support of members and senators from both sides of both Houses of Parliament, and was assisted by the active prodding of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ken</inline> Wriedt who is in this chamber to listen to this very important debate. The CSIRO Antarctic division not only has been sent to Hobart, but also the Government has decided to establish a marine science centre in Hobart and this will include transferring the CSIRO division of Fisheries and Oceanography. This adds to the status of Hobart as the future logistic centre for scientific and commercial developments and understanding of the Antarctic region. </para>
          <para>It is worthy of note that the University of Tasmania has had a proposal before the Government for at least two years that a centre of excellence be established at that university to deal with marine and Antarctic studies. It is proposed to draw upon the already expert body of persons within the university. As a centre of excellence it will attract people of international reputation. A marine and Antarctic study centre should be established which would provide that depth of research which, in co-operation with the CSIRO and the International Antarctic Commission, would add to the status of Hobart not only as a providoring and service port, but also as a scientific headquarters for the proper understanding of that vast region to our south. It is a matter of some concern to me that after two years the Government still has not come to a decision. We certainly look forward to the establishment of that centre of excellence within the University of Tasmania. </para>
          <para>It is good to note that the Government has overcome some of its concern about its cooperation with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in allowing the Ambassador from the USSR- accredited to the recent conference held in Canberra- to travel to Hobart to acquaint himself with the facilities available for the operations in the Antarctic. </para>

              <para>- I believe he was one of several ambassadors who travelled on a VIP aircraft to Hobart in order to see for himself the great facilities of that marvellous port. I am not in any way point scoring; I am merely saying that that is a good, sensible, rational approach to the long term development of Tasmania as the headquarters for, perhaps, the bulk of marine activities in the great southern oceans and the Antarctic continent. I was pleased to see that out of that visit, also, the Government decided to establish a dry dock in Tasmania to service the fishing vessels and the other vessels which will be using the waters to our south. I think that leads to the next logical step which would be in harmony with the Government's permission for the negotiation of forward contracts to do with the sale of wheat to the Soviet Union. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I put in a special plea on this last day of the session that the Government consider the merits of permitting a re-opening of negotiations on the joint fishing venture which was proposed between James IXL and a Soviet fishing corporation. I suggest that it may be that, to be consistent and to ensure an even-handed approach to all regions of Australia, the Government not only permit the wheat growers to negotiate with a view to securing future contracts for the sale of their wheat but also allow this Australian company to continue negotiating and engaging in joint feasibility study with the Russians as joint venturers in order that we may establish whether a joint fishing venture could be based in Hobart because this is very important to the economy and to the employment prospects of southern Tasmania. I bring that matter into this debate because I think it would complement and supplement the efforts of both the Federal and the State governments to ensure that Tasmania does become, as I say, the logistic headquarters for both the commercial and the scientific understanding and development of the Antarctic. I finish, given the brief time available to us, with those few words and commend the Government for the steps taken so far in the preservation of that fragile environment to our south. </para>

            <para>199. Australian policy towards Antarctica is based on the premise that the region is an important one in which we have a history of involvement. As a consequence Australia has sought to maintain an adequate level of activity there and, as one of the twelve original signatories of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, to have its position respected and its voice heard in international forums concerned with Antarctic Affairs.

            <para class="block">International Interest in Antarctic Resources 200. The Antarctic Treaty contains no provisions specifically governing the exploitation of the resources of Antarctica. A significant recent development has been a growing international perception that the resources of Antarctica may be both accessible and rich, and a corresponding growth of interest in the possibility of their exploitation. Interest in Antarctic resources has been shown by United Nations bodies, particularly the Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO). 201. The concern of some Third World countries that the Antarctic Treaty Parties may act soon to exploit the resources for their own benefit could precipitate proposals to internationalise Antarctica. The recognition of the 'common heritage' concept in relation to the deep sea-bed in the Law of the Sea Conference is likely to stimulate moves for application of a similar concept to Antarctica. There has already been evidence of such moves in both United Nations bodies and in the Non-Aligned Movement. These developments raise the basic questions of the longer term tenability of Australian sovereignty over the AAT; of the extent to which the maintenance of sovereignty over the AAT might jeopardise the continuance of the Antarctic Treaty, including its demilitarisation, peaceful uses and non-nuclearisation provisions; and of what arrangements in the Antarctic would best serve Australia 's wider foreign policy interests, including our concern about our relations with the other Treaty Parties and the Third World. 202. Third World interest in the living resources of the Southern Ocean has been mentioned at recent meetings of the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI). Moves have been made in COFI, supported by Third World countries, to give COFI an active role in the management of the living resources of the Southern Ocean. These have been opposed by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties on the grounds that, while FAO and COFI have an undeniably legitimate interest in the living marine resources of the Southern Ocean, their proper role is one of information-gathering and evaluation. Moreover, the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties have a demonstrable role in the management of Antarctica and are currently engaged in the preparation of a regime for the conservation (and therefore the responsible management) of Antarctica 's marine living resources. In response to this, COFI has been prepared to modify its ambitions with regard to management. However, there is continuing pressure among the Third World countries in COFI and any failure or undue delay on the part of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties to conclude a responsible regime for the living resources of the Southern Ocean will undoubtedly result in further moves to have COFI more involved in the management of the living marine resources of the Southern Ocean. To date, the Antarctic Treaty partners have also been successful in heading off other Third World initiatives, including those by Sri Lanka aimed at persuading the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution for the internationalisation of Antarctica and that country's efforts in October 1976 to have included in the Declaration of the Non-Aligned Conference words to the effect that Antarctica was the common heritage of mankind. But it would seem likely that unless the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties can demonstrate a capacity to develop satisfactory resource regimes the dangers of Third World pressure building up will increase. 203. Australian policy must take account of the foregoing developments. However, other factors, which are difficult to assess, must also be taken into account. These include the outcome of the Law of the Sea Conference, the attitudes of the other Antarctic Treaty partners, the economic/ technological feasibility of exploiting Antarctic resources, and whether international pressures will strengthen among Third World countries in such a way as to require any change in our policy. Nevertheless, three possible policy approaches can be identified. They are: </para>

              <item label="(">
                <para>a ) <inline font-style="italic">Strict Adherence to Sovereignty</inline> 204. Australia has so far adopted the position in discussions among Treaty partners that nothing should be done in relation to the resources question which is not basically compatible with our sovereignty. This has been possible in the past because there has been little substantial discussion of resources in the Treaty context; such a position becomes harder to sustain as interest in resources grows. 205. The obvious advantage of a policy of strict adherence to sovereignty is that, if it were sustainable in political and enforcement terms, it would allow Australia to determine all aspects of the development of the AAT and its off-shore areas. We would be able to regulate exploitation, in the same way that we now regulate the mining industry in Australia. Such a policy would also meet our environmental interests by enabling us to impose our own standards and controls. However, in view of the very limited international recognition of our claim, there must be doubt as to whether it would be sustainable as it becomes feasible to exploit the resources in the region. At the least we would need to allow access on generous terms. If the sovereignty issue became contentious, we would have to consider whether the price, in terms of our international standing and broader political and economic interests and relations, would make a policy of strict adherence to sovereignty worthwhile. Such a policy would be seen by many developing countries as running counter to their ambitions; it could also run counter to the interests of the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan and other non-claimant Treaty Parties. </para>

                <para>
                  <inline font-style="italic">Internationalization</inline>206. Another approach would be to accept the internationalisation of Antarctica if it is proposed, or, indeed, to promote it. The premises of this approach would be that Australia cannot hope successfully to assert exclusive control of the resources of the AAT and its off-shore area, that increasing Third World pressure is inevitable, that the Treaty itself, based as it is on a privileged position for twelve (now thirteen') countries, will not provide a long-term solution, and that a new and comprehensive international regime for Antarctica can be established. Australia might therefore anticipate this situation through a bold and generous initiative to propose the internationalisation of Antarctica and the preservation of Antarctic resources for all mankind. Australia's acceptance or sponsorship of internationalisation, and our geographical posit-on, might enable us to retain a measure of political influence and a share of economic benefits (including possible use of Australian bases or entrepot facilities) under any eventual international regime for Antarctic resource exploitation. But this is essentially conjectural and any international 'appreciation' might be shortlived. However, to the extent that internationalisation could prevent Antarctica from becoming a scene of international discord, our defence interests would be served . It might also be conjectured that such a policy would enhance Australia's international standing, particularly among the Third World, with consequent advantages in other areas of foreign policy interest. 207. Such an initiative, if successful, would, however, mean the end of Australian sovereignty over the AAT, and domestic political repercussions could be expected. It would be highly desirable- some might say a prerequisite- for there to be full consultation with out our Antarctic Treaty partners with the object of obtaining their agreement. We should, however, have no illusions that the other Treaty Powers would be likely to support such an approach; and we would incur the displeasure, and indeed the anger, of at least some of them, for advancing it. It would also mean giving up to the international community most of any economic benefits and the exclusive environmental controls which sovereignty, in theory, gives us. Whether the 'spin-off' Australia might derive from participating in an international regime for Antarctica would compensate, and whether international environmental controls would meet our requirements, could not be forecast at this stage. </para>

                <para>
                  <inline font-style="italic">To Build on the Antarctic Treaty</inline>208. Another course- and the course in fact followed in current policy- is to seek to work within the Antarctic Treaty framework to develop new regimes to handle resource questions, together with the related questions of conservation and protection of the environment. In pursuing this course our basic objective is to derive as many as possible of the benefits of sovereignty rights over resources, including the living marine resources within Australia 's future 200 mile off-shore zone, without sacrificing our other policy objectives. In the context of the Treaty it is necessary to negotiate on the basis of sovereignty; but, in the recognition that the full exercise of sovereignty is unlikely to be sustainable, we have accepted that some flexibility is necessary in order to encourage others to participate with Australia in promoting mutually beneficial regimes for the exploitation of living resources and, at a later date, non-living resources. 209. The draft regime for Antarctic marine living resources, which is currently being negotiated by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, aims at the long-term conservation of these resources, thus ensuring their preservation as a future world food source. The establishment of such a regime by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties can be presented as a responsible action taken in the broader interests of the international community. 210. The Committee has felt obliged to address itself to Australia's interest and policies in relation to Antarctica because they clearly have Third World dimensions which could become more important wilh time. However, it does not feel called upon to make any recommendation in terms of the options canvassed. </para>

              <para>-As I said, the subject of Antarctica does not come before the Parliament very much for debate. It is a great shame that this is the case because a large number of issues arise from the Antarctic policy that need to be considered. I could illustrate that by indicating the titles of a number of articles that have appeared in various publications in recent months which raise issues of policy which the Australian Government needs to consider. For instance, in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of March this year a series of articles appeared entitled 'The Antarctic: Still Out in the Cold' by Denis O'Brien. On 19 September 1979 the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> ran an article called 'Polar oil war looms. Australia's claim angers diplomats'. On the same day the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> published an article entitled 'Demands on Antarctic. Australia wants resource rights'. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of 1 November 1979 published an article entitled 'High stakes in Antarctic power play'.

When one sees articles by militarists and lieutenantcolonels of one description or another raising the prospect of these military confrontations in the Antarctic, it is a pity that the Parliament has not had time to discuss these issues in any great depth. In November 1979 the Government presented a report of the Antarctic Research Policy Advisory Committee, once again indicating the size and scope of activities being undertaken in the Antarctic. This Parliament ought to be turning its attention to that.

              <para>- I presume that it is an attempt to prevent Newcastle disease reaching the wildlife of the Antarctic. The second is a lengthy prohibition on the importation into the Antarctic of dogs which have not been innoculated against certain diseases specified in Annex D of the Treaty. Although dogs are still used in the Antarctic, I understand that most of them are bred there for that purpose. </para>

          <para>This Bill gives domestic application to a treaty to which Australia has been a signatory for almost 20 years. The convention of the Preservation and Conservation of Wildlife and Living Resources and the 'Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora' are important international documents. It is important that Australia has at last taken this step to give effect to those agreed measures. This Bill is therefore very much to be welcomed as part of the Government's responsibility in the Antarctic and very much to be welcomed as giving further evidence of the concern which this Government has for issues of conservation and environment protection. </para>

            <para>- It is my intention to confine my remarks to the War Graves Bill 1 980. We received copies  of the second reading speech only a short time ago. The Bill was introduced about 25 minutes ago. Again I would like to say that it cannot be truly said that this is a proper House of review. I think having a second reading speech of a Bill incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and proceeding almost immediately to a full debate on the Bill gives the lie to the suggestion that this is a House of review. We have seen that happen on many occasions in the last week. The incorporated second reading speech of the Minister for National Development and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> states: </para>

            <para>The purpose of this Bil! is to give statutory recognition to the establishment, care and maintenance of Australian war graves and to create the position of Director of War Graves. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There are one or two things that I want to say in response to this Bill. The second reading speech also states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The scope of the Bill is limited to the purposes to which I have referred, namely the creation of a statutory office of Director of War Graves. The function of the Director shall be, under the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, to administer the Department 's War graves activities. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One question I would ask the Minister is whether the Bill enables the Director to provide funds to country sub-branches of the Returned Services League to enable its members to care for the graves of their fallen comrades. In recent months, the problem of caring for the graves of eligible Australian Service dead, particularly in country cemeteries, has been brought to my attention. Those maintaining the graves are entitled to assistance from the Office of Australian War Graves. I ask the Minister whether the Director, the statutory officer provided for in the Bill, can make assistance available so that it is not left to members of the local RSL to do all the manual work in caring for war graves in country areas. When I made inquiries I found that once a year in South Australia someone comes from Adelaide and polishes the plaques on the graves; but in other places the local RSL or the sexton of the cemetery is given money to purchase a lawn mower to keep the area in some form of order. This does not apply to all cemetries. That is why I ask: Does this Bill enable the Director to make moneys available? From discussions I have had particularly with the Mannum sub-branch of the Returned Services League in South Australia it is clear that it would be happy if, say $200, $300 or $400 were made available annually to local subbranches so that they could pay somebody a small fee to care for the graves of their fallen comrades. I put that request to the Minister. The other matter to which I want to draw the Minister's attention is set out in the second reading speech and it refers to clause 3. The Minister stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The person appointed to the office will be responsible, under the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, for carrying out the activities of the Department in relation to war graves in Australia and overseas. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">My concern is that the Director is in fact responsible to the Secretary to the Department of Veterans ' Affairs. In my view it would be much better if the Director were responsible to the Minister who, in turn, is responsible to the Parliament. There may be some good reasons why this action, which is outlined in the second reading speech, has been taken. Because this organisation will be a statutory body I am of the opinion that the Minister should accept any responsibility if this Act is not fully complied with. </para>
          <para>With respect to the matter of the Director having the responsibility for activities in relation to war graves overseas, I say in passing that last year on Anzac Day when visiting the German Democratic Republic I had the honour to be invited by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morris,</inline> who is the Australian Ambassador in East Berlin, to represent the Australian Parliament at the Anzac ceremony in the Potsdam war cemetery. My wife accompanied me on this visit. It was a very impressive ceremony and I want to pay tribute to the people in the office of the Department of Foreign Affairs in East Berlin who, knowing that I was in that country, invited me to represent the Australian Parliament at that ceremony. On a tour of that cemetery I found headstones commemorating 1 1 Australian ex-servicemen from the First World War. When speaking to my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> 'Byrne, on my return he reminded me that during World War II he was a prisoner of war at a camp which was about 10 miles away from the Potsdam war cemetery. He was quite interested to know that not only did I visit the Potsdam cemetery but also the Cacilienhoff Castle where the Potsdam War Agreement was signed. It was an interesting experience for both my wife and me to see what had been done there. I would like to pay tribute to the East German people for the way in which they look after that war cemetery. I hope that all nations continue to look after the sections of their cemeteries which contain graves of Australian servicemen whether they be from World War I or World War II. </para>
          <para>I wish to raise a couple of other matters but I will leave them until the Committee stage. I hope that the Minister will be able to inform me whether some proviso will be allowed to the Director to make money available for country cemeteries? I referred to one such cemetery but there must be many others. Money could be made available to the local RSL sub-branches to carry out maintenance of war graves. I am sure it would not cost the Government as much if a local person were given a few hundred dollars a year. This is preferable to having to pay somebody to travel all day- it is only about 60 miles from Adelaide to Mannum- to maintain war graves. But other cemeteries would be much further away. It would be much cheaper in my view if this were done. It would be welcomed by the local people if they could get some remuneration for carrying out the work themselves. </para>

            <para>- The Australian War Memorial Bill is a very important piece of legislation because it relates to one of our major national institutions. It in fact perpetuates the Australian War Memorial and I believe in many ways strengthens it and its administration. The Act will create a council to administer the War Memorial and to oversee its collection. The collection in the Australian War Memorial is one of the most important of its kind anywhere in the world, one of which I think this country can be very proud and one of which those people who have been in charge of that collection over many years can also be very proud. I know that a great deal of work is now going on to ensure that that collection is properly displayed and conserved for Australians in the future so that they might be better aware of the very important traditions and heritage of the nation. I also mention in passing that the Australian War Memorial is the most popular tourist attraction in the national capital. </para>

              <para>-That is right; deservedly so, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> said. Each year about three quarter of a million people visit the Memorial. They are mostly Australians and about 70,000 are school children. The Memorial has special importance for Australia and, of course, for Canberra as the national capital. </para>

          <para>The recent report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory which inquired into the future of the tourist industry in the Australian Capital Territory laid considerable stress on the need for Commonwealth departments and national institutions to make available to the public information about their activities. In this case, I refer to the very important collections of the War Memorial. The War Memorial is already established, as I mentioned a moment ago, as a major tourist attraction. It has many standing displays and facilities. I make the point in this debate that quite an urgent need is now developing for improvements in facilities at the </para>
          <para class="block">Australian War Memorial. As I see it, there is a need for improving facilities by the provision of a theatrette and classrooms where, for example, some of the 70,000 school children who visit the War Memorial each year might go to be informed directly of the role of the Memorial and the traditions and heritage which it commemorates rather than simply walking around and looking at the displays. </para>
          <para>There is a need for some work to be done on the entrance foyer and for improvements to public amenities at the War Memorial. For example, improvements need to be made to facilities for scholars because the Memorial contains a great deal of material on which research is constantly being done by scholars. It is important that the facilities for those scholars working at the War Memorial should be as good as possible. At this stage I think there is some need for upgrading of those facilities. I have mentioned only a few of the areas that require some work. This is a matter that I and others have taken up with the Government. Whilst I think this is very important legislation which, in its own way, strengthens the War Memorial and its administration and emphasises its significance to Australia, one hopes that action can be taken to ensure that the displays and the facilities for the public and for scholars working at the War Memorial will be upgraded. I hope that the Government will give very close attention to those matters. </para>

            <para>- The Senate is debating two Bills cognately, the War Graves Bill and the Australian War Memorial Bill. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> has made some comments on the War Graves Bill on behalf of the Opposition and I endorse his remarks. It is of the utmost importance to our nation that we take proper steps to preserve the memory of our comrades who fell in wars defending democracy and defending the peace and security of our nation. I shall make just a few remarks about the Australian War Memorial Bill. I welcome the introduction of this Bill because it seems to me that its measures provide for better management and administration of the major memorial to those who fell fighting for this country- the Australian War Memorial. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I speak as a pacifist when I make these remarks. As a pacifist, it seems to me that the Australian War Memorial is a great symbol of the tragedy and the waste of war. That is always the impression it makes on me and I hope on all Australians and overseas visitors who visit the War Memorial. It is not a memorial glorifying war in itself, although it properly glorifies the acts of many men and women who fought in wars. It is to me a memorial that reminds us of the tragedy and waste of war and should serve as a great and overwhelming caution against any future actions by our nation which could lead us into warfare again. Therefore, we are happy to see the Government taking steps to improve the administration and management of the resources available to the War Memorial. The Opposition has no argument with the Bill. </para>
          <para>I will make a few points on the resources available to the Australian War Memorial. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight</inline> has mentioned in some detail some aspects of the management of this memorial which need improvement. It seems to me and to the Federal Opposition that the resources available to the War Memorial are too meagre at this stage for the memorial to fulfil what the Minister for National Development and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> referred to in his second reading speech as the expression of the vision of that great historian C. E. W. Bean. We share the vision of that great historian with regard to the War Memorial, but it seems to us that the vision is not being realised with the present difficulties being experienced in regard to conservation, storage and training of persons to conserve the great and important collection of the War Memorial. As I speak, I am aware that a new storage and conservation facility has been established in the suburb of Mitchell in the Australian Capital Territory. It is a very advanced storage facility. I understand that all sorts of advanced technology has been introduced into that facility so that the question of the conservation of the collection of the Australian War Memorial is not the problematical one that it has been recently. Nonetheless, there are still some difficulties despite the establishment of this new facility for the conservation of the War Memorial 's collection. </para>
          <para>During a recent discussion with officers representing the War Memorial in Senate Estimates Committee E, I inquired about the level of staff available to the memorial, the wages of staff and unfilled positions. It seems to me that there is still a very serious shortage of trained conservators available to the War Memorial. At the moment there are ten unfilled positions. These unfilled positions range over a variety of levels of work but there is, clearly, a need for the War Memorial to have more trained staff mainly in the conservation area. During this Estimates committee discussion it was also pointed out that the cutback in funds available to the War Memorial has inhibited its educational function. For example, recently there was a very important conservators conference in Perth. The War </para>
          <para class="block">Memorial was unable to send staff to that conference to have the benefit of the discussions with regard to the conservation of the collection. If the War Memorial is to be the important educational institution to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight</inline> referred and is to continue to be the major tourist attraction of the Australian Capital Territory, I believe it deserves more resources, in terms of staff and financial allocation for salaries than it has at present. I make a plea to the Government to make such resources available. </para>
          <para>One of the reasons the War Memorial has so many unfilled positions for conservators and so forth is that in Australia we have been extremely lax in training people in these skills. There is a course currently at the Canberra College of Advanced Education to train conservators not only to work in the War Memorial, but also on the other great national collections in the National Library and National Gallery and it is to be hoped, if the Government makes money available, in the many regional galleries which also have very important historical artistic collections which are being destroyed through lack of funds to conserve them and through lack of trained conservators to work on them. </para>
          <para>I do not want to digress to deal with the general question of our national and regional art collections. To get back to the national collection of the War Memorial which is the greatest collection of its kind in the world, we need more people being trained in the job of conserving and preserving these collections. The course at the CAE I understand is a very good start in this direction. I have been informed that the training is adequate to the needs of the War Memorial. However, at the same time we need to attract the best of overseas conservators who have had the vast experience that the students coming from the CAE will not have had. In order to do that I believe the Government should review its staff ceilings so that more positions can be made available. But, more importantly, I think the level of salaries of staff should be reviewed so that the War Memorial will be in a position to compete successfully in attracting those experienced and trained conservators it needs to do the job, which we all agree on a bipartisan basis it is very important be done; and that is to preserve and maintain our important collection at the War Memorial so that Australians of the future and overseas visitors will have access to it. </para>

            <para>- I will not take much time of the Senate. Upon listening to the debate on these two Bills, the War Graves Bill 1980 and the Australian War Memorial Bill 1980, it comes to mind that, whilst there are some merits in the expenditure of funds for war graves and the expenditure of funds on the Australian War Memorial, there are walking around Australia today thousands of ex-servicemen who, for all sorts of reasons, are carrying memories of war, who are heading for the grave but who have never received any recognition. There are thousands of men who, in their teens, went off to World War II, for example. At that stage they would have received injury from all sorts of means, whether it be from enemy action or otherwise. But because there was a job to be done and because they were not malingerers, and could never be described as such, they carried on doing their duty and never reported their illness or injury. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In their older years they or, in some cases, their widows- the ex-servicemen having passed on- are no longer able to justify any claim to consideration according to the regulations laid down by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Whilst it is all very nice to talk about these sorts of things, I think at times some consideration should be given to some amelioration of the Repatriation Act so that some of these ex-service people who are still alive in Australia can obtain some form of justice. </para>

            <para>(3.34)- I thank the Opposition for the way in which it has dealt with the cognate debate on these two very important Bills, the War Graves Bill 1980 and the Australian War Memorial Bill 1980. I have noted the comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight</inline> with regard to the Australian War Memorial. I will draw the attention of the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan's</inline> comments with regard to further storage and training and staff ceilings, and seek from him and the Director any information that is able to be provided. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline>raised some questions with regard to the War Graves Bill. As he stated, the statutory Office of the Director of War Graves is one that shall be functioned through the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. He raised the question as to why a decision had been made that reporting and functioning be effected through the Secretary. I am not aware of any great matters that arose in this regard in the past, so this will have been the way in which the Director reported and functioned. I draw attention to the fact that there is the requirement for the Secretary to the Department to prepare and furnish an annual report to the Minister for presentation to the Parliament. The War Graves Bill contains a provision that requires this to be done. </para>
          <para>The Secretary to the Department also reports on defence service homes, on the Repatriation Act. It seems that it is appropriate that the report on the War Graves Act be made to the Parliament in this way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> also asked about superannuation rights. I draw attention to the fact that the people concerned are statutory employees. There are full superannuation rights available to them through the contributory scheme. I think that explanation will satisfy the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren.</inline></para>
          <para>The other matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> relating to war graves was the care that is given to those graves in some country, or outlying areas, by RSL branches. He sought information as to whether there is any provision for funds for those services. I am advised that under the Bill there are no specific funds that can be used to provide funds to RSL branches, but there is a means by which a contract can be arranged for the care of graves. In certain circumstances, where there are large numbers of graves, local contracts can be arranged. I am advised that there would be no reason why an RSL branch could not become a contractor under those circumstances and in that case there may be the provision of funds where there were a number of graves which required attention. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>those were the matters raised. I thank the Senate for its support of the Bills. I think that all Australians have a sense of history and are interested in the condition of and the way in which we administer our war graves and our War Memorial.

I am sure that many of the Returned Services League sub-branches will be very interested to know that they could become contractors, or could be recognised as contractors, if they so desire to care for war graves in country cemeteries. I will draw that to the attention of the secretaries of the many branches who have approached me.

          <para class="block">Service Homes Agreement Act. I am concerned in that members of parliament do not like to be put in the position where they have to be very critical of a public servant, and it appears to me that under this Act, if things about which members of parliament are concerned do not happen, they will have to stand up in this place and be critical of the departmental Secretary rather than the Minister. I suppose that we could frame our criticism, when we make it, by saying that it is not intended for the Secretary but that it is intended for the Minister. We would have to be very careful of that. I think we had an occasion here today when one of our members was criticised by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> for having directed his criticism at a public servant when, in actual fact, the criticism was intended for the Minister himself. </para>

            <para>-  That course is acceptable to the Opposition. I do not intend to speak for very long on these two Bills. The Customs Tariff Validation Bill validates, in advance, changes which may be made to Customs duties between now and the end of December. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill authorises retrospectively the various changes to the Schedule which have been made since, I think, last October. It affects a number of matters on which the Industries Assistance Commission had reported and on which the Government had subsequently taken action. Broadly the changes are in line with the recommendations made by the IAC, but in the case of wine and spirituous beverages, about which I will say a few words later, the IAC recommendation was not followed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The amendment I will move formally when the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is before the Senate expresses the opinion that a parliamentary standing committee ought to be established to peruse and make recommendations on changes to excise and customs. The practice until now has been that the responsible Minister, either in isolation or in association with other Ministers, presents the Parliament with a fait accompli. As we all know, a decision by the Executive is not subject to further scrutiny in the Parliament unless the Executive does not have the numbers in the Senate. Of course, those decisions are not always subject to further scrutiny then either. The experience between 1973 and 1975 showed that there is a stone wall in the Senate. In those days, the Senate certainly did not see its role as being one which may make marginal improvements to administration. It saw its role as being to prevent, to frustrate, the enactment of the policies of the elected government. </para>
          <para>Therefore, although plenty of legislation was rejected then it was done not in a constructive way, but in a totally destructive way. The people who adopted that wholly destructive approach between 1973 and 1975 have since retreated into their shells. Therefore, these customs tariff changes, matters on which many honourable members and senators could express a valid point of view, are never subjected effectively to the scrutiny of anyone outside of the Ministry. It was for that reason that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hurford,</inline> on behalf of the Opposition, moved in the other place that a committee be set up and I will be moving a similar motion in the Senate shortly. </para>
          <para>I wish now to give an example, by no means the only one available, of the way in which the Government murders the English language. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> is, of course, a prime exponent of that art. He refers not to permanent Public Service positions but to positions of permanency in the Public Service. I believe that the Government's propensity to write nonsense statements into second reading speeches is increasing. A very good example was provided by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> on 7 April in announcing the $80 a tonne subsidy for domestic consumption of liquified petroleum gas. He said that the primary objective was to direct liquid petroleum gas to its premium end uses, that is, as a petrochemical feedstock and an automotive fuel. Thus, in the very sentence in which he extols the payment of a subsidy of $80 a tonne for domestic consumption he adds that the Government's objective is to direct LPG to its premium end uses. That kind of doublespeak and sloppy English is creeping into Government second reading speeches more and more. The comment that caught my eye in the second reading speech on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1980, which related to tariff protection for wine and the excise on brandy, is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government considered that it was not an appropriate time to reduce levels of protection to wine producers and grape growers as it could hamper their efforts to adjust production to market requirements. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is quite a valid point of view- that it was not an appropriate time to reduce levels of protection- and doubtless very defensible. However, my point is that the Government, far from assisting the industry in its efforts to adjust production to market requirements, as it claims, is insulating the industry from market pressures. That sentence provides a classic example of doublespeak, in which the Government proclaims that its action is doing one thing when it is doing precisely the opposite. That is not to pass judgment on the issue itself, just on the lamentable and increasing practice of members of the Government, in second reading and other speeches, to indulge in doublespeak and newspeak, sloppy misuse of the English language and misrepresentation of facts. The real danger is that ultimately the Government will lose the capacity- if it has not done so already- to draw any distinction between fantasy and reality. </para>

I understand that there is to be an expression of opinion in relation to the second Bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, and a proposal that a parliamentary committee should be established, but I will deal with that matter when it is proposed during the Committee stage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> has expressed concern about the use of the English language. I suppose that is a change from his usual lecture on economic policy. Perhaps we should be thankful that he is complaining only about the use of English and not about economic policy as well.

            <para>- The Opposition protests most vehemently and strongly against the manner in which this important piece of legislation is being dealt with by the Parliament. It was introduced in the last couple of days in the House of Representatives. In the dying hours of the Senate this vital piece of legislation, probably one of the most important pieces of legislation before the Parliament, is being rushed through without adequate debate and understanding by the Australian community of its implications. It is indicative of the churlish attitude that the Government takes towards any system of equity in the whole political process in this country. It underpins the Government's attitude to the way in which the democratic processes should operate. This legislation is being rushed through the Parliament without adequate debate. It will mean a great deal in the fashioning of the election to be held some time between now and the end of this year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">We have all been aware for a considerable period of the inadequacies, failings and deficiencies of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The Bill, which seeks to remove any limitations on spending and to introduce a sky-is-the-limit concept concerning electoral expenditure by political parties and political candidates, is being dealt with in a very cavalier fashion by the Parliament under the leadership of the Fraser Government. </para>
          <para>The Government seeks to repeal sections of the existing Act and then to establish an inquiry after the event. That inquiry, like so many inquiries by this Government, obviously will be an inquiry in name only and will not have any effect on the important election which is coming up in 1 980. This is an indication of the way in which this Government operates and the way in which it seeks to maintain its hegemony, its domination, of the political processes. Its attitude is: We have the power, we have the media and we have the resources. We do not intend to share the power, the media and the resources'. Obviously it will maintain the inequities which have been with us for a considerable period. It is because the Opposition recognises the inequities and the unfairness of the existing system that I propose to move an amendment on behalf of the Opposition. I move: </para>
          <motion>
            <para>At end of motion, add, 'But the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill should provide for reasonable limits on electoral expenditure to be established following an urgent Parliamentary inquiry into methods of funding the democratic process. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">I think we are entitled to ask: Why can we not have such an inquiry during the three-month period in which the Fraser Government is putting this Parliament to rest? This parliamentary session will end this week- an unprecedented step. Twelve weeks will elapse before the Parliament reassembles. In that time we could hold a public inquiry in which the various interest groups in Australia could examine the way in which election funding is taking place, the way in which the process has been distorted as a result of the unfairness of the existing practices and the way in which this Government has the greatest share of spending so far as elections are concerned. </para>
          <para>I do not wish to challenge the recognition of the urgent need for electoral reform. The events in Tasmania give sufficient reasons for that. Challenges were made in that Senate because of some inadequacies in the legislative processes in that State. But those inadequacies have been recognised for some time. Indeed, they were recognised by the Australian Labor Party some five years ago when it sought the approval of the </para>
          <para class="block">Parliament for electoral reform. That would have avoided the necessity for the panic legislation which the Parliament is now consideringthe bungled legislation to which the Parliament is now asked to give assent. This is the way in which this Government proceeds. It is not unlike the red queen in Alice in Wonderland, who wanted to have the verdict first and then the trial. That is the way in which this Government is approaching this piece of legislation. </para>
          <para>The issues are substantial and important. They are not unique to Australia. Many other democratic countries have taken steps when confronted with similar problems of electoral expenditure and accountability. They have looked at different approaches, and different solutions have been found in different countries. But what has been adopted after investigations in countries similar to Australia is not what is contained in this legislation. The Opposition believes, as indeed most of the other democratic countries believe, that there should be a limit to electoral funding and expenditure and that there should be a disclosure of sources of funding. Surely no government should be afraid to accept those basic principles. They are basic, essential principles for the maintenance of a functioning democracy. Surely it has to be accepted that the way in which elections are financed is fundamental to the whole way in which the process should operate. </para>
          <para>If parties do not have equal access or adequate access to resources, it is clear that the system is lopsided. I suggest that that situation exists in this country. One party has unlimited access to unlimited funds and resources, and because it has that edge on every other political party it is able to wield excessive influence in the moulding of public opinion and in the functioning of the parliamentary process. The conservative parties also have greater access to the media. In fact, the media comprise one of the institutions that prop up this Government and its philosophy and ideology. It is because of that position in our society that this Government is able to win majority support. Those who want to put up a different philosophy, a different policy, suffer as a result of the substantial use of resources by the major parties. The smaller parties are at a disadvantage in this part of the political process. </para>
          <para>Anyone who knows anything about politics in this country would know that conservative parties are and have been the most corrupt of all political parties. They are corrupt in the sense that there is no disclosure of funds and there is no indication of how they are able to raise such large sums of money. Obviously it is from sources that are associated with it in its commercial arranagements. We have only to look at the end result to know that funds flow into the conservative parties in greater volume than they flow to any of the other political parties in our country. Nobody knows about the deals, subsidies and slush funds which clearly find their way to the conservative parties for election purposes. I do not suggest that individual members of the conservative parties are corrupt but I do suggest that the conservative parties are corrupt insofar as they receive funds from unnamed sources and are not prepared, as the 1975 debate showed, to have public disclosure of them. </para>
          <para>The Opposition makes the assertion that the Liberal and National Country Parties are the parties of slush funds in this country and that legislation which seeks to remove any limitations upon the collection of funds is something that should be the concern not only of the Parliament but also of every democrat within Australia. There should be public accountability about the source of funds, and equity in the way in which political parties operate, depending upon the source and the degree of support they have within the community. There ought to be principles of fair play and there ought to be an adequate share of access to the media. But there is not, as I will seek to show subsequently. </para>
          <para>Everybody knows that the media prefers the conservative parties because it shares the same philsosphical position and because it is part of the economic power group within our society. Everybody knows that the media is prejudiced against the Labor Party and against the Labor movement. Everybody knows that the media is prejudiced against small parties. Everybody knows that the media is prejudiced against any radical thought. We only have to define what radical thought is about to appreciate what that means because radical thoughts inevitably start from a small base and if they have any substance at all they subsequently attract majority support. Public access to an examination of those thoughts is difficult when the media and the conservative parties have this domination in the whole political process. </para>
          <para>Everyone knows that the big spenders can win because they are the big spenders. Everyone knows that it is the Liberal Party and the National Country Party which are the big spenders in the whole political process. Those of us who are involved in the political processes are aware that the very avaricious sectors of our economy, such as the multi-nationals and the mining sector, have been and are involved in funding the conservative parties. We do not have to look at many countries to appreciate that the big corporate and big business sectors have been involved in political scandals in Japan, Italy and in many other countries where funds have flowed into political parties as a result of commercial deals involving the party in power. We would be fooling ourselves if we did not realise that this is happening in this country. For example, I know, but I cannot prove it, because of the arrangements that are made between big corporations and political parties, that the Shell oil company for years and years financed the political activities of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. I know that some of the tobacco companies finance political parties, groups within political parties and struggles even within the trade union movement. Of course it is this aspect of our society that needs public ventilation and public debate. </para>
          <para>It is true that the Government might have the numbers in this place to put this legislation through. But I suggest that it does not have the argument. The Government might have the numbers but this does not entitle it to believe that it can win the argument. There must be limits and there must be disclosure because we are talking about a fundamental principle of the democratic process, that is about the large sums of money that are spent in Federal elections. Let us look at the 1977 election. I want to stress the need for the limits that should be contained in this legislation. A total of $2,179,340 was spent on radio and television broadcasts alone in 1977 by political parties. These figures have been obtained from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal annual report for 1977-78. Of this total $481,602 was spent on radio and $1.697,738 was spent on television. The regulation of this money is surely a problem in itself. </para>
          <para>What is of more interest is who spent the money. In respect of radio the Government parties spent 64 per cent and the Australian Labor Party 28.4 per cent and that, of course, is much more than a two to one ratio. For television the Government parties spent 68.7 per cent and the Labor Party spent 36.3 per cent. Again, this is nearly a two to one ratio. In cash terms that means that the Government spent $308,226 on radio to the Australian Labor Party's $136,775. For television the Government spent $996,572 and the Australian Labor Party $616,279. Of course, one only has to look at these figures to appreciate how difficult it would be for minor political parties to share in that process. That is not equal coverage in media terms; far from it. Yet the ALP contested 129 House of Representatives seats compared with 137- nearly equal- by the Government parties. For the Senate the ALP contested 22 seats compared with 25 by the Government parties. Those expenses do not include the cost of the preparation of advertisements, publication of newspaper and printed media advertisements, literature, howtovote tickets and the costs for dozens of other items which are involved in modern election campaign. </para>
          <para>We are running a democracy for the rich. This legislation will make it more so. Needless to say, the present system benefits the Government parties and their sponsors, the big companies, the multinationals which obviously can afford the money that permits these parties to present their representatives for consideration to the Australian people. What happens when the Liberal Party and the National Country Party accept amounts of well over $ 100,000 from the Utah company and other mining companies? It is my view that the removal of the coal levy- I think most people in Australia who think about it would agree with this- returns much more money to Utah than it spent in getting this Government elected. But it costs the taxpayers many millions of dollars- much more than any potential subsidy for the political process. The changes in the coal levy could be justified only on the basis that there was an obligation to a group of contributors on the part of the Government. Similarly, this situation applies- as I said previously in respect of the Democratic Labor Party and the Shell group of companies- to oil companies generally, life assurance offices, banks and so on. </para>

          <para class="block">I want to assure the Senate that that $25,000 cheque did not come to the Australian Labor Party. Of course, the Democrats can speak for themselves. This is evidence given in court. It is not difficult to say whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gale</inline> provided the $25,000 for because we know- it is common knowledge- and it has been admitted by the present Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gale</inline> provided help for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> when he was shadow Minister for Labour and Industrial Relations. The Gollin company provided the services of a man to draft the labour and industrial relations policy of the present Liberal-National Country Party Government. We know that at that time the private sector of the community was providing not only manpower but also financial resources to the Liberal-Country Party coalition then in Opposition. </para>
          <para>If we examine the problem facing us- and I hope that honourable senators will look at it in a fairly non-partisan way, but I have doubts- we will find that it is a question of either combining a limit on expenditure with free radio and television time or public funding via taxation. I think that we can reduce the amount of money that is required if- I repeat, if- there is some sort of limit on expenditure because free radio and television advertising time will be provided for political broadcasts. Anthony Lewis, who late in 1970 was a <inline font-style="italic">New York Times</inline> correspondent in Europe, wrote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>From the vantage point of Europe . . . American permissiveness on money and politics seems almost Roman in its decadence. The thought of allowing politicians to sell themselves in spot advertising on television would be revolting in Britain or anywhere in the established European democracies. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In the United Kingdom, individual candidates' expenses are reduced because some advertising is free. Each parliamentary candidate is permitted one free mailing of election advertising material to every elector in his constituency. Campaign broadcasts are free. The political parties are allowed a certain number, of varying lengths, during the campaign period. It is illegal for a candidate to buy television time. The Act of Parliament which set up the Independent Television Authority prohibits the acceptance of any political advertising. I think that is the sensible way in which we ought to be looking at this proposition. We ought not to be giving our assent in globo to this piece of legislation. </para>
          <para>Money in politics is becoming a subject of increasing concern and is generally regarded by an ever growing number of people in the Australian community as, at best, a necessary evil. What concerns us all is the problem of finding ways to elimiante or to restrict the most obnoxious campaign practices while at the same time discovering alternative methods of political financing which recognise the growing cost of campaigning for political parties and for candidates and the need to establish public faith in the basic honesty of our whole democratic political system. When bringing in amendments to such an important piece of legislation as the Commonwealth Electoral Act, it would have been worth while for the Government to bring in amendments in addition to the ones which deal with finance. Of course, we could be talking about optional preferential voting, which has been supported by the Liberal Party in New South Wales, the earlier closing of polls, the drawing for positions on ballot papers, party affiliations and so on. Of course, those matters are not mentioned in the Bill. All it seeks to do is to remove the whole limitation on finance for parties and for candidates. </para>
          <para>I remind the Senate that if this Government was really concerned about this problem, it would have applied itself to the major amendments which the Australian Labor Party formulated in 1975, which were passed by the House of Representatives, in which all of these matters were adequately canvassed and which contained all the considerations I have suggested ought to be examined in the Parliament. Yet it was the obstinacy and the dogmatic and authoritarian approach of the Government parties, which then held a majority in this place, that prevented the implementation of the 1975 legislation. </para>
          <para>I finish by referring to a recent Gallup Poll reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> on 23 July 1977. It showed that a clear majority of Australians think that the Federal Government should provide a fixed sum for candidates' election expenses and ban all private contributions. In the survey it was put to people that the Federal Government should provide a fixed amount of money for the election campaigns of candidates for Federal Parliament and that all private contributions from other sources should be prohibited. They were then asked: 'Do you think this is a good idea or a poor idea?' Sixty per cent said it was a good idea, 2 7 per cent said it was a poor idea and 13 per cent were undecided. I think that gives an indication of the concern that exists within the Australian community about the unfairness of the existing system. All this legislation will do is to exacerbate the problem by removing any limitations. That is why we believe the Senate ought to express an opinion in the terms of the amendment which I have moved and which I hopealthough I know that it will not- will receive some mature consideration by the Australian Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">Substantially, this amendment means that we would like to see retained Part XVI of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which, apart from some minor points in it, is to be repealed by this legislation; but we say that there should be some adjustment of the limits given to candidates. Why should I move a further amendment when the Australian Labor Party has moved one? We approve of the Labor amendment but feel that it does not approach a degree of political practicability. We think under the circumstances it is desirable that there be presented to the Government- I earnestly commend this proposition to honourable senators- another feasible solution which it would see as reasonable, right and a modus operandi for the 1980 general election. We are very concerned at the situation which has arisen. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> said, this matter was raised late in the session in the other place. In the last hour or so of the sitting of the Senate this enormously important matter, which concerns an election to be held in Australia this year, has been brought on for debate in this chamber. </para>
          <para>A while ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate,</inline> I believe, referred to the virtues and wisdoms of Hobart. I wish to refer to that matter again. I refer to an article in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> of last Monday headed Democrats move to Block Slush Bill'. I make the point that the Press, the media and people of this country are already referring to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1980 as the slush fund Bill. I think it is properly described in that way. I think the Government ought to take note of the fact that that inevitably is the reaction of the community to this legislation. The Democrats move is neither here nor there. Whilst we are making this move we hope that not just Australian Democrats but all well-intentioned persons concerned in any way with democracy in this country understand what is going on. We feel that if they did understand it thoroughly they would not wish this Bill to pass in its present form. </para>
          <para>Matters concerning the conduct of elections are of very special sensitivity to the public in every country, and rightly so. Such matters must not only be but also appear to be in the best interests of the Australian people so that they are not misled, not unfairly influenced and not conned in any way when they come to the two vital democratic responsibilities they have. The first is to stand as a candidate for election. That is the right of every decent Australian who is qualified so to do. The second right is to vote on issues which are presented fairly to them in a way that can be understood and in which every voice is heard equally in that election. </para>
          <para>Most Australians are not so naive now as to be unaware of a very direct relationship between money and political power. They are, I think, well educated, sophisticated and perceptive enough to look at lavish campaign spending similar to that which occurred in the 1977 campaign. Their attention will be directed not so much to any message that might be conveyed in those campaign operations but at the cost of the campaign. Most perceptive Australians- many of them have told me this- when they see this spending say: 'What did this function or advertisement cost? Where did the money come from? What strings are attached to that money?' Then they ask: 'What are those strings costing me as an Australian citizen?' That might be the final question that the perceptive person might ask himself or herself. </para>
          <para>I believe that it was our own Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser, who, if he did not actually coin the phrase, launched it in Australia: 'There is no such thing as a free lunch'. I would suggest to honourable senators that that is especially true of politics. Strings are almost always attached to the supply of money, especially in politics. Those who, in their wisdom, wrote the Commonwealth Electoral Act in its present form had in mind the opportunity for and the temptation of corruption and massive slushfunding. That aspect is probably more important than any allegation of actual corruption. Some limitation must apply to the amount of money that candidates can derive from any source which must be revealed. Some penalties must apply through a mandatory provision to candidates who do not do what the law requires them to do. 1 find the second reading speech delivered in the other place by the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr John McLeay)</inline> to be curious in respect of this matter. In that speech, the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Historically, the outdated provisions contained in Part XVI - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We do not agree that those provisions are outdated. We say that they merely need adjustment-  derive from provisions which were enacted in the 1 9th century and designed to deal with bribery and corruption then existing in the British elections. </para>
          <para class="block">That provision is fine. We would probably agree with it. But I cannot understand the logic of the Minister's statement that, because corruption once existed and certain measures were taken to stop it those measures, can now be removed and everything will be fine. I would think it much more logical to assume that the repeal of that provision would cause at least a risk that a renewed phase of corruption would result from the reinstatement of that temptation. From the practical point of view, that is what would happen. All politicians are human. </para>
          <para>It is wrong that persons seeking to be elected to Parliament should be subject in the course of an election campaign to unlimited temptations for which they may see complete justification. A person may believe that his or her election to the Parliament or the election of his or her party to office could be the best thing that could happen. Such a person may also feel that the end justifies the means. They may believe that it is perfectly permissible to use money offered to them if it assists in that process. How much more will that be their thinking when the Government says that that is perfectly all right, that it will be legal. The Government says that there is no reason for a person to be worried about that. No report on such matters will be required because there will be no penalties. Absolutely no restriction will apply. I suggest that this attitude would create a very dangerous situation in our community. </para>
          <para>What are the provisions? They were enacted in 1946 and the amount allowed is ridiculously low. A candidate for election to the House of Representatives may spend $500 on his campaign while a candidate for election to the Senate is limited to an expenditure of $1,000. If the obligation to report such expenses is not heeded, certain penalties apply. This law has been very much honoured in the breach, certainly in recent years. The figures available to me show that the consumer price index has increased by a factor of 7.53 since 1946. Other elements to be considered include the advent of television and the virtual necessity for candidates to express their arguments through that new medium. This development must affect any limit proposed which would be acceptable to the parties of long standing contesting an election. The Australian Democrats do not especially favour the sums in the amendment that I shall move. Originally I proposed lower amounts of $5,000 and $10,000 respectively. We genuinely are seeking a reasonable compromise which is acceptable to all honourable senators. Hence I have been persuaded that the figures of $7,500 and $15,000 are reasonable. I might add that these amounts would permit a party contesting all seats in the House of Representatives and putting forward full Senate teams in all States a maxmimum spending of close on $1.5m-$l,440,000 to be precise. I do not mind saying in this chamber that it is obvious that the Australian Democrats certainly will not have available that sort of money, due partly to its independence as a citizens' movement and partly to the requirement in its constitution that any donations over $2,000 are subject to public disclosure. I commend that measure most earnestly to the Liberal and National Country parties if they want to be believed in as honest political movements by the people of this country. However, the real point is that it ought to be some earnest of our sincerity in that we are proposing limits not in any way suitable to ourselves. </para>
          <para>The history of this matter is that the Australian Democrats have said that those who make laws should not break them. Experience in Tasmania and elsewhere, and feedback we have had, shows that the Australian public feels very much that way. People resent the idea that people who make laws- lawmakers- should feel they can break the law with impunity. I think all honourable senators, if they think carefully about that, would agree with the principle. If there had been no amendment to the legislation the Australian Democrats certainly would have sought a writ of mandamus to ensure that the law was policed. However, our first preference was that it should be amended. We are strongly of the opinion that that should be the case, and we regard that as the ideal solution. </para>
          <para>My second major point is that the repeal of Part XVI is quite against the spirit of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That Act attempts to provide equality of opportunity to all Australians when they want to stand as candidates. Our great worry is the effect the abolition of the limit will have in a single electorate where, say, a major foreign investor or a speculator might feel it worthwhile to make available to or offer to a candidate a sum large enough to affect the result of the election. As the law presently stands, that would not be possible, but if the rule book is torn up and thrown away for the vital 1980 Federal election, as indeed this Bill proposes, not only would it be possible but nobody would ever know what was happening. </para>
          <para>I have to ask a very hard question. What is the Government up to? Is there some massive funding to come through for this year's election? If so, in which electorates will it be spent? Will it perhaps be for the Senate? I can see that quite rightly honourable senators on the other side do not like these imputations, and I do not blame them. I am quite prepared to accept the honesty of honourable senators opposite. The point I want to get across is that these are the questions that will and must be asked, and will continue to be asked. The public will ask them, the media will ask them, and they will insist on replies. The proposed situation will be seen and rightly so, as unlimited secret power and money against the Australian people. I believe that nothing the Government can do will alter that impression. It can show its sincerity, its integrity, its goodwill, its upkeeping of its responsibility to the Australian people only by accepting this amendment. I would be most interested to hear a direct answer to that point when the time comes for the Minister to reply. </para>
          <para>If honourable senators feel that the imputations I have made are repugnant, and I put them up because I felt I should, they have only one course of action available to them, and that is to support the amendment relating to candidate's expenses for the 1980 Federal election. The Australian Democrats believe that in the longer term this sort of thing should be decided not by a government but by a referendum because it touches very closely the responsibilities of the Government and the rights of the people. Surely this is the son of situation that could be put and might still be put in the 1980 Federal election as a referendum to the people. The Australian Democrats feel that there should be some sort of consultation, and I hope that there will be some feedback from the public on this debate. Certainly anybody who reads the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> or has heard the speeches should put forward their views. Certainly I will undertake to make the Senate aware of those views, and I am sure that other honourable senators will do the same. I hope that there will be some public response to this matter. I do not wish to take up the time of the Senate unduly. I have indicated the motion which I will move. </para>

            <para>- With the indulgence of the Senate, I would like to put the record straight. The suggestion is that this action by the Government has something underhand to it. The very reverse is true. As history shows, following upon a Tasmanian election a series of charges was levelled at candidates which threatened and indeed resulted in the voiding of seats. All Australians who are familiar with the electoral laws suddenly realised that the electoral laws around the land needed to be looked at very closely indeed, otherwise quite unpremeditated things might happen to innocent people. Furthermore, when this matter was looked at, it was found that candidates and all political parties over the years had been breaking the laws by not conforming with all the laws, as were organisations outside. It became fundamentally necessary to have an overhaul of the laws themselves. Nobody has the selective right to claim integrity. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me make this clear. This idea of claim to selective integrity is absolute nonsense. What this Government is doing is suspending a particular section for this election on the clear understanding that it will set up an inquiry which will be based on one fundamental assumption, and that has been completely ignored by those who have spoken. The inquiry will be set up on the basis that there shall be full disclosure at all levels. Let us make that perfectly clear so that all those who feel that there is something under the carpet will know what the inquiry says. The terms of the inquiry itself are such that it will take a reasonable amount of time because the Act is complicated. They include: The provision which should be included in the Commonwealth Electoral Act to require public disclosure of electoral expenditure by or on behalf of the interests of a candidate, on behalf of the interests of a political party, other electoral expenditure or information regarding the publication of electoral matter. Let us make it perfectly clear that this is no sweeping under the carpet; it is the very reverse. There is to be a public inquiry based upon a clear undertaking of disclosure. </para>

              <para>- Over the years, all political parties, including the Australian Labor Party- the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> has just spoken- did not make disclosure even though they were required to do so under the law. Let it not be said that this was so. So that we fully understand the situation, we want to make it perfectly clear that there are no limits at all under the present law on the expenditure of political parties, organisations, trade unions or others at all. The only limit at the moment under the law is on the candidate. So much can be spent indirectly on the candidate and not disclosed at this moment. That is a fundamental weakness. There are no limits in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, West Germany, Italy, France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland or the United States of America. So let us not be looking for something that is not there. The suggestion that it could all be done in a hurry- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> suggests that- is <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> shared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran,</inline> who believes that an exhaustive inquiry is necessary. This Bill will take out of the Act those measures that themselves pose great dangers to innocent people- as the Tasmanian election showed- and will put into the Act, after full public inquiry, disclosure at each level of organisation. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>I do not want to be provocative, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> was totally so. He suggested that this side of the House received all the funds, that there were pressure and corruption and that this did not occur on the other side of the House. If a left wing or communist controlled trade union gives the Australian Labor Party money is that honest and open? Is that not subject to suggestions of influence? Does anyone deny that the trade union movement taken as a whole is a massive organisation which gives massive funds to the Labor Party? The fact of the matter is that the Labor Party is subject to enormous pressure groups. The Labor Party, under the signatures of its leaders, circularises both national and multinational corporations throughout Australia asking for funds for its election campaigns. Letters go out at the time of each election. Quite a flood of letters under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> 's name went to national and multinational companies asking for funds. I just put that on the record. Comments made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> suggest that the Australian Labor Party does not do those things at all. It is wrong to believe the force of financial resources lies on one side of the Parliament and poverty lies on the other. </para>
          <para>This piece of legislation aims to set up an inquiry to bring about the recommendations for full disclosure. It is a perfectly wholesome Bill. It is anti-slush fund in the whole of its nature. We oppose the amendment and commend the legislation. </para>

          <para>- Because of the timing arrangements that have been made and the agreements made between the Whips I did not speak on this matter earlier. I wish to now make a few comments. I can assure honourable senators on the Government side that I will be reasonably brief. Like all government legislation in this matter we are getting too little of it too late. A Senate election will take place in New South Wales later this year which will probably take six weeks to count- that is, if there is a clear winner. If we have a situation like we had in 1975 we might find that it takes two months or more to get a result for the Senate in New South Wales. It is just not good enough. I do not know whether there is any other country in the world, let alone in the Western world, where an election takes that long to be counted. It takes that long to count because the Commonwealth Electoral Act is outdated and cumbersome. It needs a complete overhaul. I mentioned that we need computerised tallying of the votes and perhaps we should be investigating whether we will use voting machines. </para>

        <para>In New South Wales, even given a reasonable ballot paper, we can assume that 10 per cent of the votes in the next Senate election will be informal. That is a disgrace. We will have a 10 per cent informal vote because we have compulsory preferential voting and we force people to put a number in every square. What we should be looking at in a new electoral Act is a system of optional preferential voting, as operated in the last New South Wales Legislative Council elections. To cast a formal vote, one had to fill in the squares only from one to nine. Even so, 4 per cent of the votes were still informal. </para>

            <para>- It was a dramatic drop, but it still is not good enough. In Senate elections people are forced to fill in every square. There were 70-odd candidates in New South Wales in one Senate election. It is absolutely ludicrous that if, in filling in a ballot paper, a person writes two 48s or two 49s, that ballot paper is then taken out of the count. </para>

            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> said, it is a deliberate tactic. I agree with him. I will come to that later. I think we have to ask ourselves why there are no instructions in foreign languages and no party affiliations on the ballot papers. Why do we still continue to have joke candidates that make up this huge field of 40, 50 and on to 70? Having that number is a deliberate tactic. If anybody is a genuine candidate in a Senate election I think it is reasonable enough that he should have a nominator from every Federal electorate within his State, not the situation at the moment. The deposit ought to be increased quite dramatically. At the moment Aborigines, migrants and the elderly are at a severe disadvantage. In some instances when Aborigines have been filling out ballot papers they have been deliberately misdirected on how to vote. </para>

            <para>- As long as it is clear. I will make a very brief comment that it is incorrect to suggest that the Opposition- and, I believe, the Australian Democrats- do not want a proper inquiry into this whole vexed question of electoral expenses. Of course, there is a very grey area and we would want to see the whole matter clarified. I think there is common ground there amongst all of us. But the essential point is that the Fraser Government is saying that at the coming election the lid is off; those who can marshal the most money will have the advantage in the election campaign. The vast resources available to the Liberal Party will be pumped into its campaign virtually without limit. That is what it amounts to. The Labor Party and, I would assume, the Australian Democrats and other minority parties will find themselves out-gunned financially in the course of this campaign. </para>

        <para>There is absolutely no reason at all why the Government could not have kept some limits on election expenses as, for example, are contained in the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats, which would have kept some degree of reason in election expenses. We will find that those candidates and those political partiesessentially the Government parties- which have enormous financial resources behind them, will be able to spend virtually whatever they wish. It is a desperate action by a desperate government. </para>

          <para>- I will continue to cooperate by being very brief, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> provoked me also in his reply at the second reading stage. I object to this scandal of a Bill, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 1 980. 1 put it in no lesser terms than that. To err on the side of conservatism, I point out that at the last election, the Liberal Party- I leave aside the National Country Party- received over Sim in undisclosed funds. 1 can prove that quite easily but I will not take up the time of the Committee. It is possible simply to calculate the amount spent on television advertising at the going rates, on newspaper advertising and on other things. If one multiplies the number of members of the Liberal Party nationally by their membership fee, one finds that at least $ lm- probably nearer $2m- came into the funds of the Liberal Party. No one on this side of the chamber and no member of the general public knows where the money comes from. In a country the size of Australia, when we are talking about $ 1 m going to a political party from undisclosed funds, that to me is corruption. I am not alleging that any honourable senator on the other side of the chamber is corrupt. What I am saying - </para>

That sort of situation in a democracy leads to corruption, not the corruption of the individual but the corruption of the objectivity of policies. </para>

            <para>- There will be no report, no limits, until after the next election which is probably seven months away. One wonders why this situation has been brought about. I deplore this Bill. I think it is immoral; I think it is a scandal. I think it strikes at the very root of democracy. One can see that running through the original Bill like the thread of Ariadne was the whole philosophy of equity- equity to those parties, to those individual candidates who were not wealthy. It preserved some sort of protection for the less well endowed political parties or individuals. This Bill strips away all that protection for the poorer people and for the less well endowed parties. It opens up the gate for multinationals, transnationals, monopolists, to pour millions into the one political party or the two political parties which stand on the right side of politics in this country. I deplore this legislation. </para>

          <para>- I rise not to take the time of the Committee but to disabuse the public and honourable senators of the arguments that have just been put forward. The existing legislation requires no disclosure at all by any political party or any organisation of the source of donor's funds. So nothing at all is being done by this Bill to alter that situation. That is quite clear but the implication has been that it is. The existing legislation and this amending legislation make no attempt at all to put a ceiling on the real expenditure of political parties, that is, of the party organisation itself and the local conferences. The only ceiling that has ever applied has been that set by the candidate himself. By the simplest of all devices it is as easy as can be for the main flow of funds to be spent by the organisation and the local campaign committee. Of course the candidate then can keep his expenditure down. I make it perfectly clear that all this talk that for us to take limits off party funds means that something is happening is nonsense. The fact is that over the years the source of the huge sums that have flowed to the Labor Party, and no doubt to the Australian Democrats, has never been disclosed. If there is an argument for disclosure in that regard, that is an argument for another day. This Bill seeks to work out in the end, by way of expert inquiry, what ought to be the nature of disclosure and it is on that aspect that the Bill is based. I simply rose to put the record straight. </para>

          <para class="block">The Government's approach to road funding is part of its insane, inane and inadequate approach to Australia's development. It fails to recognise that roads in a modern society are integral to the whole modern transport system. The Government's approach to this problem of cutbacks is an affront to the whole recognition of roads in a modern industrial society. Of course, it is part of the inappropriate philosophy to which this Government gives credence in its public expenditure doctrine. </para>
          <para>The Government's approach is similar to the policies under which <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Thatcher</inline> is leading the United Kingdom to ruination. Words fail me to describe Madam Thatcher. She is leading her country to ruin by the highest increases in inflation and interest rates since the 1930s. Of course, she is applying the principle of major cuts in public expenditure in the false belief that this will somehow create a Utopia in her own country. The Fraser Government continues that philosophy. It believes that a policy of spending money on roads, housing and public sector works programs somehow or other will create inflation and will be part of a policy leading to the decline of our economy. The Government's decision to cut back its road funds at a time when the nation's roads have deteriorated to an abysmal and dangerous state is another example of its failure to recognise its primary responsibilities to this country. Revenue from road use has reached record levels. Consumer organisations, State transport Ministers of all political parties and local government right throughout the length and breadth of this country- in fact all public organisations concerned with road safety and transportation without exception- are pressing this Government to increase funds for the purpose of road construction. </para>
          <para>What does the Government do? It cuts back, in real terms, the money that is needed to alleviate the problem. In the face of almost universal criticism, the Government is to make grants for main roads maintenance and construction that will just keep pace with the expected inflation rate for 1980-81. They will not be sufficient to make any impact upon the great backlog of road needs. It is not realistic even to compare the expected 1 1.3 per cent increase in the allocation with the actual increase in costs. The figure is not adequate, having regard to the cost of construction and maintenance of our roads system. </para>
          <para>Let us examine those rising costs, which have outstripped the overall inflation figure to a great degree and which are likely to rise further. The cost of bitumen has jumped by approximately 100 per cent in the last year. We know who supplies that. It is supplied by one of the big monopoly groups that this Government represents. Again, in the last 12 months the cost of aggregate has increased by some 40 per cent. Thus, the cost of these two major components of road construction has risen many times more than the 1 1.3 per cent figure which is claimed to be an adequate increment to cover inflation. </para>

              <para>- Nor does the figure of 1 1 .3 per cent take into account the increase in the physical use of the roads and the corresponding increased need for maintenance. Of course we have the usual catchcries from the unthinking members and lickspittles of the conservative party who never think about or concern themselves with making a fundamental appraisal of the Commonwealth's areas of responsibility. When we consider the amount of money the consumers are paying this Government we can see where it is failing in its responsibility to meet the transport needs of the motorist. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As the motorists in the capital cities of this country drive from their places of employment to their places of residence- for instance, in New South Wales using the Hume Highway, the Pacific Highway, the Princes Highway and the Great Western Highway- they appreciate what the Opposition is saying about this matter. They support the overall views expressed by the motorists ' organisations. </para>
          <para>Let me refer to what is said by just one of these organisations. In a Press statement the National Roads and Motorists Association, the motorists' organisation in New South Wales, says that in the last six years that State has lost $166m in terms of grants for urban main roads. This Government has deprived the State of New South Wales of that sum of money, in real terms, for roads. Naturally, the consumer reaction is expressed in such Press statements, and it is intense. Motorists recognise that the Government is not prepared to listen to the transport organisations of this country. </para>
          <para>Across Australia there has been a campaign designed to appeal to this Government to increase its road allocations. Do honourable senators opposite suggest that the Australian Automobile Association, the National Roads and Motorists Association and the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria do not represent the motorists of this country; that the campaign that is being waged is based on emotion rather than real need; that what is being said is not relevant to the transport needs of this country? Those organisations draw attention to the failure of this Government to listen to their voice and to the voices of the State Transport Ministers, all of whom uniquely, despite their differing political philosophies, have been critical of the Government's decision to relate the allocation of funds for road construction to the mere expected inflation rate. </para>
          <para>One of the major aspects of road construction and maintenance is its employment component. The Opposition has said, in respect of housing and public works, and will say again in respect of road construction, that 64 per cent of direct and indirect expenditure on roads is devoted to the employment of labour; that if the Government were really concerned about employment, rather than indulging in rhetoric on the whole question of job opportunities for Australians, it would see the value of making funds available for this purpose. Such funds would be spent substantially in the private sector. Most of the road constructing organisations in our country, whether at the local government level, the State level or the main roads authorities in the various States, employ private sector contractors for most road construction and maintenance purposes. This is particularly important to be considered in respect of the regional unemployment in Australia. This Government should be returning a fairer share of road users' revenue to road construction and maintenance to increase employment. On the contrary it does not make available any of the extra funds which are being sought by the road user organisations. We believe that if there were sufficient recognition of this an extra 9,000 persons could be employed immediately, directly or indirectly. The Government should take into account not only the inflation rate but also its effect on the actual cost of the construction and maintenance of roads. </para>
          <para>We can compare expenditure on roads with the enormous capital outlays required to create so few jobs in other enterprises supported by the Government such a uranium mining, the Halls Creek project and the North West Shelf development. They require a great deal of capital but they do not have their genesis in providing jobs. This Government, by steadfastly refusing to return a fairer share of road users' revenue to road construction and maintenance, is not making a contribution to the unemployment problem. This Bill also provides for the complete abolition of the Minor Improvements to Traffic Engineering and Road Safety program which is known as the MITERS program. The amount of $ 15m which was available in the last Budget for expenditure on traffic lights, passing lanes, kerb straightening and safety lines will not be available. That shows, of course, that this Government's rhetoric about road safety is not borne out. Government members do not put their money where their mouths are. It is no wonder therefore that an editorial appears in today's Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> which indicates how much out of step the Government is with public opinion. The article is headed 'Blood on the Hume ' and states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In a report released today the NRMA says up to 350 deaths and injuries a year could be saved if rural sections of the Hume Highway were divided. </para>
            <para>This is not a figure the motorists' organisation has plucked from the air. It is based on a survey of two rural sections of the highway where 20 kilometres of divided road has cut crashes and casualties by three quarters. </para>
            <para>Extend this to the entire length of the notorious Hume Highway and out comes the lives- to-be-saved figure. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This Government is not concerned about lives. It is not interested in the welfare of the people it claims to represent. The editorial continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It's simple arithmetic and simple logic. </para>
            <para>But will it happen? Probably not. </para>
            <para>The NRMA and other motoring organisations have done almost everything short of driving cars into Kings Hall to try to get the Federal Government to give back for road building a bigger share of the $2, 500m a year pumped into Federal coffers in petrol taxes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We know that this Government is concerned only with platitudes. It is concerned only with trying to encourage the private sector by giving it handouts and subsidies in the belief that that will create the sorts of job opportunities that every person in this country wants to see. We want to see jobs for the unemployed and jobs for our children. The private sector is interested substantially in returning larger dividends to the shareholders of its companies. It is not concerned as this Government should be concerned about providing job opportunities for the people of Australia. </para>
          <para>The sums allocated to roads have steadily fallen from those allocated during the period of the Whitlam Administration. If this Government were really concerned it would adopt a responsible attitude towards the funding of road safety improvements and engineering advances. It would accept its proper responsibilities for the national roads program. Everybody who uses those roads concedes that there has been a marked improvement as a result of the tremendous sums that were allocated during the Whitlam period for our national main roads system. This Government, of course, has the insane belief that if it encourages the private sector by subsidies, export incentives and other public funds, somehow that sector will magically create the regeneration that is needed in the Australian economy. It believes that the way in which to achieve this is to cut back public sector spending. That is the central theme which this Government has adopted since it unfortunately came to office in 1975. This theme has been shown to be a failure in the United Kingdom. Surely the policies being pursued by this Government will also be seen as a failure. </para>
          <para>Finally, the Government's own expert authority, the Bureau of Transport Economics, has provided concrete evidence of the benefits that would result from an improved road network. The Government's own organisation has recommended a substantial increase in road expenditure and has said that it is not only warranted but is also needed. In a modern industrial society, how could anyone argue that we do not want to improve our whole roads system- our main roads system, our arterial roads system and even our local road system? Yet this Government, by persisting with its policy, will not listen to the demands that have been made right across this country by all the motorist organisations, by consumer organisations and by all the various State Ministers of Transport whose responsibility it is to provide the decent roads that every person in this country wants to see. Everyone in this country wants the Federal Government to accept its responsibility by providing the essential funds. I ask the Senate- I know probably without much success- to give consideration to the amendment which I have moved on behalf of the Opposition. </para>

            <para>- I wish to make a few comments about the Roads Grants Bill, which provides $628m for roads throughout Australia in the forthcoming year. I think it is important for us to remember that the Government has not only a responsibility to provide funds for roads but also other commitments, which are quite considerable, in the areas of social welfare, health and other important areas that are significant for the people of Australia. Therefore some measure of restraint has to be exerted. That does not mean that I am not somewhat disappointed with some aspects of this Bill. I regard roads as national assets that not only contribute to national development in the long term but also provide job opportunities in the short term because of the work force which is required to carry out their construction and maintenance. A project of this nature involving capital works is in my view a very important part of government action, lt ought to be considered more fully in the future because it creates jobs and consequently saves a considerable amount of unemployment benefit funding. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The South Australian Local Government Association reacted quite emotionally when the details of the road funding for South Australia were announced. I think it has an argument which is quite substantial and which will certainly warrant the Government's attention in the year following the period that is covered by this Bill. It points out, having regard to the State's population percentage and comparing that with its roads grants percentage, that Western Australia with 8.4 per cent of the population has attracted 12.2 per cent of the total roads grants. Queensland, which has 15.2 per cent of the population, has attracted road grants amounting to 20.3 per cent whereas South Australia, which has 9. 1 per cent of the population, has attracted only 8.2 per cent of the amount allocated for road grants. South Australia's share of the road grants is less than that of other comparable States, and seems to be declining. I believe its share ought to be increased to approximately 10 per cent so that it is comparable with other States. The Bureau of Transport Economics quite properly drew attention to the cost increases with respect to road construction and maintenance. </para>
          <para>The Local Government Association of South Australia has drawn attention to this matter. It has provided some interesting information dealing with increased costs over the five years from 1 976 to 1 980. It points out that bitumen used for road construction is 400 per cent dearer than it was five years ago; that hotmix for maintenance of roads has increased in price by 200 per cent over the past five years; that road construction costs generally are between 60 per cent and 100 per cent higher than they were five years ago, depending on the type of construction; that </para>
          <para class="block">Commonwealth road grants are only 40 per cent higher than they were five years ago; that road making cost increases have averaged out at 1 S per cent per year; and that road grants have averaged out at an increase of only 7 per cent per year during that time. It would be fair to suggest that the Government did not pay sufficient regard to the increased costs that I have just described. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney)</inline> that when allocations of funds for this purpose occur next year some increase should be contemplated. </para>
          <para>The Government has considered carefully the matter of allocations to the Minor Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Improvements Program and regards it as more of a State responsibility. The Government has reduced the funding in that area. As a result, it has been able to increase the allocation of funds for national and developmental roads, which is a new category. Honourable senators will realise that the road categories previously funded wholly by the Commonwealth were national highways and national commerce roads. The sum provided for those categories in 1979-80 was $206m for national highways and $18m for national commerce roads. Thus Bill covers national developmental roads. The allocation for that purpose is $278m, which represents an increase of the order of 18 per cent to 19 per cent. This may well assist the State Government in South Australia to accelerate the construction of the Stuart Highway. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff,</inline> who is unable to speak on this matter, and I look forward to an earlier completion of' that road. It is my view that road categories ought to be abolished. Apart from national developmental roads, I think that money should be allocated by the Federal Government to State governments for State roads and to local government for local government roads. I make that suggestion to the Minister. </para>

            <para>- I am compelled to say a few words on the Roads Grants Bill 1980 as the Stuart Highway has been mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has put an argument for the allocation of funds for the Stuart Highway. I remind the Senate that last year he had the opportunity to vote for an amendment about that to an Appropriation Bill. Because of the actions of this Government- the guillotine- honourable senators were not allowed to debate a similar Bill on this occasion. Both he and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff,</inline> whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has just mentioned, had the opportunity to vote for a special fund to construct the Stuart Highway, in conformity with a promise made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> in Alice Springs. When the vote was taken both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> walked out of the chamber and refused to vote. That, of course, is history. But the people in the area served by the Stuart Highway have long memories. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is very pleasing now to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> put an argument for increased funds for South Australia. We all know that the State Labor Government was always accused of not using the allocation of funds from the Commonwealth in the proper regions. Now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> blames the Federal Government. I am pleased to hear him do it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo,</inline> the Labor Minister of Transport in South Australia, repeatedly blamed the Federal Government for lack of funds. When we supported him in this place honourable senators opposite ridiculed us. Now there is a Liberal government in South Australia it is very pleasing to find that the blame is being laid at the feet of the responsible people- the Federal Government. I am very pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has pointed up where the responsibility really lies. </para>
          <para>If time permitted I would speak for much longer. However, because of restraints I will conclude my remarks. I think I have pointed up once again that people are not always as dinkum in this place as we would like them to be. They say one thing in the electorate and they say another thing here. </para>

            <para>- I want to take one moment to reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren.</inline> I would like to remind him that when I spoke during debate on a matter of public importance to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> moved that a special allocation of funds be made for the purpose of the construction of the Stuart Highway I told the chamber that it was question of policy; that I would support a motion that would include all other national highways; that a special fund should be allocated for the purpose so that the Minister could allocate those funds according to his own priorities; and that I would support the Stuart Highway as a No. 1 priority. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> and I did not vote for the motion. That is quite true. We refused to vote, which meant that the Opposition numbers went up by two. If three or four senators on this side of the chamber had done the same that motion would have been carried. </para>

            <para>- Again we find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> misleading this place. He said that the motion was on a matter of public importance. As I pointed out, the motion was not a matter of public importance; it was an amendment during the Committee stage of an Appropriation Bill to set up the fund. It is a spurious argument for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> to useand this is the argument he uses in the electorate- that all he did was to reduce the numbers of the Government by two when in fact he did not have the courage to vote for that amendment. He had the opportunity to vote but he did not do so. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As a further excuse he said that he did not vote because a matter of policy was involved. Honourable senators who spoke on that matter, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> pointed out it was a matter of Government policy because it had been announced as Government policy by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> to the Mayor of Alice Springs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> said that if the Government was returned at the 1977 election a special fund would be set aside for the construction of the Stuart Highway. So no matter how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> wriggles and twists, he cannot get out of it. It was a policy announcement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair.</inline> Of course, what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> is now saying is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> cannot be trusted. I will leave it to people to make the judgment. But he made the announcement in Alice Springs. It is no good <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> coming in here and saying that he could not support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop's</inline> motion because he had to support Government policy. I am pointing out that in fact it was Government policy to set up a special fund and the Government reneged on it. </para>

            <para>- I have three matters I wish to submit briefly. In the first instance, I refer to the Government 's Advance Australia campaign and the auxiliary operation on the supply of flags. I have here a letter from our Embassy in Berne, Switzerland, which is a reply from the senior officer to a complaint from a <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Dugdale</inline> of Fairfield on the lack of Australian flags. She also took the opportunity to refer to the sum of $300,000 for expenditure in this campaign, not all of which was to be spent on procuring Australian flags. But she does make the point that in respect of pageantries in the various parts of Europe and the number of Australian tourists it does not seem good enough when our embassies and consulates are light on with Australian flags. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a letter from our officials at the Berne Embassy so that the appropriate Minister can make inquiries. </para>

            <para>The Australian Tourist Commission has forwarded to us your letter of 21 June 1979. </para>
            <para>I was in Interlaken on 26 June and noticed all the flags flying, but as we were driving through, did not have time to see if the Australian flag was evident. </para>
            <para>The answer to your suggestion is really one of cost. If the Australian Government were to provide several flags to each  of the major tourist centres in Switzerland, the cost to the Australian taxpayer would be several thousand dollars, and this would be for only one country. </para>
            <para>We do spend a considerable amount of time and money pursuing an energetic information programme in Switzerland. This is aimed at informing people of all walks of life in Switzerland, but particularly the decision-makers in government and private industry, of conditions in Australia, our way of life, government policy in a wide range of areas (Indo-chinese refugees, uranium, investment, etc., are some that come to mind). We also have a considerable number of films here available for public distribution and a modest library from which interested people can borrow books on Australia. I am confident that, since our flag is not prominent in Swiss towns, this does not mean that a broad and generally accurate picture of Australia is not held by Swiss citizens. </para>
            <para>I should mention that when representatives of Australia participate, for example, in sporting contests in Switzerland, we are always pleased to lend an Australian flag to indicate Australian involvement. </para>
            <para>If the Interlaken Tourist Office approaches us about our flag, I am afraid that all we could do is to direct them to an Australian manufacturer and suggest that they purchase some commercially. </para>

              <para>- The second matter I wish to raise is that some time ago I referred in a discussion on many immigration matters to the resident status of a South Korean. Inadvertently I said he had been sponsored by the Australasian Society of Engineers. The Federal Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Addison,</inline> has quite correctly taken the opportunity to point out that the union's prime responsibility is to encourage an expansion of apprenticeships in the metal trades industry. The South Korean concerned is a member of the union. I was putting forward his case for permanent resident status mindful of the political turmoil in South Korea. But I did not imply that the Australasian Society of Engineers was denying people the opportunity to gain additional trade skills here. The union naturally was not involved in the sponsorship of overseas tradesmen. I take this opportunity to put that on the record. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The final matter I wish to raise refers to travel agents. Honourable senators will know that for well over 1 8 months I have been campaigning to cull one or two unscrupulous travel agents. Unfortunately the other night when the Senate was dealing with what on the surface was a rather minute amendment to the Migration Act I felt that although it related to the illegal carriage on airlines of people into Australia it did not deal with one or two corrupt travel agents. I simply rise on this occasion to point out the peculiar position of a Chilean national named <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arroyo.</inline> I raised this matter of an unscrupulous travel agent- an unscrupulous lawyer- about 15 months ago. Whilst the wheels of justice are turning, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arroyo</inline> still does not know what his position is. </para>
          <para>I took the opportunity before Estimates Committee C to ask whether a determination had been made but the officers were rather vague. They said that he had not been given permanent resident status. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arroyo</inline> did not act as a stool pigeon. When he indicated to me that he had been sort of conned by a travel agent, I took over and reported the travel agent to the Federal Government and to the State Travel Agents Registration Board. I think this man should not be held in a state of limbo. I ask the Minister responsible to give an early answer as to the status of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arroyo,</inline> in view of the fact that his aunty was taken advantage of in relation to his coming here. I know that the Chilean community supports his case. I repeat that his coming here did not involve any back door entry via New Zealand. It was just that he was probably falsely induced by a travel agent. I ask that that matter also be taken on board. </para>

            <para>- In speaking to the Supply Bills we find ourselves once again at the end of a session with a very restricted allocation of time for honourable senators to speak. I again want to lodge my protest at the actions of the Government in bringing down the guillotine on the Appropriation Bills whereby the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money was rushed through the Parliament without proper opportunity being given to honourable senators on this side of the chamber to raise matters of importance. Of course, having been prevented from raising those matters on the Appropriation Bills, one now has to use the second reading of the Supply Bills to bring a few of those matters of concern before the Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Honourable senators will recall that on four occasions I have raised the cruelty involved in the shipment of live horses. I spoke about this matter at length last night. I had hoped that the standards laid down by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> would prevent this cruelty. Yet I picked up an issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> this morning and I again saw a story of a horse having to be shot because it was travelling as cargo on the open deck of a ship. I think it is time we put a stop to this terribly cruel practice whereby individuals are allowed to ship horses to Japan just because they want to make an easy and quick dollar. Despite the conditions laid down by the Minister in the document which I read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> last night, we find that it is still happening. The Minister, in the Press release which I incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> referred to the departure from Melbourne of the ship which carried the horse to which I referred and which had to be put down when the ship reached Sydney. </para>

          <para>There is another matter of grave concern that I wanted to raise on the Appropriation Bills when the expenditure for the Department of Veterans' Affairs was before us. I was unable to do so for the reasons I have stated. I now have to take the time of the Senate to raise it again tonight. I refer to the inadequacy of the War Service Homes Agreement Act to give assistance to ex-servicemen who have served this country and who, because of their occupations which take them all around Australia in various governmental jobs, are unable to buy a home of their own. When they get near retiring age they are still prevented, because of this Act, from getting a loan, at the low interest rate to which they are entitled, to buy or to build a home. I want to read a letter which I received from one of my constituents. No doubt many ex-servicemen who are listening tonight, after they hear what happened to this person, will be writing to members of parliament. I hope they write in their thousands so that members of parliament will take action to see that the Act is amended. This person wrote to me on 14 April. I will leave out his name for many reasons. I do not think he should be identified. I have already sent the letter to the Minister. Incidentally, I got word today, after the passing of the War Graves Bill, that there is a letter in the post in reply. I do not know what the contents of it are or whether the Minister will agree to allow this person to qualify for a war service home loan. This person wrote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>With retirement as Postmaster Australia Post, pending in April 1983, 1 purchased a small retirement home in April of last year for $23,500 for which, being an eligible ex-serviceman of the 1939-45 war, I confidently expected to obtain a Defence Service Homes Corporation loan at an interest rate of 3.75 per cent for the first $12,000, to finance the purchase. </para>
            <para>However, as can be seen from the attached communication from the Defence Service Homes Corporation; para 4: finance from them will not be available until such time as I occupy the home, which of course I cannot do until I retire, lt is simply not possible to reside at . . . and commute- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is, it is not possible to reside in the home that he has purchased and to commute to his place of employment which I know from personal experience is some 200 miles away from where he is living now. The letter continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This decision by the Defence Service Homes forced me to obtain the required finance from the Commonwealth Bank at the much higher interest rate of 9.5 per cent, with an increase to 10 per cent pending. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course, that interest rate could increase even further if this Government allows interest rates to escalate. The letter further states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Similarly a request for a Home Savings Grant to assist with the purchase of the house has been deferred for an identical reason- see communication from the Department of Housing and Construction; para 3; </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He attached that letter to this one. The letter continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whilst the conditions under which both the Defence Service Homes Corporation and the Department of Housing and Construction operate are appreciated, as is the good faith in with which both decisions have been made.  I feel   that people such as myself who of a necessity must travel in search of promotion (1 have worked in post offices in Victoria, Queensland, ACT, Northern Territory and South Australia) are discriminated against in the purchase of a retirement home. Whilst I admit that travel in search of promotion was made entirely on my own initiative, I consider without being presumptuous that in addition to my war service and eligibility for a Defence Service Home loan I have done much over the years to help meet the postal needs and requirements of Australia Post customers in various areas including such isolated localities as Winston in central westernQueensland and Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory. </para>
            <para>I consider therefore that I have merited the benefit of any assistance to which my war service and financial position entitles me in the purchase of a small and modest home in which to retire when my 36 years of public service with the post office are completed. </para>

Yet on Monday next we will see a waste of hundreds of thousands of dollars- money that could be well spent in helping these people. That event will be well covered by television. I am sure that when the pensioners see it exposed on television they will have heartburn because they have to coast along trying to buy the necessities and to have a decent living standard. When they see the expense involved in this pomp and ceremony that will be taking place at the behest of the Chief Justice they will be very disappointed. </para>

I lodge my protest about that. I am sure that many people would support me in pursuing these matters, particularly the first matter which I raised, namely this Government's continuing to allow horses to be shipped to Japan for the benefit of those gourmets who want to eat raw horse meat. </para>

          <para>- Honourable senators will recall that I made a short statement a few days ago regarding the problems encountered by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Elizabeth</inline> Thomas of Townsville. In some areas people have attempted to misinterpret the remarks that I made on that occasion. Some people feel that I made charges against them even though I did not mention any names. The lady concerned has had an extremely rough passage as a result of the punishment meted out to her. </para>

        <para>My criticism is directed to the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt),</inline> to his Department and to the Public Service Board. This lady was suspended for a period exceeding six months and she received no pay. She received a telegram dated 28 April 1980 from the Public Service Board advising her that she had been dismissed from service on 18 April. On 29 April, she received a further telegram advising her that she had been dismissed on 24 April. The point I wish to make is that there have been some problems associated with the transcript of the appeal at which she appeared and was represented by senior legal people. </para>
        <para>A further letter has been received to that from which I quoted the other day. I quote only three or four of the points contained in that letter to show that this doubt still exists. The letter is dated 29 May 1980, at which date we have not yet arrived.

I make a final appeal to the Government to re-examine the whole case and for the Department to examine the transcript. I hope that she will receive some justice as a result of any further examination that might be conducted. </para>

            <para>- It is not in recession, so <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Teague</inline> tells me it is normal to have 400,000-odd people unemployed and static growth. As numerous economists have observed, and most recently Kasper and others in <inline font-style="italic">Australia at the Crossroads,</inline> during the 1950s and 1960s the performance of the Australian economy was quite dismal. Given our resource endowments, our 2 per cent annual growth rate in the labour force, and the extremely high level of capital formation during that period, our growth performance was extremely poor. My constructive suggestion is that the entrepreneurial talent which abounds in the Fraser Cabinet and in the Liberal and National Country parties should be harnessed to inspire all the other lack-lustre captains of commerce and industry to improve their performance. There can be no doubt that indifferent management has been a major factor in the poor long-term performance of the Australian economy and our very low rate of growth. </para>

            <para>- I am judging it against the rest of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. These Ministers and their associates, who have a great deal of entrepreneurial talent, have failed to inspire the other entrepreneurs because they have been so modest about their own triumphs in industry and commerce. Their reticence has precluded them from exploiting their potential to inspire. In fact, we hear of their business triumphs and acumen from other people, never from themselves. They should be more philanthropic and diffuse their talent and experience. For example, if one wanted a lesson in profitable land trading, where could one find a better tutor than Philip Lynch, who made a profit of some $300,000 in land transactions at Stumpy Gully. It does, of course, help in such a profitable business if the planning authority, which is in control of land zoning, is the  chairman  of your campaign committee and is also involved in your land dealing operations so that he knows when the time is expeditious to buy and sell land. In spite of that- it is an advantage that would not be available to everyone- I am still sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> could impart other useful information to those who wish to emulate his feat. </para>

        <para>A critical factor in determining the viability of any business is the fate of interest on borrowed funds. Could one find anyone better equipped than the relatives of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)-particularly</inline> Sandford and Hugh Beggs- to instruct budding entrepreneurs on the procedures necessary to obtain the funds at the lowest possible rate of interest, to wit at 4 per cent, when the going rate of interest is 10 per cent? <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick, of course, is a highly successful three-career man.  His  first career, of course, was law, his second career was politics, and his third career was business, although his business career was unknown to the public until he entered his 77th year. He reached the top in law, in politics, and in business, and what an inspiration his example would have been to the rising generation of entrepreneurs. </para>

Knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> 's emotional attachment to Robert Menzies, it must have pained him to repudiate the clearly expressed views of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> on the question of judicial involvement in business. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> of course, is not a man to shirk his duty, as he clearly showed in 195 1 when he judged that it was more important to the cause of world anti-communism to proceed to Oxford to pick up that third class degree instead of fighting the wicked communists in Korea. With <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser's</inline> insight and deep knowledge of economic history in this matter, he saw that the views of Robert Menzies were a barrier to progress and had to be swept away as the mercantilists were swept away by Adam Smith in the nineteenth century- and the twentieth century bourgeois industrialists. </para>
        <para>Unfortunately I cannot comment on the business career of a former Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair.</inline> Likewise we have much to learn about the business career of Ransley Victor Garland, the present Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. Those who search the records of the Corporate Affairs Commission of Western Australia will learn that throughout the 1970s and up until the late 1970s he was virtually the major shareholder and the controller of three proprietary companies which on the same day in February 1978 had their share registers transferred to Peat, Marwick and Co. in Darwin and then transferred back to Perth to Melsom Wilson and Partners in St Georges Terrace. In the meantime the directors of all the companies had been changed. Previously the directors had been <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garland</inline> and other members of his family. In this interim period new directors for all the three companies were appointed- the same directors in each case- they being Messrs Sheedy and Collie of Melbourne. All the notifications of these changes were lodged by another Melbourne firm, Rickford Administration. </para>
        <para>When the companies were finally wound up in October 1979, they having gone into voluntary liquidation-they were all liquidated by the same liquidator- the only shareholder was Hulldale Pty Ltd. It is not known how Hulldale acquired ownership of the companies because that information is not disclosed in the Corporate Affairs Commission files. In October 1959 there was a distribution of funds of just over $500 for each of the three companies. We do not know why all this was done, but it is obvious that heavy legal costs must have been incurred in this multiple transfer of ownership and a corporate shuffle over two States and one Territory. It is not likely that it would have been done if the only assets the companies had at any stage totalled $500. The companies, incidentally, were Stirling West Pty Ltd, Greenbank Pty Ltd and Frederic Salons Pty Ltd, which were directly or indirectly controlled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garland.</inline></para>

            <para>-I do not think it was a hairdressing salon. I do not know what the business was. We can be sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garland</inline> would be much too astute a businessman to have organised that multiple transfer of ownership in that two-State and one Territory shuffle unless there were some good fiscal reasons for so doing. One of the possibilities which opens up, although there is no evidence of it, is that perhaps at the time the ownership was transfered the companies' assets might have been considerably in excess of $500, and that possibly following the well-known frugality of Liberal Party Ministers when it comes to paying taxes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garland</inline> was seeking to minimise his taxation liabilities.

            <para>-We have not had a chance to do anything with that, have we? The activities of the Ministers or people in and around the Fraser Government have not been confined to the mollycoddled domestic economy with which the companies to which I have so far referred have been associated. They have also been successful exporters. Nareen wool, for instance, helps the Red Army defeat the vicious Afghan chill. In fact half the Cabinet are successful exporters. Their role as suppliers of food and fibre to the Politburo and the ayatollahs make a significant contribution to earning our precious export income. </para>

        <para class="block">I am quite willing to if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> insists. This member of the Liberal Party said: 'Can I come to see you some time?' I said: 'Yes, this afternoon'. He did come to see me. He did not tell me much about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crichton-Browne's</inline> business affairs that I did not already know. He told me a few other matters. There were perhaps two significant points. One is that at the time of the Poseidon boom, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crichton-Browne's</inline> then fiancee, now his wife, Esther, worked in the office of the Burrill company, the consultant geologists, and therefore was extremely well placed to procure information not only about Poseidon but also probably about other companies prior to it becoming public knowledge information, which no doubt was put to very good use by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crichton-Browne</inline> in his other share trading activities. This man also told me the name of an accountant who could probably shed some light on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crichton-Browne's</inline> association with a Christo Mull, who is the organiser of a very large but apparently unsuccessful taxation evasion racket. </para>
        <para>Maybe if Ministers were not so reticent about their entrepreneurial activities and their business acumen, we might be able to find out the link between Stumpy Gully and Rundle, the common factor involving both Stumpy Gully and Rundle. We might also be able to find out why the Government has been so anxious, against highly reputable geological evidence, to declare the Fortescue oil field a new oil discovery at the ultimate cost to the Australian Treasury of some $2 billion or $3 billion. Of course, not all of the entrepreneurs who have close associations with the present Government have been as successful as those I have named. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser's</inline> former research worker, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gale,</inline> presided over a company that went into liquidation and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gale</inline> himself went into Long Bay gaol. The business enterprises of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> M. Miller, who has close associations with the National Country Party, likewise were less successful than Stumpy Gully and some of the other companies I have mentioned. This vast reservoir of business knowledge and acumen in and around Cabinet should be tapped in the interests of Australian capitalism. I implore the Ministers and associates concerned to adopt a more philanthropic approach to this matter and disseminate their knowledge more widely. </para>

          <para>On13 May1980 you asked me a series of questions concerning the opinion of the Solicitor-General tabled in the Parliament on 29 April relating to the propriety of the Chief Justice participating in certain decisions of the Full Court of the High Court of Australia. I am not prepared to table the materials that were available to the Solicitor-General at the time of his preparation of that opinion. The material is in the nature of a brief to counsel and it is not the usual practice to table such briefs. What I can say is that the Solicitor-General had newspaper articles, the letter from the Chief Justice and other <inline font-style="italic">comments by officers of</inline> my Department. I have discussed your questions with the Solicitor-General. The Solicitor-General informs me that he has read and considered the facts and contentions you made in the Senate on 29 April last. He is of the view that the facts referred to do not establish that a fair-minded person would reasonably suspect that an unfair and prejudiced mind would be brought to bear on the resolution of the judicial questions involved. That being so, no question of disclosure arises. </para>

        <para class="block">About that letter I say only this: If the Attorney-General thinks that he has, by this letter, closed the ledger once and for all on the Barwick affair he is sadly mistaken. There is a long list of unanswered questions still remaining- questions of fact about the precise nature and extent of the Chief Justice's direct and indirect interests both in Mundroola Pty Ltd and in various companies which have litigated cases before him and questions of law and of convention about the obligations hitherto thought absolute on justices at least to disclose the existence of interests which might reasonably be thought capable of giving rise to bias. The cursory and terse dismissal of these questions by this Government does no one concerned any credit. Fundamental questions of propriety and public interest are involved. They are questions which simply cannot be willed away in this fashion. </para>

		  <quote>
		  <para>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs aware that early in the morning of Thursday, 10 April, at the Hollywood Repatriation General Hospital in Perth two hooded men threatened two nurses with violence and stole a quantity of hard drugs? Because of the violence associated with illegal drug usage, will the Minister give an assurance that increased security will be provided at the hospital so that nurses, especially those on night duty, will not run the risk of being physically assaulted by criminals in search of hard drugs?</para>
		</quote>
		  <para>The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para>
		  <quote>
		  <para>I have been kept fully informed on the break-in at the Repatriation General Hospital Hollywood, on 10 April 1980. It is understood that three youths have since appeared in the East Perth Court charged with stealing drugs from the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital and have been remanded until 22 May 1980.</para>
		  <para>As far as the security of the hospital is concerned, it is patrolled on a regular basis by trained hospital patrolman.</para>
		  <para>Indeed it was during such a patrol that a hospital patrolman observed and chased two men involved in the offence and was later able to provide a description of the men to the Police.</para>
		  <para>Security aspects aimed at protecting the hospital staff, particularly those on night duty are constantly being reviewed by the Hospital management. The honourable senator has my assurance that everything possible is being done to protect hospital personnel from incidents similar to that which occurred on the 10 April and as a result of this incident security procedures have again been reviewed and certain increased security measures introduced.</para>

              <para>The Government on November 1979 tabled its response to the Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. In its response, the Government made clear that the Committee's Report constituted a significant contribution to the definition of the problems and needs of children living in isolated areas. It was also noted that developments generally in line with the conclusions of the Committee were proceeding or were contemplated. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The Government has been concerned to ensure that the educational facilities and opportunities available for children in isolated areas are improved through a series of programs specifically designed with this purpose in mind. The Government has continued its commitment to the Scheme of Assistance to Isolated Children, which provides help to parents in the form of boarding, correspondence and second home allowances. In 1977 it introduced the Disadvantaged Country Areas Program, aimed at extending services to students living in country areas nominated as educationally disadvantaged. Specifically for the assistance of Aboriginal students, many of whom live in isolated areas and need to attend boarding schools, the Aboriginal Secondary Grants Scheme has been maintained. The Scheme provisions and allowances are designed to assist and encourage Aboriginal students to remain at school for as long as they are able to benefit. </para>
          <para>It needs to be emphasised that Government schools in country areas also benefit from the allocation of funds from general purpose Schools Commission programs for recurrent and capital expenditure. The determination of priorities is a matter for the State authorities. Non-government country schools receive grants direct. Considerable advances have been made in country areas in recent years, although the situation of many less advantaged non-government schools continues to cause the Government concern. </para>

              <para>1 ) There have been <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> number of inquiries and reports in recent years on language usage in Australia, and on language teaching and curricular provision, but the data which has been gathered is at best fragmented. The 1976 Census was the first Australian Census since 1933 to attempt to gather nation-wide data on language use. The 1 976 Census question asked that all 'languages regularly used' by the person whether at home, at work, at school, when shopping, etc. be listed (including English). At this stage, only limited preliminary Census results of the language question have been released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Study of this data has been proceeding at a number of educational institutions, for example in the Department of Demography at the Australian National University and in the Centre for Migrant Studies at Monash University. Further Census data is expected in the near future from the Bureau and it is hoped that this will extend our understanding of language use in Australia. If the term 'proficiency' implies linguistic ability I am not aware of any particular studies directed to assessing proficiency in languages other than English. There must be doubt whether it is practicable to attempt to measure proficiency in any language through a self-enumation census style approach. The 1976 Census question was concerned with language use and not proficiency. </para>

              <para>As indicated in the Treasurer's response to Question No. 2259 official forward cover facilities available through the banking system are designed basically to enable the private sector to cover exchange risks on trade transactions and some closely related invisible transactions. Consequently official forward exchange facilities are not available to Government departments or organisations which are essentially part of a Government department. Official forward cover facilities are usually available, however, to public corporations if they are involved in commercial operations and if they are entirely dependent upon revenue raised in the pursuit of these commercial operations. Official forward cover is not available for capital transactions. Statutory authorities may seek to cover their foreign currency exposure arising from capital transaction, or any other transaction ineligible for official forward cover, in the interbank or intercompany currency hedging markets. </para>

          <list type="upperalpha">
            <item label="(">
              <para>I ) The Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Citizen Military Forces (the Millar Committee) included an examination of the question of retention of members in some detail. In addition, a number of studies have been conducted by Army Reserve formations, on a regional basis, to determine the best ways to increase retention. No formal studies have been undertaken by the Navy and Air Force as their strengths are considerably lower than the Army's. The number seeking discharge before the expiration of engagement is small and has not been a source of concern. </para>
              <list type="decimal">
                <item label="(2)">
                  <para>The conclusions drawn by the Millar Committee are contained in Chapters 1 and 10 and Annexes C and D of the Committee's Report. Factors identified as having an influence on members' decisions to seek discharge include a change in job or occupation and\/or a change in place of living, the unwillingness of employers to release members and negative attitudes of wives or girlfriends. Later regional studies conducted by Army Reserve formations also indicate that the main reasons members leave the Army Reserve are job change, increased job demands, insufficient time available and family commitments. </para>
                </item>
                <item label="(">
                  <para>3 ) Following one of the Millar Committee 's recom mendations, the Committee of Employer Support of Reserve Forces was established in 1977 to promote service in the Reserves of the three Arms of the Defence Force. Employers were asked specifically to release employees serving in the Reserves for camps and other training, thus contributing to the stability of the Reserve Forces. The response of employers to date has been satisfying. There is little that can be done to slow down the rate of discharge in cases where members place family interests ahead of those of the Reserve Forces. </para>

            <para>In June 1 979, Australian and Soviet scientists drew up a program of cooperation in a groundwater study of the Murray-Darling and South-East Coast catchment areas. This program was to have been undertaken under the auspices of the Australia/ USSR Scientific and Technical Cooperation Agreement. As the honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator will</inline> be aware, all activities under this Agreement were indefinitely suspended by the Australian Government in January 1 980. </para>

The honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator will</inline> be aware that in February 1980 the Government, after a review of its relations with the Soviet Union which took into account the attitudes of other countries including the United States and the United Kingdom, decided that the export of raw materials to the USSR should continue normally. </para>

            <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> article of 22 April to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> has referred was in fact pan of an extensive publicity campaign aimed at potential applicants for Secondary Allowances Scheme benefits undertaken by the Queensland Office of my Department. Intensive publicity efforts were made to ensure that as many as possible of those eligible for benefits submitted applications before the first term closing date of 2 May. Publicity material was provided to the metropolitan and provincial press, to radio and television stations and to other appropriate information outlets such as government and non-government welfare agencies. All Queensland members of Parliament, both State and Federal, were also sent information material on the Scheme, and reminders concerning the closing date were sent to schools and guidance services. </para>
            <para>These measures have served to supplement the already extensive publicity given to the Scheme. The major components of this earlier publicity were two annual large-scale exercises aimed directly at parents. Towards the end of 1 979 information cards on the Scheme were distributed through the Department of Social Security to all parents with children who had turned or were about to turn 16 years of age. In addition, special brochures were sent to schools in sufficient numbers for a copy to be provided to each student about to enter year 1 1 or year 12. </para>
            <para>I might add that the Scheme's publicity also takes into account the special needs of migrants. Information translated into eight different languages is included in a special brochure which is distributed each year to migrant organisations, welfare agencies and schools. </para>

Following receipt of advice from the Commission, the Government decided to seek the views of the Antarctic Research Policy Advisory Committee (ARPAC) and of the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee (AMSTAC) on the proposal. The Tertiary Education Commission is currently re-examining the proposal in the light of the views of the two advisory bodies, following which it will be further considered by the Government in the context of the Government's Tasmanian policy and a decision will then be taken. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question. </para>
          <para>Formal applications have been received from TAA and Ansett seeking an increase in domestic air tariffs. Their claims are based in part on recent increases in fuel and labour cost increases. The rapidly rising price of fuel is having a particularly severe impact on the airline industry. </para>
          <para>The initiatives taking place in the area of discount fares reflect the more highly competitive attitude on the part of the airlines. In general discounts have not been extended but conditions attached to concessional fares have been relaxed and simplified to bring benefits from easier administration and public understanding. </para>
          <para>Promotional fares are intended to be self-financing in that they generate new business, and do not affect availability of seats to normal economy and first class passengers since their allocation is limited on the more highly loaded flights and used on a fill-up basis for other flights. In this way the additional revenue from these fares helps contain the overall level of fare increases thus benefiting regular travellers. </para>

            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) To obtain precise information on statutory authorities within the administration of the New South Wales Government, the honourable senator would need to approach that Government. There are a number of different types of public authorities within the New South Wales Government administration (and other administrations ) ranging from departments to various semi-autonomous bodies. Published lists of such authorities differ according to the <inline font-style="italic">purposes tor</inline> which the lists are required. For instance, the 1978-79 Report of the New South Wales Auditor-General refers to the accounts of some 219 statutory bodies and various public authorities. These are authorities having independent financial operations subject to audit. </para>

          </list>
          <para>Funds made available to the State under the personal income tax sharing arrangements and through the State Government Loan Council borrowing programs are intended for use by the New South Wales Government as it sees fit: the Commonwealth does not seek to determine the manner in which they are expended. This is in accordance with the Commonwealth's Federalism Policy which emphasises the need for the States and local government to determine their own priorities within their spheres. Accordingly, it is not possible to say to what extent such funds may have been used by the State to fund the activities of the authorities. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth also provides financial assistance to New South Wales (and to the other States) by way of specific purpose payments. Through these payments the Commonwealth assists and encourages the States to pursue priorities they share. As a general rule, however, the Commonwealth does not prescribe the detailed administrative arrangements for expenditure of these funds by State Governments. The extent to which such funds may be channelled through State statutory authorities is therefore not known to the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>The statistics which appear in the Administrative Review Council second Consultative Paper relate basically to New South Wales and were specifically collated for the Administrative Review Council. Statistics in this form have not been collected or maintained throughout Australia. The collection of national statistics on review operations is presently being examined. The following statistics for New South Wales for 1979 are however available: number of reviews conducted- 4,267; number of decisions varied upon review- 1,804; number of decisions not varied upon review- 2,463. It is known that 542 appeals were lodged with Social Security Appeals Tribunals in respect of decisions which had been the subject of those 4,267 reviews; other appeals may also have been lodged. Some measure of the procedure can be guaged from the fact that the number of appeals being lodged with Social Security Appeals Tribunals has fallen substantially since the introduction of this review process. The number of appeals lodged with the Tribunals throughout Australia in 1979 was 7,227. In 1978 the corresponding figure was 14, 142. </para>

            <item label="(1">
              <para>) Approximately 40 representations have been received on the question of invalid pension reviews so far this year. (2), (3) and (4) Under the Pensioner Entitlement Review Program all invalid pensioners are selected annually for review and receive a questionnaire asking for details of their circumstances at that time. The selection is normally timed to coincide with the anniversary of grant of pension. In addition, there are other special reviews, e.g., medical reviews, reviews related to possible earnings and a child attaining16 years, etc. Historical data about these reviews is not held in the computer record. To obtain this type of information it would be necessary to undertake a considerable amount of clerical effort to physically examine every invalid pension paper file in all offices. </para>

          <para>The following paragraph should be inserted on page 7 of the Council's First Report after the phrase 'we believe best meets these objectives' at the end of the third paragraph under Question 1. Question 2 then becomes Question 3 and the new Question 2 is as follows: </para>

              <para>2 Are the current social security provisions (family allowances, payments to pensioners and beneficiaries for children, etc.) and current income tax arrangements meeting those objectives? </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Current social security provisions and current income tax arrangements are not meeting the objective of fairness to families with children. The reason for this is that family allowances and payments for children to pensioners and beneficiaries have not been indexed since at least 1976 (since 1965 in the case of the guardian's allowance), whereas the tax rate and the dependent spouse rebate have been indexed. This means that the relative position of families with children has necessarily deteriorated vis-a-vis those without children. In other words, there has been a transfer of resources through the tax/welfare system from those with children to those without children. The group of taxpayers that has suffered most since 1 975-76 are sole parents on the minimum wage. Their relative position has deteriorated sharply because the introduction of income tax on widows' pensions and supporting mothers' benefit was only partially offset by the introduction of family allowances and by the increase, in that year, of the sole parent rebate. Sole parents on welfare have also lost out, relative to other beneficiaries. The plight of the sole parent families was highlighted in the recent ACOSS/DSS survey into emergency relief that shows that sole parents with dependent children, a group constituting 8.8 per cent of the population, make up between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of all recipients of emergency relief.

In the letters to the Premiers of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania, the Prime Minister recommended that their States introduce legislation in respect of student union membership at universities and colleges of advanced education similar to that proposed for the ANU and the Canberra College of Advanced Education and which came into effect on 1 January 1 980. The letters to the Premiers of Victoria and Western Australia took into account that in those States, certain action had already been taken. </para>

            <para>My Department has not undertaken a study of the particular methods used in the education of handicapped children by the New Start for the Under Achiever Association (ANSUA). While involved both directly and through supporting services in assisting in the education of handicapped children, it has not been the function of the Department to evaluate particular methods. It would be appropriate that such evaluation should be undertaken by the authorities directly responsible for education in the classroom, that is, the State Departments of Education or their counterparts in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, and by the non-government school authorities. I suggest that ANSUA might wish to approach these authorities which are directly involved in this way in providing services for children whose educational progress is inhibited by various forms of handicap or learning difficulties. </para>

          <para class="block">Personnel and Related Matters </para>
          <para>Recruitment (Recommendation 127)- the Public Service Board has had the question of delegation of aspects of recruitment practice under study for some lime. Some delegations have been made. For example, departments may now determine when to advertise vacancies as open to persons not permanent officers of the Service. Further, the Board has delegated to specified officers in the Department of Health authority to accept persons as medically fit for appointment to the Service. The question of further recruitment delegation is being examined by the Public Service Board. </para>
          <para>Lateral recruitment (Recommendation 128)- 128 (a): see answer in respect of recommendation 127. 128(b): for an indication of opportunities provided for career development see Public Service Board Annual Reports 1978 pages 67-69, 1979 pages 41-45. 128(c): this recommendation has not been accepted. 128 (d): the Public Service Amendment Act 1 978, when proclaimed, will introduce revised arrangements governing the movement of staff from the Public Service to Commonwealth statutory authorities whose staff are covered by the Public Service Act and other public sector employers. </para>
          <para>Restoration of benefit entitlements on re-appointment (Recommendation 129)- for details of action taken on this recommendation see Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> 23 November 1979, page 2980. </para>
          <para>Nationality requirement for appointment (Recommendations 117-119)- the Government has this matter under attention. </para>
          <para>Equal employment opportunity (Recommendations 120, 125, 126 (f), 134-147, 160 (c) (v), 183 (c), 334 (e))-for details of action taken see Public Service Board Annual Reports 1977 pages 76-80, 1978 pages 73-77 and 1979 pages 52-57. Recommendations relating to the legislative prohibition of discrimination in government employment are still under consideration. </para>
          <para>Character checking for appointment (Recommendation 121)- this recommendation was considered in conjunction with recommendations of the Royal Commission on Security and Intelligence. Revised arrangements for character assessments are currently under consideration in relation to the implementation of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. Further the Minister for Administrative Services has directed that where criminal record information is sought for employment and similar purposes it should be supplied to the subject and not to the third party enquirer, unless the subject has formally waived this right. </para>
          <para>Security checks (Recommendation 122)- the Government has announced that security checking will now only take place when it is reasonably expected that public servants will require access to classified matters or areas. The Board has discontinued, as a general practice, the checking prior to employment of all recruits to the Second and Third Division and is currently reviewing, in consultation with relevant permanent heads, changes required as a result of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. A Security Appeals Tribunal is to be established under this Act. </para>
          <para>Educational qualifications (Recommendations 1 30- 133)- 130: the Public Service Board takes into account the factors mentioned in this recommendation in reviewing and prescribing educational qualifications. 131: the approach recommended is that taken by the Public Service Board. 132-133: the Public Service Board does not favour the delegation of its powers to set minimum qualifications. </para>
          <para>Restrictions on graduate recruitment (Recommendation 123)- the Public Service Amendment Act 1978, when proclaimed, will abolish the 10 per cent restriction on the number of non-specialist graduate recruits. </para>
          <para>Preference for ex-servicemen (Recommendation 124)- the Government has decided to retain existing arrangements. </para>
          <para>Staff development (Recommendation 160)- action taken on this recommendation is summarised in the Public Service Board's 1978 annual Report at pages 67-68 and in its 1979 Report at page 44. </para>
          <para>Promotion and promotion appeals (Recommendations 161, 163, 165-1 75)- the Government has decided that promotion in the Public Service should be based solely on efficiency. The Government has also decided to streamline measures for selection, promotion and promotion appeals in the Public Service; details were announced by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters on 1 7 September 1979. (See <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Record,</inline> 17-23 September 1979, pages 1393-1394). </para>
          <para>Promotion selection (Recommendations 162, 164)- the Public Service Board has issued guidelines on the formation and operation of staff selection committees. </para>
          <para>Interviewing (Recommendation 126)- the Public Service Board has issued a training manual on staff selection and guidelines on the formulation and operation of staff selection committees. </para>
          <para>Disciplinary procedures (Recommendations 177, 186)- a new discipline code for the Public Service was incorporated in the Public Service Amendment Act 1978. </para>
          <para>Information on disciplinary procedures (Recommendation 185)- when the disciplinary provisions introduced by the Public Service Amendment Act 1 978 are proclaimed, the Public Service Board will be issuing a manual of policies and procedures which will be available to management and staff. A short leaflet outlining the main aspects of the disciplinary process and the rights of individuals will also be produced and distributed to staff. </para>
          <para>Grievance procedures (Recommendations 183, 187-197, 199)- aspects of these recommendations have been considered by the Public Service Board and the Joint Council. Following an interim Joint Council report, the Board had established a Grievance and Appeals Bureau to provide a focus for all appeals and other grievances now directed to the Board. The Bureau will co-ordinate the investigation and resolution of such appeals and grievances. Outstanding aspects of these recommendations will be considered in the context of further examination of the Royal Commission's recommendations on co-ordination in Commonwealth employment ( Recommendations 213-217, 221, 333). </para>
          <para>Redundancy and early retirement (Recommendations 178-180)- the principles incorporated in the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979 in respect of redundancy, invalidity and inefficiency or limited efficiency of staff are broadly consistent with these recommendations which were, however, framed in the context of the relevant provisions of the Public Service Act. The Redeployment and Retirement Act also provides for voluntary early retirement at age 55. </para>
          <para>Abolition of the Divisional structure of the Service (Recommendations 205, 238)- the Government has decided that the Divisional structure of the Public Service should be abolished. (The decision was announced on 28 November 1979; see <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Record 26</inline> November-2 December 1979, pages 1833-34). </para>
          <para>Categories of employment (Recommendations 209-212)-under the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979 temporary staff with more than 12 months service are to be treated in the same way and have the same rights as permanent officers. Further the Public Service Amendment Act 1978 provided for temporary staff with 12 months service to have access to the discipline appeals provisions. Other aspects relating to the distinction between permanent and temporary staff will be examined as priorities permit. In relation to part-time employment, the Public Service Board is at present canvassing with departments and authorities the future role of this form of employment in the Public Service. </para>
          <para>Rotation between policy and management/operational areas (Recommendations 27, 243)- the Public Service Board is examining conditions of service and other issues, and monitoring progress. Permanent heads have been asked to take account of recommendation 243 in making selection of staff. </para>
          <para>Womens policy units (Recommendation 299)- women's policy units have been established in the Attorney-General 's Department, and the Departments of Education, Health, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and Social Security, the Australian Development Assistance Bureau and the Schools Commission. The Women's Bureau in the now Department of Employment and Youth Affairs was established in 1963 (it was originally known as the Women's Section) to promote equality of opportunity for women in employment and to encourage the full use of individual women's talents and skills. It provides information and advice on issues affecting women in employment. In 1 975 the Public Service Board established the Equal Employment Opportunity Section, now the Equal Employment Opportunity Branch, to develop policy, co-ordinate advice and provide information on equal employment opportunity matters affecting disadvantaged groups, including women, Aboriginals, migrants and handicapped persons within the Australian Public Service. Australia Post, Telecom, the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Department of Housing and Construction have established Equal Employment Opportunity Sections with similar responsibilities in respect of their agencies. </para>
          <para>Experiments in organisation and personnel practice (Recommendation 1 1 )- the Public Service Board is continuing work in this area as resources permit. </para>
          <para>The role of the Chief Officer (Recommendations 20-21, 54)- the Public Service Board has consulted permanent heads on these recommendations. The recommendations are still being considered. </para>
          <para>Staff rotation and exchange (Recommendations 94, 114, 330-33 1 )- the Public Service Board has introduced an Interchange Program to facilitate exchanges of personnel between the Australian Public Service and other parts of the public sector and organisations in the private sector. Details are provided in Public Service Board Annual Reports 1978 pages 5-6 and 1979 pages 5, 117-120. The Board has also delegated to departments authority to arrange permanent transfers of staff when the departments and the officer are in agreement. The Board has suggested, in introducing these arrangements, that departments adopt a liberal attitude towards the release of staff on transfer and make full use of transfers of staff on a planned basis as part of a program of staff development. </para>
          <para>Studies assistance (Recommendation 154)- following a Joint Council review of continuing education in the Service, the Board has developed a new studies assistance scheme consistent with this recommendation. Background information is provided in the Public Service Board Annual Report 1979, pages 44-45. New studies assistance guidelines have been promulgated by the Board. </para>
          <para>Staff assessment (Recommendations 156-159)- in 1977 the Public Service Board issued guidelines on the development and use of staff appraisal schemes to assist departments on matters of principle in the applications of staff appraisal practices. Again in 1978, following extensive consideration in the Joint Council, the Board issued two further documents to departments: 'Staff Appraisal Schemes in the Australian </para>
          <para class="block">Public Service' and 'The Design and Implementation of Staff Appraisal Schemes'. So far as making appraisal reports available to promotion selection and appeal committees is concerned, the policy suggested in these documents is that if the reports are prepared as part of a promotion reporting system then they should be made so available. If appraisal reports are prepared for other purposes however (for example, staff development) it is suggested that they should only be used for those purposes and not be made available to promotion selection or appeal committees. In relation to promotion appeals all relevant documentation, including original selection committee reports, should be provided to Promotion Appeal Committees. </para>
          <para>Pre-retirement training (Recommendation 184)- the Public Service Board has issued a retirement planning seminar guide to departments and authorities. </para>
          <para>Individual work plans (Recommendation 204)- the factors raised by the recommendations relating to individual work plans are taken into account in the staff utilisation reviews organised by the Public Service Board and departments. So far as recommendation 204 (a) is concerned, duty statements exist for positions in the Service and are freely available to officers. </para>
          <para>Delegation of the Public Service Board 's power to annul probationary appointments (Recommendation 176)- a decision has not yet been taken on acceptance or rejection of the recommendation. </para>
          <para>Research on career patterns (Recommendation 153)- the Public Service Board included in its 1 976 Annual Report the results of a study on career patterns (see pages 106-1 1 1). In June 1978 the Board published a paper entitled 'Foreign Affairs Officers: A Study of Career Patterns'. The Board is continuing research of this kind as resources permit. </para>
          <para>Rights and duties of staff (Recommendations 1, 15, 182)-the Public Service Board issued a set of guidelines on official conduct in October 1979. </para>
          <para>Pecuniary interests of officials (Recommendation 198)- the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Duty and Private Interests was made public in November 1979, and the Government has announced that it has accepted virtually the whole of the Committee's recommendations in regard to Ministers, public servants and other officials. In regard to public servants, the Public Service Board has promulgated the Code of Conduct recommended by the Committee of Enquiry and has notified steps to be taken in relation to the disclosure of interests by public servants and consultants, the acceptance of gifts, travel and hospitality, and the acceptance of business appointments after separation from the Service. </para>
          <para>Senior appointments (Recommendations 41, 49)- new principles and procedures for permanent head appointments were incorporated in the Public Service Amendment (First Divisions Officers) Act 1976. See also Public Service Board Annual Report 1977, pages 92-94. </para>
          <para>Permanent Heads (Recommendations 51-52)- the  Chairman  of the Public Service Board has been asked to have regard to these recommendations in developing and administering his responsibilities for senior appointments. </para>
          <para>Senior executive staffing (Recommendations 239- 240)- the Government has decided that all senior vacancies in the Public Service should be advertised within the Service and that senior officers should not normally remain in one position from more than 5 to 7 years. The Public Service Board has also encouraged permanent heads to advertise all senior vacancies. Other aspects of these recommendations are being examined by the Board. </para>
          <para>Senior staff register (Recommendation 329)- the Public Service Board has established, on the basis of voluntary returns, a biographic register of Second Division staff in the Service and of senior staff in  statutory authorities. </para>
          <para class="block">Industrial and Related Matters </para>
          <para>Conditions of employment in relation to staff dispersal and decentralisation (Recommendation 97)- no action was required on this recommendation as guidelines on consultation arrangements and employment conditions had been established by the time the Royal Commission completed its report. </para>
          <para>Salary ranges and groups (Recommendation 155)- the Public Service Board will consider this recommendation as changes occur in the salary structure. In the past salary structures in the Service have been devised on a group by group basis having regard to the factors relevant to salaries for each group, including rates paid for comparable work by other employers. In this the Board has paid attention to the integration of occupational groups within the Service. Continuing attention will be paid to this question as National Wage Case guidelines and other priorities permit. </para>
          <para>Personal classification ( Recommendations 148 and 1 50) - following a Public Service Board/Departmental Working Party Review of the grading system applying to Research Scientists in the Department of Defence, scope was found for the introduction of a special performance based promotion system. Promotion procedures similar to those applying to Research Medical Officers are under consideration. In general, these enable officers to claim promotion based upon their satisfying criteria for selection to higher levels. Other areas where there may be further scope for orienting grading systems to the level of contribution of the individual are being kept under notice. </para>
          <para>Classification committees (Recommendation 203)- this recommendation has been considered by a Joint Council sub-committe which recommended against establishment of classification committees. </para>
          <para>Review of Technical/Professional areas (Recommendation 206)- the Public Service Board is monitoring these areas with a view to improving the structural separation of professional and technical work but is conscious of the constraints of wage indexation guidelines in implementing any recommendations that propose significant change. Clerk and Clerical Assistant structure (Recommendation 207)- the development of an approach to the Commission's recommendation to review lower grade work in the clerical/administrative area with a view to devolving it to the clerical assistant group is closely linked to the implementation of the Government's decision to remove the Divisional structure of the Public Service. In the context of reviews of occupational groups in progress the Board had paid particular attention to areas where there is scope for rationalisation of clerical /administrative work and the greater use of clerical assistants. </para>
          <para>Other lower level career structure aspects (Recommendations 151 and 1 52 )- the Public Service Board recognises the need for the enhancement of career opportunities for the typing/stenographic group and, for example, encourages the use of multi-role jobs combining typing/secretarial and clerical assistant tasks where they provide efficiency and economy over single-role positions. Removal of unnecessary barriers to career opportunities is one of the factors inherent in the implementation of the Government's decision to remove the Divisional structure of the Public Service. </para>
          <para>Staff organisation involvement in classification activities (Recommendation 208)- following consideration of this matter by the Joint Council, the Public Service Board has issued guidelines for consultation with staff organisations on classification matters. </para>
          <para>Discretionary increments (Recommendation149)- this was considered by the Joint Council; no action is planned at this stage. </para>
          <para>Staffing of courts (Recommendation 222)- so far as the High Court is concerned the High Court of Australia Act 1979 provides that the  Clerk  shall engage such staff as are deemed necessary by the Court on terms and conditions determined by the Court with the concurrence of the Public Service Board. Staffing arrangements for other courts are not under consideration at this stage. </para>
          <para>Remuneration Tribunal determination (Recommendation 218)- no action is necessary as the Tribunal's determinations have automatic effect, subject to disallowance by the Parliament. </para>
          <para>Jurisdiction of tribunals (Recommendations 244 and 254)- under consideration. </para>
          <para>Power of disallowance (Recommendation 245)- under consideration. </para>
          <para>Rights of appearance (Recommendation 246)- under consideration. </para>
          <para>Recognition of the Public Service Board as employing authority ( Recommendation 247 )- under consideration. </para>
          <para>Determining power for the Public Service Board (Recommendation 248)- the Government had decided that the Public Service Act should be amended to give the Public Service Board power to determine conditions of service, subject to Parliamentary disallowance. </para>
          <para>Accusations of pace-setting (Recommendation 249)- prior to the introduction of wage indexation in 1975 an important first step in the Public Service Board's approach to pay fixation was to have regard to rates paid for comparable work by other employers. In forming a view on these matters the Board conducted extensive surveys of market rates of pay itself and subscribed to similar surveys by private management consultants to confirm the Board's own surveys. Since 1975 the Board has adhered to the wage indexation guidelines of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission under which rates paid by other employers are not regarded as a relevant factor in pay fixation. </para>
          <para>More comprehensive awards (Recommendations 250 and 25 1 )- under consideration. </para>
          <para>Strike provision of the Public Service Act (Section 66) Recommendation 252)-no action at present contemplated. </para>
          <para>Other conciliation and arbitration matters (Recommendation 253)-under consideration, </para>
          <para>Code of standards on physical working conditions (Recommendation 256)-a standing committee on staff amenities has been established comprising representatives of the Public Service Board, departments with a policy interest in the provision of amenities and staff organisation peak councils. The Public Service Board has also issued revised amenities standards in the Public Service; these standards are based on Code 305 Personal Facilities issued by the Committee on Occupational Health and Safety in Commonwealth Government Employment. </para>
          <para>Flexitime (Recommendation 259)-for details of action taken in relation to flexible working hours in the Public Service see Public Service Board Annual Reports 1976, pages 68-69; 1977, pages 60-61; 1979, page 14. </para>
          <para>Guidelines for statutory authorities on industrial matters (Recommendation 257)- this recommendation is being considered in relation to recommendations 32-35, 37-38, 43-44 and 274-5 on statutory authorities. </para>
          <para>Structure and role of registered unions (Recommendation 258)- this recommendation is still under consideration. The </para>
          <para class="block">National Labour Consultative Council has been asked for its views on certain aspects of it. </para>
          <para>Commonwealth employment arrangements (Recommendations 213-17, 221, 333 ) - still under consideration. Some action has been taken in this area, for example, the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979 when proclaimed could be applied to areas of Commonwealth employment not at present covered by the Public Service Act. Uniform conditions for most Commonwealth staff exist in superannuation, long service leave, compensation and maternity leave. The Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act 1977 applies to all areas of Commonwealth employment. It has been decided that there should be no change to current arrangements in relation to responsibility for superannuation and compensation. </para>
          <para>Joint Council (Recommendations 260-262 )-these recommendations have been examined by the Government, the Public Service Board and the Joint Council. They will be considered again infurtherworkonrecommendations 213-217, 221 and 333 relating to co-ordination in employment arrangements. </para>
          <para class="block">Efficiency, organisation and related matters </para>
          <para>Forward Estimates (Recommendations 2, 87, 310, 311 (b))-the Government's response to these recommendations is contained in the statement made by the Minister for Finance to the House of Representatives on 4 March 1980 in response to a Report from the House Standing Committee on Expenditure entitled 'Parliament and Public Expenditure'. The Minister stated that the Government saw no advantage in adopting the specific measures proposed by the Royal Commission. He noted that these recommendations generally recommend upgrading of the forward estimates system. This is reflected in the system now operating which integrates the forward estimates into the Budget process, provides for Ministerial involvement and gives a framework within which expenditure priorities can be assessed and control measures can be pursued in an orderly fashion. The Minister stated, however, that the Government does not consider it appropriate or practical to convert the present forward estimates into a comprehensive expenditure planning mechanism or, given the uncertainties involved, that it would be helpful to provide detailed published projections for years ahead. </para>
          <para>Permanent heads- role and relationships (Recommendations 3, 9, 14, 16, 47-48, 53, 55)-for details of action taken see Public Service Board AnnualReport 1978, page 30, Recommendations 47 and 48 were not accepted by the Government, but amendments to the Audit Act (section 2ab (i)) clarified the role of a permanent head in relation to the financial management of his department. The Government has not accepted recommendations 53 and 55. </para>
          <para>Efficiency auditing (Recommendations 4-8, 39-40, 96 (b) (c), 3 12-3 18)- the Audit Amendment Act 1979 provides that the Auditor-General shall undertake efficiency audits and report to the Parliament on these. </para>
          <para>Common services agencies (Recommendation 22)-the possibility of establishing a trial common service unit in Adelaide was examined by the Public Service Board and the Department of Administrative Services. As a result of this study the Board has decided not to proceed with a full scale unit at this stage, butfurther consideration is being given to establishing a common unit for personnel services.Further details are provided in the Board' s1979 Annual Report, pp. 15-16. The Department of Finance has reviewed policy relating to interdepartmental charges and the Government has laid down criteria to be followed.

          <para>Aspects of the Board's management consultancy role (Recommendation 96 (a))-the Board examines delegations in the course of its conduct of joint management and staff utilization reviews. </para>
          <para>Management service units (Recommendations 241- 242)- the Public Service Board has conducted a number of joint management reviews with departments into aspects of management services work and has taken those recommendations into account in the reviews.

Some details of these reviews are given at pages 1 1-13 of the 1979 Report of the Public Service Board. </para>
          <para>Management consultancy unit (Recommendation 327)- a management consultancy pool was established in the Public Service Board's Office in 1978. This unit includes a Level 3, Second Division position, three Level 1 positions as well as other senior Third Division positions. Staff from policy and management services areas of departments are seconded to the pool from time to time and private management consultants are engaged on a full-time or part-time basis to help with the services provided by the pool. Consultant services are not usually provided to organisations outside the Public Service proper although the Board has given assistance to some Commonwealth government organisations not staffed under the Public Service Act. </para>
          <para>Registries (Recommendation 301)- in July 1979 a study was undertaken to determine the feasibility of a major review. An inter-departmental working group was established and fact finding was carried out in eight departments. A pilot study was undertaken in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and recommendations are being considered for implementation. Another pilot study is being conducted in the Curriculum Development Centre and further studies are under consideration. </para>
          <para>Automatic data processing, (Recommendation 302)- the Public Service Board's role in relation to ADP essentially encompasses the functions identified as appropriate in this recommendation. The Board 's role is being examined in the context of the Public Accounts Committee's 174th and 175th Reports, the Government responses to which are still under consideration. </para>
          <para>Establishment, classification and other functions of the Public Service Board (Recommendations 202, 325-326, 334) - still under consideration as priorities, permit; the implementation of many of the Commission's recommendations have, of course, affected the role of the Board. </para>
          <para class="block">Information matters </para>
          <para>Departmental annual reports (Recommendations 23-25, 58)- the Government has decided that all departments should produce annual reports and has approved guidelines to assist departments. </para>
          <para>Accessibility to groups and guidelines for community contact (Recommendations 91, 92, 93)- Ministers have been asked to review regularly the adequacy of their procedures in relation to recommendations 91 and 92. In light of this, the Board has not taken any action on recommendation 93. </para>
          <para>Exchange of information with Foreign Affairs (Recommendation 287)- Ministers have been asked to review regularly the adequacy of their procedures in this area. </para>
          <para>Regional electronic information system (Recommendation 12-13- the Public Service Board considers that while the establishment of an electronic system of the kind suggested by the Royal Commission is now theoretically feasible, substantial doubts arise with regard to its costs and benefits at this stage of technological development. Apart from substantial technical problems, there are a number of significant administrative problems that would require resolution before such a system could be contemplated; for example, the establishment of department priorities and privacy of personal information. Further, limitations on the availability of resources (both finance and staff) currently result in substantial difficulties in developing computer systems of a much more restricted and less complex nature. Even a pilot study of the type suggested by the Royal Commission is not considered feasible at this time. </para>
          <para>Departmental information procedures (Recommendation 68)- the Freedom of Information Bill will place upon departments and authorities a statutory obligation to publish statements and manuals relating to their functions and the categories of documents they hold. In addition, agencies will be required to respond to requests for information within a statutory time limit and disclose documents. It is up to each agency to develop administrative procedures to meet these obligations. The legislation covering the unauthorised disclosure of information is currently being examined and this will include a review of regulation 35 under the Public Service Act. </para>
          <para>Review of information programs and services (Recommendations 304, 305, 307-309)- the Government has established a Task Force on Departmental Information to undertake a review of departmental information programs and examine the public dissemination within Australia of information on Government programs and activities. During the course of its review the Task Force has made suggestions to Ministers concerning improvements to the flow of information to the community and will be making recommendations generally on many of the subject areas of recommendation 307. In accordance with its terms of reference, the Task Force is giving consideration to 'the need' for central professional advice and monitoring' in respect of departmental information activities. The Task Force will be providing its final report to the Government shortly. </para>

In relation to certain of the more specific matters dealt with by recommendation 3 1 1 , the Audit Act has been amended to provide clear authority for delegation of certain powers formerly those of the Secretary to the Treasury, but the Government has not accepted the view that the Australian Bureau of Statistics should be responsible to a Minister other than the Treasurer. </para>
          <para>Department of Industries and the Economy (Recommendations 264-265)- not accepted. </para>
          <para>Australian Bureau of Statistics (Recommendations 270, 272-273)- 270, 272: no action has been taken in respect of these recommendations. 273: it has been decided that this recommendation will not be implemented. </para>
          <para>Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Structure (Recommendations 319, 320)- the Department's need for flexibility in meeting administrative needs from time to time has been reflected in a variety of formal structures. The recommendations of the Royal Commission are but one option for departmental operations. At this particular time, management requirements, as determined by the permanent head in consultation with the Public Service Board, call for a structure different from that suggested in the recommendations. </para>
          <para>Interdepartmental Committees (Recommendations 321, 322)- some of the procedures outlined in these recommendations are current practice. No further action is at present contemplated. </para>

          <para>Meetings of statutory bodies (Recommendation 31)- the Public Service Board has not convened any meetings of groups of statutory authorities in advance of further consideration of the Royal Commission 's recommendations for a wider role for the Board in relation to Commonwealth employment generally. </para>
          <para>Statutory Authorities (Recommendations 32-35, 37-38, 43-44, 274-5)- the Government has endorsed the conclusion that the departmental form of organisation for government agencies is to be favoured unless a clear necessity can be demonstrated for the functions concerned to be carried out by a body which is wholly, or in some desired way, separate from ministerial and departmental administration. The issues relating to the creation and operation of statutory authorities raised by the recommendations of the Royal Commission and by later reports, including those of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations on 'Statutory authorities of the Commonwealth ', are under consideration. </para>

          <para>Integration of Foreign Affairs Officers (Recommendations 223 and 225-227)- a scheme was introduced in 1977 to facilitate secondments between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and other areas of the Public Service. Staff of the Department have participated in staff exchange arrangements between the Public Service Board and other employers and in the Executive Development Scheme organised by the Public Service Board.

          <para>Overseas allowances (Recommendation 229)- the Public Service Board is currently examining the system of overseas allowances. </para>
          <para>Locally engaged staff at overseas posts (Recommendations 230-232)- a system has been introduced which provides for the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Resources to control the employment of locally engaged staff, within certain limits approved by the Public Service Board. These limits include the designation and classification to be used and the maximum number of persons to be employed. At the majority of overseas posts the Head of Mission is now authorised to adjust the salaries of locally engaged staff between inspections by the Board to take account of movements in local pay markets. </para>
          <para>New posts- criteria for establishment (Recommendations 233-234)-the Public Service Board is to report biennially to the Government on the whole field of overseas representation. Ministers will continue to determine when functions need to be performed overseas. </para>
          <para>Post liaison visits (Recommendation 235)- the Government has decided that post liaison visits are to be given a higher priority: each post is to be visited at least every three years, larger posts every two years. </para>
          <para>Inspections of overseas posts (Recommendation 236)- wherever practicable inspections of overseas posts are undertaken on a joint Public Service Board/departmental basis. Where joint inspections occur joint reports are prepared. In relation to the assessment of management practice at overseas posts, Public Service Board inspectors are progressively increasing their audit of delegated authority as responsibility for more management decisions are devolved to departments and Heads of Missions. So far as determinations by inspectors are concerned, matters requiring early decision can be taken before the inspectors return to Australia. In taking decisions as a result of inspections, the Board prefers to take into account the views of the affected departments as well as the posts. </para>
          <para>Action taken on Report on Overseas Service (Recommendation 237)- the Royal Commission generally endorsed the Report on Overseas Service, and recommended that the Report's proposals not dealt with specifically by other recommendations of the Commission be implemented.

          <para>Qualifications of the Director-General of Health (Recommendation 50)- the existing qualification requirements for the Director-General of Health will be retained. </para>
          <para>Decision-making at the point of contact (Recommendation 73)- action to be left to departments and Ministers. </para>
          <para>Public contact staff (Recommendation 74)- measures have been taken to improve counter services following an interdepartmental committee report on the matter. For details see Public Service Board Annual Reports 1977 page 82, 1 978 page 69 and 1 979 pages 46-47. </para>

          <para>Administrative appeals (Recommendations 79-82)- 79: this recommendation is still under consideration. The Administrative Review Council is empowered among other things to ascertain, and keep under review, the classes of administrative decisions that are not the subject of review by a court, tribunal or other body; and to make recommendations to the Attorney-General as to whether any of those classes of decisions should be the subject of review and, if so, what is the appropriate body to make that review. 80: this recommendation has been implemented in part. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 was amended in 1977 to provide for senior non-presidential members who might sit either alone or as chairman of panels of the Tribunal. The Act does not require that a senior non-presidential member should have legal qualifications, although all such members appointed to date do in fact have legal qualifications. The question of the qualifications for members of the Tribunal is a matter to be considered in a review of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. 8 1 : the enactment of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review ) Act1977 provides simplified procedures for originating applications for judicial review and vests review jurisdiction in the Federal Court of Australia. A Bill to amend that Act with a view to the Act being proclaimed as soon as possible was introduced by the Attorney-General into the Senate on 22 May 1980. Recommendation 81 will be fully implemented when the Act is brought into operation. 82: this matter is still under consideration. </para>
          <para>Role of voluntary agencies (Recommendations 83-85)- 83: the procedures outlined in this recommendation are in accordance with the Government's approach to the use of voluntary agencies. 84: details of grants to voluntary agencies are generally made public. Appropriate safeguards in regard to the use of public money are imposed by granting departments or through the appropriate state agencies. 85: discussions have been held with the States and where appropriate agreed forms of program administration will be implemented in respect of new programs. </para>
          <para>Grants to organisations making submissions (Recommendation 90)- recommendation not accepted. </para>
          <para>Tropical housing standards (Recommendation 98)-the Interdepartmental Committee on Housing Scales and Standards has been asked to take account of this recommendation. </para>
          <para>Regional administration (Recommendations 99-106)- the Government has decided not to proceed with the implementation of these recommendations. The Public Service Board is however continuing to pursue aspects of the proposals that do not involve additional staff or funds. </para>
          <para>Use of State and Local Governments (Recommendations 107,110, 111 and 1 13)- these recommendations should be looked at in the light of the Commonwealth Government's Federalism policy, the main thrust of which is the returning to State governments of those matters traditionally their responsibility. This has been exemplified by reducing the significance of specific purpose funding and ensuring that the States have reasonable access to untied funds via the tax sharing arrangements. This has meant a cut back in duplicated effort. At the same time States are required to conform to the principles set out in recommendation 111(b) and (c). It is the responsibility of the administrating Commonwealth department to ensure that Commonwealth programs administered by State departments are carried out within the agreed arrangements for that program. The role of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, in this regard, is to look at the broader implications of actions within the context of the Federalism policy. With regard to local government, there are some programs that the Commonwealth Funds directly. However, the Commonwealth recognises local government as, constitutionally, the responsibility of State governments. </para>
          <para>Use of State officers (Recommendations 108-109, 112)- the Board has consulted permanent heads on these recommendations. They are now to be considered in conjunction with any further examination of the Royal Commission 's views on the co-ordination of Commonwealth employment arrangements (recommendations 213-217, 221, 333). </para>
          <para>One stop shops (Recommendations 115-116 and 292)- officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Victorian Premier's Department and independent consultants have completed a final evaluation of the Centre. On the basis of the conclusions in that evaluation the NOW Centre will continue as a co-ordinated welfare delivery outlet. Future administrative arrangements for the Centre are being finalised between the Commonwealth Department of Social Security and the Victorian Department of Community Welfare Services. The final evaluation found that the NOW Centre services differed from those at other offices in only a few respects and were not significantly different in terms of cost. The question of the establishment of further one stop welfare centres will be considered in the light of particular circumstances as they arise. In relation to recommendation 292, the one stop shop was tried for a period in the major government administrative building in Alice Springs. Following self-government for the Northern Territory on1 July 1978 the use of the building was reallocated and the experiment discontinued. In practice, it was found that the departments providing services to Aboriginals had such different accommodation needs and management systems that the one stop shop concept was impractical. </para>
          <para>Grievance case (Recommendation 181)- the Public Service Board established an independent enquiry to review this case. The results of the review were indicated in the House of Representatives by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters on 8 June 1 978 ( House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> p. 3255). </para>
          <para>Remuneration Tribunal- amendment to Act ( Recommendation 255)- this recommendation is to be taken into account in any review of the Remuneration Tribunal Act. </para>

          <para>Staff ceilings ( Recommendations 200. 20 1 )- for details of current arrangements see Public Service Board Annual Report 1979, pages 3-4. </para>
          <para>Aboriginal advisors' and consultative bodies ( Recommendations 289-291, 293)- following on from the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Role of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (the Hiatt Committee), the government has established and funds two inter-related bodies: the National Aboriginal Conference and the Council for Aboriginal Development. The structure and functions of these bodies were set out in a statement made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 30 May 1977 (House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> pages 2 104-2 111).

          <para>Aboriginal affairs ( Recommendations 294-297)- 294: the Royal Commission confirmed the Government's existing philosophy of self-management which is central to Government policy. This policy recognises the need to ensure that administrative burdens are not placed on Aboriginal communities prematurely.295: studies of the kind envisaged have been undertaken both within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and through special consultancy work and studies performed by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies and others. 296: the question of measurable indicators of welfare was given a great deal of attention in the Hay Report. As a result, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, with assistance from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, has developed a system enabling the collection of statistical data about individual communities. Indicators are being derived from this data so that comparisons can be made between communities. 297: the Hay Report reviewed services financed by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Following on from this, processes for the continuing review of governmental programs in aboriginal affairs were strengthened. In addition it is to be expected that program effectiveness reviews would look from time to time at various aspects of particular programs in aboriginal affairs. </para>

A non-Canadian can be admitted to Canada only if a verified appointment offer is held, and the institution concerned is able to show that reasonable effort has been made to find a qualified Canadian or current landed immigrant to fill the position.

            <para>To provide all the detailed information requested by the honourable senator in relation to statutory authorities would involve checking with each authority. Even so, for reasons indicated below, it would be impossible to provide meaningful and complete information in the terms sought. In the circumstances, 1 would be reluctant to authorise the use of the resources that would be necessary to draw together such detailed information as is available. A significant amount of the information which could be obtained by a detailed check is, however, already published in a convenient form and I draw the honourable senator's attention to the relevant sources below. If there is some further specific information which the honourable senator would find of particular interest, I would be happy to see if it could be provided. </para>

The difficulties still apply and the figures quoted above reflect the average number of days elapsed by which 50 percent of the new unemployment benefit claims are paid. </para>
        <para>The average waiting time for payment of special benefit has not been shown in the above table because the waiting time varies considerably, for example, the straight forward hardship case is paid immediately whilst a maintenance guarantee case may take several weeks. </para>

In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wainwright</inline> 's case it is noted that at the time of the grant of Australian citizenship to him, he was not reported as having been convicted of any criminal offence, nor having any outstanding charges against him.

Inquiries with respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wainwright's</inline> application for citizenship have been completed and the matter has been referred to the Attorney-General's Department for advice.

            <para>The Copyright Tribunal, under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> St John, has recently inquired into the statutory royalty payable to copyright owners for the use of their musical works in commercial sound recordings. Its report has been tabled and published as a Parliamentary Paper. </para>
            <para>The Copyright Act provides that the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Executive Council may now, after taking into account the report, make regulations to vary the royalty rate in such respect as he thinks equitable. </para>
            <para>The Tribunal has recommended that it would be equitable to increase the royalty rate from 5 per cent of the retail price per record to 6.75 per cent of that price. The Tribunal estimated that this would increase the price of a $8.50 record by about 25 cents. </para>
            <para>Record Companies on the one hand and Music Publishers and composers, on the other, were represented before the Tribunal. Both have made competing submissions concerning the adoption of the recommendations in the report. I have met representatives of each side to discuss its submission and each has been given an opportunity to comment on the other's submission. </para>

              <para>1 ) The availability of adequate numbers of competent shearers is of considerable concern to me as Minister responsible for both the Department of Primary Industry and the Australian Wool Corporation. Responsibility for shearer training lies within the portfolio of my colleague, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner,</inline> but naturally there is liaison between us and our Departments on this important function.

          <para>Although it may be the case that many young men express the wish to become shearers, and subject to the likelihood that the position differs between the various States, one of the disappointing experiences of the Australian Wool Corporation has been a high dropout rate, in excess of 50 per cent in some cases, among learner shearers who had achieved shearing tallies in the order of 80 per day in coaching schools. </para>
          <para>The Government has accordingly been giving close attention to the measures which might assist not only in attracting men to the shearing industry and training them appropriately, but also to the means which might be pursued to maintain their numbers once they have entered the industry. </para>
          <para>This will require close co-operation between the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, the Australian Workers' Union, the Australian Wool Corporation, wool-growers and probably authorities concerned with Technical and Further Education and steps have already been taken to secure that co-operation. </para>

              <para>Most shearer training is currently carried out by private shearing contractors who do not provide information on the number of new shearers trained. However, some State wool industry training committees and some State departments have organised small shearer training schools during the period 1974-75 to 1979-80 with the aid of Government NEAT moneys, facilities provided by TAFE and instructors provided by a private shearing contractor, TAFE and the Australian Wool Corporation. </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) A Ministerial level meeting will bc held in Geneva on 26 and 27 May to consider further humanitarian assistance and relief to the Kampuchean people. The meeting is being convened by the United Nations Secretary-General as a result of ASEAN-sponsored resolution, which Australia supported, adopted on 1 May 1980 at a meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) held in New York. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will lead the Australian delegation. Thailand has played a central role in the initiative. The Geneva meeting has a three point agenda: (a) Relief programs within Kampuchea; (b) Situation of refugees and displaced persons; (c) Pledges of further assistance. lt is hoped that the meeting will galvanise international relief efforts for Kampuchea. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>and (3) Kampuchea faces a renewed threat of serious food shortages within the next two months as distribution of food aid in the pipeline is completed and the present harvest is consumed. The numbers of refugees in Thailand have stabilised, but their needs remain substantial and considerable pressure on Thai resources continues. This situation coincides with the conclusion of Phase I of the Kampuchean relief operation. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Against this background, the United Nations reported that additional commitments totalling $US262m were required to support Phase II of the joint program through to December 1980. </para>
          <para>Consequently, on 26 March 1980, I announced that the Government had decided to pledge a minimum of a further $3m towards the United Nations-sponsored Kampuchea Relief Appeal. The pledge was announced at a meeting held in New York on 26 March to review Phase I of the joint international agency relief program for Kampuchea and to seek commitments for a second pledge. </para>
          <para>Decisions about the specific aspects of the program for which Australian funds will be used will be made in consultation with the international agencies. The supply of rice seed has already been designated as a priority item for the relief operation as it will contribute to greater self-sufficiency in food throughout the country. Large quantities of rice seed are currently being sent into Kampuchea. </para>
          <para>In addition to approximately $ 10m subscribed by individuals to the International Disaster Emergency Committee Appeal, the Government committed a total of $7.8m towards Phase I of the relief operation mounted by the United Nations agencies and voluntary aid organisations within Kampuchea and among Khmer refugees in Thailand. This program, for which the total assistance pledged was $US210m, appeared to have temporarily averted a major human catastrophe. The Government's pledges to humanitarian relief in Kampuchea now total $ 10.8m. </para>

            <para>Telecom Australia advises that the 50,000 telephone accounts queried in 1977-78 represents only 0.8 per cent of the total accounts issued in that year. This figure represents a steady decrease in the incidence of queried accounts over the last four years. However, Telecom has no desire to curtail or deter any of its customers from querying their accounts; in fact, each account issued invites the subscriber to ring a specified number if they are in any doubt about any item on the account. </para>

            <para>To the best of my knowledge no partnership agreement exists between K. L. Ballantyne Pty. Ltd. and the New Zealand Dairy Board (NZDB) for the distribution of New Zealand dairy produce in Australia. </para>
            <para>It is understood that an agreement was reached between the Company and the NZDB under which Ballantynes would pack a small quantity of Australian butter, under New Zealand labels, for export on behalf of the Board while the New Zealanders were updating their butter canning equipment. </para>
            <para>Some Australian dairy manufacturers and traders, and I understand K. L. Ballantyne Pty Ltd are among them, have reached agreement with the NZDB for the purchase of New Zealand dairy produce for processing or repacking in Australia and subsequent re-export from Australia. </para>
            <para>These imports are being strictly monitored by the Australian Dairy Corporation and procedures have been introduced and agreed to by the NZDB which are aimed at ensuring that none of the imported product finds its way onto the Australian domestic market or replaces traditional Australian exports when Australian production is available. </para>

            <para>-On 18 October 1979 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> page 1468), <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis</inline> asked a question without notice concerning the cost to the nation of strikes such as the New South Wales Railways strike. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Clearly, strikes and other forms of industrial action involve economic costs to the nation through loss of production, wages, business confidence etc. These costs may not be restricted to the establishment subject of industrial action and, because of the inter-dependence of industry, may extend to other establishments and industries. The particular strikes to which you have referred involve the transport industry, upon which many other industries, and the community generally, are dependant for normal operation. Given the size of the operations directly involved and the nature of the dependency of other industries, the cost of these disputes would be widespread and obviously significant. </para>
            <para>However, aside from such general observations about the likely cost of the disputes, I am informed it has not been possible to accurately identify the detailed effects of those disputes nor, as a consequence, to collect reliable information about their cost. </para>
            <para>There are a number of difficulties involved in attempting to estimate or quantify the economic cost of industrial disputation and it may be helpful if I detail some of the major problems in this area. </para>
            <para>Firstly, the only official data regularly published on the cost of disputes are the monthly, quarterly and annual estimates prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) of the wages lost by workers directly and indirectly involved in disputes at the establishments where stoppages occurred. This information, therefore, provides only a very partial estimate of the total cost of industrial disputation. It relates only to wages lost rather than to production, sales or revenue lost and even then, excludes the loss of wages in those establishments affected by disputes, but not directly involved in disputation. </para>
            <para>There are a number of statistical difficulties involved when attempting to estimate the total economic cost of a dispute. In particular, there are the conceptual problems involved in measuring the net loss of production, sales or revenue to individual employers resulting from disputes. This is because, in many instances, the loss may be partially recouped at a later date by the employer operating his plant at a higher level of utilisation and\/or by the working of additional overtime. Similarly, any loss in sales or revenue might also be made up at a later date. </para>
            <para>In assessing the overall economic cost, consideration must also be given to the practice of switching purchases to similar or substitute products or to alternative sources of supply. </para>
            <para>Of course, in assessing the total economic cost of disputation, consideration must also be given to the impact of the dispute on activity and employment in other industries. For example, a dispute resulting in the curtailment of electricity, petrol or telecommunications can seriously affect activity and employment across a wide range of industry. Another difficulty, therefore, lies in the fact that the measurement of the total economic loss resulting from a dispute presents much greater problems in terms of indentifying where losses have occurred and collecting information about them than does the measurement of the number of disputes and the number of working days lost. The former involves consideration of a far greater number of establishments than the limited number at which actual stoppages of work occurred. </para>
            <para>You will appreciate the difficulties involved in quantifying the net impact of industrial disputation on Australia 's export contracts and trade relations in general. Further, one can only speculate on the extent to which industrial disputation influences decisions in respect of potential foreign investment. </para>
            <para>In compiling statistics on industrial disputation, the ABS follows the standards and concepts established by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). These standards have been adopted by most of the statistically advanced western countries. </para>
            <para>During recent discussions at the OECD it was agreed that there are serious difficulties in defining and measuring the impact of disputation on other establishments (commonly called 'secondary idleness') and that such effects should not be included in official industrial dispute statistics. In particular, the US authorities involved believe that it is not possible to identify such effects because of the extent and complexity of the inter-relationships between modern western economies. Of all the OECD countries represented, the United Kingdom was the only one which stated that it was conducting pilot studies on 'secondary idleness'. </para>
            <para>In response to previous queries regarding measurement of the economic cost of disputes, the ABS has advised that while it may be possible to estimate the economic cost of a particular dispute, provided adequate data is available, it is extremely doubtful, for the reasons I have outlined, whether this could be done on a comprehensive or continuing basis. The Bureau further noted that the resources required would be substantial. </para>
            <para>Notwithstanding these significant difficulties, there are strong reasons why the Government and the community should have at that their disposal comprehensive data on the extent and costs of industrial disputes. An InterDepartmental Committee, comprising the Department of Industrial Relations, Treasury and the ABS is currently examining the feasibility of upgrading and extending the present statistical coverage of industrial disputes and, in particular, the economic costs of those disputes. The possibility of underaking pilot studies to ascertain the feasibility of compiling statistics of 'secondary idleness' for a limited range of stoppages, such as those involving energy supply, telecommunication or commuter-transport employees, or specific stoppages is, for example, one of the measures which the IDC will be examining. </para>
            <para>The Government has a continuing concern with the heavy costs- both direct and indirect- of industrial disputation. In successive National Wage Hearings, the Government has submitted information on the level and general impact of industrial disputation. In particular, in the November 1978, May 1979 and November 1979 National Wage Hearings, the Commonwealth provided the Commission with information on a range of particular disputes to illustrate the broader economic costs involved. Indeed, on each occasion, the Commission itself commented on the seriousness of these overall costs. I refer you to pages 20 to 26 of the Commonwealth's November 1978 submission, pages 53 to 64 of the May 1979 submission and pages 129 to 142 of the November 1979 submission. </para>

            <para>-On 6 March 1980 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> page 610) <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> asked me a question without notice concerning the effects of industrial disruption on the wheat industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government is extremely conscious of the gravity of the present level of disputation. Indeed, the extent of current disputation is jeopardising the very foundation of the emerging recovery in economic activity and employment. </para>
            <para>However, as you are probably aware, there are difficulties involved in attempting to estimate or quantify the economic cost of industrial disputation. Firstly, the only official data regularly published on the cost of disputes are the monthly estimates prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) of wages lost by workers directly and indirectly involved in disputes at the establishments where stoppages occurred. This information, therefore, provides only a very partial estimate of the total cost of industrial disputation. It relates only to wages lost rather than production and even then, excludes the loss of wages in those establishments affected by disputes, but not directly involved in disputation. </para>
            <para>There are a number of statistical difficulties involved when attempting to estimate the total economic cost of a dispute and it may be helpful to outline some of them. In particular, there are the conceptual problems involved in measuring the net loss of production or sales to individual employers resulting from disputes. This is because, in many instances, the loss may be partially recouped at a later date by the employer operating his plant at a higher level of utilisation and/or by the working of additional overtime. Similarly, any loss in sales can also be made up at a later date. </para>
            <para>In assessing the overall economic cost, consideration must also be given to the practice of switching purchases to similar or substitute products or to alternative sources of supply. </para>
            <para>Of course, in assessing the total economic cost of disputation, consideration must also be given to the impact of the dispute on activity and employment in other industries. For example, a dispute resulting in the curtailment of electricity, petrol or telecommunications can seriously affect activity and employment across a wide range of industry. Similarly a dispute in a particular area of manufacturing will affect those industries supplying it with raw materials or other inputs as well as those industries whose activities depend on supplies from the dispute affected industry. In short, because of the complex interrelated nature of the economic system, many disputes can have serious multiplicative effects throughout the economy. </para>
            <para>Another difficulty, therefore, lies in the fact that in order to estimate the total economic loss flowing from a dispute it may be necessary to aggregate estimates provided by thousands of employers, in the case, say, of a power or petrol dispute, whereas the measurement of the number of diputes and working days lost entails estimates from a much more limited number of establishments at which the actual stoppages of work occurred. </para>
            <para>You will also appreciate the difficulties involved in quantifying the net impact of industrial disputation on Australia's export contracts and trade relations in general. Further, one can only speculate on the extent to which industrial disputation influences decisions in respect of potential foreign investment. </para>
            <para>Notwithstanding these problems, in response to a number of queries in recent years concerning the possibility of estimating the economic cost of disputes, my Department has examined the matter in consultation with the ABS. The Bureau has advised that while it may be possible to estimate the economic cost of a particular dispute, provided adequate data is available, it is extremely doubtful, for the reasons I have outlined, whether this could be done on a comprehensive or continuing basis. The Bureau further noted that the resources required would be substantial. </para>
            <para>It should also be pointed out that in compiling statistics on industrial disputation the Bureau follows the standards and concepts established by the International Labour Office (ILO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). These standards have been adopted by most of the statistically advanced Western countries. </para>
            <para>You might also be interested to know that in recent discussions at the OECD it was agreed that there are serious difficulties in defining and measuring the impact of disputation on other establishments (commonly called 'secondary idleness') and that such effects should not be included on official industrial dispute statistics. </para>
            <para>In particular, the United States authorities involved believed that it was not possible to identify such effects because of the extent and complexity of the interrelationships between industries in modern Western economies. Of all the OECD countries represented, the United Kingdom was the only one which stated that it was conducting pilot studies on secondary idleness'. </para>
            <para>Nonetheless, the ABS has indicated that when resources are available, it may be able to undertake pilot studies to ascertain whether the compilation of statistics of 'secondary idleness' for a limited range of stoppages, such as those involving energy supply, telecommunication or commutertransport employees, is feasible. However, at present, the only information available on the cost of disputes are the unofficial estimates made occasionally by employers or their organisations. </para>
            <para>In successive national wage hearings the Government has submitted information on the level and impact of industrial disputation. In particular, in the November 1979 National Wage hearing, the Commonwealth provided the Commission with detailed information on a range of particular disputes to illustrate the broader economic costs involved. </para>
            <para>In recent times the Government has placed considerable emphasis on publicising the economic impact of disputation, not only in respect to the prospects for economic recovery and the creation of employment opportunities, but also in terms of the inconvenience caused to the general public. </para>

            <para>I ask the Attorney-General whether he is aware that marihuana plants with a street value of some millions of dollars were found by police in South Australia last week. This is only one of many such finds in Australia this year, besides what has been found and confiscated in previous years. Will the Government take steps to increase greatly the penalties for growers of marihuana by confiscating all their property or the property on which the plant is grown and deporting those growers or property owners who are not naturalised Australians? At present the light fines and penalties are regarded as a joke when compared with the huge profits to be made from growing marihuana. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The level and type of penalty to be imposed on persons who illegally grow or sell marihuana in Australia are primarily matters for the State Governments. The deportation of non-Australians convicted of criminal offences against the State or Commonwealth laws is, however, governed by the Migration Act 1958. That Act renders liable to deportation immigrants who, within 5 years of entering Australia, commit an offence punishable by imprisonment for 1 year or longer. In addition, non-Australians, other than British or Irish citizens, sentenced to imprisonment for one year or longer are also liable to deportation under the Act. On 3 1 January 1980 the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs released a statement of the Government's policy relating to the deportation of persons convicted of criminal offences. I refer the honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator to</inline> paragraphs ( 8 ) to (13) inclusive of that statement in which is set out the Government's policy with respect to the deportation of drug offenders. As the honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator will</inline> be aware, the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs has recommended that the Migration Act 1 958 be amended to do away with the distinction for the purposes of liability to deportation, between British and Irish citizens and other persons who are not Australian citizens and to delete the provision in the Act protecting a migrant of British or Irish nationality from deportation where the migrant has resided in Australia for 5 years before the commission of an offence which would otherwise render him liable to deportation. The Government is currently considering the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission. </para>

The question concerned an article which appeared in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> about the ineligibility of Miss Yvonne Keynes to be employed under the Special Youth Employment Training Program. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Miss Keynes first registered with the Elizabeth Office of the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) on 17 September 1979. This year she elected to go back to school whilst continuing to look for work. Miss Keynes has been interviewed at the CES at approximately 4 weekly intervals. It is true that Miss Keynes is ineligible for assistance under the Special Youth Employment Training Program (SYETP) as she is a full-time student. </para>
            <para>The aim of SYETP is to assist unemployed young people who are unable to compete on the open labour market because they lack required experience and employment qualifications and/or personal qualities. The program is therefore only directed at those who are unable to meet employers' normal requirements for recruitment to a position. The overall purpose of the program is to remedy these disadvantages by providing the trainees with the basis for entry to continued employment and to equip them with basic skills which are readily transferable and acceptable to the employers. </para>
            <para>Experience has shown that the great majority of school leavers and those seeking their first full-time job are able to find employment shortly after leaving school. The purpose of the qualifying period under SYETP is to identify those who are in need of special assistance. If SYETP were made generally available to all school leavers and those returning to school there would be no incentive for employers to take on disadvantaged young people whom they would not otherwise select. </para>
            <para>Finally, the article in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of 15 April 1 980 is misleading in one particular in that it suggests that government regulations had somehow prevented the firm employing Miss Keynes. It should be pointed out that the firm is free to employ anyone they select, but in order to receive a SYETP subsidy they must be prepared to take on and train someone eligible for assistance under the Program who is referred by the CES. </para>

Australia's actions in respect of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan are consistent with the thrust of the UN resolution and the actions of like-minded countries which abhor the Soviet Union's infringement of Afghanistan's sovereignty.

          </talk.start>
          <para>On 21 May 1980 I answered these questions by informing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I answered today in the Senate the question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> about advice given to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline></para>
            <para>In relation to other questions, I attach a copy of a letter sent today to the Leader of the Opposition by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Attachment 1). I shall deal below with the other questions only to the extent to which they are not answered by the Minister's letter and its attachments. </para>
            <para>On 14 December 1979, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Graham</inline> Richard Ihlein, through his solicitors, Messrs Lethlean, Howie and Maher, wrote to me and asked for my consent to institute proceedings against News Limited and Cruden Investments Pty Ltd for alleged breaches of section 92 ( 1 ) (a) of the Broadcasting and Television Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> asked what action I took as a result of receiving that letter and, in particular, whether in the light of that letter and the original letter I received from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett, I instructed the Commonwealth Police or the  Deputy  Crown Solicitor to investigate the alleged breaches that were brought to my attention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> asked why, if I did not issue such instructions, 1 did not do so. 1 did not instruct the Commonwealth Police or the  Deputy  Crown Solicitor to investigate the alleged breaches. </para>
            <para>With respect to the Ihlein letter, the course of events was much as I had recalled them when I answered <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> on 20 May. There has been no further correspondence with the solicitors since the then Acting Crown Solicitor wrote to them on 16 January 1980. I attach copies of the correspondence with the solicitors (Attachment 2). </para>
            <para>Upon consideration of the letter from the Minister for Post and Telecommunications dated 26 March 1980 and its attachments, it did not seem appropriate at that stage for any action to be taken by me. </para>
            <para>In particular, I refer to the Tribunal 's statement, on page 3 of its letter, that the 'full extent of any contraventions' had not been established and that there could be a public inquiry into the matter.

              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr STALEY-</inline>On 15 May 1980 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> asked me a question without notice regarding a letter said to have been sent to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett which drew attention to acquisitions by News Limited of shares in Ansett Transport Industries Limited. </para>
            <para>The answer to the honourable member's question is: </para>
            <para>There is no record of such a letter having been received by me. However, on 22 January 1980 my colleague, the Attorney-General, wrote to me enclosing a letter dated 5 December 1979, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> referred to this matter. Copies of these letters are at Attachment A. </para>
            <para>On 19 December 1979 the Attorney-General acknowledged <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald's</inline> letter, and on 22 January 1980 wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> and advised that, as the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 was administered by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, he had referred <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald's</inline> letter to me for consideration (Attachment B). </para>
            <para>I had already asked my Department to make inquiries of the Tribunal for advice regarding the share transactions which had taken place and any communications which had been received by the Tribunal from the parties concerned. Subsequently, I received advice from the Tribunal in a letter addressed to my Department dated 20 February 1980. This advice is at Attachment C. </para>
            <para>On 6 February 1980 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Peter</inline> Abeles wrote to me on behalf of Ansett Transport Industries Limited on the same matter, enclosing a copy of his letter to the Attorney-General (Attachment D). </para>
            <para>On 26 March I responded to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> saying that I had obtained information from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and had considered this carefully. I concluded that, in all the circumstances, I did not propose to take any action under the Broadcasting and Television Act (Attachment E). </para>
            <para>On the same day I also wrote to the Attorney-General, enclosing a copy of my letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> informing him of my belief that, under the circumstances, a prosecution should not be instituted (Attachment F). In forming this view, I had regard to the fact that the Tribunal had given notice of its intention to hold a public inquiry on this matter. I will continue to keep the matter under review and there will be an opportunity to re-assess the position when the Tribunal's Report is available. </para>

            <para>I refer again to your letter dated 11 January 1980, concerning the purchase by the News Group of Companies (News) of shares in Ansett Transport Industries (Ansett) in relation to the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act (Act) which govern the ownership and control of commercial television stations. </para>
            <para>The Tribunal has received several letters from News and a letter from Ansett which have a bearing on the matter. There have been a number of telephone discussions as well. </para>
            <para>On 12 December 1979, News Limited advised the Tribunal that the News Group had purchased 43.6% of the share capital of Ansett and was continuing to purchase shares with a view to acquiring up to 50% of the issued ordinary share capital of Ansett. The letter acknowledged that provided the Tribunal approved the sale of News' interests in NWS Adelaide (since approved), and Ansett disposed of its interests in TVQ Brisbane (negotiations partly completed), the News Group would no longer hold prescribed interests in television stations in excess of those permitted by section 92 ( 1 ) of the Act. The same correspondence said that it was the intention of one or more companies in the News Group to apply to the Tribunal for approval of the acquisition of the Ansett shares, as soon as matters relating to NWS and TVQ were resolved. It was also pointed out that the ultimate holding company of the News Group had become The News Corporation Limited and all companies in the Group would become direct or indirect subsidiaries of that company. </para>
            <para>Details of the authorised and issued share capital of News Corporation Limited, News Limited and News Investments Pty Limited, which form part of the News Group of companies, were notified to the Tribunal on 4 January 1980. The News Corporation Limited advised the Tribunal on 25 January 1 980, that News and Ansett were currently seeking a buyer or buyers for TVQ but one factor which had contributed to the delay was that the sale of the John Fairfax Limited interests in station QTQ Brisbane was the subject of concurrent negotiations. </para>
            <para>Advice has since been received that QTQ is being purchased by AWA Ltd and that Ampol Petroleum Ltd was acquiring some 60% of the issued share capital of TVQ. In a letter dated 13 February 1980, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Peter</inline> Abeles, the Joint Chief Executive of Ansett Transport Industries Limited advised the Tribunal that a preliminary agreement had been reached for Ampol Petroleum Ltd to acquire some 60% of the share capital of TVQ and that negotiations were continuing for the sale of the balance of the Ansett interests in TVQ. </para>
            <para>In the letter from News Limited dated 13 December 1979 a copy of which was forwarded to your Department on 1 5 January 1980, the company acknowledges that its Ansett shareholding transaction caused a contravention of the ownership and control provisions of the Act in that it held at that date a prescribed interest in both TEN Sydney and NWS Adelaide, and automatically acquired through Ansett a prescribed interest in ATV Melbourne and TVQ Brisbane. On the facts available, the Tribunal was aware of this situation. However, it has been the practice over the years for such contraventions to be corrected either through negotiation with the parties concerned or voluntarily by such parties as soon as they realised the situation in which they were placed. There is no record of any prosecutions having been launched in connection with contraventions which have occurred from time to time. </para>
            <para>It is the opinion of the Tribunal that continuation of the previous attitude to contraventions is desirable where it is clear, as is the case in regard to the News Group purchase of the Ansett shares, that every attempt is being made to remedy the contravention as soon as possible. On the general question of the institution of court proceedings regarding contraventions, the Tribunal believes that the powers and functions conferred upon it by the Act do not impose any responsibility for it to initiate prosecutions in relation to contravention of the ownership and control provisions. However, the Tribunal accepts that where a contravention exists and the offending party refuses to take corrective action, the Tribunal should hold a public inquiry and, if appropriate, direct the divestment of the excess interests. If such a direction were to be ignored, the Tribunal would report the matter to the Minister with a view to the Commonwealth instituting legal proceedings. </para>
            <para>I understand that your letter was written as a direct result of a letter which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett forwarded to the Attorney-General sometime ago. </para>
            <para>As you are aware <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> has since disposed of his personal interest in Ansett Transport Industries to the News Limited Group. The Tribunal has been informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> does not wish the subject matter of his letter to be pursued and that the Joint Chief Executive Officer of Ansett Transport Industries will be writing to your Department to this effect. </para>
            <para>In conclusion, I should mention that although the News Corporation Limited has yet to make a formal application for approval in relation to its purchase of the shares in Ansett and the full extent of any contraventions cannot be established until then, the Tribunal has invited members of the public to furnish submissions on the matter. On receipt of these submissions the Tribunal will determine whether the transactions should be the subject of a public inquiry, pursuant either to section 92 F (4) or section 1 8 ( 1 ) of the Act. </para>
