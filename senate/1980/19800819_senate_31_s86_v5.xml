        <para>Thai the Senate records its sincere regret at the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Masayoshi</inline> Ohira, Prime Minister of Japan, and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family and to the people of Japan. </para>
        <para class="block">The Senate will wish to be advised formally that the Government extended its deep sympathy to the Government and people of Japan and that the Prime Minister represented Australia at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira&#39;s</inline> memorial service. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Masayoshi</inline> Ohira led the Japanese Government at a time when changing international circumstances presented the Japanese nation with considerable uncertainties. A wisdom born of wide experience coupled with a deep personal commitment to the shaping of a better world for future generations earned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline> great international esteem.  His  wise advice and considered counsel gained him the respect of leaders around the world. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline>recognised the important role which Japan has to play in international affairs as a member of the Western alliance. He was concerned to enhance Japan&#39;s political and economic contribution to world peace and security.  His  understanding of the changing circumstances in Asia and the Pacific region led <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline> to play an active part in seeking closer ties between the countries of the region.  His  promotion of the concept of a Pacific community is an outstanding example of this. In January this year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline> visited Australia. He was welcomed both as a representative of one of the countries most important to Australia and as a national leader who strove to increase understanding and personal contact between the peoples of different countries. I believe his visit made a lasting contribution to the strengthening of relations between our two countries. We all mourn his death. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of the Opposition I wish to offer formally our condolences to the Japanese people and to the Japanese Government on the death of Prime Minister Ohira. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> has just indicated, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline> visited Canberra last January. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira,</inline> in both his foreign policies and his personal contacts, showed himself to be a constructive supporter and developer of relations between Japan and Australia. The loss is therefore a joint loss. He was a product and a leader of what might be called the old school of conservative Japanese politics, but he was also a statesman and a man of broad vision. He was an internationalist and significantly more outward looking than some of his predecessors. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline>was the architect of better balanced relationships between Japan and the United States of America. He was also the architect, firstly as Foreign Minister and then as Prime Minister, of Japan&#39;s developing dialogue with China. In Australia he will probably be best remembered for his advocacy of the Pacific Basin concept. It is an indication of his contribution to JapanAustralia relations and to Pacific affairs overall that his death led to some uncertainty about the future momentum of this diplomacy. In the turbulent international events of the first half of this year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline> took a broad and cautious view. He was a statesman of world standing. The Opposition wishes to record its recognition of his achievements and in doing so to reaffirm its belief in the fundamental importance of good relations between this country and Japan. </para>

          <para>- The Opposition wishes to associate itself with the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick. Sir Seretse</inline> Khama was indeed one of the great political figures of Africa in recent years.  His  death at the rather premature age of 59 is a loss not only to Africa but also to the Commonwealth and the world scene. He was, as we know, a pioneer of African independence. We recall the event of his manage to a European, formerly Miss Ruth Williams, which also helped in his approach towards racial harmony in that very troubled continent. He was for 1 4 years  President  of Botswana, and under his leadership great progress was made in an atmosphere of democracy. He set examples of political and personal behaviour and achievement which his successors will find challenging. On behalf of Opposition senators I record our deep regret at the death of this outstanding African leader and express condolences to his family, his tribe and his nation. </para>

          <para>- I  wish to be associated with my fellow senators in their expressions of condolence on the occasion of the very sad passing of a former Senate colleague, former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator William</inline> Morrow. Bill Morrow was elected to this Senate on the same day as J was elected in September 1 946. He was a member of this chamber until 1953. He was a great fighter for world peace. When he died on 12 July last, at the age of 9 1 , he was still fighting for the great causes to which he had applied himself all his life. He was a great man in every sense of the word. He had the great quality of love of his wife and family. It was a very close-knit family. To the members of his family I extend my very deep sympathy. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Bill Morrow was a kind and gentle person. At all times he was a modest and completely unassuming man. His life was one of struggle, but it won him recognition not only here in Australia but also internationally. In his pursuit of world peace he moved in circles with such people as Pandit Nehru, Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai, Stalin and Molotov. He was the recipient of the JoliotCurie Peace Prize and also was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize. Mao Tse-tung once wrote that a man&#39;s ability may be great or small, but if he has this spirit of selflessness he is already nobleminded and pure, a man of moral integrity and above vulgar interests, a man who is of value to the people. Such a man was Bill Morrow. </para>
        <para>Bill Morrow had very humble beginnings. He was born in Rockhampton, Queensland, in 1891. He first began to emerge as a leader as an organiser with the Australian Railways Union. He went to Tasmania in 1936 and became the State secretary of the Australian Railways Union. He took a very active part in the Australian Labor Party and was not only a member of the State Executive of our party but also the vice-president of the Trades Hall Council. As I have already said, he was elected to the Senate in 1946. During the time that he was a member of the Senate we in this country witnessed such great world events as the birth of the People&#39;s Republic of China and the outbreak of the great Korean War in 1950. During the debate on the Korean War <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morrow</inline> spoke always of the ordinary struggling people and pointed out that the ordinary people do not make wars; they just do the fighting, suffering and dying, and they have no say in making wars. That advice is as true today as it was when Bill Morrow spoke in this chamber in 1949. He attacked the merchants of death, the armaments manufacturers, who are coming out of their funkholes again at present trying to find excuses for wars, which will be far beyond the comprehension of any of us because of the new dimensions of war. Inherent in Bill Morrow&#39;s warnings to people was that such a war would be the end of mankind. That should be heeded. </para>
        <para>In concluding my tribute to Bill Morrow, I would like to quote a poem which was written on 15 July last by Maurie Edwards. The poem is headed &#39;Bill Morrow - Australian&#39;. It reads: </para>

I knew all of them at one time or another in their service in the Labor movement and to Australia, but because of my close association with the late honourable member for Barton I wish to pay my personal tribute to the memory of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Len</inline> Reynolds. He was the member for Barton in this Parliament from 1958 to 1966 and from 1969 to 1975. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reynolds</inline>and I spent our early days together in the Labor movement. When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> was the member for Barton and the leader of the Australian Labor Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reynolds</inline> was the  president  of the Barton federal electorate council of the Labor Party and at the same time I was the secretary of the council. When <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> transferred from having Barton as his electorate to having Hunter, Len Reynolds became the member for Barton. I well recall that at that time our political opponents thought that when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> left the electorate of Barton no-one could win the seat for Labor, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Len</inline> Reynolds disproved that. </para>
        <para>He was active in every community activity. He sold double tickets for senior citizens groups in the streets of Kogarah, Rockdale, Ramsgate and Sans Souci. He was a member of many ex-servicemen&#39;s associations in the district, he was a prominent member of the St George Leagues Club and he was also an active member of that organisation&#39;s bowling club. He was a very strong and keen supporter of the St George football club. He and his wife Sylvia devoted the whole of their lives to the service of their electorate. Between them they would have attended every school fete, every church bazaar and every local government function that was held in the electorate. They were a most widely respected couple in the district. It was only because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reynolds</inline> suffered a massive heart attack in 1973 that he retired from the Parliament and did not offer himself for re-election in 1975. </para>
        <para>The late Len Reynolds and his late wife Sylvia loved life and loved people. They shared a common goal of serving their electorate and serving humanity. I know how much <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reynolds</inline> grieved after he lost his wife Sylvia in 1978. On behalf of all members of the Labor Party - in the Barton electorate especially - I pay tribute to his life&#39;s work. I tender my deepest sympathy and that of my colleagues and all members of the Labor Party, particularly those in the Barton electorate, to his sons Gary, Neal and Brian. </para>

        <para class="block">Both of them were highly dedicated hard-working members of Parliament. I remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peters,</inline> although a self-educated man, used to address the House with great wisdom. One of his obsessions was interest rates and the creation of credit by the banks. Some of his contributions to the House were appreciated by all members. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reynolds</inline> was a very hard-working person, particularly in social welfare and education, but above all I would like to place on record that in my view, after having known both of these members for many years, they were both extremely decent human beings who made a great contribution to this place. </para>

          <para>- I wish to say just a few short words on behalf of members of the Australian Labor Party in relation to the passing of our colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ted</inline> Peters. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peters</inline> joined the Labor Party on leaving school. On looking back over his history that would appear to me to have been perhaps about the time of the great conscription debates in 1916 and 1917. He worked as a public servant for 20 years from 1915 to 1935. During that period he became  President  of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party and was a member of that branch&#39;s central executive from 1 928 until 1 955. That record indicates that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peters</inline> as an activist in the Party was involved in some fairly strong struggles within the Labor movement in Victoria over those years. He was also a member of the Victorian Teachers Tribunal for three years and was secretary of the Victorian parliamentary Public Works Committee from 1935 until 1946, which indicates a broader view of life than plain politics. He was elected to the House of Representatives for the seat of Burke in 1949 and again in 1951 and 1954. After a redistribution in 1954 he became the member for Scullin in 1955 and held that seat until his retirement. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Ted Peters played a long and active role within the Australian Labor Party. He could only be described as a fiery orator. One is reminded of men of his period such as the late Eddie Ward and the former Minister for Agriculture in the Chifley Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reg</inline> Pollard. I suppose that in my early years in the Labor Party, if there were three fiery orators within its ranks then surely they were the three. However, as I said, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peters</inline> could only be described as an ardent Australian nationalist. On behalf of the Opposition in this chamber I would like to pass on our condolences to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peters&#39;</inline> wife Min, who herself played a long and active role in the Labor Party, and to their son. </para>

          <para>- I wish to make a few brief remarks in respect of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ron</inline> Davies, the former member for Braddon in Tasmania, whose passing we regret today. Ron Davies came to this Parliament in 1 958, winning that seat in quite remarkable style. We all remember that in that State he converted a deficit of 8000 votes, I think it was, in 1955 to a winning margin in 1958, which was a remarkable performance. He was a very dedicated member for Braddon and a man who worked his electorate very effectively. He remained the sitting member until his defeat in 1975. He was an object lesson for any member of Parliament as to the manner in which an electorate should be serviced.  His  great interest in Tasmania and Tasmanians was well recorded in this Parliament and in the work he did in his own State. On behalf of the Opposition I place on record our sincere regret at his passing. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of Government senators I express to the relatives and friends of those to whom we are paying tribute today our deep sympathy at their passing and our acknowledgement of the service which in their own way, in their own lights, they gave to Australia. I express to the Australian Labor Party as a whole our sympathy at the loss of people who in their day played great parts within the Australian Labor Party. I was not privileged to know most of those people directly - I knew them by reputation only - but I acknowledge their very real service to the Australian Labor movement. May I simply say that I was privileged to know Len Reynolds, and a finer gentleman and a nicer person would have been hard to find in this world. I think as a person and as a member of Parliament he brought a contribution to this Parliament that we are all the richer for, and I am sure that Australia is the poorer for his passing. I, therefore, join in tribute to those who have passed on. </para>

          <para>- I want to be associated with the words of condolence at the passing of five former members of the national Parliament, all of whom served the Parliament in different capacities but who were all members of the Australian Labor Party, in the majority of cases for most of their lives, and join with my colleagues who have spoken of the four other members of the Australian Labor Party who were members either of the Senate or the House of Representatives. I refer specifically to the life of public service that Arthur Greenup dedicated in his 78 years on this planet. He was born in 1902 and most of his life was dedicated to the service of his fellow man. He was a very active member of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association at a very early age. He became an official of that union, as an organiser, and subsequently rose to become the  President  of that organisation. He was a unique person in that he served in all three arms of government. He served for some 14 years in local government, both in the council which serves the Newtown area and the Sydney City Council. He then went on to serve in the State Parliament and subsequently served a period in the national Parliament.  His  services in both the State and Federal parliaments were disrupted as a result of redistributions which caused him no longer to be able to represent those areas in the respective parliaments. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The most interesting thing about him is that his 51 years membership of the Australian Labor Party was an active membership. Despite his 78 years of age he was, nevertheless, a delegate to our New South Wales Labor Party conference held on the Queen&#39;s Birthday weekend in June 1980. So Arthur Greenup in his various ways in the trade union movement- for something in excess of 40 years he was an official of our organisation - and in the three arms of government, local, State and Federal, sought successfully to represent his fellow man. He did so with a great deal of distinction. He was a very gentle person. He held views fairly strongly about the Labor movement and he expressed those views sometimes when they were not popular views. He, nevertheless, held to those views and it was in that sort of spirit that he was accepted as being a very honourable and hard working member of the Australian Labor Party. Whilst he had only a brief association with the national Parliament, I think what we have to look at, in looking at Arthur Greenup and his recent death, is the fact that he spent practically the whole of his adult life in the service of his fellow man. He did not marry and, therefore, any condolence remarks can be referred only to his nieces and nephews who are still alive. Through their close association with him they were able to see that he was a man who at all stages in his life sought to represent the little people wherever he could. In the most humble way Arthur Greenup made a very considerable contribution to the political life of this country. </para>
        <para>I also endorse the remarks of preceding speakers in respect of former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bill</inline> Morrow, and Ron Davies, Len Reynolds and Ted Peters, former members of the House of Representatives. We are poorer for the loss of these five former members of the national Parliament. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MULVIHILL</inline>(New South Wales)In briefly supplementing the tributes that have been paid, I can do no better than follow up what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> said in relation to Arthur Greenup. Most of us came in contact with Arthur </para>
        <para class="block">Greenup after he had passed from the parliamentary stage. As can be seen from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> a feature of his speeches on the cost of living was a good knowledge of food distribution. He had an ability to illustrate fluctuations in the cost of living not only in Industrial Court hearings but also in the Parliament. Many people who go out of politics get a bit soured, but although Arthur Greenup was twice the victim of redistributions, once in the New South Wales Parliament and once in the Federal Parliament, he never became sour. He always made a constructive contribution at Australian Labor Party conferences. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> has said, he was just as fluent in his speech in the last year as he had been when I came to know him in the mid-1950s. </para>
        <para>Notwithstanding all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> has said about the custody of a marginal seat, I found in my days as an official that Len Reynolds, the former member for Barton, was always available to go to distant areas to serve. I think the best epitaph that one could give him would be in the words spoken during the service attended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland,</inline> myself and others to mark the passing of Len Reynolds. People active in junior rugby league circles said: &#39;He was one of the few men who was an active referee and you still thought he was fair and decent&#39;. They did not say that in jest either. That is the sort of person he was both in his ethics and his general attitude. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Justin</inline>O&#39;Byrne, in paying a very comprehensive tribute to Bill Morrow, referred to the former senator&#39;s zest and power in crusading for world peace. I do not wish to speak disparagingly of the smaller States, but having been a trade union official I know that at times Tasmanian union officials have to take on the mainland branches to get justice for their members. Bill Morrow appeared to have a particular capacity or versatility. Despite his intense interest in foreign affairs, he in no way neglected his advocacy in relation to the claims of railway men in Tasmania. He had a happy combination. There is no doubt that both in the period he served in the trade unions and during his political life he left his mark. </para>
        <para>In speaking of the former member of the House of Representatives Ted Peters, I support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp.</inline> I went to meetings of the Caucus during the last three or four years of Ted Peter&#39;s term. There is no doubt that he had an economic fundamentalism, and he would illustrate his views on interest rates and other matters in a very colourful manner. He would certainly liven up a debate that was languishing. </para>
        <para>The former member for Braddon also could enthral the Caucus when there was a debate on a subject in which he was really interested. I do not think I would be revealing any Caucus secrets by mentioning that on one Bill - I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> would know about this - relating to the annual renewal of a softwoods agreement, Ron Davies, in a devastating 10 minutes, wiped the floor with everybody because he felt we were distorting a point of view put by the Tasmanian timber industry. I will always remember that about the former honourable member for Braddon. </para>

          <para>- I too associate myself with the expressions of condolence and wish to add briefly to the remarks made by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> concerning Len Reynolds. In 1966, as a candidate for the House of Representatives, I got to know Len Reynolds well for the first time, and as a party official I worked closely with him in election campaigns in 1969, 1972 and 1974. In all those elections, of course, he held the seat of Barton. In 1975, because of ill health, he decided not to run again as our candidate, and I, along with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> and others, tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to continue because of his strong personal vote in the Barton electorate. I think it is fair to say that he was among the hardest working members of parliament or candidates with whom I have ever worked, and 1 have no doubt that his strenuous activity on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and on behalf of the constituents of Barton helped towards his untimely death. To his family I extend my deepest sympathy. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;BYRNE</inline>(Tasmania)- When this debate commenced I was not quite certain of the form it would take and I omitted to mention some of my former colleagues - Ted Peters, whom I knew very well in the early days of my time in the Parliament, Arthur Greenup and Len Reynolds. But I would like to associate myself particularly with the expressions of sympathy to the relatives of Ronald Davies who was the member for Braddon from 1958 until 1975. Ron Davies was the first Labor member for Braddon since King O&#39;Malley. There was great jubiliation in our party in Tasmania when we won that seat because it had been held by such an illustrious person as Dame Enid Lyons. When she retired Ron Davies succeeded her and maintained the very high standard of representation in that electorate. </para>
        <para>The late Ron Davies made a great contribution in many spheres of activity in Tasmania. He was associated with sporting activities - wood chopping - and he had a group of world champion Tasmanians participating in a world championship in Hong Kong when his untimely death occurred. He was also associated with the executive side of horse trotting and of galloping. Not only was he closely involved in politics but also his son is the  Speaker  of the House of Assembly in Tasmania and carries out the duties of that very high office with great credit and with great dignity. I knew very well his wife Jennie, who predeceased him, and I knew what a very happy couple they were. I want especially to extend my deep sympathy to Glen Davies, the  Speaker  of the House of Assembly of Tasmania, and to his daughter, Anne Burr, who lives here in Canberra. </para>

              <para>-  I know that leave was sought and granted, but 1 still raise a point of order on whether leave should have been granted in this case. I was not aware of this happening; perhaps I should have been. I do not think I was in my seat at the time. If I had been I would have objected to leave being granted. Nevertheless, I ask the Senate to consider whether a precedent ought to be established whereby a petition placed before the House on behalf of citizens - rightly so - should be commented on by senators. A senator might wish to speak adversely about a petition. Surely we would not wish that to happen. </para>

              <para>- This petition represents the largest petition presented by a single senator since at least 1973, if not earlier. Of course, multiple petitions of large numbers have been presented by groups of senators but a petition of this magnitude has not been presented by one senator. The signatories to the petition represent a broad cross-section of the community from literally every part of Tasmania. The petition resulted largely from its distribution to 75 per cent of Tasmanian householders by 300 volunteers over the last couple of weeks. The remarkable feature of the petition is that approximately 15,500 of the petitions flooded into my office in the last three postal sortings and there are more to come. This spontaneous response reveals the depth of feeling amongst families that they have been getting a raw deal. I hope members of the Government will take note of this petition before it is too late for them. </para>

I  think it is one that we should not attempt to develop until we have explored it.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: whereas before Europeans settled in Australia, the Aboriginal peoples of Australia had lived on their traditional lands from time immemorial and had in Aboriginal law and customs a clear title to those lands; and whereas Europeans and other non-Aboriginal people have occupied and used most of the traditional lands of the Aboriginal peoples against their will and without negotiation, compensation or treaty, and whereas it has been the practice of nations established in territories previously occupied by indigenous inhabitants to reach a negotiated settlement with those inhabitants; and whereas that occupation has seriously damaged the traditional way of life of Aboriginal Australians and has caused poverty and hardship to be the fate of the great majority of their surviving descendants; and whereas the surviving descendants of the Aboriginal peoples have expressed a wish to have their rights to land acknowledged, to preserve their link with their Aboriginal ancestors and to maintain their distinctive identity with its own cultural heritage; and whereas the people of Australia in 1967 voted overwhelmingly that the Commonwealth Parliament should have responsibility for laws relating to Aboriginal Australians: and whereas the National Aboriginal Conference unanimously resolved in April 1 979 in Canberra to ask the Commonwealth Government to negotiate a Treaty with Aboriginal Australians. whereas it is accepted internationally by the United Nations organisation, that each country should work to establish the rights of indigenous peoples to self determination, non-discrimination and the enjoyment of their own culture; and whereas the Woodward Commission in 1974 established principles by which Aboriginal rights to land should be acknowledged and realised; and whereas the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament in February 1973 resolved that Aboriginal Australians should be compensated for the loss of their traditional lands and for the damage to their way of life; and </para>

            <para>- I refer the Minister representing the Prime Minister to the Premiers&#39; revolt led by Victorian Liberal Premier Hamer and supported by all State Premiers and, in particular, to the recent meeting of the Premiers which was held in Melbourne and to which the Federal Government was not invited. I ask the Minister: Is it not now apparent that every Premier in Australia views with the greatest distrust and the gravest concern the intentions of the Federal Government in respect of the Commonwealth&#39;s responsibilities to provide adequate funding to the States and that the Premiers have come to the realisation that they have now come to the crunch point to increase their taxes, including the implementation of stage 2 of Fraser federalism - that is, the introduction of State income taxes? Is it not also apparent that the so-called co-operative federalism of the Fraser Government is now revealed for what it always was - confrontation federalism? </para>

            <para>- The answer to the three questions asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> is no. The discussions of the Premiers in recent weeks are as the cooing of doves compared with the open and widespread revolt during the time of the Labor Government. It will be remembered that at that time a then State Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan,</inline> who was a respected Premier of the Australian Labor Party, condemned the Whitlam Government&#39;s centralist financing. If one wants to analyse what has happened to State government financing under federalism, one has to look only at their Budgets over the years that this Government has been in office. Progressively, year by year, the States have had such surplus revenue that taxes could have been cut heavily, thereby indicating that they had surplus revenue. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If one looks at the employment of State public servants one finds that, whereas the Commonwealth Government reduced the number of its public servants, the States have increased theirs by tens of thousands, involving hundreds of millions of dollars of expenditure. The fact is that demonstrably on their balance sheets at each Budget the States have had more funds than before. They have had surplus funds because they have given tax cuts. Co-operative federalism has worked, particularly in the local government sphere. The revenue sharing system with local government has enabled local government for the first time to stabilise rates and to have some freedom of decision making in their policy making. </para>

In view of the answer given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> is it the case that every State Premier of the Commonwealth simply does not know what he is talking about and that every one of them does not know the state of his own finances?

              <para>- It is not I but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> who is asking the rhetorical questions. What I am saying is that every Premier, when he brought down his Budget, made a clear and positive admission that the revenue available to him was adequate, capable of enabling tax cuts and capable of allowing expanding policies, and was therefore better than it had been in the past. The Slates will always be seeking other ways of getting revenue. The States have always had the ability to increase their taxes. It is important for the people of Australia to know that the States and local government combined spend 52 per cent - that is the majority - of all public finance spent in Australia. The Commonwealth is responsible for only 48 per cent. The big spenders of public finance in Australia are the States. In fact, the States have always had the great capacity to raise taxes if they have wanted to. They have raised very many taxes and charges. Under the Whitlam Government they were forced, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> said, greatly to increase their taxes and charges; under this Government they have reduced them. </para>

Is the Minister aware that many illiterate Australians are unable to understand or to deal with the forms, completion of which is necessary before benefits can be paid or continued? Are strategies available, using visual or audio-visual communication methods, which would enable illiterate Australians to comprehend or to deal with forms more appropriately than they seem to do at present? If there are such methods, what means are taken now to publicise them widely in the community? </para>

		    <para>- I am aware that there are difficulties with literacy concerning some people who deal with my Department. Several steps are taken to assist people with the claims which they make and the business which they wish to undertake with the Department. There is difficulty for those with low literacy in the English language or in other languages. Interpretative services are available for those who have a language problem. In some of the regional offices there are audio posts which can give to people a visual or audio-visual message which may be of assistance to them. I am not sure what steps are taken to inform people of these audio posts in the regional offices. I will check to see whether they are adequate. The regionalisation of the Department in itself has been of assistance because now it is a more visible department in local areas. People are aware of it and are able to have a personal contact with the Department instead of a written communication. I will check to see whether anything else can be done to help those with literacy problems so that they will be able to transact their claims with the Department without any impediment. </para>

          <para>I have had this matter fully investigated and I have had discussions with the officer of my Department who was concerned. Let me just reiterate that the document was an advice or submission from the  Deputy  Secretary of the Postal and Telecommunications Department to his Minister. It was not any advice to me. The minute by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Payne</inline> to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline> was not based on any written advice by my Department to the Postal and Telecommunications Department. The facts are these: On 13 December 1979 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Payne</inline> of the Postal and Telecommunications Department wrote an internal minute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline> concerning the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett to the Attorney-General, that is, to me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Payne</inline> referred to telephone advice from a senior officer of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department - that was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Edwards - that the letter had been received by the Attorney-General and that the Attorney-General might be seeking to raise the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley.</inline> No advice was conveyed from the Attorney-General&#39;s Department that a prosecution could or should be instituted. A view was expressed by the officer that if Press reports that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Payne</inline> and he had seen could be taken as accurate it seemed highly likely that News Ltd had acquired in excess of a 5 per cent interest in Ansett Transport Industries Ltd unconditionally on the stock exchange and that, if that were so, </para>
          <para class="block">News Ltd would have a prescribed interest in the Ansett television stations and thus clearly would be in contravention of the Act. The minute suggested that the Minister consider a possible course of action. </para>
          <para>That was the nature of the discussions between the officer of my Department and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Payne.</inline> I might say that it is not my practice normally to disclose advice that is given by my Department to other departments or, indeed, by myself or the Solicitor-General to other departments, but in the light of the publication of this internal minute I felt it was appropriate in the peculiar circumstances of this case to make that information publicly available. </para>
          <para>In the other part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button&#39;s</inline> question he asked me whether I was aware of that advice. I have just said that I was not at that time. He asked me further whether it was not a fact that my Department had conducted an investigation. The fact of the matter is, from that information I provided, that my Department had not conducted an investigation. It was simply basing these views on the Press reports which the officer had seen. I made it perfectly clear in answers to questions in the Senate last May, and I reiterate, that my Department is not an investigative department. If, under an Act which I administer, such as the Crimes Act, my Department were concerned about a breach of that Act we normally would seek a police inquiry as to the facts. Other departments, of course, by and large do the same or have their own investigative agencies such as procedures of their own. In this case there was the Tribunal. Subsequently the Tribunal&#39;s inquiry into this matter commenced. </para>
          <para>When I was answering these questions last May that inquiry had already been proceeding. There had been High Court proceedings in which the High Court indicated very clearly that the Tribunal was an inquisitorial body. That inquiry is still proceeding. I believe the proper course is to await the conclusion of its inquiry, its decision and any report it makes. </para>

Do I further take it that on 21 May when he answered the questions in the Senate he was still unaware of that advice? </para>

            <para>- I understand that the report of the inspector appointed by the Minister for Health to investigate the affairs has only just been submitted for consideration. It is a lengthy document, which is being examined, and will be available to the Minister in the next day or two. The legislation requires that the Minister seek the advice of the Attorney-General before he considers the question of whether the whole or any part of the report should be published. This action will be taken urgently. The Minister is most conscious of the interests of the contributors in this matter. I understand that an application to the Federal Court by the Druids Friendly Society of Tasmania to wind up its medical and hospital benefits fund is likely to be made shortly. The Minister for Health expects to have the report available to him in the next day or so and further information will then be given. </para>

I pay <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> the courtesy of saying that my question follows his question No. 2974 of 23 May to which an answer has not been given. It is in respect of Uruguay. Has the Minister&#39;s attention been drawn to the plight of political prisoners in Uruguay held without trial? I refer to a group of prisoners about whom I informed the Minister 10 days ago who had been threatened with death by the end of August, and whose relations and friends are currently protesting in Melbourne. Is he aware that Amnesty International considers Uruguay to have one of the worst human rights records in Latin America, with regard to the number of political prisoners held without trial, the frequency and severity of torture, and the number of people who die as a result of torture? Is there a record of prisoners being forced to torture and kill other prisoners? What measures has the Government taken, and what further measures will it take, to exert pressure on the Uruguayan Government to end these practices which are illegal under Uruguayan law and to guarantee the safety of the prisoners? Will the Government, through its representatives, raise the matter urgently with the United Nations and other appropriate international forums? </para>

            <para>- 1 have been advised by the Minister for Transport that he is aware of the stories to which the honourable senator refers. Indeed, he has publicly responded to them. He made a statement which was released to the Press on 25 July. He indicated in that Press statement that he is not aware of any expert report, which was the expression used in the media stories, but that the stories appear to refer to correspondence from the Aviation Safety Advisory Panel, which is a body made up of the four aviation staff associations. The Minister subsequently met people from the Panel on 13 August to discuss the current shortage of radio technical officers in the Department of Transport. As stated in his Press release of 13 August, he and his Department are very much aware of the current shortage of trained staff and action is in hand to recruit people to fill the vacancies which exist. The Minister advises me that suggestions that safety standards have deteriorated are incorrect and that his Department&#39;s operating procedures would not allow the safety of aircraft operations to be prejudiced. </para>

            <para>- Can the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs advise what States, if any, have not passed complementary legislation to enable the Government&#39;s $80 per tonne liquefied petroleum gas subsidy payment to be passed on to domestic users? On what date did payments commence in each of the remaining States? </para>

            <para>- I think it is easier to answer the question the other way around. Victoria is the only State that has passed complementary legislation to date. The remaining States and the Northern Territory have been contacted and have agreed to introduce legislation at the earliest opportunity. The legal schemes in relation to the States and to the Northern Territory formulated by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs have been drafted to enable payment of subsidy in anticipation of State legislation. Claims for approval of payment in the States were approved as follows: New South Wales, 31 July 1980; Victoria, 1 August 1980; Queensland, 6 August 1980; South Australia, 25 July 1980; Western Australia, 1 August 1980; Tasmania, 4 August 1980; Northern Territory, no claims have been lodged to date. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. In view of the theft of six drums of yellowcake from the Mary Kathleen mines, how can the Minister justify his past claims that strict security measures were in force with the mining, handling and storing of yellowcake, uranium, and plutonium? Does the Government approach such security with the same degree of &#39;I don&#39;t care&#39; attitude that it adopted to the sale of 900 short tonnes of uranium to Finland, knowing that it will be processed in the Soviet Union? Will the Minister give the Senate a full report on the theft of the yellowcake, where security has broken down, and what measures have been taken to rectify this? Can the Minister give a full report on the terms on which the uranium was sold to Finland? </para>

            <para>- There are two quite separate questions. As to the first question, I cannot comment as to the particularities of the matter which, of course, would be the substance of a court case. The first knowledge that the honourable senator would have had of this matter would have been as a result of the arrest of a person in Mount Isa for the alleged theft of the two tonnes of yellowcake. The fact is that when it became known that an amount of yellowcake had obviously not been accounted for, I arranged that it be taken into custody, that the Commonwealth Police should be put on the job, and indeed that there should be a thorough investigation of how any breach of security could have taken place. This was some 1 1 days before the man was arrested. I think it was 1 or 2 August that the matter came to my notice. The fact is that it was readily easy to get a rough identity and age of the yellowcake by an assay of it. It appeared to be yellowcake that had been mined some years before - possibly in 1977 and in 1978  -  and that, I understand, has been alleged in regard to the misappropriation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Yellowcake within this country is not regarded as a highly radioactive material and therefore does not have rigid safeguards attached to it. It is not harmful unless, of course, one is in total exposure to it for long periods. It is toxic. Its movement by way of export is governed by the most rigid of rules and it comes under our agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency. It comes under our agreement in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Australia has some of the strictest rules in the world in that regard. If some quantities of some yellowcake have been misappropriated - I am not able to comment on that - quite clearly there were weakenesses in the security of either the milling or the storage of the uranium. Representatives of the Australian Safeguards Office - which comes under my responsibility - have visited that mining area and others and have made inspections and issued instructions for the tightening up of security. The major instruction is that a total inventory must be kept precisely in future so that measured and total quantities of the yellowcake are known throughout the whole of their movements. </para>
          <para>I can say only that if there has been misappropriation of course the security was not good enough. It would be silly to say otherwise. We have taken very strict precautions. Whether the security that has existed in recent years has been good enough - it has been strengthened under the Australian Safeguards Office - remains to be seen. My understanding is that these thefts - if they were thefts - occurred several years previously. In any case, we will tighten safeguards even further. It must be borne in mind that the material was seized and put under security and a person has been apprehended. </para>
          <para>As to the question of the sale of yellowcake or uranium to Finland, I understand that Finland conforms to all the NPT and International Atomic Energy Agency security arrangements that have been laid down under the Ranger recommendations and under the Government&#39;s laws and regulations. I repeat that ours are the strongest and most stringent in the world. It is possible for a country to have its uranium reprocessed elsewhere. It is far from uncommon for west European countries - including, I understand, West Germany and others - to have their uranium reprocessed in the Soviet Union. A movement of radioactive material, including yellowcake, comes under the regulations that have been laid down and comes under the survey of the International Atomic Energy Agency. A total audit of movement out and movement in of the materials is kept and maintained so that there is a scrutiny, a tolling of the material as it is described, so there is an inventory to show that the same amount of radioactive material comes back as goes out. </para>

              <para>-  This is a serious matter. I take it seriously. It is not a question of trusting the Soviet authorities. I take this matter seriously. If there were a need to tighten something up we would do so. It is not a question of that. The International Atomic Energy Agency, to which I thought the Australian Labor Party subscribed, is the body which audits movement, whether or not it trusts nations. Incidentally, the USSR is a signatory to the NPT and is a signatory to these regulations. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Grimes</inline>laughs. Let me help him with his laughter. If the suggestion is that the Soviet Union would like by these means to add to its store of uranium, yellowcake or plutonium, it would show the most crass ignorance of the distribution of radioactive materials in this world. The Soviet Union, however sadly, is not short of uranium, yellowcake or plutonium. There would be no way that the Iron Curtain countries would seek to get uranium by subversive means. The fact is that they have enormous supplies of uranium available to them. In any case, I stress that this material is monitored throughout the world. Indeed, if the Senate were interested I could give it the names and details of the various non-communist countries in the world that reprocess their materials in the USSR and, in fact, have them audited by the International Agency. </para>

              <para>- The fact is that those nations must agree to use the material for peacetime purposes. A body called the International Atomic Energy Agency has been set up and its primary job is to monitor the movement in and out of countries of every ounce of radioactive material in the world. So where that material goes for reprocessing is a matter strictly for that agency. The movement of that material out of a country to the reprocessing country and back from that country is monitored. There is no question of trust. A mechanism has been set up which ensures that, trust or no trust, the material returns to the country concerned. I thought that procedure was an acceptance of an Australian Labor Party policy. </para>

I am happy to remind honourable senators on both sides of the chamber that recently I met the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and discussed with him a wide range of matters, including the proposed Alice Springs to Darwin rail link. The proposal has been the subject of a report by officers of the Commonwealth Department of Transport and the Northern Territory Department of Transport and Works and has been the subject of representations from the Chief Minister to the Prime Minister. Of course, the matter is very much one for the Minister for Transport. However, I have sought from my Department advice on any energy and national development implications of the proposal. I understand that the Minister for Transport intends to give the matter early consideration. </para>

The Minister will be aware that neither the United States of America nor the United Kingdom recognises the Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea which the Prime Minister has described as the most repressive regime of modern times&#39;. The Minister will be aware also that the People&#39;s Republic of China, long time supporter of Pol Pot, continues to recognise the Pol Pot regime, as does the Australian Government.

            <para>-  The answer to that is no. Of course, one does not have to believe in or to support the actions, qualities or philosophies of a government to recognise that government. Indeed, we recognise - honourable senators on both sides of this chamber recognise - many governments which I hope we do not support in what they do. I think the Government of former  President  Amin was recognised even though nobody in any degree agreed with what had happened. The Government of Kampuchea was changed by military force. Some 10 or more divisions of Vietnamese troops invaded that country and changed its government by force. </para>

              <para>- The fact is that member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations and many other countries have said that, whilst they deplore what is going on in Kampuchea, they do not believe a withdrawal of recognition at this moment would be a good thing as it would serve to suggest to the Vietnamese and the people of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that we are weakening in our stance. The stance that is taken is a stance of total opposition to the military invasion of the country by the Vietnamese divisions. I hope that the Opposition opposes that. We do not support the present Government of Kampuchea and its murderous habits, but we do not want to give any kind of aid or help in the form of recognition to Vietnam or to Russia in what has been done. We have made it abundantly clear that the goal ought to be not this kind of argument but for all Australians, including the Government and, I hope, the Australian Labor Party, to demand that the Vietnamese withdraw their armies from Kampuchea. That is the goal to be sought. When that can be done a proper look at recognition can then take place. </para>

          <para>- I refer the Attorney-General to an article appearing in the June edition of <inline font-style="italic">National Watchdog,</inline> a copy of which I have supplied to him, relating to submissions on freedom of information presented by Federal departments and individuals to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs during its 1979 inquiry into the Freedom of Information Bill and the Archives Bill. Is it correct, as alleged in that article, that an officer of the Australian Archives wrote a submission for individual presentation to the Committee but, that when its existence was discovered, the officer was instructed to shred it? </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>If so, I ask the Attorney: Firstly, as the officer&#39;s submission was one for individual presentation why was this action taken and under whose instructions was the submission destroyed? Secondly, does the Attorney agree that it is particularly invidious that in an inquiry which seeks to introduce effective freedom of information legislation into Australia such a blatant denial of individual rights should occur? Thirdly, will the Attorney assure the Senate that in future public and parliamentary inquiries Commonwealth employees will be permitted to exercise the same rights as other individual citizens? </para>

        <para>There is a clear Government policy that individual officers of the Public Service in their personal capacity are entitled to make submissions to parliamentary committees, royal commissions and other committees of inquiry. That entitlement is, of course, conditional upon an officer who makes such a submission making it clear that the submission is made in his or her private capacity and that prior authority is obtained for the disclosure of any information or the contents of any document acquired in the course of official duty. Last year the Public Service Board issued guidelines on the official conduct of Commonwealth public servants. Paragraphs 4.33 and 4.36 of that document set out the guidelines that ought to be followed by public servants volunteering information to royal commissions and committees of inquiry. </para>

            <para>-  I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. It concerns the obligations or responsibilities of the Federal Government and the State authorities to ensure that there are no oil tanker mishaps on the Australian coast. Has the Government studied the findings of the Irish Royal Commission which indicted the Total oil company for the disaster with the tanker <inline font-style="italic">Betelgeuse</inline> which resulted in the death of 50 crewmen and millions of pounds of damage simply because the company failed to spend a small sum on vital tanker maintenance services? In effect I am asking the Minister to ensure that there is a safety blitz on every tanker controlled by Total to see whether there are any structural defects which could lead to a repetition of the Bantry Bay disaster. </para>

            <para>-  Last financial year the predecessor of the Aboriginal Development Commission, the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission, purchased some land at, I think, Trinity Beach near Cairns. I understand that it purchased that land on the application of some of the Aboriginal residents of Cairns who wanted a sport and recreational centre and had plans to develop it for that purpose. The responsibility has now shifted to the Aboriginal Development Commission. As was extensively debated in this chamber when the legislation was considered, the Commission is, of course, independent subject only to a power of general direction. I do not have the direct control of its administration and I have no immediate advice as to the Commission&#39;s intentions with respect to that piece of land. I will ask the Commission to advise me what it has in mind - I am sure it will do that - and I will let the honourable senator have a reply. </para>

              <para>- The answer to that question is no. My understanding is that there have been some representations with respect to the use of that land. I hope that the local authority and any concerned citizens will be able to sit down with the Aboriginals who are concerned and with the Development Commission and reach an amiable solution to the problem. The various outriders which are funded by my Department are subject to normal zoning requirements and so on. Like any other developer they may choose to use the machinery which is usually available under State law to challenge rulings which they disagree with. That is a minority situation when it occurs. Usually these things are dealt with as other developers deal with them, in co-operation and consultation with the local authority. </para>

            <para>- I have some information in relation to the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> but it is in rather general terms. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has asked about certain specific allegations which I cannot answer at this stage. I will refer them to the Minister. I am able to say that representatives of the Customs Officers Association of Australia have made a number of statements over the past 18 months which have been critical of the administration of the Bureau of Customs. The Customs Officers Association has had the opportunity of making its claims to at least two recent commissions - the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs and the New South Wales Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking. In the reports of the commissions there is nothing to suggest there is any substance in the claims that were made to them. I do not know whether that covers all the claims which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has mentioned. I must put that caveat on it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Many allegations are being made in the media currently, but the Minister informs me that no details of alleged corruption have been furnished to the Department, despite written requests being made to the Customs Officers Association to give particulars in support of statements that have been made. The head of the Department&#39;s Internal Affairs Unit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wilson,</inline> who was formerly the Commissioner of the Australian Capital Territory Police Force, is currently in Sydney seeking to interview representatives of the Customs Officers Association on the latest allegations. Whilst the COA, as it is known, has refused to cooperate with the chief officer of Customs in New South Wales, it is to be hoped that it will assist the Internal Affairs Unit in its inquiries. The Minister informs me that he could not consider any form of inquiry into the Bureau of Customs or other areas of public administration on the basis of the so far unsubstantiated and general type of complaint that has been made by some members of the staff association. As I have said, that covers a number of fairly general allegations that have been made recently in the Press and otherwise. I will draw the specific cases mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> to the attention of the Minister. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Telephonic communications are very poor in the north of the Australian continent, particularly along the coast of the Pilbara and North Kimberleys from Port Hedland, Broome, Derby, Kununurra to Darwin and also through Arnhem Land, Groote Eylandt, Borroloola, et cetera, to Thursday Island and Cooktown. Having in mind the urgent need for reliable communication links to support defence activities, surveillance, security and industries in these northern regions, will the Minister indicate what action the Australian Telecommunications Commission is taking to overcome the poor state of communications and what priorities are being given in the various areas for the extension of microwave links and other forms of communication installations? </para>

            <para>- I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> that the Government is aware of the problems of telephonic communications in the north of Australia. I must say that the theoretical awareness that I had has become very practical awareness since I have had responsibility for Aboriginal affairs. Often I have seen the disadvantage that is suffered by people from the south in trying to make contact with people in the north and vice versa. For that reason the Government regards it as a serious problem. Action has been taken to try to overcome what is a widespread problem. In 1979 Telecom Australia commissioned a major study of telecommunications needs in remote areas of northern Australia. It was a major inquiry which paid particular attention to the needs of Aborigines, pastoral properties, mines and tourist establishments. The study also examined technical solutions, together with other cost implications. Already as a result of that inquiry some action is being taken. Knowing of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> s interest in this matter, I have a fairly substantial note on the action which is in hand in the various areas which he mentioned. Rather than take the time of the Senate, because it is of broad interest, I seek leave to have the material incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

            <para>The results of the study have now been made available to Telecom and the Commission now has a detailed picture of the needs of the Northern Territory and the principles of the NT study can now be applied to other remote areas. </para>
            <para class="block">Position </para>
            <para>The study showed that 20,600 people in the Northern Territory do not have access to a modern telecommunications service. About 80 per cent are Aboriginals. The communications needs of Aboriginals are such that the study recommended the formation of a specialised Telecom unit to study them, consult with the Aboriginals and develop solutions to their communications problems. </para>
            <para>The study suggested that 1172 automatic STD telephone services will be needed by 1 985 to meet needs in the remote areas of the Northern Territory and about two-thirds of these will be for Aboriginals and Aboriginal settlements. </para>
            <para>Telecom is looking to being able to provide a fully automatic telephone service to all parts of Australia by 1990. The study recommends that the work in the remote areas of the NT be carried out in the period 1 984-89. </para>
            <para class="block">Pilbara and Kimberleys area </para>
            <para>Telecom is particularly aware of the telecommunications needs in this area. Following severe cyclones earlier this year Telecom has initiated action to substantially reduce the risk of communications failures by providing additional protection against lightning damage to the coaxial cable system and rectifying weaknesses in the open wire system. </para>
            <para>The protection program for the coaxial cable is expected to cost in excess of $400,000 and the upgrading of the open wire into the Kimberley area has been budgeted at $36,000, both projects having a target date for completion before the onset of the next wet season. </para>
            <para>A broadband service to the Kimberley area is planned to be operational to Broome and Derby during 1982; and to Wyndham and Kunnunurra during 1983 at a cost of $ mm </para>
            <para>Action is in hand, in the meantime, to improve and extend emergency HF type radio communications between Derby and Perth by employing modern equipment with an increased number of frequency options. This system is scheduled to be in operation prior to the next wet season. </para>
            <para>Investigations are also proceeding for the provision of similar equipment to Wyndham before the 1981-82 cyclone season commences. While these back-up systems have limited capacity, they do provide a substantial measure of additional telecommunication security for the region. </para>
            <para class="block">Groote  Eylandt </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline>has a particular interest in the improvement of telecommunications services to Groote Eylandt and during his recent visit to the area the Minister for Post and Telecommunications had discussions with the Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator and</inline> representatives of the Groote Eylandt Mining Company (GEMCO) on this subject. </para>
            <para>As a result of those discussions consideration is being given by Telecom to the purchase of the GEMCO tropospheric scatter radio system which provides up to 12 circuits between Nhulunbuy public exchange and the company PABX at Alyangula. The link was installed under the &#39;Subscriber&#39; Spur Line Policy which lays down conditions for a privately owned communications system to be connected to the public network. Services in the township are provided and maintained by GEMCO to meet company requirements although circuits are also provided for a public telephone and a Northern Territory Administration exchange line. </para>
            <para>The company had elected to provide and maintain its own communications on Groote Eylandt and to be a subscriber on the Nhulunbuy exchange rather than have Telecom take over communications under the provisions of the alternative Trunk&#39; Spur Line Policy. This policy requires that the company make an unconditional capital contribution of the cost of a trunk spur line facility capable of meeting requirements for five years. </para>
            <para>Telecom Australia has now advised that the purchase of the existing subscriber radio link from GEMCO is not an attractive proposition as the system does not have the capacity necessary to meet the predicted requirement for trunk telephone circuits nor does it meet denned standards for trunk operations. To meet the requirements for a trunk system, a more sophisticated tropospheric scatter radio system would have to be installed, costing in the order of $ 1.5m. </para>
            <para>Telecom is prepared, however, to consider establishing an exchange on Groote Eylandt and also to take over the provision of services within the island if GEMCO is prepared to make a capital contribution for a suitable trunk line facility. In addition, Telecom is prepared to take over the existing subscriber link, at fair valuation, for possible use elsewhere. </para>
            <para>Telecom has, as a matter of urgency, set up a working group to examine the best means of meeting the particular telecommunications needs of Groote Eylandt and the means of providing additional trunk capacity between Darwin and Nhulunbuy. Further consultations with the company are proposed. </para>
            <para class="block">Conclusion </para>
            <para>Should the Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator require</inline> further information on projects and priorities in improving telecommunications services to Northern Australia I will seek that information from the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> asked me a question on Uruguay and human rights. I have some information and, with the consent of the Senate, I will give a brief answer. The Government has heard of allegations that the Uruguayan authorities plan to kill a number of detainees during a &#39;staged&#39; breakout from the Libertad prison near Montevideo. Because any such action would give us great concern, we raised the matter recently with the International Red Cross, who had also heard of it from a Geneva-based group called The Committee for Aid for Human Rights in Uruguay&#39;. Acting on these allegations, the International Red Cross sought and received permission from the Uruguayan Government to visit the prison in question about a month ago. During this visit they uncovered no evidence to support the allegations made against the Uruguayan Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>While the Government is aware of violations of human rights in Uruguay and has made known its concern to the Uruguayan Government, we are not aware of any recent deterioration of the human rights situation in Uruguay. We understand that prison conditions have not deteriorated, that medical facilities remain normal and that there is no recent evidence of torture. Prisoners have normal facilities such as visits and correspondence and are allowed access to legal assistance. </para>

          <para class="block">On 24 January this year it was announced by the Minister for National Development and Energy, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> on behalf of the Government, that an $80 a tonne subsidy would be paid on liquefied petroleum gas used for domestic purposes. In a ministerial Press release it was stated:   . . a subsidy to wholesale suppliers of LPG and wholesalers of naphtha for gas-making feedstock . . . </para>
          <para class="block">It was explicit in that statement that the subsidy would be paid through wholesalers. On 8 April another statement was issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> which again indicated that the subsidy would be paid to wholesalers and announced that it would be paid retrospectively to 28 March. On 1 7 April, following some questions in the Senate to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> evidently realised that a subsidy of this type, which is selective depending upon end use, could not be paid through wholesalers; that was not administratively possible. So in a lengthy answer to a question asked in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> notified us that the subsidy would be paid to retailers and to utilities which supply gas to towns in reticulated form. He clarified some other points pertaining to the subsidy, and there are many more that he failed to clarify. I will return to that matter in more detail. </para>
          <para>That marked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick&#39;s</inline> exit from this matter. The Government, for one reason or another, decided that future releases on this subject would come from the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland),</inline> who is represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack.</inline> I note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> is to reply in this discussion of a matter of public importance today. It is probably a wise choice by the Government, whatever its reasons may have been. On 6 July <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garland</inline> issued a statement which confirmed that the subsidy would be paid through retailers and that it would be paid retrospectively to 28 March. He also announced the registration of distributors. He left many more questions unanswered. We have been told today that after all this time some 228 distributors, I think it was, have been registered. The Government, or at least its representative in this House, apparently is not able to estimate how many potential distributors there are, but since LPG is sold at almost every service station among other places, presumably the number runs to tens of thousands. Whether any subsidy actually has been paid we do not know. If it has been, the amount would be miniscule. A promise made on 24 January this year has still not been honoured. </para>
          <para>The subsidy was announced on 24 January. As I mentioned earlier, it was quite explicity stated that a subsidy would be paid to wholesale suppliers of LPG and wholesalers of naphtha for gasmaking feedstock, to utilities which reticulated gas to towns and to domestic consumers who bought gas in bottles of 46 kilograms or less. The final paragraph of the Minister&#39;s statement of 24 </para>

            <para class="block">Which, if maintained in the mid-1980s, would pre-empt a substantial part of annual output for less efficient uses, for which LPG is basically less appropriate than other fuels of much greater availability. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In a statement in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> announced a subsidy for what he himself defined as an inappropriate and less efficient use of LPG, he condemned measures which would encourage the use of LPG in an inappropriate way for less efficient end measures. That, apparently, is responsible economic management, Fraser Government style, 1980! On 8 April, tacked on to a much more comprehensive statement on the pricing of LPG, it was still implied that the subsidy would be paid through wholesalers and that it would be retrospective to 28 March. That complete statement of 8 April added to the contradictions in the Government&#39;s policy on this matter. It reasserted the Government&#39;s belief that LPG is a premium fuel, the use of which so far as possible should be restricted to its premium usage as automotive fuel and a feedstock. But the package of policy announced on that day priced LPG for petrochemical feedstock purposes at $252 a tonne and at $125 a tonne for the crudest of all conceivable uses - space heating. So the Government&#39;s policy - responsible economic management, Fraser Government style 1 980  -  is to sell a commodity at half the price for an end use which we wish to discourage and at double the price for an end use which we believe should have priority. Common sense and truth again have been stood on their heads. Reality, as has so often been the case with this Government, has been stood on its head. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline>had been questioned on a number of occasions about the administration of the subsidy. The Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 17 April records his answer - a day later - to a question which had been put to him the day before on how the Government intended to identify what LPG was used for household or domestic purposes and what was used for industrial purposes, especially when a poultry farmer, a pig producer or some glasshouse proprietors - any number of industrial users - use LPG for industrial purposes immediately adjoining or even in their own residences. He was asked how the Government proposed to differentiate. His answer did not clarify that fairly fundamental problem but it did make a couple of other points. It announced for the first time an important point - that the subsidy would be paid to retailers. Some time in the two and a half months after it announced this measure, some time between 8 and 17 April, the Government suddenly realised that this discriminatory subsidy - I do not use that as an emotive word; it is a subsidy the qualification for which is dependent upon end usage - cannot conceivably be administered at wholesale levels; it can be administered only at retail level, and very ineffectively there. </para>
          <para>As for the individual customer who would use gas, perhaps from the same cylinder, for both domestic and industrial purposes, he said that the dominant usage would prevail in this dual usage situation. So the retailer who sells LPG is expected not only to find out whether it is to be used for domestic purposes or industrial purposes but also to find out, when an individual customer is using the LPG for both those purposes from the same bottle, which usage is dominant. The subsidy is paid not to the person who is actually using the gas, but to the retailer. During the recess Question No. 5822 asked by the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> was answered. That answer made it clear that there is absolutely no record of the usage patterns of LPG prior to 1979, apart from some calculated estimates made in 1979. We do not know and the Government does not know what proportion of total LPG purchased in the past has been consumed for domestic purposes. So that cross-check is not available to the Government. </para>
          <para>On 17 April, as I mentioned, we saw the exit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> from participation in this policy area. When there is an election among his back benchers we will see his exit from the leadership chair too. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> will be back there like a rocket. On 6 July under the new regime of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garland,</inline> another statement was issued. It confirmed that the subsidy would actually be paid at retail level and that it would be paid retrospectively to 28 March. It also announced that distributors would be registered. The statement read: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The subsidy will be paid to registered distributors of the gas . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">How many distributors the Government expected would be eligible to enrol we were not told. The Government still apparently does not know. We have found out in the last half hour that some 228, I think it is, are registered now. That is probably just within the last couple of weeks because, according to my information at the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garland</inline> issued this statement, on 6 July almost six months after the Government had announced it was going to pay the subsidy, the forms for registration had not even been printed. Yet the </para>
          <para class="block">Government still insists that the subsidy will be paid retrospectively to 28 March. The Government says it will reimburse an unknown number of distributors whose names in all but 228 cases are not even on record who sold up to 5 months ago an unknown amount of gas for specified purposes. The Government says it will pay a subsidy on that provided this unknown number of dealers who sold the unknown quantity for specific purposes sold it at $80 a tonne below the ruling price. That is a very simple proposition! It is very simple to do that! Anyone who believes that that will be done would believe a Fraser electoral <inline font-style="italic">promise</inline> or a Carrick explanation dictated by Ian Sinclair of contradictory ministerial answers. </para>
          <para>The Government insists that the subsidy will be paid retrospectively to 28 March but it has not explained how it will determine the price at which each of the tens of thousands of retailers have sold LPG from 28 March onwards and the specific purpose for which the LPG was bought, whether it was bought for household or industrial use. The subsidy that was promised eight months ago, if it has been paid at all- perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> will clear this up when he replies - has been paid only in minuscule amounts because until very recently no distributors had been registered. All along the Government has kept telling the retailers that they should reduce their selling prices by $80 a tonne because the Government will reimburse them for it. After eight months the Government still has not got around to actually doing it. Predictably and, I suggest, justifiably, few if any dealers have complied with the Government&#39;s request to cut the price by $80 a tonne in the expectation of receiving a subsidy. Perhaps they place the same value on the Government&#39;s undertaking to pay a subsidy as the electorate at large places on a prime ministerial promise to reduce or hold income taxes or any other tax down to their present level. </para>
          <para>Even beyond that, overlooking the &#39;tremendous problems - I suggest the insurmountable problems of retrospectivity and looking into the future - we have the question of how a retailer is to determine whether gas purchased from him or her is to be used for industrial or domestic purposes. How will the Government ensure - it says that this is a condition of the subsidy being paid that the benefit of the $80 a tonne subsidy is passed on to the consumer? How will the Government ensure that? Obviously it requires firstly, the monitoring of retail prices from tens of thousands of outlets. Perhaps we could have an estimate of how many bureaucrats will be engaged in that. It also requires the withholding of a subsidy if the correct retail price, or what some bureaucrat says is the correct retail price, is not charged. </para>
          <para>If the Government can do that with LPG why can it not do that with petrol? We come to an interesting contradiction here because the Government is paying $123m a year to oil companies for petrol freight subsidies but the difference between petrol prices in the country and the capital cities is greater than it has ever been. The difference in Western Australia in specific cases that I know of is as high as 1 3c a litre. Yet the Government says it is picking up all the freight in excess of half a cent a litre. Where does the other 121c go? The Government says: We cannot do anything about that&#39;. The Government says: &#39;We have no control over retail petrol prices&#39;. If it has no control over retail petrol prices, if it cannot prevent the misuse, the misallocation of its enormous subsidy on fuel freights how will it have effective discipline over retail prices for LPG? It either has that discipline for both or it does not have it for either. It is appropriate that the petroleum products freight subsidy should be used because, as I said, the gap between city petrol prices and country petrol prices is greater than it has ever been, notwithstanding this enormous subsidy which is being paid out, the ultimate destination of which nobody can be absolutely certain of. We only know where it goes at the first step; it goes to the big oil companies. Is the LPG subsidy, when the Government eventually gets around to paying it, going to finish up in the same place? Is it going to be intercepted by the oil companies in the way in which the petroleum freight subsidy appears to have been? </para>
          <para>I also noted in a current issue of <inline font-style="italic">Inside Canberra</inline> which is usually quite a reliable newsletter that the Government is having a great deal of trouble in administering this policy where LPG is reticulated to households by utilities in towns. So these self-proclaimed responsible economic managers are preparing to go to the nation again in 10 weeks&#39; time to ask the nation to re-elect them on the grounds that they are responsible economic managers who understand business and trade when seven months ago they said that they would pay a subsidy of $80 a tonne without having the faintest idea of how they were going to do it. They said that they would pay it to retailers then they realised that would not work and they would have to pay it to wholesalers. They then said that they would pay it retrospectively to 28 March even though they do not know how much LPG was sold or who sold it. At this distance, five months later, they reckon that they will unscramble the problem of these unknown distributors who sold an unknown quantity of gas to unknown persons at unknown prices for unknown purposes and will pay the subsidy retrospectively. Responsible economic managers indeed! It was, of course, another knee-jerk policy which, like so many of the policies which have got this country into trouble, originated among the standover men of the National Country Party. </para>
          <para>The assertion that the Government will pay the subsidy retrospectively is in keeping, of course, with other abstractions from reality which we have recently noted by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in particular. He assures us that the Government will continue with its policies of bearing down on inflation, its policies which have borne down on inflation. Has not the Prime Minister noted that inflation has gone up by 40 per cent in the last two years? Has not he noted that it has gone up from 7.7 per cent to 10.7 per cent? Bearing down on inflation indeed! The policies which the Prime Minister has followed have not borne it down; they have pulled it up. They will continue to do so. Perhaps most dangerous of all, judging from statements like that in association with a 105 per cent investment allowance and a 17+ per cent effective interest payment on trust deposits with the Government is the danger that, like Alice in Wonderland, the Prime Minister appears to believe that if he says something three times it is true. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I simply refer to that not because I believe there is any substance whatever in that proposition - indeed I will invite the Senate to reject it out of hand - but because it seemed from a good deal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh&#39;s</inline> speech that he was really talking about something else altogether, namely, the policy of the scheme which, of course, was adopted and supported by this Parliament. A number of things he said may have been relevant. He may have said them in the debate in this Parliament when the policy in respect of the scheme was being considered. As usual, he spent a lot of time debating other matters which were really irrelevant to his own proposition. What the Government is asked to answer this afternoon in the Senate is an allegation of incompetent administration of the liquefied petroleum gas subsidy. As that scheme is administered not by the Minister for National Development and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Carrick) but by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland),</inline> whom I represent and as the motion is aimed at the administration of the scheme, I am replying on behalf of the Government; so there should not be any surprise about that fact either. </para>
          <para>The position is that this subsidy scheme was first announced on 24 January this year by the Minister for National Development and Energy. I will not go into the details of this scheme. Broadly it provides for a subsidy of $80 a tonne on liquefied petroleum gas supplied to household users and others, not for commercial uses or for industrial purposes either. The payment made to wholesalers was to be passed onto consumers. It is a condition of the scheme that the payment is made only if it is passed onto consumers. 1 hasten to say that that is a very different scheme from the one that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> spent some time criticising, namely the petrol freight subsidy scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> knows quite well - he mentioned it quite often in the Senate before - that is a payment of a freight subsidy and this Government has no power over the actual ultimate price that is charged by the retailer. It is being paid here specifically on the condition that the subsidy is passed onto the consumer. Under the scheme we have control over the person to whom it is paid. </para>
          <para>Dealing with the allegation of incompetent administration, the scheme was announced only as a broad policy on 24 January. The legislation to give effect to the scheme was introduced into this Parliament on 17 April, was passed through the Parliament and was assented to on 23 May. The legislation required detailed schemes as well as administrative details to be developed in consultation with the State governments. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> has already indicated, the matter was passed to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs as the Minister responsible for the administration of the scheme and his Department formulated schemes for the States. These details were announced on 6 July this year. Indeed, on 7 July I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> asked me whether application forms were sent to all known distributors; that is, the day after the details of the scheme were announced. Although there may now be some criticism of delay in payment, the fact is that these schemes have been developed to operate from 28 March this year, so that the payments will be made in respect of the liquefied petroleum gas supplied since that date. People who have supplied and received it since that date will be eligible for benefits under this scheme. </para>
          <para>There has been a need to consult with a number of parties. I have already mentioned the States. </para>
          <para class="block">Many other people are involved in the administration of the scheme as well. First and foremost, I should say, as I answered a question earlier today, all States are required to pass complementary legislation. Only one State has done so, but discussions have taken place with other States. It is anticipated that they will be passing their complementary legislation. </para>

              <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer</inline> answered, Victoria has already passed it. As the Senate knows, State parliaments have varying periods of recess. I think that is probably one of the main reasons for the delay in the passage of legislation. Therefore, there is no suggestion whatever that such legislation will not be passed. The forms were sent out to all known distributors. I have some statistics in relation to the numbers of distributors. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> asked me a question earlier today which, unfortunately, at that time I was not in a position to answer, but there are about 560 distributors of the bulk and bottled liquefied petroleum gas and there will be about 40 reticulators. Both of those groups will be eligible to receive the subsidy for passing on to the selected consumers entitled to the subsidies. There certainly has been some delay on the part of those distributors in returning forms, but the companies have been approached by departmental officers to expedite completion of the registration forms. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As I said earlier, 226 distributors have already been registered and it is estimated that those who have registered cover 90 per cent of the eligible liquefied petroleum gas market. In answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer</inline> earlier today I indicated the dates on which claims had first been approved in the various States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> has now gone out of this chamber. Apparently he is not very interested in getting the answers to the questions he has asked, but that, 1 suppose, is to be expected. To date claims totalling $71 5,000 have been paid and it is estimated that there will be payments of $ 1 m by the end of this week. Admittedly there has been some delay in the registration of reticulators in New South Wales, the reason being that these are mainly municipal or shire councillors who have had some difficulty in establishing tariffs that reflect the benefit of the subsidy being passed to their consumers. Discussions are going on. Attempts are being made to iron the matters out and every encouragement is being given to enable the difficulties to be overcome. All reticulators in Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, West Australia and Tasmania have been registered, so that the administration of the scheme is proceeding with considerable expedition as far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned. </para>
          <para>As I have said, it is a matter of consultation with the States, it requires legislation by the States and discussions with large numbers of people, including the municipal and shire council reticulators. These things ali take time, but it is our policy to implement this scheme as quickly as possible in the circumstances. I have cited some of the critical dates in the establishment of this scheme, the formulation of policy, the passage of legislation, the working out of the details of the scheme and the implementation of it at the Commonwealth end as quickly as possible. The full implementation of the scheme necessarily involves large numbers of people. For instance, as I said, we estimate that 560 distributors will be involved but so far only 226 have registered. Although we are giving them encouragement to register, we cannot make them register quickly so we have to wait until they get around to doing it. Therefore some delays are bound to occur. I might add that it is not necessary to register all the thousands of garages that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> seems to think it will be required to register. Most retailers buy the gas cylinders from distributors. The wholesalers are the ones who will be eligible to receive the subsidy on the condition that the benefit is being passed on. </para>
          <para>It can be seen from the details I have given that the Commonwealth Government is proceeding in an efficient manner with the administration of this scheme. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> took most of the time allotted to him in this discussion, he did not establish incompetent administration by the Federal Government of the liquefied petroleum gas scheme. He pointed out a number of difficulties that may be encountered in the administration of the scheme. We do not deny that there are difficulties in administering a scheme in a nation the size of Australia and a scheme involving large numbers of people who have to be relied upon in order to make it work efficiently. However it seems to be quite clear that there is a general and widespread acceptance of the scheme and there is a very considerable measure of co-operation. There are difficulties in certain respects and I have mentioned some of them, but there is absolutely no basis whatsoever for the allegation of incompetent administration which has been brought before the Senate today by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh.</inline> In light of the fact that he has not produced any evidence which I believe warrants any further debate or examination by the Senate, I move: </para>

              <para>- Normally at this stage, as  chairman  of a Senate standing committee bringing up a report of his committee, I would seek leave of the Senate to move that the Senate take note of the report. On this occasion, however, the Committee is reporting on a Bill at the request of the Senate pursuant to Standing Order 196A and therefore the Committee&#39;s report is a part of the legislative process. The major debate on this report will occur within the Senate&#39;s consideration of the remaining stages of the Bill. However, I would like to explain a number of matters in connection with the Committee&#39;s consideration of the Bill which I feel should be placed before the Senate at this stage. </para>

          </list>
          <para class="block">At this stage, by way of background I would like to inform the Senate of something of the conduct of the inquiry. After the Senate referred the Bill to the Committee, we met immediately and initiated procedures to obtain submissions, evidence and contributions from all interested sections of the community. Advertisements were placed nationally in the usual manner. Furthermore, given the special nature of the inquiry, contact was made with approximately 100 ethnic newspapers and publications, as well as with numerous ethnic and public radio stations. In response to this advertisement, some 84 submissions and 20 other documents were received from a wide cross-section of the Australian community. </para>
          <para>In addition to material received from interests associated with broadcasting, there were representatives from organisations who entered a plea for their special interests to be considered. The organisations included the Australian Centre for Visual Television, the Association of Translators and Interpreters of Australia, the Australian Council for Radio for the Print Handicapped Co-op Ltd, the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped and the Australian Deafness Council. Furthermore, there were two submissions from representatives of the Aboriginal community. Committee briefings were undertaken and public hearings were held in which some 31 individuals covering some 16 organisations gave evidence. </para>
          <para>In examining its terms of reference, the Committee was mindful of the need to report on the proposed establishment, functions and powers of the IMBC as well as to take into account the concept of multiculturalism. The implications of multiculturalism cover a very wide field. A culturally diverse nation offers its citizens the chance of a rich and varied pattern of life. However, we should be mindful of the importance of the central nature of the host society. The Committee has recognised the role of multiculturalism in furthering the unity of Australian society and in appreciation of our various cultures. We have emphasised both on our report and in our conclusions this value as a facet of our developing society. </para>
          <para>The Committee is in no doubt as to the value of multiculturalism to the contemporary and developing society in Australia. It endorses the development of appropriate means to achieve multiculturalism in accordance with the objectives which are enunciated in the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs Act 1979. We therefore welcome the Government&#39;s initiative in the field of multicultural broadcasting. </para>
          <para>However, in careful consideration of the written and oral evidence presented at this inquiry, we are concerned that the movement towards its permanent introduction is being made without the necessary preliminary preparation that would ensure its success. The evidence also strongly suggests that the preparations made are inadequate to allow the service to go to air by October this year. The evidence has not shown that the proposed programming policies will necessarily be successful in achieving a worthwhile intercultural exchange between those people of the various ethnic communities and with Australian society at large. </para>
          <para>Multiculturalism as envisaged by the IMBC would seem to depend upon the popularity of foreign language programs with English subtitling - a policy that on the basis of evidence received is open to question and hence a policy which will need considerable experimentation. While provision has been made in the legislation for the support and encouragement of independent public broadcasters, we are not satisfied that sufficient consideration has been given to their role and access to IMBC broadcast facilities. Another important unknown factor yet to be resolved is reconciling program policy with stated programming philosophy in the context of maximising revenue from advertising. There is a widely held concern that we share that, in attempting to resolve this possible conflict of interest, programming principles might be compromised. We are also not entirely satisfied that the ethnic community prefers the IMBC concept to the Australian Broadcasting Commission concept for multicultural television. There was a strong element of evidence which suggested that some representatives from the ethnic communities would be prepared to support broadcasting programs on a second channel operated by a reorganised and a re-structured ABC. </para>
          <para>In summary, we are in sympathy with the doubts and reservations that have been raised in the evidence which suggest that it would be premature to embark on a full-scale multicultural broadcasting service at this stage. In any event, we are not entirely satisfied that the IMBC is the best option open to us. We believe that the ABC has been insufficiently considered, having regard to the fact that an ABC Committee of Review, the Dix Committee, has been established and is presently inquiring into all aspects of ABC broadcasting. The Committee is conscious that legislation is already in existence which would allow the Special Broadcasting Service to carry out multilingual broadcasting as well as special television services as are prescribed. </para>
          <para>We are aware that some preparatory work has already been completed in regard to multicultural broadcasting, and in pursuance of the stated government policy on multiculturalism the Committee would conclude that the Government initially introduce an interim experimental service until the ABC Committee of Review findings are available. This interim service should be carried out under the auspices of the existing but more responsive SBS, having regard to the stated criticisms of that organisation as outlined in the Ethnic Television Review Panel second report. 1 turn to the relation of the matter of what we call function B, that is that section of the Bill which reads: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(b)">
              <para>to support and encourage the provision and development of public broadcasting and public television services, </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The Committee notes that there is at present no government policy on public television and that the SBS does &#39;not yet have an official public television policy to implement&#39;. The Committee would wish to see reflected in the proposed interim service, facilities to support and to encourage public broadcasting and public television. However, it notes that the SBS will be advising the Government on the development of a public television policy, and in the interim the Committee is of the view that the development of public broadcasting and public television continue under the existing Australian Film Commission arrangements. This will facilitate the eventual integration of both public broadcasting and public television into a wider broadcasting structure at a later stage. </para>
          <para>The Committee has noted the different advisory roles of the National Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Committee and the State Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Committees in relation to the SBS and it recalls the critical observations of the ETRP second report. The Committee is not at all confident that these existing advisory committees will be appropriate for the proposed interim service. In order to achieve a more successful consultative structure for the interim period, we call for an urgent review of these advisory committees. In any such review consideration should be given to the principal objectives or intent of Section 79ZL and 79ZM of the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill 1 980. </para>
          <para>It remains for me only to restate to the Senate the important role of Senate committees. The work of our Committee over the last few weeks has been an important part of the legislative process of parliament. A Bill was referred to the Committee for examination and report. This we have now done, and by bringing up our report we are returning the Bill to the legislative processes of this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I commend the report to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- by leave - As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> said in his introductory remarks, the Senate will have the opportunity for a full debate of the issues covered in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts when the debate on the legislation is resumed. However, I take this opportunity to make a few remarks in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson&#39;s</inline> statement. First of all, I would like to say how fortunate the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts was in having <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> as its  Chairman  in this exercise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> is an experienced and assiduous senator who has devoted a great deal of his time in the Parliament to giving attention to broadcasting matters.  His  chairmanship of the Senate Committee&#39;s report on children&#39;s television was outstanding, and that report has been one of the most significant documents to come out of the Senate on that matter. It was due in no small part to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson&#39;s</inline> excellent chairmanship that we have been able to arrive at what is a very important conclusion, namely a unanimous report from the Committee. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I suggest that this report brought down by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> represents an exercise in Senate responsibility. This report shows that the Senate, in the work of its standing committees, can exercise a useful check against hasty and ill-considered excesses of the executive. I believe that the Parliament and the general public are becoming increasingly disturbed about the accretion of executive power at the expense of the Parliament. It is only by the work of the committees such as we have been engaged in that the power of the Parliament can be returned. If the Senate&#39;s oftstated claim of being a House of review means anything at all, it means that its committees can investigate in an impartial, expert and cooperative way matters such as controversial and significant legislation. The legislation to set up a multicultural broadcasting corporation was both of those things; it was significant and it was controversial. It was significant because it represented an attempt to bring to the ethnic minorities of Australia a broadcasting system tailored to meet their needs. It also attempted to create a broadcasting system in Australia which would reflect the multicultural character of contemporary Australian society for the benefit of all Australians. With both of these objectives the Australian Labor Party was in accord. </para>
          <para>We believe it is time- in fact, it is long overdue - that non-English speaking Australians in our midst get better broadcasting services tailored to meet their specific needs. We believe they are entitled to such services. They clearly want them and it ought to be a responsibility of government to provide them. We also believe in a multicultural Australia. We believe it is time that all our institutions - not only our broadcasting institutions but also our educational and various other institutions - should reflect the true and factual ethnic diversity of our society. We - I am speaking on behalf of the Federal Opposition at this point - are most anxious to see a multicultural Australia pursued through appropriate broadcasting services. </para>

              <para>- I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Teague,</inline> one of my colleagues on this Committee, endorses that view. However, the legislation was controversial, and it was controversial for the reasons <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> has set out. It seemed to the Committee and it certainly seemed to the Federal Opposition that the legislation, in the form in which it was referred to the Committee, would not achieve those important objectives which we all agree ought to be pursued. I believe that the Senate Committee has done the Senate, the Parliament and the Australian public a great favour in bringing down this report. This report, if adopted by honourable senators - which I sincerely hope it will be - will give the Parliament and the Government more time to look clearly, calmly and carefully at the various alternatives available for the provision of ethnic and multicultural broadcasting services. </para>

          <para>Time was needed because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> said, preparation had not been adequate. In recommending that we leave the matter for consideration until after the Australian Broadcasting Commission committee of inquiry reports, I believe we are giving the Parliament and the Government the opportunity to develop a coordinated broadcasting policy in place of the ad hoc, fragmentary and ill-considered developments we have seen in the past. Because this Senate Committee&#39;s report was an exercise in Senate responsibility, because it will give the Parliament, the Government and the public more much needed time to consider these matters and because I believe, if these recommendations are adopted and pursued they will bring to all Australians and, in particular, to Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds broadcasting services that they both need and want, I heartily endorse the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> and commend his statement to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- by leave - I believe that the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts has done important work. I am one of those most wanting to listen to the arguments being put forward for the achievement of multicultural broadcasting. I support this unanimous finding of the Committee. Nevertheless, I also recognise the very considerable arguments that have been put by the Government, by government departments and by the Special Broadcasting Service in relation to the interim arrangements. I am careful to point out to the Senate that in the conclusions and recommendations brought down some stress is placed upon interim arrangements and that the findings of the Committee, so clearly set forth by the  Chairman,  are essentially giving time so that a sounder provision for multicultural broadcasting will eventuate, a provision that will be cohesive with other broadcasting services in this country. Nevertheless I, as a member of that Committee, urge upon the Senate and upon the Government that the interim arrangements be as fully implemented as was originally envisaged, that a fifth channel be set up for those interim arrangements and that 35 hours of broadcasting be put together in the best possible fashion as a package that can give a very real trial to multicultural television in this interim period. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>At the end of the interim period much more evidence will be available to allow bipartisan support in this Parliament and cohesive support throughout the Australian community for the arrangements that I hope will then be concluded and gain the unanimous support not only of our Senate Committee but also of the whole of the </para>
          <para class="block">Senate and the whole of the country. I, as a senator involved in this inquiry, will show the greatest interest in the interim arrangements being fully developed under the SBS legislation for a full trial of multicultural broadcasting. When the Dix Committee report is before this Parliament I believe we will have the opportunity of seeing the evidence we have laid out in this Committee&#39;s findings become cohesively integrated with the Dix Committee report. I have great pleasure in supporting the speech made by the Committee  Chairman. </para>

            <para>- by leave- I think that one of the last things <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> could be accused of is dropping bombshells in the Senate. But I think it would be fair to say that tonight he has dropped a bombshell. I have great respect for every member of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. I am very impressed that it has been unanimous in its recommendations. On behalf of my party I express grave misgivings, without having read the report and without having sifted the evidence as the Committe has done, about two of its recommendations. The first one is so final and so categoric. It states: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>That the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill 1980 in so far as it relates to the Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting Corporation be not further proceeded with. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is a very final air about that sort of recommendation. If adopted it would not only break an undertaking by the Government but also have vast repercussions thoughout the ethnic communities. I will read the Committee&#39;s reasons for reaching that recommendation with great interest before agreeing to it. If I have grave misgivings about that recommendation I have even graver misgivings about the leaning of the Committee towards the Australian Broadcasting Commission&#39;s conducting a service for the ethnic communities. For the last five or seven years it has shown a singular disinterest in the activities and the problems of the ethnic communities. Now, when an interim multicultural Bill is being proposed, the ABC has suddenly become aware of and awakened to its responsibilities towards the ethnic communities. I will need to be persuaded beyond any shadow of doubt that, firstly, the ABC is capable of doing it and, secondly, that it has a genuine interest in doing it. If we are to be asked to believe that the Special Broadcasting Service has any better track record than the ABC in this area, I would like persuasive evidence on that too. </para>

            <para>- Tonight we are witnessing one of the most unusual events that has ever happened in the Senate. We just witnessed the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> moving a motion to suspend Standing Orders to permit him to introduce the 1980-81 Budget. On looking at today&#39;s Notice Paper I am reminded of events which took place just 1 2 months ago when the same Leader of the Government in the Senate moved in this House a similar motion to permit him to introduce the 1979-80 Budget. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I do not know whether you are aware of the fact that the 1979-80 Budget still appears on today&#39;s Notice Paper for debate. I read that section of the Notice Paper to honourable senators - it appears under Orders of the Day No. 1 4: </para>

            <para>Budget Papers 1979-80: Adjourned debate <inline font-style="italic">(from 26</inline></para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A Government senator is to continue his speech on that Budget. Today I took time to do some research in the Records Office. I went back through the records for the past 10 years and found that not in the past 10 years had we witnessed a Leader of the Government moving in this place a motion to suspend Standing Orders to enable him to introduce a Budget while the previous Budget still appeared on the Notice Paper because debate on it had not concluded. I am wondering whether we will witness with this Budget the same situation as we witnessed with the previous Budget when the Government, in its indecent haste while debate on the Appropriation Bills in the autumn session was still proceeding, adjourned the Senate without allowing full debate on even the Appropriation Bills. </para>
          <para>On 16 May the Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> declared the Appropriation Bills urgent Bills, stifling debate on them. Then on 20 May the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> declared a whole host of Bills urgent Bills. Senators, who are elected to represent the States, were prevented from raising issues of vital importance to the people who elected them. What I am concerned about is whether we will be faced with that situation in respect of this Budget, whether in two or three weeks the Government will declare the Appropriation Bills of this Budget urgent Bills and stifle debate on them. If that happens we will go into an election without the electors of this nation knowing full well what the thoughts of the Opposition are on the measures contained in this Budget. I raise this matter to point out how slipshod this Government is, not only in running this Senate but also in running the country. I sincerely hope that the electors of this nation will take great account of these matters when they go to the polls this year and that when we come back to this Parliament we of the Opposition will be sitting on the Government side of the chamber and senators opposite will be sitting on this side of the chamber. </para>

          <para>It will only be so if we continue those policies which in five years have brought Australia from a country clearly living beyond its means to where, this year - for the first time for seven years- we can achieve a domestic Budget surplus. </para>

          <para>There must be no relaxation of that effort. </para>

          <para>As foreshadowed in last year&#39;s Budget, 1979-80 proved difficult for the world economy. </para>
          <para>That Budget was designed to equip Australia to succeed in a world environment of rising inflation and intensifying competition. </para>
          <para>That objective was achieved. </para>
          <para>Over the year to June 1980, Australia&#39;s inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 10.7 per cent - about three percentage points below the average of OECD countries. </para>
          <para>Last year, exports grew by almost 1 5 per cent in real terms. </para>
          <para>For the first time since 1972-73 private external transactions produced a substantial surplus. </para>
          <para>Overall, growth was 2.2 per cent reflecting stronger non-farm growth of 3.1 per cent partly offset by some fall in farm product from the very high level of the previous year. </para>
          <para>Whilst business fixed investment declined with the phasing down of the investment allowance, it rose in the second half of the year. </para>
          <para>Business profits increased strongly last year, but there is a need for further improvement to support increased investment and employment. </para>
          <para>Private dwelling investment was strong throughout the year and recorded a real increase of over 1 0 per cent. </para>
          <para>Although personal consumption expenditure was relatively subdued there was an encouraging lift in the second half of the year. </para>
          <para>Greater non-farm growth was reflected in a strong rise in total employment of 2.4 per cent in 1979-80- the largest since 1973-74. </para>
          <para>Unfortunately this was not enough to reduce unemployment, which in June 1980 was roughly the same as a year earlier. </para>
          <para>Unless there is a moderation in wage demands and fewer industrial disputes it will be difficult to achieve a sustained reduction in unemployment. </para>
          <para>The spread of work value claims and settlements - many on quite spurious grounds - together with other excuses for higher wages, such as the campaign for a 35 hour week, are utterly inconsistent with achieving a lasting reduction in unemployment. </para>
          <para>The resultant growth in average weekly earnings over the course of 1 979-80, of almost 1 2 per cent, is a clear indication that the task of restoring wage and price stability is far from over. </para>
		  <para>OIL PRICING AND THE CRUDE OIL LEVY</para>
		  <para>One of the most important economic decisions taken by this Government has been the move in 1978 to import parity pricing for our crude oil. </para>
		  <para>The objectives of that decision are being achieved. </para>
		  <para>Reflecting the need to pay market prices for a scarce resource, this policy has greatly strengthened Australia&#39;s capacity to withstand world energy problems. </para>
		  <para>Consumption of major petroleum products fell by 1 <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> per cent last year. </para>
		  <para>Energy exploration has accelerated. </para>
		  <para>Alternative energy sources have become more economic. </para>
		  <para>Projects like Rundle Shale Oil, which might involve the largest resource investment in Australia&#39;s history, could not have been realistically contemplated without our crude oil pricing policy. </para>
		  <para>The crude oil levy enables the Government to distribute to the community generally a share of the proceeds of crude oil price rises. </para>
		  <para>The levy revenue has been used sensibly and to the benefit of the whole community. </para>
		  <para>Without it the deficit would not have been reduced so quickly nor, for example, would the personal income tax cuts which took effect on 1 July last have been possible. </para>
		  <para>It is also assisting us to provide additional funds for defence. </para>
		  <para>THE BUDGET OUTCOME</para>
		  <para>The Budget outcome for 1 979-80 was very close to projections. </para>
		  <para>Outlays were virtually the same as budgeted and reflected a slight reduction in real terms. </para>
		  <para>Overall receipts were largely as predicted except for the additional crude oil levy revenue which amounted to $204m. </para>
		  <para>The additional revenue was used to reduce the Budget deficit further. </para>
		  <para>Thus the deficit was ultimately $160m lower than originally estimated and $1 ,444m less than in the previous year - the largest ever reduction in a single year. </para>
		  <para>This greatly eased pressures which would otherwise have been reflected in higher interest rates. </para>
		  <para>THE SHAPE OF THE BUDGET</para>
		  <para>This year&#39;s Budget again places prime importance on the fight against inflation. </para>
		  <para>Lower inflation remains fundamental to greater private sector growth and to international competitiveness. </para>
		  <para>Therefore, there will be a further sizable reduction in the Budget deficit. </para>
		  <para>This will be achieved despite the need for a faster rate of increase in outlays this year. </para>
		  <para>OUTLAYS</para>
		  <para>In 1980-81 outlays are projected to be $36,037m, an increase of 13.7 per cent on 1979-80. This represents a growth of just under three per cent in real terms in 1 980-81 , and an average annual growth of about one per cent in real terms over the five years to 1 980-8 1 . </para>
		  <para>As a proportion of Gross Domestic Product outlays this year are expected to be 27.9 per cent compared to 30.1 percent in 1975-76. </para>
		  <para>In summary, the Government&#39;s decisions on outlays provide for much greater spending on defence, higher levels of support to areas of particular social need, increased payments to local government, and growing expenditures in areas of assistance to industry. </para>
		  <para>At the same time we have observed the continuing need to contain spending within a responsible overall economic package. </para>
		  <para>I now turn to the main expenditure provisions of the Budget. </para>
		  <para>More details are provided in accompanying Budget documents, particularly Statement No. 3 attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech. </para>
		  <para>DEFENCE</para>
		  <para>This Budget gives a high priority to the strengthening of our national security. </para>
		  <para>The $3,54 lm which we are providing for defence is $533m more than last year. This is an increase of 1 7.7 per cent in current prices, no less than 7 per cent in real terms. </para>
		  <para>The changed strategic circumstances in which Australia now finds herself require a much greater commitment to defence spending. </para>
		  <para>This is a priority which the Government believes commands the support of the vast majority of Australians. </para>
		  <para>Further large increases in later Budgets will be necessary, up to an expected 3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product for defence spending by 1984-85, to accomplish the improvements to defence capabilities announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year. </para>
		  <para>SOCIAL WELFARE</para>
		  <para>Total spending on social security and welfare in 1980-81 is estimated to be $9890m, a rise of 12.4 per cent over 1979-80. </para>
		  <para>It will account for over 27 per cent of all Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1 980-8 1 . </para>
		  <para>The size of present social welfare programs, their momentum and the need to achieve a responsible overall Budget outcome mean that little room exits for new initiatives or increases in those benefits which are not the subject of automatic adjustment. </para>
		  <para>The Government has decided that such additional funds as can be made available for social welfare without prejudicing the overall Budget outcome should be directed to those who need assistance most. </para>
		  <para>Indexation of Pensions and Benefits</para>
		  <para>The rates of relevant pensions and benefits will continue to be adjusted each November and May in accordance with the relevant movements in the Consumer Price Index. </para>
          <para>In November, for example, the standard or single rate of social service pensions will rise by $3.05 to $ 64.10 a week, and the combined married rate will increase by $5. 1 0 to $ 1 06.80 a week. </para>
          <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Children with Special Needs</inline>
        </para>
          <para>The Budget increases rates of assistance for children in situations of special need from the first relevant payday in November. </para>
          <para>The handicapped child&#39;s allowance will be increased by $8 to $73 a month, providing improved assistance in respect of an average of 26,000 handicapped children in 1980-81. The double orphan&#39;s pension will also be increased by $8, bringing it to $55.70 a month. This will provide additional assistance to families caring for orphans. </para>
          <para>Additional pension or benefit payable to eligible persons with dependent children will be increased by $2.50 to $10 a week for each child; on average 560,000 children are involved. Single pensioners with children and supporting parent beneficiaries will receive further increases in rates of assistance - the mother&#39;s /guardian&#39;s allowance will be increased by $2 a week. The new rate will be $8 a week where one child is aged under 6 or invalid and $6 a week in other cases. On average, 190,000 single parent families will benefit. </para>
          <para>The cost of these measures is estimated at about $63m in the current year and $97m in a full year. </para>
		  <para>Sickness Beneficiaries</para>
          <para>We have decided that fringe benefits will be extended to sickness beneficiaries in appropriate cases. Details will be announced by the Minister for Social Security. </para>
          <para>This is in recognition of the additional costs faced by many people who are temporarily unable to work because of sickness. </para>
		  <para>Assistance to Supporting Parents</para>
		  <para>The Government has decided to remove the six-month waiting period for supporting parent&#39;s benefit. This means that Commonwealth assistance will be available at uniform rates to all sole parents who meet the income test and other eligibility conditions. The States Grants (Deserted Wives) Act will be repealed. </para>
		  <para>Unemployment and Sickness Benefits</para>
          <para>The Government has decided to relax the income test on eligibility for unemployment and sickness benefits. </para>
          <para>This has been done to give greater encouragement to those out of work to undertake temporary part-time or casual work. </para>
          <para>At present, people who receive more than small amounts of private income have their unemployment or sickness benefits reduced dollar for dollar. </para>
          <para>Such a situation provides no real incentive for those receiving these benefits to seek temporary part-time or casual work. </para>
          <para>In its concern to remove this disincentive, the Government considered a number of options, including a simple increase in the allowable income threshold. </para>
          <para>It rejected this course in favour of one permitting recipents to undertake a more substantial amount of temporary part-time or casual work without losing the whole of each dollar earned. </para>
          <para>We have accordingly decided that from the first benefit payday in November 1980 the benefits will be withdrawn only on a 50 per cent basis for private income within the following ranges. $3 to $40 a week for single persons aged 16 and 1 7 years with a parent living in Australia; and $6 to $50 a week in all other cases. </para>
          <para>An unemployment benefit recipient over 21 years of age who earns $50 a week from casual work would currently have the benefit reduced by $44 a week. </para>
          <para>Under the new proposal the benefit would be reduced by only half this amount providing an extra $22 a week. </para>
          <para>Benefits will continue to be withdrawn on a dollar for dollar basis for all private income in excess of the upper limits of $40 and $50 a week respectively. </para>
          <para>It has also been decided to increase by $2 a week from the first benefit payday in November the non-indexed rate of unemployment benefit payable to beneficiaries who are 1 8 years and over and who have no dependants. </para>
          <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Assistance to the Handicapped</inline>
        </para>
          <para>Over the past five years, this Government has provided generous support for programs to assist the mentally and physically handicapped. </para>
          <para>Again, in 1980-81, in addition to increasing the Handicapped Child&#39;s Allowance we have - provided $1 lm in the first year of a three year program for the establishment of new services for handicapped children and adults; provided $300,000 to upgrade the quality and effectiveness of existing services for the handicapped; and decided to establish additional facilities within the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service network. </para>
          <para>Funds will be provided for administration and planning for the International Year of Disabled Persons and for a number of other new programs for the handicapped and disabled. </para>
          <para>Full details will be announced by the Minister for Social Security. </para>
		  <para>Assistance to Veterans</para>
		  <para>The Budget provides for two measures of particular importance to veterans as well as increases in a range of supplementary repatriation benefits, and for certain extensions of eligibility for free repatriation medical treatment, with effect from November. </para>
		  <para>The Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs will be announcing details in a separate statement. </para>
          <para>The Government has decided that, from 1 January 1981, only half of any disability pension will be taken into account in determining eligibility for a Pensioner Health Benefits Card. </para>
          <para>The Government has also decided that the maximum loan available through the Defence Service Homes Scheme will be increased from the present $ 1 5,000 to $25,000. </para>
          <para>The additional $10,000 will carry a concessional interest rate of 10 per cent. </para>
          <para>The estimated cost of this measure is $25m in 1980-81 rising to $59m in 1981-82. </para>
          <para>The waiting period for a loan under the scheme will be reduced to 10 months, at an additional estimated cost of $ 1 9m in 1980-8 1 . </para>
          <para>The cost of all the other measures is estimated to be $3.9m in 1 980-8 1 and $6.3m in a full year. </para>
		  <para>Other Welfare Measures</para>
          <para>Further welfare measures in the Budget include: an increase in the rate of accommodation subsidy paid to services assisting the homeless, by 45c to $ 1 .20 per person a day; an increase of 1 5 cents in the rate of meal subsidy for non-resident homeless persons and in the rate of delivered meals subsidy; and the provision of the same pensions and benefits to inmates of mental hospitals as are already provided to inmates of other institutions. </para>
		  <para>HEALTH</para>
		  <para>Total expenditure on health services in 1980-81 is estimated to be $3,644m which is $475m more than last year. </para>
		  <para>Hospitals</para>
          <para>For States and Territories hospitals, provision is made for Commonwealth expenditure of an estimated $ 1 ,3 1 6m in 1 980-8 1 , to allow services to be maintained at their existing levels. </para>
		  <para>Pharmaceutical Benefits</para>
		  <para>Pending final decisions on the Ralph Inquiry into the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Industry, the Government has decided to grant pharmaceutical manufacturers an across-the-board increase in Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme drug prices of 20c per prescribed item, at price to chemist level, effective from 1 November 1980. </para>
          <para>This increase in drug prices under the Scheme will not result in a rise in the cost of pharmaceutical benefits to patients. </para>
          <para>The estimated additional cost is $9. 5m in 1 980-8 1 and $ 1 9m in a full year. </para>
		  <para>Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefits</para>
          <para>The domiciliary nursing care benefit, provided to assist with the cost of home nursing care for relatives who are 16 years or over, will be increased from $2 a day to $3 a day with effect from 4 September 1980, at an additional cost of $4.7m in 1980-81 and $5.5m in a full year. </para>
		  <para>EDUCATION</para>
		  <para>Details of funding of the Tertiary Education and Schools Commissions programs in 1981 have already been announced. </para>
          <para>In recent years there have been real increases in funding for schools in Australia. </para>
          <para>All Government school systems have now reached, or passed, the resource use targets set by the Karmel Committee. </para>
          <para>There is increased questioning and indeed concern about the extent to which many young people leaving school are equipped to enter the workforce. </para>
          <para>For its part the Government has undertaken an imaginative program to facilitate the transition from school to work. </para>
          <para>The Government will continue the higher priority given in recent years to technical and further education programs. </para>
          <para>To cater for expected growth in enrolments in 1981 general recurrent grants to this sector are to rise by 4 per cent in real terms and the momentum of last year&#39;s substantial increase in capital work will be maintained. </para>
          <para>The Schools Commission programs will also provide added support to migrant education and to the least well endowed non-Government schools. </para>
		  <para>Student Assistance</para>
          <para>Eligibility for student assistance benefits is to be expanded, and the rates of benefits are to be increased. </para>
          <para>There will be a 1 0 per cent increase in tertiary education allowances and adult secondary education allowances. </para>
          <para>To provide further help on a needs basis to students wishing to remain longer at school, there will be a 20 per cent increase in both the allowances and the means test limits under the Secondary Allowances Scheme. </para>
          <para>Assistance under the Isolated Children Scheme will be extended and the level of allowances increased. </para>
          <para>In all, these changes are estimated to cost $19m in 1980-81 and $38m in a full year. </para>
          <para>Full details will be announced by the Minister for Education. </para>
		  <para>MANPOWER TRAINING</para>
          <para>Effective manpower training is crucial to the employment prospects of the workforce. </para>
          <para>More than 430,000 Australians have been assisted by our training programs over the last four years, including some 170,000 in 1979-80. </para>
          <para>The Government will provide $126m in 1980-81 for training programs, $23m more than was spent in 1979-80. </para>
          <para>The provision for the CRAFT Scheme totals $56m and the National Employment and Training System and other forms of training and retraining assistance are expected to cost $68m this year. </para>
          <para>The funds provided in this Budget are expected to cover all those eligible for training in 1 980-8 1 . </para>
          <para>The Government has also committed up to $150m for school to work transition programs over the five years starting in 1 980. </para>
          <para>This Budget provides $34m in 1980-81 for this purpose, with the States being asked to contribute matching amounts up to $9. 9m for the 1981 calendar year. </para>
		  <para>ABORIGINAL ASSISTANCE</para>
		  <para>The Budget provides $138m for special assistance to Aboriginals, $1 5m more than in 1979-80. </para>
          <para>The establishment of the Aboriginal Development Commission, which is to be provided with $23. 8m in 1980-81 , is a major initiative. </para>
          <para>Of the total provision for the Commission, $10m will form an accumulating capital investment fund. </para>
		  <para>HOUSING</para>
          <para>As announced previously, the Commonwealth will provide $285m to the States and the Northern Territory for welfare housing in 1 980-8 1 . </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth has also offered to guarantee to provide a base level of $ 1 ,000m over the five years from July 1981 to assist the States and the Northern Territory in the provision of welfare housing. </para>
          <para>Under this proposed arrangement, additional funds would be allocated each year as part of the normal budgetary process. </para>
          <para>The value limits for the Homes Savings Grants Scheme will be increased substantially. At present, a full grant is paid on house and land valued at up to $35,000 with pro-rata grants being then paid on house and land valued to $40,000. The value limits will be increased to $45,000 for a full grant, phasing out to a nil grant for house and land exceeding $55,000, to persons who enter into contracts to buy or build homes on or after today. </para>
          <para>Private sector housing activity strengthened during 1979-80, aided by record lending by major housing lenders. </para>
          <para>The Government again desires a high priority for housing finance to be maintained consistent with overall monetary policy. </para>
		  <para>CULTURE AND RECREATION</para>
          <para>The Budget provides some $383m for cultural and recreational activities in 1 980-8 1 , an increase of over 19 per cent on last year. </para>
          <para>This includes $2 16m for the Australian Broadcasting Commission and associated activities, $28m more than in 1979-80. </para>
          <para>The Budget provides also for the first stage of the rehabilitation of the Radio Australia transmitter at Darwin and for broadcasting equipment for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. </para>
          <para>The Australia Council is to be provided with over $29m for assistance to the arts, and the National Gallery with $23m. </para>
          <para>An amount of $21m is provided in 1980-81 for the new Multi-cultural Television Service, which is planned to commence in October, and for ethnic radio services. </para>
		  <para>IMMIGRATION</para>
          <para>The migrant intake is expected to rise to 95,000 in 1980-81 compared with 82,000 last year. </para>
          <para>Provision is made for the entry of 30,000 people under the Assisted Migration Program, an increase of nearly 8,000 on the 1979-80 numbers. </para>
          <para>A total of $28m is allocated to continue the Adult Migrant Education Program. </para>
          <para>Altogether more than $25m is being provided for programs and services for migrants under the recommendations of the Galbally Report. </para>
	      <para>FOREIGN AID</para>
	      <para>The Budget contains a large provision for aid to developing countries. </para>
          <para>A total of $547m will be provided for foreign aid in 1980-81 which is $49m more than last year. </para>
          <para>Earlier this year, Australia assumed an increased commitment for the small countries of the South Pacific region and a new three year program of support commencing in 1980-81 was announced. </para>
          <para>We are continuing to provide generous support for the training of overseas students. Over 3,000 a year are directly assisted to study in Australia under the Aid Program, and some 8,000 more who study privately receive tuition either free or at less than a third of the estimated cost to the Government. </para>
		  <para>INDUSTRY PROGRAMS</para>
		  <para>Export Incentives</para>
          <para>The importance attached by the Government to encouraging exports, particularly manufactured exports, is demonstrated by the provision in this Budget of $260m for export expansion and market development grants - a rise of $45m or 21 percent over 1979-80. </para>
          <para>This will substantially reduce the carry-over of claims. </para>
          <para>These programs have greatly helped Australian manfacturers in securing and developing markets abroad. </para>
		  <para>Rural Assistance</para>
          <para>Existing measures supporting rural industry will continue. </para>
          <para>In particular, we will increase the Commonwealth contribution to wool promotion by $6m to $20m for 1980-81. </para>
          <para>The Nitrogenous Fertilizer Subsidy will be extended for a further year to the end of 1981 at a total cost of $5.5m. </para>
		  <para>Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme</para>
          <para>Rural industry and country consumers generally will continue to benefit from the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme on which there will be a total expenditure of approximately $123m in 1980-81. </para>
          <para>This is some $5 2m greater than last year; the increase results largely from the extension of the scheme last April which had the effect of halving the maximum freight differential between metropolitan and country areas. </para>
		  <para>Research and Development</para>
          <para>Expenditure on research and development is of long term significance to industry. </para>
          <para>Funding under the Industrial Research and Development Scheme will rise by $19m or over 55 percent in 1980-81. </para>
		  <para>TRANSPORT</para>
		  <para>Roads</para>
          <para>The Commonwealth has undertaken to provide the States and the Northern Territory with $3,650m in grants for roads over the next five years; $628m will be provided in 1980-81 which maintains the real level of our spending in this area. </para>
		  <para>Air Transport</para>
          <para>The Budget provides $64m in 1980-81 for buildings, works and equipment at airports, $41m more than expenditure last year. </para>
          <para>This includes work in line with our commitment to redevelop Brisbane airport by 1986 at a total cost of over $200m and to upgrade facilities at a number of other airports. </para>
          <para>High on the list of priorities are a new international terminal at Perth, planning for new civil aviation facilities at Darwin, the development of Norfolk Island airport to medium jet standard, airport facilities for the operation of wide-bodied domestic jets, upgrading of Townsville airport for international services, and new terminal buildings at Canberra and Coolangatta. </para>
          <para>The expected cost of all these additional facilities is some $ 145m. </para>
          <para>The Government has decided that international sector air navigation charges will remain unchanged in 1980-81. </para>
          <para>The Government has also decided that the target of full cost recovery in the domestic trunk airline sector should be achieved in 1980-81, a year earlier than previously announced. </para>
          <para>Despite this, it will now be necessary to seek an increase of only 15 per cent in air navigation charges for that sector in 1980-81 compared with the 25 per cent increase previously announced. </para>
          <para>The increase proposed will yield an additional $3min 1980-81. </para>
		  <para>ENERGY</para>
          <para>Budget funding for energy research is to rise by almost 50 per cent to $ 1 3.5m in 1 980-8 1 . </para>
          <para>A further $2. 5m will be provided for energy information and energy conservation programs. </para>
          <para>These expenditures supplement the very significant taxation incentives which have already been provided to encourage greater energy exploration and development and the use of energy sources other than oil. </para>
          <para>The total cost to revenue of those incentives in 1979-80 was at least $50m and this figure is expected to rise as industry takes increasing advantage of them. </para>
          <para>This year the Pipeline Authority will be starting construction of natural gas pipelines from Young to Wagga Wagga and from Dalton to Canberra. </para>
          <para>Studies will be undertaken on extending the natural gas pipeline from Wagga Wagga to Albury and on possible lines to Lithgow, Bathurst, Orange and Oberon. </para>
          <para>The expected cost of construction and studies in 1980-81 is$26m. </para>
          <para>The Pipeline Authority will fund such activities by borrowing from the private sector; interest on borrowings will be met from the Authority&#39;s revenue and from the Budget. </para>
		  <para>MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH</para>
      <para>This Budget provides a total of $ 18m for medical research which will be made available through the National Health and Medical Research Council. </para>
      <para>This represents an increase of approximately 30 per cent and demonstrates the desire of the Government to provide substantial and ongoing support for medical research. </para>
      <para>The Government recognises the high quality of medical research in Australia and wishes to build upon the past contributions of our researchers. </para>
      <para>Significantly more support will be given to marine science this year. Specific funding for this research will rise from $650,000 to $3. 5m and further resources will be provided for research activities in the Great Barrier Reef area. </para>
      <para>In the next few years, up to $80m will be spent on the rebuilding and upgrading of Australia&#39;s Antarctic bases, the transfer of the CSIRO Division of Fisheries and Oceanography to Tasmania, and the acquisition of a $9m oceanographic ship for CSIRO and other national uses. </para>
      <para>In the field of conservation, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is to receive $6. 6m and funding for the Biological Resources Survey will more than double. </para>
	  <para>GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION</para>
      <para>The Government will maintain strict restraint on its own administrative costs. </para>
      <para>For 1980-81, provisional public service staff ceilings have been set to increase by less than 1 per cent and departments and authorities will again be required to live within the Budget allocation provided to them. </para>

      <para>Growth in State and Northern Territory taxsharing entitlements accounts for $665m, or more than half of this increase. </para>
      <para>In accordance with our 1977 election promise, local governments&#39; tax-sharing entitlements are now two per cent of personal income tax collections. </para>
      <para>They will be $302m in 1980-81, an increase of 36 per cent. </para>

	  <para>PERSONAL INCOME TAX</para>
      <para>The Government has already announced major changes in personal income tax which took effect from 1 July. </para>
      <para>The standard rate for 1980-81 is reduced to 32 per cent and the income ranges in the scale have been indexed by 3.8 per cent so that the tax-free threshold is now $4,041 . </para>
      <para>Dependant rebates have been increased by 34 per cent, with the rebate for a dependent spouse rising to $800 and that for a sole parent to $559. </para>
      <para>These changes have an estimated revenue cost of $636m in 1980-81. </para>
      <para>In recent years a loading has been added to normal rates in calculating the provisional tax payment of taxpayers who do not self-assess, in order to achieve reasonable comparability in the treatment of PA YE and all provisional taxpayers. </para>
      <para>In 1980-81 this objective is to be achieved by applying the 1980-81 rate scale to 1979-80 incomes increased by a factor of 7i per cent and allowing dependant rebates at 1980-81 values. </para>
      <para>Provisional taxpayers will of course continue to have the option to self-assess and provide an estimate of their 1980-81 incomes. </para>
      <para>Where this option is exercised the new rates and rebates will apply to estimated 1980-81 incomes. </para>
      <para class="italic">
        <inline font-style="italic">Superannuation Arrangements for Self-employed Persons and Unsupported Employees</inline>
      </para>
      <para>The Government has decided to provide a significant new incentive through the taxation system to encourage self-employed persons and employees not covered by employer-sponsored arrangements to make greater provision for their retirement. </para>
      <para>At present contributions by an individual for superannuation purposes are included in rebatable expenditure, within a limit of $1 ,200 for the sum of life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions. </para>
      <para>This limit applies whether the contribution is by an employee contributing to an employersupported fund, an employee who is not supported by an employer-sponsored scheme but makes his own arrangements to contribute to a public superannuation fund, or a self-employed person. </para>
      <para>However, whereas employee members of an employer-supported fund also have the advantage of employer contributions on their behalf, and are not taxed on those amounts, there is no corresponding benefit for self-employed persons or employees who are not supported by an employersponsored scheme. </para>
      <para>The Government has therefore decided to extend to such people, where no other contributions are made on their behalf, a taxation benefit broadly comparable to the &#39;matching employer&#39; contribution of supported employees. </para>
      <para>We have decided that contributions - up to a limit of $1,200 per annum - made by self employed persons and employees after today to a qualifying fund to provide retirement benefits for themselves and their dependants will be deductible from their assessable income if the person is not covered by employer-sponsored arrangements. </para>
      <para>Contributions in excess of $1,200 will remain rebatable expenditure, up to the present limit of $1,200 for life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions applicable to all taxpayers. </para>
      <para>At the same time, 5 per cent of lump sums received by self-employed persons and unsupported employees after today from qualifying superannuation funds will count as assessable income, to the extent that those sums are derived from contributions made after today and from earnings of the fund from the investment of those contributions. </para>
      <para>This will result in that part of the lump sums being taxed to the same extent as lump sums received on retirement by supported employees. </para>
      <para>That part of the lump sums derived from earlier contributions, and the earnings on their investment, will remain tax free. </para>
      <para>On the basis of assumptions about the likely response rate to such a measure, the full year cost is estimated at about $100m. </para>
	  <para>Taxation of Australians Working Overseas</para>
        <para>We have decided to amend the law to provide some relief from Australian tax on certain foreign source income which Australian residents earn from their personal services overseas where that income is not taxed in the source country. Details are provided in Statement No. 4. </para>
        <para>This measure is intended to enhance the ability of Australian consultants to obtain a greater share of the growing overseas consultancy services market. It will apply to income from services performed overseas on projects approved and entered into after today and is estimated to cost about $2m in a full year. </para>
		<para>Deductibility of Gifts</para>
        <para>We have decided to permit tax deductibility of gifts made to certain educational institutions and voluntary overseas aid organisations. </para>
        <para>Gifts made after tonight to certified technical and further education institutions will be tax deductible where those gifts are for approved purposes. </para>
        <para>In addition to the substantial outlays made direct from the Budget for overseas aid purposes, the Government permitted tax deductions in respect of donations made in 1 979-80 to the Kampuchea and East Timor appeals. </para>
        <para>In recognition of the work performed by many of the voluntary bodies involved in the provision of overseas aid the Government has decided in principle to allow taxation deductions for gifts made to eligible non-government organisations extending assistance to approved programs and organisations in developing countries. </para>
        <para>Eligible organisations will be determined by the Treasurer after consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who will be consulting relevant bodies including the Australian Council for Overseas Aid. </para>
        <para class="block">Inquiry into Zone Allowances </para>
        <para>Income tax zone allowances for taxpayers living in remote localities were introduced in 1 945. </para>
        <para>While the supplementary component of those allowances has since been adjusted to reflect increases in dependants&#39; allowances, the basic allowance has remained largely unchanged since 1958. </para>
        <para>In the meanwhile, of course, circumstances have changed. </para>
        <para>Against this background we have decided to establish a public inquiry to examine in detail the cost and other disabilities of living in remote areas and to make recommendations on possible changes to the present system of zone allowances. </para>
        <para>I shall announce the terms of reference and composition of the inquiry as soon as practicable with a view to it reporting prior to next year&#39;s Budget. </para>
		<para>BRUCELLOSIS AND TUBERCULOSIS IN CATTLE</para>
      <para>We shall amend the income tax law in certain respects to encourage further progress in eradicating brucellosis and tuberculosis in cattle. </para>
      <para>In particular, for cattle properties certified as subject to those diseases and where herd control is difficult, expenditure by 30 June 1984 on internal fences and stockyards contracted for while a certificate is in force will be deductible in full in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. </para>
	  <para>ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT</para>
      <para>There have been many suggestions in recent years that the present depreciation provisions do not provide a sufficiently fast rate of write-off for new plant during periods of rapid technological change. </para>
      <para>We have therefore decided to apply a 20 per cent loading to existing depreciation rates; for example, an existing rate of 15 per cent will become 1 8 per cent and so on. </para>
      <para>These new arrangements will apply to new and second-hand plant ordered after today, with the exceptions of motor vehicles of the type now excluded from the investment allowance and plant for which statutory concessional rates are already available. </para>
      <para>There is, by definition, no objective way of adjusting depreciation rates for obsolescence occasioned by unpredictable technological change. </para>
      <para>The proposed loading does, however, represent a significant aid to businesses confronted with that problem and will encourage updating of plant and equipment. </para>
      <para>The cost of this measure will rise over a transitional period, from an estimated $60m in 1981-82 to more than $250m per annum in the mid-1980s. </para>
	  <para>DIVESTMENT OF ASSETS</para>
	  <para>The sale of the Commonwealth interest in the Ranger joint venture is expected to be finalised this year, yielding $ 147m. </para>
      <para>Negotiations are proceeding for the disposal of the Government&#39;s interest in the Ngalia Basin exploration venture and the Fawnmac group of pharmaceutical companies. </para>
	  <para>RECEIPTS IN SUMMARY</para>
      <para>This year taxation receipts will rise by 1 6.4 per cent. </para>
      <para>In particular, company tax receipts and crude oil levy collections will rise at a relatively high rate. </para>
      <para>The increase in company tax receipts reflects greater company profitability, the phasing down of the investment allowance in 1979 and last year&#39;s decision to withdraw the trading stock valuation adjustment. </para>
      <para>Crude oil levy collections will be higher mainly on account of the full year effects of the rises in the price of oil which occurred last year. </para>
      <para>Personal taxation reductions for the year have been in place since 1 July. The Budget provides some tax relief for businesses. There are also some particular areas where taxation incentives have been provided. </para>
      <para>Given the expenditure priorities I described earlier, further general taxation concessions could only have been given at the cost of forgoing the major reduction in the Budget deficit. </para>
      <para>In our view the anti-inflationary objectives of this Budget, and therefore the long term economic interests of Australia, will best be served by the reduction we have achieved in the Budget deficit. </para>
	  <para>BUDGET OVERVIEW</para>
      <para>Total outlays in 1980-81 are estimated to increase by 1 3.7 per cent to $36,037m. </para>
      <para>Total receipts, allowing for the cost of the measures I have outlined and of those previously announced, are estimated to increase by 16.2 per cent to $34,47 lm. </para>
      <para>The overall Budget deficit is therefore estimated at $ 1,566m, a reduction of $468m on the outcome for 1979-80. </para>
      <para>When allowance is made for transactions abroad, there will be an estimated Budget domestic surplus of $39m - the first such surplus since 1973-74. </para>
      <para>Such an outcome will represent further substantial progress along the road to fiscal responsibility and monetary stability. </para>
	  <para>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</para>
      <para>The aim of this Budget is to maintain and develop a climate in which Australia&#39;s high potential for growth in the 1 980s can be realised. </para>
      <para>We also wish to see that development proceeds at a pace which is sustainable and that it provides benefits for all Australians. </para>
      <para>Inflation and other economic difficulties which developed some years ago, though now reduced, threaten our growth potential. </para>
      <para>For example, if the recent pattern of wage determinations continues in 1980-81, average weekly earnings would be likely to rise by around 1 2 per cent compared with 9i per cent in 1979-80. </para>
      <para>Particularly at a time when overseas rates of inflation are showing signs of moderating, there is a real danger in this acceleration. </para>
      <para>On the basis of the fiscal and monetary policies set forth in the Budget the rate of increase in the CPI over the year to June 1981 is likely to be around 10 per cent. </para>
      <para>For 1980-81 the present outlook for the nonfarm sector of the Australian economy is for a somewhat faster rate of expansion than last year - 3+ per cent or more compared with a little over 3 per cent last year. </para>
      <para>After allowance for the likely small reduction in farm products, overall growth could be 3 per cent or more, compared with the estimated 2.2 per cent last year. </para>
      <para>This compares with the most recent <inline font-style="italic">OECD Outlook</inline> forecast of no real growth in aggregate in member countries. </para>
      <para>Although the Australian economy and in particular our exports will be affected by slower economic growth overseas, the impact will be lessened by our better inflation performance and the nature and destination of our exports. </para>
      <para>For example, over 50 per cent of our exports go to Asian and Middle Eastern countries which are among those less affected by the slowdown in world economic growth. </para>
      <para>The current account deficit will nevertheless be considerably higher in 1980-81, perhaps about double last year&#39;s abnormally low outcome of about $ 1,200m. </para>
      <para>Against this, a much larger inflow of private capital is likely, leaving the overall balance of payments satisfactory, and a surplus on private external transactions of up to $ 1 ,500m. </para>
      <para>Internally generated demand is expected to more than offset adverse international developments. </para>
      <para>In particular, business fixed investment is set to show a real increase in 1980-81 of over 10 per cent. </para>
      <para>The extent of the increase will be critically influenced by the availability of adequate supplies of labour and materials. </para>
      <para>Dwelling investment should remain high in 1980-81, although growth is likely to be slower than last year. </para>
      <para>The strengthening in private consumption expenditure during the course of last year should continue in 1980-81, reflecting further steady growth in employment of about 1 i per cent and stronger growth in real disposable income. </para>
      <para>Overall, the outlook for 1980-81 is for strong expansion in activity led by private sector demand. </para>
      <para>The Government believes this stronger outlook for activity can be achieved with slower growth in the monetary aggregates than last year. </para>
      <para>The further reduction in the Budget deficit is seen as essential to achieving the Government&#39;s monetary goals. </para>
      <para>It will help to make room for financing the significant increase in corporate borrowing likely in 1980-81 as private investment expenditure rises. </para>
      <para>The Government will again seek to have the large wheat harvest in prospect financed in a manner which will minimise its impact on the monetary aggregates. </para>
      <para>Predicting the monetary outcome is always difficult because of the number and nature of the variables which underlie particular monetary aggregates, such as M3. </para>
      <para>Despite the much reduced Budget deficit in 1979-80, the growth in the money supply (M3) was 1 2.9 per cent against the projection of about 10 per cent. </para>
      <para>That outcome again illustrates the wide margins of error inherent in such projections. </para>
      <para>In any case, M3 is not a totally definitive measure of monetary growth. </para>
      <para>For example, building society deposits, which have experienced greater growth than bank deposits in recent years, are not included in the M3 measurement. </para>
      <para>For its part, the Government will continue to monitor a whole range of monetary aggregates. </para>
      <para>We nevertheless see merit in continuing the practice of recent years of specifying a range for M3. </para>
      <para>We shall be aiming for a lower growth in M3 this year than the outcome last year. </para>
      <para>On present economic assessments, an outcome for M3 of about 9-11 per cent over the year to June 1981 would be consistent with the requirements of the Government&#39;s economic policy and would in particular exert appropriate downward pressure on inflation. </para>
	  <para>CONCLUSION</para>
      <para>This Budget consolidates the economic gains of recent years. </para>
      <para>It strengthens our attack upon inflation through a major reduction in the deficit. </para>
      <para>It maximises our potential for economic growth and development. </para>
      <para>Within responsible expenditure limits, the Budget provides more for defence, areas of need and excellence and assistance to industry. </para>
      <para>It is a Budget which will further enhance the strength and competitiveness of the Australian economy. </para>
      <para>I commend the Budget to the Senate. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave - The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard),</inline> in his Budget Speech, mentioned the major improvements to the social security and welfare system that will result from the 1980-81 Budget. I would like to elaborate on his statement and provide the Senate with additional information. Despite the economic circumstances and the need for expenditure restraint, the Government has again accorded high priority to its welfare programs and, in these, has shown greatest concern for those most in need. Social security and welfare outlays are estimated to increase by almost $900m in 1980-81 to about $9.9 billion. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Over 27 per cent of Budget outlays have been allocated to social security and welfare. </para>
          <para>In the 1980-81 Budget, special priority has been given to improving support for children of pensioners and beneficiaries, for sole parents, the unemployed and the sick and disabled. We will extend and increase Commonwealth assistance for sole parents; increase meals-on-wheels subsidies and meals and accommodation subsidies for homeless people; increase rates of additional pension and benefit for children and mothers - guardians&#39; allowances; increase rates of handicapped children&#39;s allowances and double orphans&#39; pensions; substantially relax the income test for unemployment and sickness benefits; increase the rate of unemployment benefit for those 18 and over without dependants; extend eligibility for pensioner fringe benefits to sickness beneficiaries; extend eligibility for pensions and benefits to patients in mental hospitals; expand the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service; provide substantial funds for the first year of the new three year programs for facilities for aged and handicapped people; provide funds to assist the national response to the International Year of Disabled Persons; and increase rates of compensation for Commonwealth employees. </para>
		  <para>New Support for Sole Parents</para>
        <para>An important initiative of the Fraser Government has been the progressive rationalisation of assistance for sole parents. In 1977 the Government extended assistance to sole fathers on the same basis as assistance to supporting mothers by introducing supporting parents&#39; benefits. In 1979 the Government extended pensioner health benefits to supporting parent beneficiaries on the same basis as for Class A widow pensioners. As a result, rates of direct Commonwealth assistance for sole parents, including fringe benefits, were made uniform. </para>
        <para>During this session of Parliament, the Government will introduce legislation to remove the remaining major limitation on direct Commonwealth assistance for sole parents. The six months waiting period for supporting parent&#39;s benefit will be removed. As a result, those sole parents who currently must wait six months for Class A widow&#39;s pension or supporting parent&#39;s benefit will be able to receive Commonwealth supporting parent&#39;s benefit immediately. </para>
        <para>The existing provisions relating to Class A, B and C widows&#39; pensions will remain unchanged. The decision by several State governments to withdraw support for sole parents during the six months waiting period for Class A widow&#39;s pension or supporting parent&#39;s benefit has created considerable anxiety and uncertainty amongst recipients. The Commonwealth&#39;s action will remove that cause of concern. </para>
		<para>Increased Basic Rates of Payments</para>
        <para>Most basic rates of pensions and benefits are subject to automatic, twice-yearly indexation. As a result, the standard rate of pension and benefit will increase by $3.05 a week in November to $64.10 a week and the combined married rate by $5.10 a week to $106.80 a week. These rates will increase automatically again in May 1981 in line with the movement in the consumer price index between the June and December quarters of this year. </para>
        <para>The following basic rates of pensions and benefits are indexed: Income-tested age pensions; invalid pensions; wives&#39; pensions; widows&#39; pensions; supporting parents&#39; benefits; sheltered employment allowances; unemployment benefit for all people aged 18 or over with dependants and for married people aged 16 or 17 years; and sickness benefits for all people aged 1 8 or over and for married people aged 16 or 17 years. In addition, unemployment benefit for those 1 8 or over without dependants will be increased from November by $2 a week to $53.45 a week. Rates of unemployment and sickness benefits for single people aged 16 or 17 without dependants will remain at $36 a week. </para>
        <para>A fixed rate pension is payable to those aged 70 years and over free of income test. This provides additional pension income to people when they turn 70 if their entitlement had previously been less because of the income test. The rate of this income-test-free pension will remain at $51.45 a week for single people and $85.80 a week for married couples. With the concurrence of honourable senators, I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table which sets out the existing maximum rates of the basic pensions and benefits, together with the maximum rates that will apply from November 1980. </para>

        <para class="block">I now turn to increased payments for children of pensioners and beneficiaries. In addition to the increases in basic pensions and benefits, payments for the children of pensioners and beneficiaries are to be substantially increased. Additional pension or benefit for each child will be increased from November by $2.50 to $10 a week. Mothers&#39;/guardians&#39; allowances paid to single pensioners with children will be increased by $2 to $8 a week where there is at least one child under six or an invalid child, and to $6 a week in other cases. </para>
        <para>As a result of these increases in payments, supporting parent beneficiaries and widow pensioners in particular, and other pensioners and beneficiaries with children, will receive substantial increases in assistance from November. For example, a widow with three children, one of whom is under six years of age, will have her fortnightly pension cheque increased from $179.10 to $204.20- an increase of $25.10 a fortnight. She will, of course, continue also to receive her monthly family allowance payment of $62.90. </para>

		<para>Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Income Test</para>
        <para>The unemployment and sickness benefits income test is to be significantly liberalised. As a result, unemployment beneficiaries, for example, will be able substantially to supplement their benefits through casual work. Under current arrangements, the maximum rate of benefit is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis for any other income received above the &#39;free area&#39; of $3 a week for a single person aged under 21 with a parent living in Australia or $6 a week for all other people. From the first pay-day in November the free area&#39; of $6 a week will be extended to all beneficiaries aged 18 to 20 years and the income test which will be applied above the free areas will be liberalised in the following manner: For all single people aged 16 and 1 7 with a parent living in Australia, the maximum rate of benefit payable will be reduced by 50c for each dollar of income received in the range of $3 to $40 a week; the current reduction on a dollar for dollar basis will apply only to income above $40 a week; for all other beneficiaries, the maximum rate will be reduced by 50c for each dollar of income, including the income of a spouse, received in the range of $6 to $50 a week; the current reduction on a dollar for dollar basis will apply only to income above $50 a week. Let me illustrate the effect of this change. An unemployment beneficiary aged over 21 who earned $40 from casual employment would currently lose $34 in benefit. Under the new arrangement he will lose only $17 and will therefore have a total income of $76.45 a week, or $23 in excess of the maximum rate of benefit. The Government has also decided to exempt from the benefits income test pay and allowances received by Army, Navy and Air Force reservists. Such payments will also be excluded from the income tests on pensions payable under the Social Services Act. </para>
        <para>Meals on Wheels and Other Programs for the Aged </para>
        <para class="block">The Government will increase the assistance it provides to enable aged people to remain in their own homes as long as possible as well as for those elderly people who can no longer live in their own homes. Subsidies will be increased for meals provided by meals-on-wheels services. The existing subsidies of 30c for every meal which has an approved vitamin C supplement and 25c for every other meal will be increased to 45c and 40c respectively. Subsidies under the Homeless Persons Assistance Program will be increased in line with the increases in delivered meals subsidies. The food and accommodation subsidy will be increased from 75c to $1.20 per person per day, and the meal only subsidy will be increased from 25c to 40c for each meal provided to non-residents. </para>
        <para>Commonwealth expenditure on home care services for the aged will increase by 1 7 per cent to $ 12.1m in 1980-81. Subsidies are provided for housekeeping, home maintenance, gardening and other domiciliary services. The latest allocation represents a 1 1 3 per cent increase on the funding levels in 1975-76. In addition, $4m has been provided in 1980-81 for the first year of a new $12m 3-year program for construction of senior citizens centres. An amount of $52. 5m has been provided for the first year of a new $225m 3-year program for aged or disabled persons&#39; accommodation. To date over 400 priority projects have been approved for funding in the years 1980-81 and 1981-82. </para>
        <para class="block">Support for the Sick and Disabled </para>
        <para class="block">Assistance for the sick and disabled will be improved as a result of the 1980-81 Budget. The Government will extend eligibility for Commonwealth pensioner fringe benefits to sickness beneficiaries, subject to the normal fringe benefit income test. The discrimination that currently exists against certain mental hospital patients will be removed. From November 1 980, pensions and benefits will be available to these patients on the same basis as to other members of the community. Wives of mental hospital patients may then qualify for wives&#39; pensions or continue to receive their current entitlement to widows&#39; pensions. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service will be expanded. A new rehabilitation facility will be planned jointly with the New South Wales authorities for the Newcastle and Hunter Valley area and new services planned for the western suburbs of Melbourne, in co-operation with the Victorian authorities. Two new work preparation centres for mildly intellectually handicapped people will be established; one in Sydney and one in Melbourne. </para>
        <para>Some $51m has been allocated for 1980-81 for the first year of a new three-year program of assistance under the handicapped persons welfare program. Some $155m will be provided in total for this program over the next three years. Already about 200 new proposals have been approved for funding under this program. As a result, new sheltered workshops, activity therapy and training centres and residential accommodation will be provided for over 2000 disabled children and adults. Continuing strong support will also be provided for the maintenance of existing services. The Government&#39;s commitment to the disabled is demonstrated by the allocations in this year&#39;s Budget. Total spending on the disabled will be about $ 1,060m in 1980-81, 17.7 per cent more than in 1979-80 and 1 26 per cent more than in 1975-76. <para>International Year of Disabled Persons</para>
        <para>International Year of Disabled Persons, 1 98 1 , will provide an impetus to all sections of the Australian community to review attitudes and services to ensure that disabled people have greater access to community life. Emphasis will also be given to the prevention of disability. The disabled themselves are, and must continue to be, closely involved in all planning associated with the Year. An amount of $900,000 has been provided in 1980-81 for national publicity and community information and for costs associated with the establishment and servicing of a National Committee of Non-Government Organisations and other major national events and reports. Funds have also been provided in the Budget for new proposals of other Ministers that will substantially benefit disabled people. 1 will report at a later date on the overall Commonwealth Government&#39;s response to International Year of Disabled Persons. </para>
		<para>Children&#39;s Services</para>
        <para>In addition to the various cash payments for children, the Government provides, through its Children&#39;s Services Program, financial assistance to community organisations, local government bodies and the States for a range of services for children under 18 years and services to support their families. A block grant is also made to the States and the Northern Territory for pre-schools. An amount of $33.09m will be provided this year in the form of grants to the States and the Northern Territory for pre-schools. To assist with forward planning, these grants will, in the future, be made on a calendar year basis. A further $36. 1 3m has been allocated in 1980-81 for assistance for child care and other related services. Over recent years there have been significant changes in the overall pattern of grants made under the Children&#39;s Services Program and in the services assisted by the grants. Many of the projects approved early in the Program were large capital-intensive child care centres, which have now been completed. Emphasis in new approvals has now moved away from large centres to smaller neighbourhood centres and other projects which require only minor modifications to existing buildings. </para>
        <para>There has also been a considerable widening in the types of services available to disadvantaged children and their families. There are now clearly identified program components directed towards young handicapped children, Aboriginal children, isolated children, children of migrants and of working parents and also for homeless young people; support is also provided for the families of these children. This is evidenced by the fact that in 1 975-76 $ 1 7m was devoted to funding such services whereas, in 1980-81, over $36m will be allocated for them. </para>
        <para>Assistance for Research and Welfare Co-ordination </para>
        <para>During the past year, the independent Social Welfare Research Centre at the University of New South Wales came into operation. An amount of $410,000 has been provided in 1980-81 for the Centre&#39;s operation; $583,000 has been provided for the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat. Grants for social welfare co-ordinating organisations have been maintained. The Australian Council of Social Service, Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled and the Australian Council on the Ageing will receive grants of $160,000 in 1980-81 for activities associated with the co-ordination of services and the provision of advice to the Government. The Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled will also receive $469,500, the balance of the $500,000 grant towards the establishment of its national headquarters; in addition it will also receive assistance for its activities in connection with International Year of Disabled Persons. The Australian Pre- school Association will receive $50,000, together with an additional sum for co-ordinating the activities of Lady Gowrie Centres. </para>
		<para>Compensation Rates for Commonwealth Government Employees</para>
        <para>Rates of workers&#39; compensation payable to Commonwealth employees will be increased, from 1 September 1980, by about 16.5 per cent.

          <motion>
            <para>That the Senate take note of the statement. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">In speaking briefly to the motion - that is all one can do in the circumstances in which documents are presented on Budget night in this place, not having had sufficient time to go through the Budget in any detail- I would like to do as honourable senators usually do, and that is to bring a different perspective to the statement and to bring things back into perspective generally. </para>
          <para>On the figures given by the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle)</inline> and given by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> in the Budget Speech, social welfare and social security expenditure this year increases by 10.7 per cent. This figure happens to be the exact estimate of the Treasurer for this coming year&#39;s inflation rate. So on the Minister&#39;s and the Treasurer&#39;s own figures, expenditure on social security and social welfare this year will be merely holding the line in real terms. There will be no increase in expenditure. If, as has happened in the past and as most people expect will happen in the future, the inflation rate in fact exceeds the inflation rate predicted by the Treasurer, social security expenditure will fall in the coming year. </para>
          <para>There are selective increases in expenditure, particularly to children of pensioners and beneficiaries, to some single parents and to handicapped children. The single unemployed person will get a small increase in benefit. I point out that all of these increases fall far short of the level needed to compensate such people for inflationary increases in the last few years. Of course, if we are increasing expenditure in these sorts of areas, we must be decreasing expenditure in other areas of social security. One will find, on going through the Budget Papers, that the decrease in real expenditure occurs particularly in the fields of the aged, aged persons accommodation and services generally. </para>
          <para>To demonstrate what I mean about the failure of the Government to increase expenditure on benefits, particularly those paid to children, about which it claims great advances in both the Minister&#39;s statement and in the Budget speeches, I would like to point out just what has happened to these payments in past years and what will happen to them under this Budget. For instance, the allowance for pensioners&#39; children which at the moment is $7.50 a week has not been increased since November 1975. In that time the consumer price index has increased by 55.7 per cent. There has been an erosion of this benefit in real terms since last time the payment was increased of some $4.18 a week. That is a considerable amount of money to people with children dependant on fixed pension incomes. The increase will be 33 per cent, or $2.50 a week, so that these people still will be well behind the eight ball as far as the inflationary effects of this payment are concerned. </para>
          <para>Similarly, the handicapped children&#39;s allowance was last increased in November 1976. The erosion of that benefit has been $23.40 a month. It is to be increased by $8 a month. These people in fact have fallen behind the inflationary increases that have occurred. Even the daily subsidy per person for meals on wheels is some 6c less than would have been compensated for if the compensation had been one merely to keep up with inflationary costs. The same goes for homeless persons subsidies. The accommodation subsidy which has been eroded by 58c a day will be compensated by a payment of 45c a day. This sort of situation applies to all the benefits. Pensioners and beneficiaries with children have been given increases but those increases fall far short of the increased costs they have had to face due to inflation and increases in the consumer price index. If we add to that what has happened to family allowances we find that there is an even greater difference. That difference extends to low income earners with families, with children in this community, who will receive none of the benefits of the increases announced by the Minister for Social Security. </para>
          <para>When the family allowances were introduced in July 1976 we predicted what would happen. We predicted that, in fact, there would be. no regular increase, there would be no compensation for inflation and the Government would allow these benefits to erode. Since July 1976 the consumer price index - the inflation rate - has gone up by 47.4 per cent. For instance, a family with one child is now $ 1 .66 a week worse off. A family with four children is $9.72 a week worse off. lt receives no increase at all from this Budget. In fact, the pensioner with children, the beneficiary with, say, four children, is $9.72 a week down on family allowances and down by similar amounts on other benefits and has been only partially compensated by the increases in this Budget. If such people happen to be low income earners with children they have no compensation at all and will continue to fall further and further behind the poverty line. If they are on very low incomes of $140 of $160 a week they will continue to fall further and further behind relatively in our community because of this failure to compensate in these payments for increases in inflation which have occurred in the last few years. As long as we continue to fail to compensate families with children for increases in inflation we are creating a group of people in the community - from whom our future citizens will develop - who are being discriminated against by this community, who are being treated unfairly and who will not have the opportunities of the better off in the community. </para>
          <para>I think it is a pity that the Government again has not found it reasonable to increase payments to these very needy groups in the community. It has failed to do it again. I can see no justification - I repeat, no justification at all - for the continued discrimination against the unemployed who are single, who happen to have no dependants. These are not only 18-year-old, 19- year-old and 20-year-old unemployed. They are increasingly middle-aged unemployed who are displaced because of new technology and who, because of lack of training facilities, lack of need for the skills that they have, are unable to get work. Their numbers are increasing as a percentage of the unemployed, yet they are still discriminated against. They are still denied indexation. They are given an increase which is far below the increase in the inflation rate since they were last given an increase in May 1978. They are still singled out because of this obsession of honourable senators opposite that people who are single and unemployed are somehow unemployed because it is their own fault. So, from a first look at the social security area in the Budget we see that expenditure merely holds the line and the increase in expenditure is, in fact, exactly the amount the Treasurer estimates the inflation rate to be. </para>
          <para>There have been small increases in some areas. There are token increases to disabled persons in the Budget. Therefore, to hold the line as the Government has, there must be decreases in other areas. As I have said, the glaring area concerns the aged pensioner in this community, particularly in relation to accommodation for the aged. I merely make one comment about the general statement made by the Minister in her report when she talked about the International Year of Disabled Persons. On page 1 0 of her report she stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The disabled themselves are, and must continue to be, closely involved in all planning associated with the Year. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A continual complaint of the disabled in the community now, and it will be a continual complaint for the rest of the year, is that they were not consulted in the initial planning for the International Year of the Disabled; that the bureaucrats who are running the International Year of the Disabled are the same people who ran the International Year of the Child; only at a later stage were consultative committees set up which included some of the disabled; they have met only a couple of times; and in some of the States they do not make up a majority of the people on the committee for this year that is supposed to be concerned with them. We will have more to say in detail about what is happening in the International Year of the Disabled and the lack of participation by the disabled in it. Having said that and having had such a limited time to look at the Budget Papers and the Minister&#39;s statement, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </para>

Honourable senators will recall that on 1 7 April 1 980 1 undertook to make a statement once all investigations into the operations of Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd had been completed. Regrettably, all investigations into this matter have not yet been completed, but I believe it is appropriate for me to advise the Senate as to the latest position. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As a result of a request by my predecessor in March last year, the accounts and records of ADI, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Australian Dairy Corporation, have been examined by the Commonwealth Auditor-General. The purpose of seeking the audit inspection was to assist the Government in its consideration of the future role and operations of ADI. The reports of the Auditor-General revealed certain deficiencies in the financial and managerial control of the company, and questioned the appropriateness of certain past expenditure. I have previously stated that the deficiencies in the financial and managerial control were examined by a committee established by the Australian Dairy Corporation. Action has been taken, or is being taken, to rectify the deficiencies and ensure that the company operates in a normal commercial fashion. </para>
          <para>The only matter now outstanding in respect of the audit of ADI relates to the appropriateness of certain past expenditure by the former  chairman  of the company. This matter has been the subject of detailed examination by officials. 1 have received legal advice from the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> to the effect that certain matters arising out of this detailed examination should be reported to the police for further investigation. Upon receipt of that advice, and at my request, my Department has reported the matters in question to the Australian Federal Police for detailed investigation. In light of this, it would be improper to consider either tabling the Auditor-General&#39;s reports, or comment further on the matter. As I have said in the past, I will make a statement on all aspects of the audit inspection when all investigations are completed. I present the following paper: </para>

          <para class="block">There certainly is a great number of questions about past expenditure authorised by the former  chairman  of the company. Some of those questions have been discussed in the Senate. But I do not believe that is the only matter still outstanding. Perhaps it is the only matter outstanding and the Government has decided already what to do about all the other misappropriations detailed in the documents which I will seek leave to table very shortly. There are many matters other than those concerning the former management of the Australian Dairy Corporation and Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tony</inline> Webster. For example, there is the matter of the $5,000. I quote from the documents: </para>

            <para>Payment of a gratuity of approximately $A5,000 to E. G. McCartney in lieu of a facility to visit operating companies; </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I stress those words &#39;in lieu of a facility to visit operating countries&#39;, lt appears from that statement, which is a quotation from the audit report, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCartney,</inline> who is a former director of ADI and a former director, perhaps also current director, of Petersville, was offered a trip to South East Asia or $5,000 in lieu of a trip to South East Asia: The money or the box and he took the money. Who authorised that expenditure? Has it been recovered from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCartney?</inline> On what conceivable grounds could the granting of $5,000 to someone for not taking a trip to South East Asia have been justified? </para>
          <para>The audit report notes also that in 1 978 all of the directors of Asia Dairy Industries made between two and five trips to South East Asia. Those visits may have been justified. On the face of it it seems highly unlikely that that is so, but if they were justified let us have the Minister&#39;s report on it. If the Minister says that the only matter which is now outstanding relates to some of the expenditure incurred by the previous  chairman,  is he condoning the payment to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCartney</inline> and the making of up to five trips to South East Asia in one year by all the other directors?

That statement is found in a letter of 24 July. The joint committee set up by Asia Dairy Industries and the Dairy Corporation reported on this matter and stated: </para>

            <para>Contrary to the findings of Audit, recovery of this amount was sought from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline> Yetsenga  in a letter dated 19 September 1977 . . . When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Yetsenga</inline> declined to make any refund, the amount involved was written-off on the authority of the  Chairman  of ADI. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Yetsenga</inline>was overpaid by $10,000. Asia Dairy Industries wrote him a letter and asked: &#39;Will you pay it back?&#39; He said &#39;No thanks&#39;. The Asia Dairy Industries management allowed the matter to rest at that point. 1 quote again from the Auditor-General&#39;s report:  lt is noted the Minister indicated in November 1977 when approving an allocation of $1.5m to the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation from the Fund--- </para>
          <para class="block">That is, from the stabilisation fund, I think -  that the payment represented the final claim by the Federation. However, various Federation activities have subsequently been funded by ADI. </para>
          <para class="block">What various Federation activities subsequently have been funded by ADI? Why was $1.5m made available to the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation in the first place? There may be a very good reason for that having been done, but a ministerial statement that it was done, let alone why it was done, has never been made. Neither the Opposition nor any of the six or seven agricultural journalists 1 have consulted on this matter have ever heard of that payment. The mystery remains. The report states also:  lt is noted Thai Dairy financial statements show an item Receivables and loans to directors and employees&#39; in the balance sheet as at 3 1 December 1978- Baht 2,978.959. </para>
          <para class="block">I am not sure how that word &#39;baht&#39; is pronounced, but it is the currency unit of Thailand. Almost 3 million baht or approximately $A 127,000 was involved. Nobody knows why those loans were made, whether they have been repaid, who authorised them, or whether the loans were legal. The report continues: </para>

            <para>Certain consultancy services were carried out by firms associated with ADI Directors. </para>
            <para>Audit has instanced two occasions on which ADI has reimbursed Thai Dairy for expenses incurred on behalf of two people <inline font-weight="bold">(Mrs Stone and Mrs Kent)</inline> who are neither employees of ADI nor personally commercially associated with ADI. On neither occasion was the approval for such expenditure given by the Board of ADI. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I presume that approval was given by the then  chairman  of ADI, but that is not known either. The identities of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Stone</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Kent</inline> are interesting. Elsewhere it is stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Stone</inline> was the wife of the consulting engineer at that stage employed by ADI. It was stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Kent</inline> appeared to have been &#39;just a tourist&#39;. Why was <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Kent</inline> being duchessed by ADI? Who, indeed, is <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Kent?</inline> According to information supplied to me, I believe from a reliable source, the <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Kent</inline> in question is the wife of a dairy farming neighbour of Bill Pyle,  Deputy Chairman  of the Dairy Corporation, good friend of the former  chairman  of the Dairy Corporation, good friend and close associate of Ronald Anderson. Who is <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Kent?</inline> An alternative version is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Kent</inline> was the secretary of the student assistance scheme, of which, I must say, I have never heard. I do not know what ADI was doing running a student assistance scheme. I do know that from time to time certain rising stars in the dairy industry were duchessed by the oligarchy which has controlled ADI and used its money as a private slush fund. Certain journalists also were duchessed. Perhaps that was the student assistance scheme; I do not know. </para>
          <para>Other highlights include travel and accommodation expenses paid at what the Auditor-General calls &#39;tourist resorts&#39;; transfer pricing arrangements which almost certainly breach Thai taxation laws; the bizarre story of the employee returning to Australia who brought back 81 tons of luggage; and so on. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Webster,</inline>the former  Chairman  of the Corporation, has had very little to say on his own behalf. Others, close associates and friends of his, have said more on his behalf - it purports to have been on his behalf. The defence which is put up meanders along the lines of &#39;nothing was done in ADI that is not standard practice in private business&#39;. I did not know that in private business it was standard practice to pay employees&#39; doctors bills, to pay a doctor and to pay insurance premiums all at the same time. I would be surprised if that were standard practice in many private businesses, just to mention one of the many irregularities detailed in the documents. The report states further that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Webster</inline> did not regard himself as being covered by the Remuneration Tribunal or the Public Service Act. If he did not regard himself as being covered by the Remuneration Tribunal, it is extraordinary that he made submissions to it in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979. The line goes: &#39;Well, this is common practice in private business. Were it not for a few nit-picking bureaucrats in Canberra nobody would ever have had the audacity to question anything that had been going on in ADI. lt is doing a magnificent job for the Australian dairy industry&#39;, et cetera, ad nauseam, ad infinitum. This was a whitewash. The practices detailed in these documents are not normal commercial practices. </para>
          <para>It has also been said - this has come back to me - that those people in the Parliament, of whom 1 have been one, who have been attempting to make the Government come clean on this issue have been damaging the Australian dairy industry. It has been asserted that the signing of lucrative contracts has been delayed since January because this matter has been politically controversial. I do not believe there is any truth at all in that story. It is fabricated and it is pure fiction. I challenge those who have peddled that story, including the  President  of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, to produce a scintilla of evidence that that is so. The people who have been damaged are those in that little oligarchy who have been misusing the dairy industrys funds for the benefit of themselves and their friends for a number of years. They have been discredited by the disclosure of their activities. To the best of my knowledge, the present  President  of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation is not one of those who have misused those funds. I think, however, he is in a position where he will have to make a decision very quickly as to whether he will stand with those who are exposed as having misused funds or cut himself adrift from them. </para>
          <para>Another somewhat curious aspect of this case concerns the Melbourne publisher Ronald Anderson. When the matter was first raised in Parliament he said how dreadful it was that it had come up, especially since there was absolutely no substance in it. He made references to all the malfeasance in the Corporation. In <inline font-style="italic">Primary Industry Newsletter</inline> of 5 September last year he wrote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">PIN found nothing in its investigation to suggest any wrongdoing let alone any misappropriation . . . PIN concluded that the allegations being made were without substance. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline>has never amended that opinion. He is a man who prides himself on having excellent contacts with the dairy industry, which he has. He has very close contacts with both the former  Chairman  and the present  Deputy Chairman  of the Australian Dairy Corporation. I do not believe it is conceivable that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline> could have been entirely ignorant of the matters disclosed in the Audit report. I can therefore conclude only that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline> was willing and, perhaps, the deliberate instigator of an attempt to cover up everything that had been going on and to bluff those who were inclined to force the truth to be disgorged from continuing to do so. I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline> to put on the record whether he stands by that judgment that the allegations being made were without substance and that there is no evidence to suggest any wrongdoing, let alone misappropriation. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline>has previously complained that I have defamed him in a highly damaging way under parliamentary privilege. I said that he was on a retainer from the Australian Dairy Corporation. He denies that. There has been a question on notice for three months seeking information on that matter among others, lt has not been answered. Whatever the answer to that question, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson</inline> simultaneously asserts that there is nothing improper or irregular about his being retained by the Dairy Farmers Federation, the Victorian Grain Elevators Board and the Australian Wheat Board. It is quite proper for him to be retained by them and to write about them without disclosing his pecuniary association with them but to say that he is employed by the Australian Dairy Corporation when he claims he is not is, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anderson,</inline> highly damaging to him. He cannot have it both ways. If his relationship with all these other bodies is innocent as he claims it is I invite him to make a full public disclosure of his various interests. </para>
          <para>One of the things which the documents show is that in 1977 three journalists were sent on what was euphemistically called a study tour funded by Asia Dairy Industries around its Asian establishments. The journalists were Stuart Simson, then of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> and now of the <inline font-style="italic">National Times,</inline> Alan Eager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and Ronald Anderson, lt appears that the purpose of this exercise was to defuse actual or potential criticism from agricultural journalists. I suppose it could be called public relations if anyone wanted to use the euphemism or duchessing if he wanted to be more realistic. The results were variable. Stuart Simson came back to Australia and immediately wrote a piece in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> critical of Asia Dairy Industries and what he had seen. The Australian Broadcasting Commission&#39;s rural department, of which Alan Eager was a senior member, until the last couple of months seemed to show absolutely no interest in the matter. Ronald Anderson, of course, became the chief apologist for Asia Dairy Industries. He either organised or was the front man in the attempt to whitewash the company and to intimidate those in the Parliament who would have all the malfeasance exposed. </para>
          <para>The reports refer to various gifts made to persons overseas. By whom these gifts were made, to whom and for what purpose we do not know. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> knows. If so, it is time he told the Parliament. I do not wish to detain the Senate all night. This is not the last the Government will hear of this matter. 1 assure Government members that it will be raised again. I seek leave to table relevant extracts from a number of documents. </para>

              <para>-  The honourable senator is quite welcome to look at them if he would like to do so. I will tell him what they are. They are extracts from a letter from the Auditor-General&#39;s Office to the then  Chairman  of the Australian Dairy Corporation and ADI on 24 July 1979 and extracts from the Australian Dairy Corporation&#39;s management committee report dated 12 March 1979. Members of the committee were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norwood</inline> from the ADC, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gillies</inline> from Asia Dairy Industries, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kennedy</inline> from the ADC, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wallace</inline> and later <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coutts</inline> from the Department of Primary Industry in Canberra. The extracts also include a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Webster</inline> to the Auditor-General of 28 August 1979, a letter from the Auditor-General to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Webster</inline> of 19 September 1979 and a letter from the Auditor-General to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> of 3 August 1979. 1 put on the record that these are not photocopies of the original documents. They have been retyped. As 1 said, they are extracts. The only reason they are extracts is that the circumstances under which the documents were made available to me made it difficult to get complete copies of them. The extracts, which are copied are those which seemed to be the most relevant. The Minister, of course, should have tabled these and other documents long ago. He has not done so. I see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has joined us. I hope his committee will take up this matter some day. I wish it could do it before the election but I guess that would be asking too much even if the Government did not want to cover up the issue, but it does want to cover up. I seek leave to table about 30 pages of extracts from those various reports to which I have referred. </para>

It is a sorry day when an Opposition shadow Minister has to do what the Minister ought to be doing in the Parliament. </para>

          <para>-  I have a matter which I wish to raise briefly in the adjournment debate tonight. It relates to the failure of the Government to table in the Parliament the VIP manifest because of the undue haste with which the Senate was adjourned for the winter recess. It is usual practice for the manifest to be tabled twice yearly. Unfortunately, due to the way in which the Senate was brought to a sudden halt this year - it was because the Government did not want to face public criticism by the Opposition - we did not see the tabling of the VIP manifest. We on this side of the House have been unable to ascertain who has been travelling in VIP aircraft throughout the length and breadth of Australia. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>During the recess I had occasion to note that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cotter)</inline> travelled throughout his electorate extensively in the VIP aircraft of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> I have complained about this on previous occasions when I have been able to glean the information from the VIP manifest. </para>
        <para class="block">The last manifest which was tabled showed that certain Queensland members of the Government were able to travel throughout their electorates electioneering in the company of the Prime Minister. The same situation occurred again this year when the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was able to carry out an extensive election campaign in his electorate in the company of the Prime Minister in a VIP aircraft. I say no more at this time, except that I ask the Government to conform to usual policy and to see that the VIP manifest is tabled without delay in order that we can see who has been travelling the length and breadth of the country in VIP aircraft at the taxpayers&#39; expense. </para>

            <para>- It does not matter whom he was with. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> looks at the instructions which are laid down by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> she will see what the position is. I have referred to this matter before. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> to read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in order to ascertain what instructions are laid down rather than to interject across the chamber. Another matter of concern to me is that National Country Party members can use VIP aircraft at a cost of something in the vicinity of  $5,000  to travel from Rockhampton to Sydney to give evidence in a court of law for  10  minutes in support of a colleague. They have no qualms about using taxpayers&#39; money. Tonight Ministers have told us what they are doing to put the economy of this country back on the rails, yet quite openly, without any blushing at all, they wilfully waste the taxpayers&#39; money. The reason I rose tonight was to see that the VIP manifest is tabled. I will have more to say about this matter when it is tabled. </para>

            <para>Charges against 35 of the persons originally charged with conspiracy in connection with alleged social security frauds have been dropped. 1 3 of those 35 persons were discharged by the Court on 3 1 January 1979, I was discharged on 28 March 1979, 4 were discharged on 30 March 1979 and 17. were discharged on 8 June 1979. Amounts in settlement of claims for costs have been offered to those discharged defendants who were represented by lawyers but who were not awarded costs by the Magistrate when they were discharged. The offers were made on or about 24 October 1 979. The amounts offered were determined after taking into account various matters of which perhaps the most important was the number of days on which a discharged defendant had been legally represented in Court in relation to the charge against him. 1 defendant was offered $500.00, I defendant was offered $300.00, 9 defendants were offered $250.00, 1 defendant was offered $188.00 and 1 defendant was offered $ 1 25.00. Of those persons to whom offers were made, claims for payment have been processed by officers of my Department in respect of 6 persons. I believe that these claims have been paid. In the other cases, I am informed that acceptances of the offers have not been received but that none of the offers has been rejected. I understand, however, that in some cases the persons concerned have returned to Greece and t heir solicitors may have been unable to contact them. </para>

            <para>The Government decided on 22 January 1 980 that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications should arrange for the programs of the multicultural television services of the Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting Corporation to be transmitted on both UHF and VHF frequencies. </para>
            <para>The continued utilisation of the VHF frequency by the I &#38; MBC will be reviewed after an appropriate period of time having regard to the level of penetration of home television receivers capable of receiving UHF transmissions and the adequacy of coverage of the Sydney and Melbourne service areas. As the ability of audiences in both cities to receive adequate quality signals will have a significant bearing on the acceptance and revenue potential of the service, this matter will be the subject of progressive evaluation. </para>
            <para>Further consideration of proposals for a second television network for the Australian Broadcasting Commission has been deferred until the Government has received and considered the Report of the ABC Committee of Review, which Report is expected to become available about March 1 98 1 . </para>

            <para>The Controller of the Royal Australian Mint has been consulted on this matter. While it is considered that the milling of the 10c coin could be a major feature used by blind people to distinguish it from the 2c coin, the Mint has received very little indication from the public that this is so. Deeper milling might temporarily alleviate any problem felt to exist in this quarter but would not eliminate it because the coins will still wear down over time. </para>
            <para>When the designs of the Australian decimal coins were announced in 1964 it was pointed out by the then Treasurer that the use of large numerals in the reverse designs should be of great advantage to blind people, and other people with impaired eye-sight, as such numerals would be more readily distinguishable by touch. Nevertheless, if a substantial problem is thought to exist, I am of course willing in principle to consider any submission of proposals designed to meet such a problem, within the context of the wider considerations involved in the production of coinage. </para>

            <para>Section 91 of the Repatriation Act provides that where an applicant or service pensioner deprives himself of income in order to obtain a pension or a pension at a higher rate that income may continue to be maintained in the assessment. A similar provision exists under the Social Services Act. </para>
            <para>The Repatriation Commission has always applied this provision and has maintained as part of the assessed income any income foregone when determining eligibility for pension and fringe benefits. This policy has been applied for many years and State Officers of the Department were advised on 21 March 1980 that this policy also applied where Superannuation Boards withheld superannuation increases. </para>
            <para>Following recent criticism the Commission reviewed its policy and decided that if a pensioner did not himself institute the necessary step to deprive himself of income the provisions of section 91 should not apply. Both my Department and the Department of Social Security now apply an identical policy toward pensioner recipients of superannuation payments. </para>
            <para>Any service pensioner who had lost fringe benefits when a Superannuation Board did not grant a superannuation increase should contact the Department of Veterans&#39; Affairs in his State, so that benefits can be restored. </para>

In the case of these latter procedures the teams have found that the only times they have been able to deal with them are a relatively few occasions when the teams have been instructing younger groups who understand the more complex concepts involved. Even then the teams are unable to deal with the fine distinctions between the respective Commonwealth and Slate/Territory laws. </para>
          <para>In the case of postal voting, instruction is limited to an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a postal vote, lt is worth noting that in respect of postal voting under the various electoral laws, with some small differences, the qualifications and procedures are essentially the same. For this reason any explanation given by the teams covers in a general way the common principles and does not highlight the fine points of difference. </para>

          <para>A fisherman in proclaimed waters adjacent to New South Wales (i.e. waters beyond territorial limits and less than 200 nautical miles offshore) is required to hold a licence to engage in fishing under sub-section 9 (I) of the Fisheries Act 1952; the operator of a boat used for fishing in those waters is required lo hold a licence in respect of the boat under subsection 9 (2). Once issued, those licences when held by Australians are valid Tor all fisheries in all proclaimed waters except where prohibited by a notice under section 8 or a condition of the licence. When held by foreigners the licences are restricted as to fishing area, species, method and catch quota and subject to reporting requirements of their position in the Australian fishing zone and their catch. </para>

          <quote>
            <para class="block">Generally, in areas where postman or contract deliveries are available, there are no significant savings to Australia Post, as a result of customers electing to receive their mail through private boxes at the post office rather than by delivery to their residential or business address. Little adjustment can be made to delivery rounds to take account of the fact that mail deliveries need not be made to particular premises and, where an address is shared, unless all occupants have private boxes, the postman may still be required to deliver mail even to that address. There is, therefore, little or no offset to the substantial costs incurred in the purchase, installation, maintenance and administration of private boxes. </para>
            <para>In areas where a delivery service is not available, Australia Post does offer reduced rates for the rental of a private box. Those rates vary according to the size of the box. The current annual rental charges for private boxes at post offices in areas without delivery services are $20 (Large box), $12 (Medium box) and $6 (Small box). The lowest equivalent rates available in areas where delivery services are also provided are $45, $26 and $16 respectively. The reduction in these cases is thus currently of the order of 55-60 per cent. </para>

As part of the National Energy Conservation Program, provision has been made for advisory services. An introductory information bulletin <inline font-style="italic">Using Energy Wisely in Industry</inline> has already been released. In addition a set of 12 Advisory Booklets aimed at energy managers of small to medium-sized firms are to be published.

            <para>On 23 April 1 980 in answer to Question No. 2037 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard</inline> page 1794), I advised that the current standard for hexachlorophane does not include a test for dioxin content and the 1980 British Pharmacopoeia (B.P.) monograph will contain a limit for non-phenolic substances, which include dioxin. </para>
            <para>Examination of this new B.P. monograph now to hand indicates that this may not be sufficiently precise to limit the dioxin in hexachlorophane to a specific level. </para>

              <para>Statistics on total investment by foreign residents in enterprises in Australia are collected and published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Due to confidentiality requirements, ABS does not release information on individual companies. However, ABS statistics indicate that at 30 June 1978 the level of foreign investment in corporate equities in companies in Australia that were reported as wholly owned by individuals or companies resident in Sweden was$A22.5 million. This figure is subject to significant qualification. Foreign investment in corporate equities is calculated on paid-up value only and this results in an understatement of the total real stock value. Moreover, because the ABS country classification reflects the country of domicile of the foreign investor to whom the enterprises in Australia have the immediate liability, the figure above excludes enterprises in Australia wholly owned by companies from third countries which are ultimately owned by companies resident in Sweden and include enterprises in Australia wholly owned by Swedish companies which are ultimately owned by companies from third countries. </para>

              <para>Due to confidentiality requirements, ABS does not release information on individual companies. However, ABS statistics indicate that between 1974-75 and 1978-79 (1979-80 data are not yet available) the inflow of direct investment in enterprises in Australia from Sweden amounted to$A60.8 million. There were 53 enterprises in Australia recording direct investment from Sweden at 30 June 1978. This figure covers a number of transactions in addition to those involving wholly owned subsidiaries of Swedish companies. Figures for inflow of direct foreign investment in Australia record the net amounts of transactions between Australian subsidiaries and branches and their foreign parents and related enterprises and head offices with, for example, a loan by an Australian subsidiary to its foreign parent being recorded as a negative inflow. Also, because the ABS country classification reflects the country of domicile of the foreign investor to whom the enterprises in Australia have the immediate liability, the figure of$A60.8 million excludes any direct investment in enterprises in Australia by companies from third countries which are ultimately owned by companies resident in Sweden and includes any direct investment in enterprises in Australia by Swedish companies which are ultimately owned by companies from third countries. </para>

However, I am unable to advise which Swedish companies may have been involved as information received by the Government in connection with foreign investment proposals is treated in confidence. Foreign Investment Review Board statistics indicate that over the period between the establishment of the Board on 8 April 1 976 and 3 1 March 1 980 one proposal by Swedish interests to form a wholly owned subsidiary or branch in Australia was approved by the Government on the condition that they introduce a specified level of Australian participation in their local operations over a specified period. </para>

The trainees were surveyed 4 months after the scheduled completion of the training period, that is, in November-December 1979. The results showed that 69.1% of former trainees were in employment. A survey of trainees placed in Commonwealth establishments during 1979 has also been conducted which showed that 51.6% of former trainees were in employment 8-12 weeks after they had completed training. </para>

              <para>Community Development Employment Projects (CDEPs) do not pay unemployment benefit. CDEPs are a response to specific requests from remote Aboriginal communities for an alternative to unemployment benefit. The scheme provides for grants to a community at a level approximating unemployment benefit otherwise payable to individuals within the community together with additional amounts for materials and other costs. The grants finance worthwhile employment projects in communities. The grants are at present being paid, in the form of grants-in-aid through my Department, to 17 remote Aboriginal communities. The total number of Aboriginals currently employed on CDEP programs is approximately 950. The number is not constant as it depends on factors such as community decisions and priorities, and population movements between communities. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>, (3), (4), (5) and (6) The Department of Employment and Youth Affairs has a responsibility to assess the total number of persons in communities who would be eligible for unemployment benefits, were CDEP programs not operating in those communities. This is done at varying periods, depending on staff availability. The number so assessed provides the basis for calculating my Department&#39;s grant to each CDEP community. </para>

          <para>I am informed that staff  of  the Northern Territory Public Service at Alice Springs are now receiving rates  of  District Allowance which are higher by 70 per cent (officer with dependants) and by 80 per cent (officer without dependants) than the comparable rates payable to Australian Public Servants at Alice Springs. The actual rates are: </para>
          <para>APS- (effective 5 December 1979): with dependants $680 p.a.; without dependants $350 p.a. </para>
          <para>NTPS- (effective1 January 1980): with dependants $1 160 p.a.: without dependants $630 p.a. </para>
          <para class="block">This changed relationship between the conditions  of  the two Services resulted from a deliberate decision  of  the Public Service Commissioner for the Northern Territory to break the nexus which formerly existed with the Australian Public Service District Allowance principles which,  of  course, apply throughout the Commonwealth. In granting general increases in District Allowance, the Commissioner also placed Alice Springs in a significantly higher grade. </para>
          <para>A further review  of  District Allowance rates in the Australian Public Service has recently been completed and there have been discussions with the Peak Councils. However, I understand that no change in the grading  of  Alice Springs is to be made. </para>
          <para>As regards pay rates, I am informed that the Commission and the staff organisations have recently agreed that a 6.5 per cent increase would be appropriate for the majority  of  staff  of  the Northern Territory Public Service in accordance with Principle 7 (a)  of  the wage fixation principles  of  the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This increase in pay rates is subject to acceptance by the Public Service Arbitrator that it would be appropriate under Principle 7 (a) and if so, it will be effective from 10 April 1980. In the case  of  the Australian Public Service, consideration is not being given to the general adequacy  of  pay rates throughout the Service as was the case in the Northern Territory Public Service. Rather, the Public Service Board is considering a large number of salary claims on a group by group basis. Some of these claims have already been resolved while others are still under consideration. Any resulting increases would also require acceptance by the Public Service Arbitrator that they are appropriate under Principle 7 (a). </para>

            <para>The Government believes that this policy reflects the generally held view in our society at this time. </para>
            <para>The employment of women relies on the principle of equal opportunity with men in similar employment wherever possible, having regard to the essential maintenance of the operational effectiveness of the Services. Of course, women may be excluded from or men preferred for particular jobs because of the inherent requirements of these jobs. </para>
            <para>This is consistent with the provisions of Convention III of the International Labour Organisation. </para>
            <para>As to the particular case of the three women in Army Reserve bands, I have directed that any discrimination as to their opportunities for advancement or to attend promotion courses is to be removed as soon as possible. </para>
            <para>At the present time, no women are employed in bands of the Regular Forces. However, the Services are progressively widening the range of employments open to women. Obviously, this must be an evolutionary process. Involved is a series of complex factors including the career potentiality of female members, the balance of female to male members essential to the ability of the Defence Force to discharge its primary role and the provision, including cost considerations, of appropriate facilities. </para>
            <para>What has to be remembered is that, unlike the general run of civilian employment, the degree of absorption of females into the Defence Force must be governed by considerations which bear directly upon the maintenance of the requisite standard of operational effectiveness. </para>
            <para>In short, employment opportunities for women in the Defence Force have been widened over recent years and this process will continue in the future. </para>

The question concerned the import and export of products unsafe for children and infants, and followed a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> which claimed that a particular babies dummy was being dumped in Australia after being banned in the USA. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>When mandatory safety requirements for infants&#39; pacifiers/dummies were introduced in the USA the Nuk Cooling Soother No. 02532 was withdrawn from sale in that country for re-design to comply with the specifications set out in the new US standard. The supply to Australia of the superseded version of the Nuk Cooling Soother continued and the US Consumer Product Safety Commission notified Australian Government authorities that the Reliance Corporation of the USA intended to export 120,000 of the superseded cooling soothers to Australia during 1979. It appears that less than 6,000 of this intended quantity of soothers was, in fact, imported before the revised model was introduced into Australia. </para>
            <para>Following the US advice, an officer of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs discussed the safety aspects of the superseded soother with the Australian importers of the product. The Department also examined and considered the safety aspects of this particular soother in conjunction with the Technical Committee of the Standards Association of </para>
            <para class="block">Australia which is developing an Australian Standard for infants&#39; dummies. The advice of State Health officials was also sought. </para>
            <para>Following this careful examination the view of officials was that on the evidence available the superseded soother did not appear to be unsafe or pose a significant risk of injury to infants. Furthermore, no evidence has yet been obtained that the superseded soother in question has resulted in the death or injury of infants either in the US or Australia. </para>
            <para>I am concerned, however, to ensure that all infants&#39; dummies meet reasonable standards of safety and an Australian Standard for infants&#39; dummies is being developed in respect of the safety aspects of materials, design, construction and performance. The Department of Business and Consumer Affairs is participating in the preparation of this Standard which, when completed, will be examined by the Commonwealth/State Consumer Products Advisory Committee (CSCPAC). It is the task of this Committee to make recommendations to Ministers for Consumer Affairs on proposed consumer product safety standards under the Trade Practices Act and complementary State and Territory legislation. </para>
            <para>Section 62 of the Trade Practices Act enables the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs to declare mandatory consumer product safety standards and to ban the supply of unsafe children&#39;s or infants&#39; products. The Minister may also take action to ban imports of unsafe goods under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. The Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations do not presently provide for a ban on the export of consumer products which have been banned from supply in Australia. Section 62 (2AA) of the Trade Practices Act states that goods which are intended to be used outside Australia are not subject to safety standards declared under Section 62. </para>
            <para>As there is a huge volume of products, both imported and domestically produced, which might be used by children it is not possible to undertake safety checks on each product. Nevertheless, any consumer product which is suspected of posing a safety hazard is examined by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. Co-ordinated advice and action is undertaken throughout Australia by CSCPAC which comprises representatives of State and Territory Consumer Affairs authorities under the chairmanship of the Department. </para>
            <para>Steps to control safety defects in products may be adopted on a voluntary basis by suppliers in Australia or, if necessary, action may be taken under the Trade Practices Act and the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. </para>
            <para>Safety standards which have been declared under the Trade Practices Act for children&#39;s products include: </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Can the Leader of the Government in the Senate say what was the response from the various State governments following the approach made to them last year on the subject of voluntary membership of student unions at universities and colleges of advanced education in the States? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Minister for Education has provided the following information: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>On 29 May 1978 the Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania recommending that their States introduce legislation in respect of student union membership at universities and colleges of advanced education similar to that which was then proposed for the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education. The ACT legislation, passed in 1 979 and effective from 1 January 1 980, ensures that membership of student organisations at these institutions is voluntary and that fees compulsorily collected for provision of amenities and services are used only for approved purposes. The letters to the Premiers of Victoria and Western Australia took into account that in those two States, certain action had already been taken. </para>
            <para>Prior to the Prime Minister&#39;s letter, the Governments of Victoria in relation to the University of Melbourne, and Western Australia in relation to all tertiary education institutions in that Slate, had already acted to make membership of student organisations voluntary and to prevent funds collected for the provision of amenities and services from being used for other purposes. </para>
            <para>The response to the Prime Minister&#39;s letter was as follows: </para>
            <para>In his reply of 20 June 1978 the Premier of New South Wales outlined his Government&#39;s action to legislate in relation to the levying and use of student fees. The legislation confirmed the universities&#39; powers to collect fees on behalf of student associations and to exempt individuals from payment on the ground of conscientious objection. The legislation was introduced in March 1978 and passed in December of that year. </para>
            <para>The Premier of Victoria responded to the Prime Minister&#39;s letter on 3 July 1978 by saying his Government was considering the general question of extending to other tertiary institutions legislation along the lines of that applying to Melbourne University. </para>
            <para>The Acting Premier of Queensland indicated in a letter dated 25 July 1978 that the Queensland Government, while keeping the question of compulsory student unionism and use of fees under consideration, had opted to attain its objectives in ways other than by invoking major legislative sanctions. </para>
            <para>The Premier of South Australia advised on 1 2 July 1 978 that his Government did not propose to introduce legislation along the lines suggested in the Prime Minister&#39;s letter. Since the change of Government in that State, the Minister for Education has recently indicated he would be pleased to consider submissions on the matter. </para>
            <para>In Western Australia there has been no change since the passing of the Acts Amendment (Student Guilds and Associations) Act 1977 which made membership of the Student Guilds voluntary. Students must still pay a compulsory amenities and services fee. </para>
            <para>The Premier of Tasmania in his letter of 25 September 1978 stated that the matters raised by the Prime Minister had been considered by the State Minister for Education, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tasmania and the Acting Principal of the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education, who concluded there were no grounds to justify legislative action of the kind recommended. The Premier added that there is provision for exemption from (student) Union membership on the grounds of conscientious objection in the Statutes of the Council of the University of Tasmania. </para>

            <para>The decision by Ansett Airlines of Australia to acquire Boeing aircraft was a commercial judgment based on its assessment of market demand and suitability of the aircraft to Australia&#39;s operating conditions. </para>
            <para>The decisions by the major domestic airlines to acquire different types of aircraft reflects the current increased competitive spirit in the domestic aviation industry which I&#39;m sure all will welcome. However, in the initial stages of operation the decisions may involve some additional costs. </para>
            <para>Generally, however, the introduction of new generation aircraft provides productivity gains which are reflected in the containment of fares for a period after the introduction. This occurred for example when jet aircraft were first introduced into Australian service in 1964 and with the introduction of wide bodied aircraft onto international services. The new wide bodied aircraft chosen by TAA and Ansett offer a number of advantages over the existing aircraft, not the least of which is their improved fuel efficiency. Any proposed fare increase which may be based on the costs associated with the acquisition of these aircraft would be fully investigated. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I preface this question by saying that on occasions some telephone numbers listed in telephone directories are incorrect and sometimes names that are listed are under the wrong heading in the business section in the Yellow Pages. Sometimes names are omitted. I give the Minister the example of Hertz Rent-A-Car Pty Ltd a subsidiary of Trans-Australia Airlines, which is incorrectly listed under Kay-Hertz in the 004 directory for Tasmania. Obviously this mistake must cause Hertz some loss of business. Has Telecom Australia considered making directory correction lists available to subscribers so that they will be better served and. if not, will Telecom consider such a move? </para>

          <para>The Minister for Post and Telecommunications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Telecom Australia has advised that all entries for Hertz Rent-A-Car and Kay Hertz Rent-A-Car which appear in the 004 telephone directory are correct. However, an entry in the Alphabetical Section for Hertz Rent-A-Car was inadvertently omitted. </para>
            <para>Past experience has shown that the issue of directory correction lists is ineffectual. When supplementary correction lists were issued some years ago, surveys revealed that the lists were seldom consulted by subscribers and there was no Tailing off in the numbers of enquiries to Directory Assistance Operators. </para>
            <para>Up-to-date details of all telephone numbers are available from Directory Assistance, which is a free service, and, in the circumstances, Telecom considers the costs that would be involved in producing and distributing supplementary directory lists could not be justified. </para>
            <para>Telecom apologises for this error, and has taken action to ensure that the entry is included in the next issue of the directory. </para>

            <para>- On 27 March 1980 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> pages 1077-1078), in response to a question without notice by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> concerning a decision of the Federal Court of Australia in re Gleghorn, I indicated that I would give further consideration to so much of the question as related to the possible effect of the decision upon Federal elections. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Having considered the matter with the assistance of advice from the Solicitor-General, I can now advise the honourable senator that, in my opinion, the decision in re Gleghorn does not make it necessary to depart from the practice of treating as informal any ballot papers in a Federal election that are marked only with a cross or tick. The Federal Court decision referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> related to an optional-preferential ballot where there was only one position to be filled and only two candidates. It sufficed there to give a vote to one candidate and the Federal Court held that such a vote was sufficiently indicated by a cross or tick opposite the candidate&#39;s name. In an election of senators for a State or Territory there is now always more than one position to be filled and hence there are always more than two candidates. Accordingly the decision in re Gleghorn is not applicable to Senate elections. A House of Representatives election may, of course, involve only two candidates, and it is an election by preferential ballot. The question whether a ballot paper in such an election is informal is governed by section 1 33 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. In my view, a House of Representatives ballot paper marked in a way that was held to be sufficient under the union rules applicable to the ballot considered in re Gleghorn would be informal by reason of section 1 33. </para>

            <para>With regard to the substance of the press reports of failures at Canberra radar, Alice Springs and Darwin, the following comments apply. </para>
            <para>As a result of an industrial dispute, the Canberra radar was withdrawn from service from 7 p.m. Thursday, 1 0 April 1 980 until 7 a.m. Tuesday, 15 April 1980. During this period air traffic movements affected by the non-availability of Canberra radar reverted to procedural control. </para>
            <para>At Alice Springs there was a loss of communications for approximately 6 minutes on 27 February 1980, as a result of technician error. Again I would refer the honourable senator to the answer given in response to a question raised on 30 April 1 980 by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline></para>
            <para>The Department of Transport is unaware of any recent major failure at Darwin airport. However, on 22 November 1978, there was a major failure involving loss of communication, air traffic control, navigation and power supply systems as a result of extreme thunderstorm activity. Difficulties were experienced in quickly returning facilities to service because of the extensive nature of the faults and failure of the emergency supply system. </para>
            <para>For some years the reliability of the power supply system at Darwin airport has been of concern to the Department of Transport and also to the Department of Defence which has the prime responsibility for this joint-user airport, including the operation and maintenance of a major portion of the airport electrical system. During 1978 and 1979, the Department of Transport in conjunction with the Department of Defence undertook a review of the civil aviation operating and serviceability requirements of the power supply system at Darwin airport. As a consequence action is in hand by the Department of Defence to progressively upgrade the system. </para>

          <para>While this program is aimed at monitoring the financial position of health funds, the effectiveness of the program depends on the health funds providing timely and adequate information in order that an assessment of the financial situation can be made, lt is the responsibility of organisations to apply efficient management techniques and proper auditing procedures in order to detect any adverse trends that may develop and take appropriate steps to remedy the situation. The internal management of funds, which is a major cause of difficulties particularly with smaller funds, is outside the ambit of my Department in administering the National Health Act. In the normal course of events, it would have been appropriate for the management committee of Druids, having reviewed its financial situation, to have applied for an increase in contribution rates to compensate for any deterioration in the financial position. The decision to cease operations was taken by Druids&#39; board of management. </para>

The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister has provided the following answer lo the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The non-proclamation of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979 is attributable to industrial and other action taken by some staff organisations. These staff organisations sought through the arbitration process to have a determination made which would have the effect of overriding certain provisions of that Act. The matter came before the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which has announced ils decision but no determination has yet been made. </para>
            <para>The purpose of the Act is to rationalise and co-ordinate provisions relating to the redeployment and retirement of staff in Commonwealth employment, and it might be regarded as a codification of those provisions. The Government&#39;s consistent altitude has been that both voluntary retirement and management-initiated retirement are inextricably linked. This is reflected by the inclusion of both measures together in the Act. </para>
            <para>I am advised that it is not possible to estimate with any certainty the number of persons who may wish to take advantage of the early retirement provisions of the Act. However it is well known that many long-serving public servants feel that they have served the country well and want to take advantage of the proposed early retirement provisions. </para>
            <para>On 20 December 1 979 a Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission decided that a determination should be made to give effect to procedures in relation to redeployment and retirement, and directed the Public Service Board and staff organisations to confer on the terms of such a determination. Discussions between the Board and staff organisations began on 29 February 1980, and are still continuing. The Government has decided that it will consider the question of proclamation of the Act when the terms of the Commission&#39;s determination are available. </para>
            <para>The introduction of early retirement in the Commonwealth sector could be expected to result in some increased job opportunities as vacancies flow down the line, as well as providing promotional opportunities for Commonwealth employees. I should emphasise, however, that the primary purpose of this Act is to provide a framework for the better management of personnel across Commonwealth employment and overall further improve the efficiency of Commonwealth bodies. </para>

          <para>The Government accepts that the health and well-being of children is a matter of national concern. My Department is at present giving a high priority to nutritional aspects of health, and nutritionists in the Department are developing better nutrition education programs for the Australian people including children. A major step taken by my Department has been the drawing up and adoption of a food and nutrition policy, which makes specific mention of children&#39;s needs. </para>

          <para>The Working Party is presently considering the matter of the influence of television on the eating habits of children. The Working Party has now met twice and, when it has completed its deliberations, will make its recommendations through the appropriate committees of the NH &#38; MRC to Council for consideration. </para>

          <para>The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Australian Engineering Industry Employment Mission, organised by the Metal Trades Industry Association, which visited several European countries in February, March and April this year recruited some 600 skilled metal and electrical tradesmen. The number of tradesmen actually arriving in Australia will depend in part upon the nominees (and their families) meeting immigrant entry requirements. The recruitment mission was subject to the usual immigration criteria applying to employment nominations, in particular, verification by my Department that the tradesmen could not be obtained from the local labour market in the time scale involved. In this particular case the tradesmen were mainly sought for firms in the Parramatta, Bankstown and Alexandria areas of Sydney where there has been a consistent shortage of metal workers for some time. </para>
            <para>With regard to your request that the Government implement a formula requiring metal trades employers to institute one additional apprenticeship for every tradesman imported I must point out that legislative and administrative responsibility for apprenticeship lies with the States and it is not the Commonwealth&#39;s function to determine apprenticeship employment levels. The Commonwealth does however provide financial incentive, primarily through the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training (CRAFT) Scheme, to encourage apprenticeship employment. </para>
            <para>You also requested that continued residence for immigrant tradesmen be subject to review after a period of three years. Immigration to Australia is for permanent settlement and is not subject to review after residence has been taken up. </para>

Further, does the Minister not agree that the profit related to net tangible assets would be a more reliable indicator of return? Is the Minister aware that a substantial part of that profit is due to the company&#39;s compliance with successive Government requirements as to restructuring? Is the Minister aware also that such compliance necessarily leads to a situation of reduced employment with high-producing, world-efficient machinery?

          <quote>
            <para>I am aware that Bonds Coats Patons Ltd reported a 22 percent profit increase in the year to 3 1 December 1 979. The accounting profession recognises a number of ways of measuring profitability including the return on shareholders funds and return on net tangible assets employed in a particular manufacturing operation. The latter method is useful for making comparisons between firms and between different manufacturing operations. </para>
            <para>Clearly a satisfactory level of profitability is required to enable firms to continue to operate in the longer term in any industry. </para>
            <para>I am aware that Bonds Coats Patons Ltd. has made strong efforts to modernise and rationalise the company&#39;s facilities over recent years and higher productivity and improved earnings have been the result. According to public statements by the company, the recently reported profit growth reflected the capital expenditure program of the last five years rather than an expansion of sales. </para>
            <para>Draft Industries Assistance Commission reports are designed to promote informed public discussion of the issues; they do not call for comment or decision by the Government. </para>
            <para>Decisions on assistance arrangements to apply beyond mid- 1 98 1 will be taken shortly by the Government in the light of the recommendations contained in the recently submitted final report of the IAC and a considerable volume of other information is available to the Government. </para>

            <para>The Industries Assistance Commission conducts an annual survey of the profitability and capital structure of the Australian manufacturing sector and the latest available figures relate to 1977-78.

            <para>Profitability may be expressed in a number of ways; two ratios calculated by the Commission are set out below.

          <para>The answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The honourable senator&#39;s question makes reference to media speculation that the cost to the public purse of the proposed Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting Corporation (IMBC) could be up to $140m. This is a grossly exaggerated estimate and highly inconsistent with the true facts as will be illustrated by my answer to the second part of the honourable senator&#39;s question which relates to the cost of establishing and operating the services of the new Corporation. </para>
            <para>The 1979-80 appropriations to the Special Broadcasting Service included $2.3m to cover Implementation Committee and Task Force costs, the build-up of forward program stocks as well as initial capital costs in relation to program postarrival processing/dubbing facilities, presentation facilities and transmitters. </para>
            <para>For 1980-81 the current estimate for IMBC capital and operating costs in respect of the multicultural television services in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne is $23m. A further $ 1 .8m is estimated to be required in 1 980-8 1 to establish both the UHF and VHF transmitting facilities for these services. </para>
            <para>The existing ethnic radio services now operated by the Special Broadcasting Service, namely stations 2EA and 3EA, will be absorbed by the IMBC without change to the nature of their services or their technical facilities, and are estimated to cost $3.2min 1980-81. </para>
            <para>On-going administrative costs for the Corporation will be in the order of Sim. </para>
            <para>In summary therefore, the estimated costs of the IMBC services which have been, or will shortly be, submitted for Government consideration are as follows: </para>

          <graphic href="086232198008191_91_19.jpg" />
        </para>
        <para>lt will be appreciated that the above amounts include significant &#39;one time&#39; establishment capital costs in the order of $5. 8m which will not be repeated in subsequent years. In addition, some offsetting advertising revenue can be anticipated during 1980-81. </para>
        <para>As indicated earlier, the anticipated costs for the IMBC service which I have just outlined bear little resemblance to the speculative figure of SI 40m mentioned in a number of press articles. </para>
        <para>On the question of possible costs for 198 1-82 and 1982-83, it is not anticipated that total annual appropriations will increase significantly. Capital costs will be less, but much will depend on whether the proposed transmission hours of 35 hours per week for the initial service are increased in subsequent years, and also whether local program content is increased above the approximate level of 25 per cent anticipated in 1980-81. These factors will be better assessed on the basis of consultation and research following an appropriate period of operation of the television service. </para>

          <para class="block">Carrick a question without notice in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs in the Senate. The question concerned information on the Government&#39;s apprenticeship support schemes and the rate of expenditure of funds through the various manpower training schemes. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Apart from the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme (CRAFT) mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> the Government has taken a number of measures to increase apprenticeship intakes in order to meet the demand for skilled labour. These include the provision of full-time preapprenticeship courses, the expansion of the Group One- Year Scheme, the promotion of group apprenticeship schemes and a review of apprentice intakes by Commonwealth departments and instrumentalities. An additional and very recent initiative was the Government&#39;s decision to pay a $ 1 ,000 rebate, under CRAFT, to employers for each additional first year apprentice taken on between 1 December 1979 and 30 June 1980 compared with the same period a year earlier. </para>
            <para>In addition the Commonwealth stands ready to develop special trade training arrangements in co-operation with State Governments to cope with the expected shortage of skilled workers arising from foreshadowed major development projects. Already special arrangements have been made with Western Australia in an attempt to prevent skill shortages impeding the development of the North-west Shelf. </para>
            <para>These arrangements involve making available subsidies, from various programs administered by my Department, to employers as an incentive to their providing employment and training to apprentices over and above their current needs. By this mechanism and by associated changes to the Western Australian technical education year a program of accelerated apprenticeship training has been developed which, depending on employer response, will lead to an additional 1 ,000 tradesmen being produced in that State by 1 984. </para>
            <para>With regard to the second matter you raised, based on estimates provided by my Department early this year details of projected under expenditure on NEAT and CRAFT were included in the Department of Finance information paper entitled &#39;Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations made by Appropriation Act No. 1 and Appropriation Act No. 2&#39;, which was tabled in the Parliament on I April 1980. lt is important, however, to recognise that the actual expenditure on these programs will not be known until after 30 June 1980. </para>
            <para>While there remains a probability that there will be under expenditure on these programs it is expected (hat the number of persons assisted will not differ significantly from the target figure. I expect that the actual number assisted in 1979-80 will be in the order of 200,000. </para>

            <para>The airlines have stands, pumps and extension nozzles available at those ports where aircraft remain overnight and are liable to collect frost. Ethylene glycol or isopropyl alcohol is used as a de-icing fluid. Engineers are on duty at all ports where it is expected that de-icing may be required. I am informed that there is no programmed training by airlines in the use of ice and frost removal equipment but on-the-job training is practised. Some commuter operators use rigs and procedures similar to the airlines, others use warm water to clear their aircraft of frost. The Air Navigation Regulations place the responsibility on the pilot-in-command to ensure that all external surfaces of the aircraft are free from frost and ice immediately before take off on any flight. </para>

            <para>I am concerned not only at the rise in business bankruptcies, but also at the rise in non-business bankruptcies. However, 1 consider that it is not correct to infer from the statistics that this rise is a consequence of factors over which the individual person has no control. The Annual Reports on the operation of the Bankruptcy Act clearly show (see copies of Schedule 10 Part A attached) that, in each year since 1 975-76, the most common causes of business bankruptcies were: </para>

            <para>I have caused departmental officers to prepare for your information (see attached schedule) a further analysis from Schedule 10 of these three most common causes of bankruptcy showing, in percentage form, the incidence in which they were the major cause of business bankruptcies or the most significant secondary cause. </para>
            <para>The figures clearly show that the rise in the number of bankruptcies is more directly related to general business incompetence and lack of working capital than to anything else. 1 have noted the article in the Australian Financial Review to which your question refers. On my reading of it, the article merely confirms what the statistics referred to above show fairly conclusively. The business people referred to in the article are quoted as saying that the difficulties confronting small businesses are caused by: </para>

            <para>Generally, it is for entrepreneurs and consumers to decide whether or not a market should exist, its degree of concentration and range of choice available.

          <para>The reduction of staff at Peterborough has been estimated by ANR at 137, arising mainly from the construction of the Adelaide to Crystal Brook standard gauge railway. </para>
          <para>This new railway will facilitate the movement of rail traffic between Adelaide and New South Wales, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. It will reduce the demand for time-consuming bogie exchanging at Peterborough with a consequent reduction in demand for staff both at the bogie exchanges and in ancillary services. </para>
          <para>ANR has advised that, from the inception of the project, reductions in staff have been carefully planned. The Commission has re-affirmed its policy that no employees will be retrenched and there will be close consultation with employees and unions in offering alternative employment where necessary. ANR has also been in contact with the Peterborough Council on these matters. </para>
          <para>Although there will be a significant reduction in ANR staff numbers at Peterborough, the town will remain an important rail centre. Peterborough will retain its role as a major operational centre with respect to crewing, marshalling, examining and repairs. The bogie exchange will be retained for emergency use, manned by locomotive depot staff. </para>

            <para>My Department has under consideration a proposal that two pilots be required for operating commuter aircraft having a passenger seat configuration of 1 0 seats or more, because of the added safety and more effective passenger control which in certain circumstances a properly co-ordinated crew can provide. This, and other proposals which resulted from a review undertaken by my Department over recent months, have been placed before interested industry organisations for consideration and comment. If this proposal is implemented, aircraft such as the Metroliner will require two pilots when operating on commuter services. </para>

            <para>As the new scheme relies to  a  much greater extent on volunteer support from the community for the administration and training of cadets, there is less diversion of Defence funds from their primary purpose. </para>
            <para>The  President  of the Returned Services League in Western Australia is reported to have said at the State Congress of the RSL that the  League  did not see the (cadet) movement as an adjunct to the Defence Force  but  rather as a community youth project. This is also the view of the Government. </para>
            <para>The community has a duty along with the Government to ensure that our young people develop the qualities of leadership, self reliance and loyalty. </para>
            <para>For its part the Government provides: uniforms: support for annual camps by way of rations, accommodation and equipment; a travel subsidy to enable cadets to attend annual camp; and payment of allowances to officers and instructors of cadets. </para>
            <para>Expenditure for 1 979-80 on the cadet scheme is in the order of $6m. </para>
            <para>Adequate community involvement and support are essential if cadet units are to operate successfully in accordance with the new scheme&#39;s guidelines. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>There are several points which should be made in response to this question. First, for many years income tax investment incentives have been given by way of direct deduction from income, rather than through rebates, and there were no features of the measures announced by the Prime Minister on 1 4 April 1980 that would have warranted a departure from that longstanding practice. Secondly, the 1 4 April measures apply to all capital expenditures for the conveyance, storage and distribution of water for use in a primary production business, and not only to irrigation systems. Thirdly, the question of incentives for soil conservation is still under study. Finally, while a rate of subsidy approaching 105 per cent may be theoretically possible, having regard to the realities of on-farm situations I think that the likelihood of such a rate would need to be heavily discounted in practice. </para>

              <para>(a) and (e) lt is true that the number of deaths from motor accidents in Australia of persons aged 1 5-24 years has risen greatly in the last 20 years. The document to which the honourable senator is referring is an article entitled &#39;Mortality from motor vehicle accidents in the 15-24 year age group&#39; which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">WHO Quarterly Statistics Report,</inline> Volume 32, Number 3, 1979. The article analyses mortality from motor vehicle accidents in the 15-24 year age groups since 1 955, using data provided by Member States, and comments on a world-wide trend towards increased numbers of deaths of young persons from road accidents. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The article considers that alcohol abuse, when combined with driving, is a major factor contributing to the increased number of road deaths among youth, due to the inexperience of young persons in both drinking and driving. The article points out also that alcohol abuse is also directly associated in some countries with an increase in one other cause of accidental death in this age group, namely drowning. Australian experience supports this conclusion. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(7)">
              <para>(b, c, d) The data presented require clarification. The number of deaths referred to in the Report are annual averages, not total deaths, for the five-year periods 1955-59 and 1970-74. For example, an average of 535 Australians aged 15-24 years died in motor vehicle accidents in each year of the period 1955-59 compared with an average of 1357 persons in the same age bracket in each year of the period 1 970-74. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Similarly, an average of 2286 Australians in all age groups died in motor vehicle accidents in each year of the period 1955-59, compared with an average of 3802 persons in all age groups in each year of the period 1 970-74. </para>
          <para>The percentage increases in deaths of young persons as a result of motor accidents in the periods 1955-59 and 1970-74 compared with percentage increases in deaths in all age groups from this cause in the same period are not affected by the use of averages and are as stated. </para>
          <para>To present a meaningful interpretation of these percentages, however, it is necessary to take account of changes which have occurred between 1955 and 1974 in population numbers, in the number of vehicles registered and in overall road usage. For example, the average number of vehicles registered each year in the period 1955-59 was approximately 2,455,000 compared with an average of about 5,503,000 per year in the period 1970-74. If the factor of increased vehicle usage is introduced, the figures appear somewhat less dramatic, as illustrated in the following table: </para>

There was no quantification of the amount by which consumption of crude oil in any particular country should be reduced as a result of the decision taken by the IEA Governing Board on 21 and 22 May 1979; that decision recognised each country&#39;s particular oil requirements and policies already in place to meet the then current situation. Australian production of crude oil averaged 11.5 million barrels per month during the first five months of 1980. This compares with an average monthly production of 13.3 million barrels per month in 1979. Details of consumption of petroleum products in Australia for 1979 and for 1979-80 were provided in my press statements of 2 1 February 1980 and 30 July 1980 respectively. </para>

              <para>1 ) As a basic objective, the Government welcomes foreign investment in Australia because of the contribution it makes to the development of Australia&#39;s resources and the benefits that are associated with such development. At the same time, the Government considers that, where practicable, Australians should have opportunities to participate in the development of new natural resource projects. Accordingly, the objective of the Government&#39;s foreign investment policy is that, as a general rule, new natural resource development projects (excluding uranium) should have at least 50 per cent Australian equity and joint Australian/foreign control. New uranium developments are expected to have at least 75 per cent Australian equity and should be Australian controlled. In cases where 75 per cent Australian equity is clearly unobtainable, alternative proposals will be considered where there is a minimum of at least 50 per cent Australian equity and Australian participants have a major role in determining the policy of the project. Arrangements may be required to increase the level of Australian participation over an agreed period. </para>

Special parking bays were reserved or ample parking provided for 326 (47 per cent) of the library facilities. The term library facilities encompasses, for example, the branches of a regional library system or of a university as well as single location institutions.

The Working Party&#39;s Report was published in April 1979, and made a number of recommendations aimed at improving the provision of library services to the visually and physically handicapped in Australia. The National Library Council has accepted the recommendations and the Library will give priority to their implementation as resources permit. In particular, these will involve the creation and maintenance of a union catalogue of library materials for handicapped people, the operation of a clearinghouse for co-operation in transcribing materials into special formats and for obtaining the necessary copyright clearances, and assistance in obtaining national and international inter-library loans. </para>

          <para>In accordance with a recommendation of the Working Parly on Library Services for the Handicapped the National Library has recently established a National Advisory Committee on Library Services for the Handicapped. The Committee&#39;s terms of reference are to consider the special needs of handicapped people for library services and to advise the National Library Council on the organisation, development, co-ordination and operation of these services to meet these needs. A detailed statement of the terms of reference is included in the Report of the Working Party, published by the National Library in April 1979. The Advisory Committee held its first meeting on 2 June 1 980. </para>
          <para>In March 1 980 the Library published the first issue of <inline font-style="italic">Linkup</inline> - a newsletter intended as a medium for the dissemination and exchange of information of interest to librarians and agencies serving the handicapped. The first part of the National Union Catalogue of Special Library Materials for the Handicapped will be issued shortly. The Library is investigating sources and conditions of supply of specially-made captioned films for the deaf, and has started quarterly showings of such films in the Library&#39;s theatre. The Film Collection also has video cassettes suitable for mentally retarded adolescents and a series dealing with the problems of the physically handicapped. A list of films acquired will be issued during 1981. </para>
          <para>A bibliography on the handicapped is being prepared by the Library. This will cover selected Australian materials, predominantly in the Social Sciences, from the beginning of Australia&#39;s history to the present. Emphasis will be given to access and prevention as major themes of the International Year of Disabled Persons, lt is expected that the bibliography will be published later in 1980. Development of a comprehensive lending collection, for nation wide distribution, of films on industrial safety and the placement of disabled people in the work force is also underway. </para>
          <para>The NCDC is also examining means of improving the physical access to the National Library building. </para>

            <para>Petrol consumption has declined in the first half of 1980 by 2.0 per cent compared with the first half of 1 979, reflecting the success of the Government&#39;s initiatives to conserve liquid fuels. This has led to relatively high stock levels of motor spirit. Discounting of petrol prices partly reflects this position as well as competitive pressures within the industry. Prices found justified by the Prices Justification Tribunal are maximum wholesale prices and companies are free to exercise their own commercial judgment, taking account of the competitive position, in setting their wholesale price up to the approved maximum. In addition, retailers are free within any limits which might be set by State legislation, to set their own retail price. In relation to petroleum product retailing, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs announced on 22 July 1980 the action the Government proposed to take. </para>

            <para>The reality is that the most formidably armed state in the history of the world, a state which moreover claims the right to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries in support of so-called &#39;progressive&#39; forces, has thrust ils military power into a highly sensitive and volatile region. In these circumstances, to believe that the weaker countries of the region are not threatened is to trust in the restraint and moderation of the Soviet Union when it has just invaded a neighbour and when it is engaged in a relentless effort to achieve global military superiority. It does no service to the cause of peace to obscure this reality. </para>

Is the Minister aware that Australian universities in particular are concerned that their endowed scholarship funds have been so devalued by these overseas processes that, in comparison with levels six years ago, only one-sixth the number of Australian students can now benefit? I ask that, notwithstanding the priority for postgraduate awards in Australia being increased towards 800 awards each year, consideration be given in the national interest to increasing the provision for Australian postgraduate study and training overseas so that there is nol a gross deterioration in this kind of experience being gained by Australia? </para>

            <para>I am aware that fees for students from overseas studying at universities in the United Kingdom have risen sharply in the last few years, and that some endowed scholarship funds may be affected by these increases. It is the Government&#39;s view that priority in student assistance expenditure should be given to assisting students undertaking courses at Australian institutions. There is however provision under the Postgraduate Awards Scheme for Research Award holders to undertake up to one year of study at an overseas institution. </para>
            <para>There are no schemes funded by my Department under which awards are currently offered to Australians for study towards overseas postgraduate qualifications. Some postgraduate awards are offered to Australians by overseas governments. My Department assists in the publicity and selection of these awards, and reciprocates them to some extent through schemes such as the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan. My Department also makes an annual grant to the Australian-American Educational Foundation which also receives funds from the US Government and provides awards at the postgraduate level. Both Governments have increased the amount of their contributions in recent years to maintain the level of awards. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Teague&#39;s</inline>inquiry was referred to my Department which has consulted the Education Research and Development Committee (ERDC). One of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee report on its Inquiry into the Impact of Television on the Development and Learning Behaviour of Children was (Recommendation 6) that when giving future consideration to the commissioning of research, the Commonwealth educational authorities give a higher priority to research into the effects of television on the learning behaviour or children. This, together with the related Recommendations 4 and 5, were brought to the notice of the ERDC for consideration when initiating research into areas of importance in education. The ERDC is responsible not only for initiating research into such areas but also for recommending financial support for proposals submitted to it by other organisations and individuals. The  Chairman  of ERDC and a member of the Committee subsequently had discussion with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson.</inline> In its recent call for applications ERDC did not receive any applications for research into the educational effectiveness of the use of television in schools. As a consequence, the ERDC will now be examining problems raised in the Senate Standing Committee report and in the light of established priorities, will consider the possibility of commissioning a study along the lines proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Teague.</inline></para>

          <para>The Minister for Health has provided the following information: </para>
          <quote>
          <para>I am aware of the technique developed in the United States by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kingsbury</inline> Heiple. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Heiple</inline> has over a 1 5 months period inserted S I joints into 22 patients. This is a very small series and the follow-up time to observe the results of the implants has been extremely short. The technique can therefore only be considered as being in the clinical trial stage. </para>
          <para>I am advised that the technique used by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Heiple</inline> of cementing articulated joints into the bone channels is by no means a new development. To date, however, it has been found that this technique is inferior to that most commonly used in Australia. In practice, implantation of the more complex articulated finger joints has not always resulted in the production of a stable joint. Sheer fractures and loosening of the prostheses have been two of the more common complications that have arisen. Many different types of articulated joints have been tried but none has been found to be superior to the procedure known as the Swanson Arthroplasty. This operation is the one most commonly performed in Australia and overseas and involves the insertion of a pliable silastic spacer between the ends of the bone and the body tissues to form an artificial joint which is both stable and comfortable. </para>
