      <para>His Excellency was pleased to deliver the following speech: </para>
	  <quote>
        <para>Senators and Members of the House of Representatives: </para>
        <para>This 32nd Parliament assembles following a general election in which the people of Australia have again returned my Government with a substantial majority. </para>
        <para>My Government regards this manifestation of the people's choice as a mandate to maintain the basic thrust of the policies which have been followed over the past five years. </para>
        <para>These policies are designed to work for the well-being of all Australians and to develop a society which maximises the rewards of individual effort and initiative, and which also respects the right of individuals to shape their own lives. </para>
        <para>The Government's program is set out comprehensively in the policy speech which the Prime Minister delivered to the nation on 30 September of this year and in the supplementary statements which accompanied that speech. My Government is committed to the whole of that program and will work with determination to implement it as fully and rapidly as possible. </para>
        <para>I emphasise this because in this speech I shall focus on some of the key elements of that program rather than merely recite the whole of it in bald form. The fact that I do so should not be interpreted as meaning that areas not mentioned by me are in any way downgraded or discarded by my Government. A selection is made in order to keep the speech within reasonable limits, but the program stands in its entirety. </para>
	    <para>
	      <inline font-style="italic">Unemployment and Youth</inline>
	    </para>
        <para>The first element of that program to which I wish to draw particular attention is the provision it contains for overcoming unemployment in general and particularly for stimulating the employment of youth. This is placed first because of the great importance my Government attaches to it. </para>
        <para>In recent years, and for a number of reasons, the question of jobs for young people has emerged as a crucial one, not only in Australia but in virtually all Western countries. It is not only an economic problem but a social one. Indeed, for the young people involved and their families it is a major psychological and human problem. </para>
        <para>My Government believes that the long-term solution to it undoubtedly lies in the creation of new jobs by restoring healthy economic growth, and in this respect Australia is much better placed than many other industrial countries. Over the next few years, resources and manufacturing development projects will certainly create tens of thousands of new jobs. </para>
        <para>But the matter cannot be left there, has not been left there, and will not be left there. </para>
        <para>During the last five years over half a million Australians have received specific help through my Government's manpower and training programs. Nearly another quarter million will receive assistance during this year. </para>
        <para>My Government has a clear and firm commitment to youth, exemplified by its announcement of new initiatives, including the introduction of a new allowance to encourage young unemployed persons to take advantage of training opportunities, the expansion of its work experience programs and the provision of improved counselling services. </para>
        <para>All of these initiatives will be in place by February next year. </para>
        <para>During 1981 my Government will take action to place increased emphasis on employment and training schemes. </para>
        <para>A framework is being established within which the Government's training programs will provide a wide range of incentives and allowances to increase the supply of skills required for economic development, and to assist the unemployed, particularly the young and disadvantaged, to obtain employment. </para>
	    <para>
	      <inline font-style="italic">The Economy</inline>
	    </para>
        <para>I turn now to the economic policies of my Government. These policies are determined by and given coherence by an economic strategy which is designed to restore economic stability and improve growth within a medium term framework. Sudden large changes in economic policies will continue to be avoided. </para>
        <para>This strategy has already resulted in an encouraging pick-up in activity and employment and a marked strengthening in business investment. There is, however, a continued need for the firm application of consistent policies to reduce inflation and to allow our national resources to be employed in areas where the highest economic return can be obtained. </para>
        <para>A primary objective of my Government will be to continue the fight against inflation. Inflation results in fewer jobs and lower living standards for everybody. Firm anti-inflationary fiscal and monetary policies are therefore essential to any lasting solution to the problems of unemployment, the achieving of higher growth and the more rapid raising of living standards, on a sustainable basis. </para>
        <para>My Government believes that there is no realistic alternative to such policies, and that alternative policies, including those which are inappropriately described as stimulatory, would set back the economic recovery now under way and create renewed uncertainty. </para>
        <para>My Government will give particular attention to encouraging the growth of the private sector and to increasing the freedom of choice of taxpayers in spending their own incomes. It will be an important policy objective to continue to restrain public expenditure so as to provide scope for reducing the burden of taxation. </para>
        <para>Improved private sector growth will require further improvements in business profitability, which still provides insufficient incentive to increased investment in many industries. My Government's policies will, therefore, seek to contain wage increases in the short term, in the interests of expanding aggregate employment and income over the medium term. </para>
        <para>Private sector growth is dependent on secure supplies of energy. My Government will continue to pursue this objective by allowing the price of liquid fuels in particular to reflect so far as possible the operation of market forces. This policy is encouraging the development of a diversified energy base, which will minimise Australia's reliance on imported liquid fuels, and is helping to conserve scarce Australian energy resources for future generations. </para>
        <para>My Government's economic policies have considerably improved Australia's international competitiveness and enhanced export opportunities for Australian industries. A sustained lift in exports and a higher level of capital inflow will increase Australia's capacity to import and to undergo the structural changes which allow economic growth to build upon itself as resources move to areas of higher profitability. My Government will encourage this process within an economic environment in which industry can invest for the future with confidence. </para>
        <para>In the context of the economy, my Government wishes to make a simple but vital philosophical point. Discussion of the economy and of economic policy has become so abstract, so specialised, so dominated by statistics and rarefied concepts that the connection between it and the lives of ordinary people is in danger of being obscured if not lost sight of altogether. It is essential that it be understood that economics and people are linked, that economic policy must serve human objectives and that the discussion be conducted in such a way that it becomes clear that what are being talked about are the jobs, incomes, assets and prospects of men and women. My Government will make a serious effort to give a lead in this respect, recognising that continuing public understanding and support are vital to the success of its policies, not least in the contribution they can make to the urgent task of improving industrial relations in this country. </para>
		<para>
		  <inline font-style="italic">Caring for People</inline>
		</para>
        <para>In what I have said about unemployment, youth and the economy, I have stressed my Government's concern with the human dimensions of the issues involved. It believes that the only legitimate yardstick for assessing any policy is not conformity to an ideology, not the strengthening of the state, but the effectiveness of that policy in enhancing the lives of people. This is the fundamental concern of my Government. </para>
        <para>This concern expresses itself in a diverse range of measures to which my Government is committed: </para>
        <para>It is evident in the commitment of my Government to a range of social security and welfare measures which will strengthen the family and through it the basic social fabric of this country. My Government has already introduced a number of measures designed to assist families. It will be looking closely at its policies with the objective of further enhancing the position of Australian families. </para>
        <para>It is evident in programs to subsidise accommodation for aged persons, to assist homeless persons, to assist low or moderate income earners in house purchasing, and in the strong commitment made by my Government to welfare housing. </para>
        <para>It is evident in the programs developed in the context of the International Year of Disabled Persons 1981 to assist the education of severely handicapped children and to increase employment opportunities for the disabled. </para>
        <para>It is evident in the commitment to improve aboriginal health standards. </para>
        <para>It is evident in the area of ethnic affairs, in the commitment to provide services both to help migrants adjust to life in Australia and to help them to maintain in Australia the cultural heritages of the countries from which they came. </para>
        <para>It is evident in the commitment to encourage excellence in a number of fields- for example, to provide greater support and improved facilities for research, to encourage the arts and to provide greater opportunity for young Australian athletes. </para>
        <para>This list is illustrative rather than exhaustive. My Government sets it out to establish that it cares deeply about the quality of life lived in Australia and that it is determined to give practical expression to that care. In doing so, my Government's objective will be not to increase long-term dependence on the Government, but, consistent with its liberal philosophy, to provide the means whereby people can become more independent and freer to choose the lives they want to live. </para>
		<para>
		  <inline font-style="italic">The Public Service</inline>
		</para>
        <para>I have mentioned the liberal philosophy of my Government. My Government wishes it to be clearly understood that it is in terms of that philosophy that it approaches the questions of growth in Government expenditure, in the public sector, and in the size of the Public Service. Its concern to maintain strict control over that growth is not based on any animus against the Public Service. It does not subscribe to the crude and usually uninformed hostility towards that Service which sometimes receives popular expression. It recognises and appreciates the contribution which the Public Service as a whole makes to the life of this country. </para>
        <para>But my Government does believe profoundly that it is vitally important that the power and functions of the State should be limited and contained. It does believe that the State is likely to be in many ways an inefficient and wasteful provider and that many services can be better supplied in other ways. And it does believe that the expansion of private enterprise is the best means to achieve the well-being and health of a society. </para>
        <para>For these reasons, my Government recently announced the establishment of a Committee of Senior Ministers to review the functions of all Commonwealth departments and associated agencies. The review will recommend to the Government which functions might be reduced, eliminated or altered so as to achieve a more efficient and economical administration. The review will also examine areas where Commonwealth activities overlap with those of the States or unnecessarily intrude into areas of activity capable of being performed efficiently by the private sector. </para>
        <para>The review is part of a continuing process of restraint on the public sector which has been maintained since my Government came to office. In that period the number of Commonwealth employees in areas subject to staff ceilings has been reduced by over 10,000. This has been achieved without weakening those areas of the administration where there are special needs. In fact, the numbers employed by the Department of Social Security have actually increased by 3,000 in the last five years, and the staff of the Commonwealth Employment Service has grown by about 1 ,000 in the same period. </para>
        <para>My Government will continue to ensure that Commonwealth activities are concentrated in areas of greatest need and that the adequacy of those services, appropriately provided by the Commonwealth, is maintained. </para>
		<para>
		  <inline font-style="italic">Foreign Affairs and Defence</inline>
		</para>
        <para>The last area of policy to which I shall refer is that of foreign affairs and defence. </para>
        <para>The past year has seen a significant heightening of international tension and uncertainty. While we must hope that it turns out to be mistaken, it must be recognised that the consensus of informed opinion, at present, is that the period encompassed by the life of this Parliament is likely to be a troubled and tense one in international affairs. </para>
        <para>The foreign policy priorities of my Government are clear. It is very conscious of the need for a strong and united Western stance towards the Soviet Union and to this end it will work to maintain its already strong ties with its traditional allies, and in particular with the United States. It should be clearly understood that it will do so out of an appreciation of Australia's needs and interests and for no other reason. </para>
        <para>Beyond this my Government will concentrate its efforts heavily within the region, broadly defined, and on the Commonwealth of Nations. Through the instrumentality of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting, my Government has succeeded in linking these two areas of interest in a new and advantageous way - and of linking both in turn with our interest in Third World matters. </para>
        <para>Australia has been chosen as host of the 1981 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. This will be the largest and most important international conference ever to have been held in this country. It will take place at a time when discussions of north/south issues will be receiving a new impetus and it should be able to make a valuable contribution to the discussion of those issues. </para>
        <para>In the present state of international tension, my Government is mindful that its first responsibility is the nation's security and it has taken appropriate steps to enhance Australia's defence preparedness. The 1980-81 Budget provides for a real increase in defence spending of about 7 per cent. Further substantial real increases in resources are planned in the years to 1984-85 by which time defence expenditure is expected to have risen to about 3 per cent of gross domestic product. </para>
        <para>My Government believes that it is imperative that Australia should move to improve its defence self-reliance and should play its part in strengthening the international forces working for stability at the global and regional levels. </para>
		<para>
		  <inline font-style="italic">Conclusion</inline>
		</para>
        <para>I have outlined important parts of my Government's program and policies for the next three years. In doing so I have made some passing references to the beliefs which provide the underlying rationale of these policies and give them coherence. </para>
        <para>My Government believes that this- an explanation to the Australian people of the ideas, principles and values in terms of which the Government of the day shapes its policies - is something which has been somewhat neglected in Australia and that this neglect has diminished the quality of political life of the country. It believes that this should be remedied. During the life of this Parliament, therefore, my Government will be making a serious and sustained effort to explain to the Australian people the philosophy on which it bases its approach to governing - a philosophy which it sees as liberal in its principles, flexible and undogmatic in its application of those principles to the realities of Australian life and conservative in its distrust of abrupt and sweeping changes as a means of achieving desired ends. </para>

Under Standing Order 1 1 3, a senator may not give two notices of motion consecutively if another senator has a notice to give. In order to facilitate the work of the Senate may I suggest that any honourable senator proposing to give more than one notice of motion should seek leave to give all his notices at the one time and, if applicable, in accordance with the circulated lists I will then place all notices on the Notice Paper according to the order in which I normally would have called the honourable senators. </para>

            <para>I would like to read again, if I may, that which we have prepared to assist the Senate in its work this afternoon to facilitate these notices of motion being put correctly to the Senate and noted for further consideration, as is the normal procedure. I shall read the statement again. A number of senators wish to give notices of motion today. Under Standing Order 113 a senator may not give two notices of motion consecutively if another senator has a notice to give. In order to facilitate the work of the Senate may I suggest that any honourable senator proposing to give more than one notice of motion should seek leave to give all his notices at one time and, if applicable, in accordance with the circulated lists I will then place all notices of motion on the Notice Paper according to the order in which I normally would have called senators.</para>

The Senate notes that in 1979 a three years old Down's Syndrome boy was admitted to a 'recognised hospital' under Schedule B2 of the Commonwealth-Western Australia hospital costs sharing agreement and that he died the following day in circumstances in which his parents and many other people believe that insufficient effort was made to preserve the child's life.</para>

          <para>It is with very deep regret that I confirm to the Senate the death on 20 November 1980 of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen. I am sure that honourable senators will join me in paying tribute to a man who served his country and this Parliament so well for so many years. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen was a member of the House of Representatives for 36 years. A farmer himself, he always retained a deep understanding of the problems and concerns of rural Australians. He had been active in the Country Party before standing, successfully, as the Country Party candidate for Echuca in the 1934 general elections. After only three years as a member of parliament, he was appointed by Prime Minister Lyons to the portfolio of Minister for the Interior, a post which he held for one and a half years. He served with distinction as Minister for External Affairs in 1940 and as Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation in 1941 until the Fadden Government was defeated in the Parliament late in that year. In 1 940 and 1 941 he also served as a member of the War Cabinet. </para>
        </talk.start>
      <para>During his years in opposition he continued to serve the Parliament and his party. He was a member of the Australian Advisory War Council from 1941 to 1945 and he became  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party in 1 943. Upon the Menzies coalition's return to government in 1949, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen was appointed Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. In 1956 this portfolio was reorganised to become the ministry of Trade and in 1963 it was broadened to Trade and Industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> developed the portfolio throughout these changes, establishing close contacts with leaders of primary and secondary industries during a period when the emphasis of Australia's economy was shifting away from the rural sector. Determination and strength of character were hallmarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John's</inline> career from the time of his struggles to establish his Stanhope property during the Depression when other soldier settlers were turning away from the land. </para>
      <para>As Minister for Trade he had the responsibility of reconciling what many people saw as the contradictions inherent in the portfolio- the need for protection to develop local manufacturing versus the free trade favoured by rural and mining industries. That he achieved this without losing the support of traditional Country Party supporters is further testimony to his political skill. He remained in the Trade and Industry portfolio until his retirement in 1971. In 1958 he became leader of the Country Party and Deputy Prime Minister. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline>McEwen was one of only three Country Party Prime Ministers since Federation. He also served under the other two - Page in 1939 and Fadden in 1941. He assumed the prime ministership under tragic circumstances upon the disappearance in late 1967 of Prime Minister Harold Holt and he held that office for a brief 23 days. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> was a great Australian, a man for whom Australia always came first. He was an inspiration to all who knew him.  His  long, dedicated and distinguished service was acknowledged by the honours awarded to him. He was made a Privy Councillor in 1 953 and a Companion of Honour in 1969. Just prior to his retirement he was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> retired from Parliament and the Ministry in January 1971.

          <para>The Opposition joins the Government in paying respect to the life and work of the late Sir John McEwen. Sir John McEwen was a member of the Australian Parliament from 1934 to 1971, a period of nearly 40 years. During that period he served in many capacities as a member of parliament—a s Deputy Leader and then Leader of the Country Party, as Prime Minister and as a successful and influential minister in a number of portfolios. As the National Times put it in an article on 25 November this year in reviewing the public life of Sir John McEwen, he 'was a very good politician indeed, and one of the few Australian politicians of his generation who could be considered of world class in his own profession'.</para>
        </talk.start>
          <para>One of the reasons for considering him world class in his own profession was his quite formidable list of achievements. For example, he represented a rural based party founded in support of the principles of free trade and protection for the rural sector and maintained the support of this constituency throughout his career. As Minister for Trade and Industry he forged an alliance with, and achieved the backing of, Australia's expanding industrial manufacturing sector on the basis of a policy of high levels of protection for that sector. Later he was to form a similarly shrewd alliance with the mineral industries as the mining sector became a new source of Australian prosperity.</para>
          <para>His capacity to manage these conflicting interests was a measure of his political determination and his tough-minded concern for Australian interests as he saw them. Perhaps the best indication of that is the fact that he is one of the few politicians of his era whose work—philosophy, if honourable senators would prefer it—attracte d the status of an 'ism'. It was known as McEwenism. In his own way he had a considerable vision of the future of this country. Central to it was a belief in a strong, self-sufficient and technologically advanced Australia.</para>
          <para>Because of his vision and sense of purpose, he managed to ignore some of the intellectual straitjackets of his coalition partners and attained for the National Country Party an influence in the affairs of government in disproportion to its electoral support, members of parliament and intellectual capacity. In his latter years of public life, his belief in Australia's future manifested itself in a concern about national self-reliance and the nature of foreign investment in Australia. As he said in 1966:</para>
          <para>It is not good enough for this country to live by selling a bit of its heritage every year . . . we want industries, not just holes in the ground. </para>
          <para>Like Hamlet's ghost, these words may come back to haunt his successors of lesser vision. The Australian Labor Party acknowledges with respect the life and work of a distinguished member of parliament and a great Australian, and extends its sympathy to Lady McEwen.</para>

          <para>On this occasion I seek to extend the sympathy of myself and of my colleagues in the National Country Party to Sir John McEwen's widow, his friends and family. I had the privilege to serve for a few months during Sir John McEwen's time in this place, but it was sufficient time to enable me to recognise the qualities and the capacities of the man. I do not intend to extend on the statistics which have so rightly been given and which are referable to Sir John but I do intend to talk for a moment or two of the man himself. It is a quite remarkable exercise for anybody to have spent 36 years in this Parliament; to have spent 25 of them as a Minister of the Government; on something like 24 occasions as acting Prime Minister; once for a short period as Prime Minister; and for 13 years as the Leader of the National Country Party. That in itself is an extraordinary performance. It made Sir John McEwen perhaps a legend in his own time.</para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>John McEwen came from a very hard and tough background. An orphan at an early age, he joined the Australian Imperial Force in 1918 and did not go overseas as, fortunately, the war ended. He then became a solider settler and developed a very great love and a very great capacity for the land and for its operators. I believe it was fitting that he should have become the Minister for Trade for some 15 years with his sort of background and his great love for the area he represented. It is also important to remember that Sir John McEwan believed in Australia as a total entity. It was Sir John McEwan who saw the great necessity for the development, in parallel, of secondary industry alongside primary industry. It was Sir John McEwen who saw that this was indeed relevant in this country to the social, economic and defence capacity of our land.</para>
        <para>He was known—a s we are all aware—a s Black Jack McEwen. That is a somewhat fearsome title. I understand that in the field of debate and negotiation he was a worthy holder of that title. But as time went by I believe Black Jack became a term of endearment, of respect and of pride. Australians believed that Black Jack McEwen with his doggedness and his determination, his pride and his fairness represented those things that Australians believe make great Australians. It is our view that Sir John McEwen was a great Australian and I, along with my colleagues, add these comments and this measure of sympathy to Lady McEwen, his friends and associates.</para>

          <para>Mr  President, as a senator from the outback representing people in the Northern Territory, I wish to support this motion of condolence relating to the Right Honourable Sir John McEwen. In his 36 years in Parliament, his 28 years in government and 25 years as a member of the Cabinet, he gave considerable service to Australia. But I will speak very briefly this afternoon on the service that he gave to the people of the outback. He has been described as a dogged fighter for what he believed was right, an unforgiving enemy, a tireless worker and, above all, a great Australian citizen, and I believe that the people of the Northern Territory remember him as such.</para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We have heard of Flynn of the Inland. He was a prominent person. He brought to the outback what has been described as the mantle of safety. I believe that Sir John McEwen should share equally in this description because in his way he also brought about or assisted to bring about another mantle of safety for the people of the outback. In his years of service to Australia in this Parliament when he was Minister for the Interior—and now I go back to the 1930s— I believe that he was instrumental in encouraging a small bush airline, based in Alice Springs, to be set up. I refer to what in those days was called Connellan Airways. It was he who encouraged Mr E. J. Connellan to take on this work. In the late 1930s and 1940s when the bush was a very isolated place, this small airline served the people in the north, South Australia, western Queensland, the Northern Territory, and parts of the Kimberleys and Western Australia. In those days the airline actually serviced 128 airports, if I could call them airports. They included mining fields, Aboriginal settlements, pastoral leases, homesteads, and so on. I believe, through Sir John McEwen's encouragement to Mr E. J. Connelan, he brought much in the way of safety and communications and better living conditions to those people.</para>
        <para>I also wish to refer briefly to the assistance that Sir John McEwen gave to the people of the Northern Terrritory in their battle for constitutional rights. I was looking at a copy of the Northern Territory Hansard today. It states:</para>
        <para>The Council</para>
        <para>That is the Northern Territory Legislative Council—</para>
        <para>. . . resolved on 27 May 1970 that a delegation of three members be nominated by Mr President to proceed to Canberra for the purpose of conferring with the Prime Minister and other members of parliament on the subject of the grievances of the people of the Northern Territory.</para>
        <para>The delegation proceeded to Canberra on 1 June 1970 and held talks with the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for the Interior and members of all parties in the House of Representatives and the Senate.</para>
        <para>As a result the Minister for the Interior undertook to place a paper outlining proposals for constitutional change before the Cabinet.</para>
        <para>I was a member of that delegation which came to Canberra from the Legislative Council. I must say that while that delegation was received rather courteously by people within the Parliament, it felt that it was getting nowhere at all until it saw the Deputy Prime Minister who at that time was the Right Honourable Sir John McEwen. I believe that from the moment that delegation moved into his office the whole picture of constitutional reform for the Northern Territory changed. He was a battler for the people of the outback. By believing in them, he did much to bring about further constitutional change. I think that the milestone reached in the events which I have just described, when he said 'It will be done' and very firmly gave orders to do it, played a major part in the constitutional change in the Northern Territory which brought it to a state of responsible self-government. On-behalf of the people of the Northern Territory, I join with other honourable senators in supporting this motion of condolence. We remember Sir John McEwen as a fighter and as a guardian of the people of the outback.</para>

            </talker>
          <para>It is with regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 1 1 November 1980 of the Honourable Vincent Gair. The death of Vince Gair represents not only the end of a long political career- over some 60 years - but also the passing of an era which had lasting effects on the course of Australian politics. It is doubtful that we will see his like again. He was much a man shaped by the times in which he lived - two world wars, the depression of the 1930s and the post-war boom of the 1950s. </para>
        </talk.start>
      <para>Vince Gair was 14 years of age when he began his association with the Australian Labor Party and he was a member of the Queensland Branch for over 30 years. He served in the Queensland Parliament from 1932 to 1960, was a Minister from 1942 to 1952,  Deputy  Premier from 1947 to 1952, and Premier from 1952 until 1957, when his connection with the ALP was severed. He then formed the Queensland Labor Party, which later merged with the Australian Democratic Labor Party. It was as a representative of the DLP that he was elected as a senator for Queensland in 1965. He immediately became Leader of the DLP in the Senate, and held the position until 1973. In 1974 he resigned from the Senate to take up his appointment as Ambassador to Ireland. </para>
      <para>While a member of the Senate he contributed to the work of a number of parliamentary committees: The Library Committee from 1965 to 1974; the Senate Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade from 1970 to 1971; and the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House from 1969 to 1970. He was a member of several select committees of the Senate: The Senate Select Committee on the Container Method of Handling Cargoes from 1967 to 1968; the Senate Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources from 1967 to 1971; and the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution in 1 968. </para>
      <para>Vince Gair was an able politician. He was recognised as a tough, tenacious opponent who fought vigorously for what he believed was right. He was a courageous man who pursued his objectives regardless of the consequences for him or his associates. It was because he held to his convictions against pressure from the extraparliamentary ALP Executive that he lost the Queensland premiership and was expelled from the ALP. He earned the respect of his contemporaries for his astuteness as a bargainer and for the way in which he made the best use of his comprehensive understanding of constitutional, parliamentary and political processes to gain his objectives. </para>
      <para>Vince Gair has left his mark on many of the major political events of his time. The judgment as to the merits of his overall contribution to Australian political life over the greater part of this century is a matter for the historians. But Vince Gair will be remembered for his courage, his very real ability, and long and distinguished service to both Queensland and the Australia in which he fervently believed. Our sincere sympathy goes out to his widow and the members of his family in their bereavement. I move: </para>
      <motion>
        <para>Thai the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 1 1 November 1980, of the Honourable Vincent Clair Gair, Premier of the State of Queensland from 1952 to 1957, a senator for that State from 1 965 to 1 974, Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party from 1965 to 1973, and Ambassador to Ireland from 1 974 to 1 976; places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service; and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. </para>

          <para>Vincent Gair was a member of the Senate between 1964 and 1974. Prior to his election to the Senate, he followed a career in the Queensland Public Service before entering Queensland State politics in 1932. He was a member of the Queensland Parliament between 1932 and 1960 and, during that period, held several portfolios in the Queensland Government, including the position of Premier and Chief Secretary between 1952 and 1957. In the Senate, he served on a number of committees and was a member of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the United Nations in 1972. He was, I understand, a vigorous interjector and contributor to debates in the Senate. In 1974, he was appointed Australian Ambassador to the Republic of Ireland where he remained for a little over a year.</para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Vincent Gair was a controversial political figure and, as such, his place in the history books is assured. In the course of his 40 year political career he was a successful premier of a government in Queensland, leader of the Democratic Labor Party in the Senate and an ambassador. His political actions led to the defeat of the Government in Queensland, the ultimate demise of the Democratic Labor Party and arguably the double dissolution of the Federal Parliament in 1974. As a politician he had a great flair for the memorable phrase. He once said of himself: 'They may not love me but they will remember me'.</para>
        <para>It would be hypocritical to say that the Australian Labor Party had any reason to love Vince Gair; on the other hand, it would be churlish not to remember and to acknowledge his place in the rich pageant of events during his period in Australian politics. As I understand from some of those who were in the Senate with him, he is best remembered here as a flamboyant personality with an earthy sense of humour which attracted considerable comment. Vincent Gair was a colourful figure who changed his colours on a number of occasions. That is a matter of regret to us and, as Senator Carrick put it, a matter for the judgment of history. On behalf of the Opposition, I extend sympathy at his passing to his wife and family.</para>

          <para>I should like briefly to associate the National Country Party with this motion of condolence in relation to the late former Senator Gair and to extend our sympathy to his widow and family. I had the opportunity to know former Senator Gair personally for only a few months. I found him to be all those things that have been so eloquently expressed by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) and by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button). He was indeed a colourful personality. He was a man of independent mind and appeared in this chamber, I thought, to be aggressive in some measure. Yet outside he seemed to be a friendly and pleasant fellow, as I am sure he was. I am sure that most people who had the good fortune to know former Senator Gair regarded him in a friendly way. I believe he made a contribution in the strange and criss-cross pattern of Australian political life. The National Country Party joins in this motion of condolence and extends sympathy to his wife and his family.</para>

          <para>I wish to associate myself with the motion of condolence moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) in relation to the late Vince Gair. I do so as a fellow Queenslander and as a friend of the late Vince Gair and of his beloved wife. I first met Vince Gair many years ago when he was Premier of Queensland and came to Palm Island to open the Palm Island show. While he was Premier of the State he saw fit to grace a little Aboriginal community with his presence. He spent a whole day with us enjoying our show and meeting all of the people of that community.</para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As has been said, one could describe him as a colourful character, but he was one of the most astute politicians that my State of Queensland and this nation have known. He also had a very great sense of humour. I would like to recount two rather humorous incidents. I happened to bear the brunt of the late Vince Gair's jokes on both occasions. We were disembarking at Canberra airport and Vince Gair was halfway down the stairs when he stumbled and fell the rest of the way. As he was lying on the tarmac, he looked up and spotted me next in line. With a twinkle in his eye, he said: 'That's what happened; that black B pushed me'. It was a great laugh. I hopped down and helped to pick him up and we walked off the tarmac arm in arm. That shows the humour Vince Gair could display on occasions.</para>
        <para>The other occasion occurred soon after I became a member of this place and I was appointed to the Senate Standing Committee on Publications. That evening as I was walking into the dining room Vince Gair, who was sitting with his colleagues from the Democratic Labor Party, said: 'Aha! Here he is. We will now certainly get everything in black and white'. He was an astute politician. He may not have been loved by all people, but he was respected. I assure honourable senators that I treasured his friendship and all the advice and counselling that he gave me in my early career in this place. Vince Gair often said that he would have to take care of me because Nell, his wife, and I were born on the Tweed. We felt we had something in common in belonging to that part of New South Wales. I join my leader in this condolence motion and extend my sympathies to Mrs Gair and her family.</para>

          <para>I rise to join in the condolence motion about Vince Gair, a former senator. I had the opportunity of meeting Vince Gair in 1956. He was a man who certainly learnt in the school of hard knocks both in his personal life and in his political life. He was born on 25 February 1901 in Rockhampton and went to the St Joseph's Christian Brothers College of that city. In 1916, after his schooling, he joined the railway traffiic branch as an apprentice clerk and, of course, joined the appropriate union, as everyone should do. In 1916 he moved to Brisbane and in 1919 he joined the Australian Labor Party. In April 1924 he directed the ALP campaign for the South Brisbane municipal elections. In that same year he became president of the South Brisbane branch of the ALP.</para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>On 14 July 1924 he married Florence Glynn, who was killed in a road accident in 1929. On 11 June 1932 Vince Gair was elected to the Queensland Parliament. He was elected for the South Brisbane electorate and in fact defeated a former Attorney-General. In 1941 he was appointed Chairman of Committees, which was a significant aspect of his career. On 16 September 1942 he was appointed Secretary for Mines; that is Minister for Mines. On 27 April 1944 he was appointed Secretary for Labour and Industry and Secretary for Mines. In the same year he married Ellen Mary Sexton. On 14 May 1947 he was elected to the deputy leadership and on 16 September of that year he introduced a Bill for a 40-hour week. Again I emphasise that point in regard to his trade union background and his pioneering spirit. On 14 September 1948 he introduced the Profiteering Prevention Bill, in other words the State price control legislation. In November 1949 there was the Golden Casket controversy, and Gair tabled tickets relating to VIP manifests.</para>
        <para>On 10 May 1950 he was elected Treasurer and in the same year he joined the Federated Clerks Union. On 17 October of the same year he delivered his first Budget as Treasurer for Queensland. On 30 August 1951 he was acting Premier and Chief Secretary, and on 17 January 1952 he was elected as Premier of Queensland. On 7 March 1953 he led the ALP, as Premier, at the State election. There was a 10 per cent swing to the ALP, and it won 50 of the 75 seats. It was the largest majority since 1938-41. On 23 March 1953 at the ALP convention there was a resolution on the three weeks leave question. That was not the controversy which tipped the scales.</para>
        <para>On 2 June 1953 he attended the coronation in England, and in October 1954 Dr Evatt made his statement regarding the groups and the movement. On 17 January 1955 the secretary of the Queensland Australian Workers Union, Mr Bukowski, made his attacks on the industrial groups, and on 26 February 1955 Mr Gair voted at the ALP Federal Conference against the purge of the Victorian ALP Central Executive. On 14 March 1955 there was the Hobart conference of the ALP, and all Queenslanders except Mr Boland boycotted that conference. On 17 November 1955 the Queensland Caucus, by 28 votes to 20 votes, rejected the Queensland Central Executive ultimatum regarding the three weeks leave question. On 22 January 1956 the Caucus, by 30 votes to 19 votes, reaffirmed that stand. On 28 February 1956, at the Mackay ALP convention, the argument was over the question of whether there would be a direction by the machine to the State parliamentarians. On 29 February 1956 there was an emergency Cabinet meeting, and the convention was told that that Cabinet meeting had rejected that direction.</para>
        <para>On 19 May 1956 there was a State election and the ALP was returned with the loss of only one seat. It in fact obtained 50.54 per cent of the votes. On 28 February 1957 the Queensland Central Executive issued an ultimatum to the State parliamentarians, and on 18 April 1957 the Queensland Central Executive, by 35 votes to 27 votes, decided that the Premier no longer had the confidence of the Labor movement and summoned Mr Gair to a special meeting. On 23 April of that year all 10 Ministers signed declarations of confidence in Premier Gair, and Caucus voted 26 votes to 21 votes to give unqualified support to him. On 24 April of that year the Queensland Central Executive instituted a trial of Gair on six charges. There was a five hour debate and Gair was expelled from the Labor Party. On 26 April of the same year the Queensland Labor Party was formed. On 13 June 1957, that is the same year, the Legislative Assembly was dissolved following defeat of Supply. On 3 August 1957 the Nicklin Government was elected with 42 seats, the ALP with 20 seats, and the QLP with 11 seats. The first QLP conference was held between 22 and 24 November 1957. On 28 May the Nicklin Government was elected and Gair was defeated in his State seat of South Brisbane. In the 1961 Federal election, Mr Gair unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a seat in this Parliament indeed, in this chamber, ln November 1961 the Queensland Labor Party-Democratic Labor Party link was formally ratified. The first Commonwealth conference of that organisation was held. In 1964 a Federal election was held and Mr Gair was elected a senator for the State of Queensland.</para>
        <para>There were a number of controversies, as honourable senators have mentioned. I will not go into those. All of this culminated in what has been covered by other honourable senators. I believe that the history of Senator Gair's fight for principle and for the underdog ought to have been and should be related to this Parliament and to the nation. Despite the fact that people had differences of opinion with Mr Gair, although I first met him in 1956—fro m memory that was the only meeting I ever had with him—m y understanding is that he always believed social justice could be achieved only through the Labor movement and through the Labor movement's being elected to a position of integrity in a particular parliament. That, of course, was challenged in the Queensland Parliament by the forces concerned. It is interesting to read the comments that were made by people such as Sir John Egerton after Vince Gair's death. Such statements only confirm, in my view, that we have seen the passing of a great character and a great man. My condolences are expressed to former Senator Gair's widow and his family.</para>

          <para>I wish to make a few comments about Patrick Galvin. He was elected to the House of Representatives to represent the seat of Kingston in 1951. He represented that electorate for the Australian Labor Party until 1966— a period of 15 years. During his time as a member of Parliament he was an active member of a number of committees of the Parliament an'' a member of a delegation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences on three occasions. In the Labor Party he was a member of the parliamentary executive, chairman of the Party's defence committee and acting chairman of the foreign affairs committee. I think it is fair to say that he was regarded by his colleagues, whether friend or foe, as a man of forthright opinions and great honesty and as one who was completely dedicated to the cause of the Australian Labor Party.</para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Mr Galvin began his career as a motor mechanic. From the start of his working life he was actively and vigorously engaged in the trade union movement. He became an organiser for the Australian Society of Engineers and was later an industrial advocate for the Australian Workers Union until his election to Parliament in 1951. In his parliamentary life he continued to maintain an interest in industrial affairs and was a strong defender of the rights and principles of the trade union movement. These concerns were matched by a concern for social justice, tolerance, and the defence of democratic freedoms. In his maiden speech to the Parliament in 1951 Mr Galvin stated:</para>
        <para>Nobody has suggested to me what I am about to say. I am free to express any opinion I hold.</para>
        <para> He consistently did that for 15 years as a member of parliament, and the Parliament was better for it. On behalf of the Opposition, I extend sympathy to his wife and family.</para>

          <para>I should like to take the opportunity of saying a few words in reference to Pat Galvin. Until the alteration of the electoral boundaries, I lived in the division of Kingston in South Australia and, as such, Mr Galvin was my Federal member of parliament for some 15 years. As honourable senators well know, we all have a relationship with the member of the House of Representatives who lives in the area where we live and work. Pat Galvin and I had a general association over those years in the sharing of public occasions and other situations. I want to express my personal appreciation of that association, during which time he became very well known to us.</para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Mr Galvin served as a member of this Parliament for a long time. When Miss Kay Brownbill won the seat of Kingston in 1966, her first words at the declaration of the poll were to call for a round of applause for Mr Galvin's long parliamentary service to the area. Later Pat Galvin served in the area of immigration, an area with which I was associated at the time in my capacity of Chairman of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council. Mr Galvin was an adviser at Australia House in London, and he did work there which he enjoyed enormously and which he did well. He had many other interests in public affairs in South Australia, most notably as a leader and an enthusiast of the Surf Live Saving Association of Australia. He served as the South Australian State President of that Association for a considerable time. We remember Pat Galvin as a member of this Parliament and as a man involved in public affairs. I should like to place on record this reference and convey my appreciation and sympathy to the members of his family.</para>

          <para>I should like to be associated with the expressions of condolence relating to Pat Galvin. In the early post-war years Pat Galvin became an important figure in the trade union movement in South Australia. He was a officer of the Australasian Society of Engineers, which was later to benefit him in the advisory role he played in the Department of Immigration in London relating to the immigration to Australia of skilled people, about which Senator Davidson spoke. Later he became the representative of the Australian Workers Union, which took him throughout the State of South Australia. He was also an active sportsman and a coach of swimmers, and he was a well known swimmer. However, I think he became known as a suitable candidate for the Australian Labor Party because of his trade union activity. His family is well known to most honourable senators.</para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As my leader, Senator Button, has said, in the Parliament he became one of the prominent spokesmen of the Labor Party in respect of industrial matters and also in respect of industrial matters and also in respect of foreign affairs and defence. In those matters he was a good debater and an important advocate of the Labor Party, and of course the Party missed him when he lost his seat. I knew Pat Galvin in the industrial area and later in the political area. I found him to be a good and sound man and politician. He was a great family man, and I express my sympathy to his family in respect of his death.</para>
