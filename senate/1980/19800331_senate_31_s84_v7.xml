          <para>-by leave-I have given these notices of motion pursuant to decisions of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. The notices relate to matters which are under consideration by the Committee. The first notice of motion relates to a provision whereby an application may be made to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory for an order to review a decision by the Court of Petty Sessions dismissing an information. The Committee is concerned that this provision may be an abridgement of the double jeopardy rule, the long-established principle that a person who has been acquitted may not be tried again for the same offence. The Committee has received a submission from the Law Society of the Territory on the ordinance, and has written to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> on the matter. As today is the last available day for giving notice of a motion to disallow the ordinance, I have done so to allow the Commitee time to conclude its inquiry. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The second notice of motion relates to regulations which provide exemptions from the charge imposed by the Overseas Students Charge Act. The Committee has just received a submission in relation to these regulations, raising a number of matters which appear at first sight to be relevant to the Committee's principles. The Committee has not had time to consider this submission, and today being the last day for giving notice of a motion to disallow the regulations, I have given such notice to allow the Committee time to study the submission and make a determination upon it. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. Is it a fact that the Australian gas industry has expressed its amazement and disbelief at the Minister's answers to questions last week to the effect that the Government's oil pricing policy does not apply to liquefied petroleum gas? Is it true, as reported, that the Australian gas industry believes the Government has always made it clear in talks on the LPG issue that its pricing policy applied to all liquefied fuels including LPG? Is the Australian gas industry under some misunderstanding concerning government policy? </para>

            <para>- The Australian Gas Association, representing the Australian gas industry, has never expressed that view to me, so I am unaware that it has that view. The Australian Gas Association has expressed to me the strong view that liquefied petroleum gas ought to have a domestic price to assist domestic consumers. I am unable to help <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>While I am on my feet I will mention that I was asked last Thursday, I think, by the Leader of the Opposition a question in which he purported to read an extract from a letter written by my predecessor, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> inferred was written to the Prices Justification Tribunal. No letter was written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman</inline> to the Prices Justification Tribunal. The Leader of the Opposition is utterly wrong. The extract was from a letter written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman</inline> to a newspaper. </para>
          <para>The fact that it was to a newspaper was in fact spelt out by the PJT. So the statement made last Thursday was based on a misrepresentation. It was not a letter at all, even though the question implied it, and I regret to say that the newspapers took the attitude that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman</inline> had written such a letter. He did not do so. It would not have been proper to do so, anyhow. He is not the Minister under whom the Prices Justification Tribunal comes. It was a letter. Indeed, anyone who quoted from it must have so known, because either the persons got the information from the newspaper concerned, or they got the information from the Prices Justification Tribunal which said that it was an extract from a letter. I regret very much that that misrepresentation occurred. </para>

I ask the Minister: Are there any public statements which he has read of the Australian gas industry indicative of its being misinformed about the Government 's policy? </para>

              <para>- I cannot recollect reading any statement by such an organisation. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> refers to the Australian gas industry, I am puzzled. I am referring to the Australian Gas Association, which is the body which speaks for the industry. I am aware of a series of advertisements published by a variety of persons in Victoria which make all sorts of claims, the claims being inaccurate. I have no knowledge of any such statement by the Australian Gas Association. It has never been purported by the Government that liquefied petroleum gas should assume a world parity price. Only the Labor Party has made that statement and said that LPG should assume that price. The Government has never said that natural gas should take a world parity price. Only the Labor Party has said that it should be equated with the parity price of oil. </para>

At Manila the Prime Minister called on the industrialised world to 'resist the temptation to evade their long term reponsibilities to their own constituencies and to the wider world by surrendering to the pressures for protectionism', and at Lusaka: 'defensive protectionist policies exacerbate the situation they are meant to deal with in that they result in an inefficient use of labour and capital resources. They are inimical to general economic recovery and put the future growth of developing countries in jeopardy'. Will the Government match words with deeds?

It is a policy which said in June last year that there would be flexible timing in passing on the price rises. Only in recent days the Prime Minister, in a reply to a question, said: </para>

              <para>- There was an interjection about my veracity. I hope that my answer to a question asked earlier today, in which I exposed a drastic misrepresentation by the Labor Party last week, would question the veracity not of people on this side of the chamber but those on the other side of the chamber. Only the Labor Party is advocating export parity pricing- not the Government. I repeat that my advice is that the Government has never put forward that its policy was one of export parity pricing for liquefied petroleum gas. I remind the Senate that the Government has introduced a subsidy scheme for country gas utilities which, in itself, is an indication of the nature of its policies. </para>

Is the Minister aware of a recent interview of Paul Keating, the ALP spokesman on energy, which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and in which he admitted that the petrol prices under ALP policy would not be significantly less than they are at present? Is the Minister able to confirm whether there have been any recent domestic or international events which could substantiate a huge fall in petrol prices? Is it more likely that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Keating</inline> is seeking to mislead the people of Australia for political purposes? Finally, can the Minister explain why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Keating</inline> continues to push different pricing policies for new and old oil when he knows full well that to exclude old oil would be to ensure that those known reserves would be used up more rapidly without encouraging urgent and necessary exploration of new reserves? </para>

          <para class="block">The Labor Party would not reduce the price of petrol. It would increase it but it would probably do so by an amount less than that by which the Government would increase it. The price of petrol on average in Australia today is 33c a litre. In no circumstances could one imagine that it would drop to 2 lc a litre. All the indications are, sadly, that it will rise on world markets. I can say only that here, again, is another version of the Labor Party's policy. The fundamental point in the printed version of the Labor Party's policynot in a newspaper report- states that the Labor Party intends to apply a resources rent tax. On <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Keating's</inline> own say-so, that will raise more than the oil levy. That being so, it must mean both dearer and scarcer petrol because it will destroy exploration and development. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. It concerns the New Zealand Government's reported signature today to an agreement with the Mobil oil corporation to produce one-third of New Zealand's motor spirit needs by conversion of natural gas from the Maui field to methanol and then to petrol at the relatively modest capital cost of $NZ500m. Is it a fact that this type of conversion is at present and will be for some years the best established and most economical technology for replacing oil as a motor spirit source? Since the lead time for such refineries is estimated to be two to three years and as the Office of National Assessments has been reported as warning that there are likely to be dislocations of our own imported petrol supplies by 1982, how far has Australia advanced towards introducing the same technology, preferably by using North West Shelf natural gas? </para>

            <para>- The Government has been keenly interested in the proposed technique of converting Maui natural gas to methanol and then fractionating it to gasolene. It is a process which, if successful, will be of great interest but, fundamentally, it is useful only where there is a very significant supply of natural gas which is not a scarce commodity for use in other ways. One also has to watch out that, in the course of the conversion of natural gas to methanol and through to gasolene, one does not use more energy than is justified by the end product. Whilst I do not want to deprecate such a proposal, I must say that a lot still has to be learnt about it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The proposal has been considered. I believe that the Australian Gas Light Co. has considered turning some natural gas into methanol as an extender. That, in itself, is an attractive proposal and we will be interested in it. So much were we interested in the proposal in New Zealand that I arranged some weeks ago for several of my senior officers to go to New Zealand to study the process. We will keep in touch with it. Whilst something may look attractive one has to look at what the net gain is in the end and whether hydrocarbon fuel is being used for its best priority use. That is not to say that to convert natural gas to gasolene would be wrong; it may be right. We will be much better informed about the process in the future. </para>

            <para>- I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt</inline> is well aware of Perth's situation with respect to international air services and the related domestic connections. The general position is that Perth has direct international air services to Africa, Asia and Europe and has access to the United States of America and the South Pacific using domestic connections. I assume that it is to those domestic connections that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas's</inline> question addresses itself. For services to Asia and Europe, Perth is a gateway of Australia. Perth residents enjoy on-line services to Europe and Africa and dedicated end-to-end services to Asia. Fare levels from Perth to Asia are amongst the lowest in Australia and Perth residents have full access to the recently announced new air fares for flights to Europe. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I said, it is the services to the United States and the South Pacific which require connecting flights across Australia. In that regard, it should be remembered that both Qantas Airways Ltd and Pan American World Airways have the right to operate flights to Perth but, as a matter of commercial judgment, they have not seen fit to provide a direct service. It is not always appreciated that the domestic airlines now offer a wide range of incentive fares with discounts which range from 10 to 40 per cent. They have considerably eased the position of those people who wish to travel internationally from west to east using domestic services. For example, a discount of 40 per cent can be obtained on domestic flights connecting with services to the United States. Recent fare changes by the domestic airlines, of course, also assist in the area about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> is concerned. </para>
          <para>There are some discrepancies between the ticket conditions available for international flights and those which are available domestically. I am advised by the Minister for Transport that the Department is examining them with the domestic carriers to see whether they can be overcome. I am aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas's</inline> question reflects concerns of electors in Western Australia which also have been made known to me. I will ensure that, once again, the whole question is directed to the attention of the Minister for Transport, although I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> would be well aware that this has been done fairly actively recently by him and other honourable senators and honourable members from Western Australia. </para>

            <para>- At the time the PJT was dealing with its price fixation of liquefied petroleum gas and other petrochemicals the Government was grappling with an overall policy, including policy on LPG. The Government was, as the Senate will know, in the process of bringing about a subsidy for country utilities. It was seeking to see whether it could get a differential for automotive use. So, clearly the Government did not have in its mind the application of export or import parity prices for all liquefied petroleum gas. It had acted even the day before to bring about a differential subsidy for utilities and was in the process of looking at automotive fuels. That is quite clear. Any attempt to suggest otherwise is wrong. </para>

          <para>Let me make the situation perfectly clear. Last week it was implied in this Parliament that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman</inline> had written to the Prices Justification Tribunal. That implication was utterly misleading. I regret that the Press was misled. I hope that the newspapers which in fact inadvertently were misled publish a correction.

I refer to such things as cricket bats, tennis racquets, et cetera. Is the Minister aware that a few weeks ago two young cricketers were hit on the head and killed and that many others have been injured?

            <para>-The Minister representing the Minister for Health might recall that on 10 May last I asked what action had been taken to implement a recommendation of the National Therapeutic Goods Committee with regard to the packaging of dangerous drugs in childproof containers. The Minister advised then that an order requiring the child resistant packaging of drugs commonly implicated in the accidental poisoning of children had been drafted. What steps have been taken to expedite the promulgation and implementation of this order? What is the current situation regarding this matter? </para>

		    <para class="block">- The Minister for Health has advised me that in November 1979 the National Therapeutic Goods Committee agreed that the States should take measures to complement Commonwealth legislation on child resistant packaging. In the same month a working party of the National Therapeutic Goods Committee achieved almost complete agreement on the content of the legislation. One matter required additional scientific evidence and that is being examined and will soon be resolved. The industry will be allowed a period of six months from promulgation of the legislation in which to comply with it. I think that covers the main matters in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> 's question. If anything is unanswered I will see that the Minister for Health provides advice on it. </para>

            <para>- Will the Leader of the Government in the Senate make a report to the Senate on the violence surrounding and leading up to the presence of the Prime Minister at the opening of a church nursing home yesterday afternoon? By way of preface I point out that groups of parents and children had walked across to the opening of the nursing home from a kindergarten picnic in Edinburgh Gardens. For two hours before the expected time of the Prime Minister's arrival mounted police were assembled in the gardens where the children's picnic was being held. A police helicopter hovered 50 feet above the suburb of Fitzroy for hours, the noise of which built up an atmosphere of fear and drama. Police took over Church Street earlier in the day and questioned people hours before the function. The Melbourne City Mission Board had insisted on the Prime Minister being present despite disagreement. A person with a loud hailer was telling people that the demonstration was a police riot. I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate: Why were so many police rostered for overtime on a quiet Sunday afternoon? Why would mounted police be included, which immediately conveyed an atmosphere of drama? Why did a police helicopter circle the suburb? Does the Prime Minister's visit to a nursing home normally attract the large number of pressmen and photographers who were obviously present on Sunday afternoon? Was a considerable representation of rentacrowd, agents provocateur, present? If so, who organised them? Were any Commonwealth police present? Are visits to areas where there are few Liberal votes going to play a key role in an election year strategy of confrontation and provoking incidents which build the Prime Minister up as a strong man for media coverage? </para>

Those people at Fitzroy yesterday then sought to hurl missiles at the Prime Minister and his wife. It is a pretty cowardly group that will demonstrate outside a nursing home with frail people, people in wheelchairs, sitting outside and people frightened for their lives, as the television cameras showed. It is a pretty cowardly mob that will do this, and a pretty tortuous mind that wants to turn the blame for this upon the police and not upon the rioters and demonstrators. </para>

            <para>- From my recollection the Australian Government has sought over the years to restrict military intervention and military build-up in the Indian Ocean and has no doubt done so at the United Nations. I will check whether the precise assertion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> is correct, lt presumably is. It is not of the choosing of the Australian Government or the American Government that the build-up has occurred. My understanding is that at last count there were something like 34 military surface vessels of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the Indian Ocean- an enormous build-up compared with the past. I do not believe that, for the safety and security of the free world, the unilateral build-up of such a force - </para>

              <para>-Those who wish to see unilateral build-up by the USSR in the Indian Ocean have the opportunity to express themselves at any time. I am merely saying that the bulk of Australians would regard such a huge surface build-up, quite apart from the submarine build-up, as being a threat to world stability and peace, particularly with regard to the Middle East, and would hope that the free world power, the USA, would at least attempt some balance. I would have thought that in the interests of world peace Australia would co-operate with the United States in assisting to obtain some balance and some stability in the Indian Ocean. If, on the other hand, the Labor Party wishes to assert a unilateral strength for Russia in the Indian Ocean, it is competent for it to do so. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs. Is the Minister aware that one of the senior Olympic contestants, Dawn Fraser, stated on a television broadcast that she was unaware of any atrocities being committed by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Afghanistan and that, if she knew of any atrocities being committed, she would think again about her decision to attend the Olympic Games? Has the Minister adequately briefed the athletes so that they can make an informed decision? If not, will the Minister write to each of the athletes as they are chosen and inform them of the situation in Afghanistan? </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of any statement that Dawn Fraser has made suggesting that she is unaware of atrocities in Afghanistan. Indeed, if she made such a statement, it is hard to imagine that she could be unaware of them. Certainly, I assume that if any Australian athletes go to Moscow they will be aware of the circumstances in Afghanistan. It is the Australian Government's view that the circumstances in Afghanistan are such that they should dictate that Australia, including her athletes, should make a determination not to give them any support. I shall refer the final detail of the question to the Minister concerned. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, refers to the unpleasant and violent demonstration which occurred in Fitzroy yesterday. Is it not a fact that the Fitzroy Council announced some two weeks before the opening that its members would conduct a peaceful demonstration outside the home as a protest against the Prime Minister and the Government's actions towards the people of Fitzroy? Is it not their right so to do? Is it not a fact that representatives of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, nine days before the opening, in fact informed the people from the Central Methodist Mission and the Victoria Police that there would be a violent demonstration? How did the members of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet know that there would be a violent demonstration? Did they have anything to do with it? </para>

            <para>-I am not aware that the Fitzroy Council indicated that its members would put on a pacific demonstration. I will ask the Prime Minister whether in fact the police were so notified. But suppose they were facts. It was not the Prime Minister who created the violent demonstration; it was the 300 or 400 people who were there who were violent. I think we are looking at the wrong end of the telescope. For some extraordinary reason, the Australian Labor Party is seeking to justify the violence that occurred at Fitzroy. The Australian people will not tolerate violence. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Any suggestion that the Prime Minister or the police provoked violence is completely wrong and completely unacceptable. The fact is that a crowd of 300 or 400 people went to where the Prime Minister was and did violence. Their violence caused old people, frail people, to become terrified. It was an outrage to any kind of justice or sensibility that anybody should have hurled missiles or used any violence at all. No amount of apology can take away the brutality of yesterday and the responsibility of those who caused it. </para>

              <para>- I ask a supplementary question. I remind the Minister that I said that the people on this side of the House are as appalled by such violent demonstrations as anybody else. I repeat: Is it not a fact that there was an expressed intention to have a peaceful demonstration? Is it not a fact that the first inkling that there might be a violent demonstration in fact came from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet? Is it not a fact that violent demonstrations seem to follow this gentleman around the country? Is there any connection between those two matters? </para>

              <para>- It is so. This place cannot operate in this way. Honourable senators realise that they can make political comment but such comment has to be made in parliamentary language and not in a way which casts reflection on other people. There is no finer time for the use of parliamentary language than when feeling and heat are being generated. It is absolutely necessary that honourable senators do their utmost to ensure that there is not the need for recourse to Standing Orders. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> has used words which he knows as well as I do are simply not acceptable. </para>

              <para>- I do not wish to quibble with such fine points of order. We are reaching a ludicrous situation in this House when the Leader of the Government in this place believes that he can abuse that position and hide behind the Standing Orders to accuse people on this side of the House of all sorts of outrageous behaviour. I said last week and I say again now that this is not a Sunday school debating society; this is a House of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I accept what you say- that we should be as dignified as possible. But that comment applies to people on both sides of the House. Gentlemen on the other side of the House have accused people of going to the bar. The Minister last week accused us of being apologists for the Soviet Union. Today he said that we were approving of violent demonstrations. I am afraid I feel that I cannot tolerate that sort of behaviour from the Leader of the Government without some sort of retaliation. It is not good enough just to ask the Minister or me to withdraw. Surely the sensible thing to do is to ask him to behave in a civilised manner. Then, perhaps, I will. </para>

I was not prepared to enter the debate again because I stated fairly clearly that I believe that the person most responsible for this situation, and other similar situations, is the Leader of the Government. He will have to learn not to provoke the Opposition in answer to questions. If he refrained he would not have constant interjections from this side which lead to personal statements being made of the nature of which you have complained. </para>

To follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> advice, I think that the Senate should proceed to the next matter listed. If the Senate can do that by way of motion, I am prepared to move that. I see no reason why you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> should be forced into the situation of naming a senator because of the irrational actions of senators on both sides. It would be far better if I did move that we proceed to the next business before the Senate. </para>

              <para>- I will repeat what I said before. I will not set any conditions on my withdrawal, if I withdraw. The sitting week before last, in the absence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> neither you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> nor anyone else in this place, had any difficulty. I suggest that this chamber is for all honourable senators and that all honourable senators have equal rights. Without making any reflection on your Presidency, it would seem to me that at least one honourable senator in this place considers that he has more rights than others, particularly in regard to the language he can use and the things that he can call honourable senators on this side of the chamber. I do not believe in the conservative dictum of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> that it is all right for him to call us collectively anything he likes and yet it is ungentlemanly or offensive for us to reply to such remarks. I have no intention of sitting in this place and copping the abuse, lies and denigration of people, as happened to the late Rex Connor, that have come from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> in the months that he has been Leader of the Government in the Senate. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GRIMES</inline>(Tasmania)-Mr  President,  first of all I apologise to you. You are and you have been in a difficult situation in this place. You always will be while the gentleman to whom I referred is the Leader of the Government in the Senate and behaves in the manner in which he does. As I said before, I believe that all senators in this place should be treated equally under the rules. I believe that you strive to do so. The trouble is that some senators in this place may obey the law as it is written but they do not obey the letter of the law. They hide behind the Standing Orders. They smear and blackguard senators on this side of the chamber collectively, knowing quite well that in those circumstances a withdrawal cannot be asked for. At the same time, they know quite well that the only real answer to such smearing and blackguarding is for someone on this side of the chamber to respond individually to those remarks. </para>
          <para>This is a difficult situation. Most people in this chamber do not take advantage of it. I may be considered to be a bit vigorous at Question Time. When I am, I suggest to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that I am always replying to the sort of abuse to which I have referred and which comes from the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I take no pleasure in being named' in this place and I realise the pain and difficulty it causes you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> But I think that someone has to direct attention to what goes on during Question Time in this place. There is consistent abuse of people on this side of the House;,not only of people on this side of the House but also, as I mentioned in the case of the late Rex Connor, of people who have been distinguished members of this Parliament and who have since died. I do not intend to put up with this in the future any more than I have in the last few months. </para>
          <para>It may make life difficult for you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and for the rest of us; but, as you rightly said, the conduct of this place depends on reasonable behaviour by people on both sides of the House. I could not agree with that more. But one cannot expect people on this side to be reasonable when one person in particular on the other side is continually and grossly unreasonable. It does not become an equal contest in that event and it does not become a matter of equal standards of behaviour on both sides of the chamber. That is the reason I refuse to withdraw on this occasion. I merely draw people's attention to the fact - </para>

          <para>- I claim to have been misrepresented during Question Time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> Early in Question Time today <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> referred to a question I asked some time last week. In the course of that question I made reference to what I believed to have been a letter written by the former Minister for National Development to the Prices Justification Tribunal. I asked the question at the time in the belief that the letter had been written to the PJT. If the information that the Minister tabled during the course of Question Time is correct presumably I was incorrect because that letter was written to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> newspaper and not to the PJT. At the time I asked the question it was my belief that the letter was written to the PJT. But that is not the substance of the issue at all. Because the Minister was in a corner regarding wrong information and the complete shemozzle of the Government's pricing policy on liquefied petroleum gas, he chose to try to get around my question and subsequent questions by magnifying that point out of all proportion to its true significance. In order to put the record straight I will read from the material that the Minister tabled so that we can see the extent to which he was magnifying the significance of my error out of proportion. I am talking about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> the man who has just moved a motion to expel somebody from this Senate. On the basis of the way he has distorted this information he ought to be expelled from the Senate. I will tell honourable senators why. The minute from the Minister's Department states: </para>

Because 1 made a mistake in saying that that letter went to the PJT and not to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> I am accused of misleading the Senate.

            </talker>
            <para>-The Opposition brings this matter before the Senate for a number of reasons. The first is the self-evident importance of broadcasting services, both publicly funded and commercial, in bringing to Australians entertainment, comment and above all information- crucial in any democratic society. The second is the wide dissatisfaction on the part of the Australian public, which has been expressed many times in this Parliament, community interest groups seeking to make representation before Broadcasting Tribunal proceedings and many prominent individuals acting in their own right, with many aspects of the broadcasting system. The third is the manifest inadequacy of the Government's response when confronted with this dissatisfaction. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The terms of the matter proposed for discussion today certainly cover an enormous range of specific issues. Among them would be the Government's failure to act on the Tribunal's own recommendations, now some two years old, with respect to the statutory regulation of certain vital areas of Australian content, advertising and children's television and the apparent willingness of the Government and its Tribunal to let the running now be taken by FACTS- the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations- the commercial industry organisation with its own proposals for self-regulation in these areas. </para>
          <para>Then there is the Government's failure, having established the Broadcasting Tribunal after the Green inquiry in 1 976, to force that tribunal into an acceptance of reasonable, fair and open procedures in licence renewal and transfer hearings to allow genuine public participation and to provide genuinely for the accountability of media organisations. Then there has been the relentlessly ad hoc character of the Government's approach to questions like cable television, the supplementary regional licences which have been the subject of recent media comment, the question of commercial FM licences and the on-going question of the role and operation of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Separate inquiries in respect of all these matters have proliferated, and continue to proliferate, with no sense of co-ordination or direction about what the Government is doing. There is no sense that the Government has any idea of where it is going or why. There is no sense that the Government has any philosophy of broadcasting other than that of not offending the media barons at any price and certainly not in an election year. </para>
          <para>Because of the way in which the Government has indicated today that it proposes to use its numbers to limit this debate to one  speaker  a side- not even acting democratically, despite the language of the motion before it- it is necessary that I confine my remarks to one major area of this topic. It may be that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan,</inline> who was to lead this debate but was regrettably taken ill this morning, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button,</inline> who was the obvious next choice to lead this debate but who was in transit this morning and unable to sign, as a result, the piece of paper which our clerical watchdogs seem to deem necessary to preserve the procedures of this place against profanity, may well have treated this topic differently. I propose to fasten upon what I would regard certainly as the major, central media issue today; that is, the question of the aggregation and concentration of media ownership, a topic which has a particular timeliness given the opening tomorrow of the Broadcasting Tribunal's inquiry into the acquisition of Channel O, now Channel 10, Melbourne, by the Murdoch organisation. </para>
          <para>I want to look at the pattern of media ownership in Australia as it has now emerged, to indicate why it is important that something should be done about that pattern of concentrated ownership, and then to castigate the Government for not in fact doing anything about it and showing no signs of any bona fides in respect of its intentions in the future. Australia's media ownership, both electronic and print, has always been notoriously concentrated. Three groups themselves by no means completely independent of each other-control all the daily newspapers in all capital cities of Australia and most of the provincial dailies as well. All of them have very significant radio and television holdings around the country and two of them- John Fairfax and Sons Ltd and the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd- in addition control Australian Associated Press, on which newspapers, radio and television stations around the country depend largely for their news sources. This pattern of ownership has become even more concentrated as a result of the extraordinary series of events which occurred late last year and which resulted for a start in a massive increase in the television influence of Rupert Murdoch, who swapped his stations in Wollongong and Adelaide for the infinitely more powerful Sydney and Melbourne 0-10 network. That also resulted in a greater interlocking of ownership of the great print media groups. </para>
          <para>It is true that the Murdoch attempt to buy control of the Herald and Weekly Times was in the event beaten off, and just as well because it would have given that organisation the lion's share not only of the Melbourne market as a result but also it would have created a monopoly or near monopoly monopoly in Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane. But what did happen, as the price of that whole exercise, was the purchase by John Fairfax Ltd of a major interest in the Herald and Weekly Times, an event that has continued to be deplored not only by the <inline font-style="italic">Age-David</inline> Syme organisation in Melbourne- whose independence was much threatened by this manoeuvre- but also by a great many commentators and public figures around the country. What is happening within the print media sector is not as such the central local point of this debate, but because of the huge cross-ownership of the print and electronic outlets, it is just meaningless to try to look at the broadcasting sector in isolation from print. The reality is that the big four print organisations- the Herald and Weekly Times, Fairfax, Murdoch's News Ltd and Packerbetween them have almost completely sewn up the media game in Australia. </para>
          <para>Let us look at that situation for a moment. The Murdoch organisation, News Ltd, so far as print is concerned, owns the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper nationally, in New South Wales, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> and in South Australia the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">News.</inline> In addition it controls Sunday papers in Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Penh and a whole miscellany of other publications around the country ranging from <inline font-style="italic">Truth</inline> to <inline font-style="italic">New Idea.</inline> On the broadcast side the News Ltd organisation has the controlling interest in Channel 10, Sydney and now Melbourne, if tomorrow's licensing procedure endorses that transaction. In addition it retains a significant stake in Channel 0 in Brisbane and also an interest, if it can be so described, in NWS 9, Adelaide, and WIN 4, Wollongong, with whom it has entered into networking arrangements. </para>
          <para>Then we have the Herald and Weekly Times organisation which owns the major dailies- the <inline font-style="italic">Herald and Sun News Pictorial</inline> in Victoria; the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> in Perth; the <inline font-style="italic">Hobart Mercury,</inline> the South Australian <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser,</inline> plus dozens of other metropolitan, provincial and local papers. On the broadcasting side the Herald and Weekly Times has a controlling or major interest in Channel 7 in Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane and Channel 9 in Hobart, together with a minority interest in some 1 5 other television stations around the country. It also has the sole or a major interest in 10 radio stations, with a minority interest in six other radio stations. </para>
          <para>Then we come to the Fairfax organisation linked with David Syme in Victoria. Its print operations extend to the ownership or control nationally of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review,</inline> of the <inline font-style="italic">National Times;</inline> in Melbourne the <inline font-style="italic">Age;</inline> in Sydney the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald;</inline> in the Australian Capital Territory the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times;</inline> plus a number of other provincial, rural and local newspapers. The broadcasting interests of the Fairfax organisation extend to a control of Channel 7, Sydney, Channel 9, Brisbane, plus a less substantial interest in three or four other stations. In radio the Fairfax organisation has a major interest in some seven radio stations around the country. Finally there is the Packer organisation, Consolidated Press, which is by no means least in the litany even though it has no metropolitan dailies within its stable. It runs the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Women's Weekly</inline> plus a very significant number of provincial and local papers together with, in the electronic area, its controlling interest in Channel 9 in Sydney and Melbourne, its minority interest in three or four other television channels and its control, in the radio area, of some seven stations. </para>
          <para>That is the overall picture. Why is this pattern of ownership a matter of public importance? Why ought it to be a matter of concern to this Parliament and to the country? The reasons go to the very heart of our democratic process and the maintenance of our character as a democratic society. In the first place it is crucial that there be protection and maintenance of a diversity of views in this society. We believe there is a fundamental democratic right to receive a free flow of information and to receive a plural expression of views and opinions. A monopoly or an oligopoly threatens that right. The fewer the forms of ownership, obviously the fewer chances there are of receiving diverse views, opinions and attitudes and the greater the opportunity of suppressing particular opinions. This point was articulated very clearly and very precisely in the second United Kingdom Royal Commission on the media which reported in 1962 in the following terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The obvious danger of concentration of ownership lies in the possibility that a variety of opinion may be stifled if one proprietor comes to control a number of newspapers which formerly presented varied and independent views  . . the risk is yet more serious if any of the publications are associated with other potential influences such as television. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The report later went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The real danger may lie not in the active propagation of one-sided views but in the conscious or unconscious  supression  of shades of opinion which ought to have a voice. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is also to be noted that some years later, in 1979, the Annan Committee on the future of broadcasting in Britain made some specific findings about the character of concentration of ownership in Australia in the following terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In Australia, newspaper interests have gained control of television stations with very sharp repercussions upon political expression and news. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The position can also be put in principle another way in terms of questions of power and accountability. Perhaps the most succinct statement on this issue is contained in Trevor Barr's recently published book <inline font-style="italic">Reflections of Reality- the media in Australia</inline> in which he writes: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Control of the media in the hands of a few groups is undesirable and potentially dangerous. If we assume that the media is influential in shaping our attitudes, then those who own the communication channels possess great potential power to influence the public in ways they choose. They can and do strongly support or oppose governments and political parties. The Press is less accountable than most other institutions in our society. Unlike political leaders those who own the Press are not, and never have been, elected. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The individual has a sense of powerlessness when he is confronted with this situation as was noted by, among others, the Australian Law Reform Commission, in its recently tabled report, No. 1 1, on Unfair Publication: Defamation and Privacy, in which it said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The very fact that there is such a concentration of ownership generates a feeling in some quarters that the Australian media is monolithic and all-powerful and a demand for effective weapons to protect the individual in dispute with it. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The gravity of the situation has been acknowledged by people from a very wide spectrum of our community. Calls for something to be done about it have come from a very wide spectrum, including prominent individuals, academics like <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Patricia</inline> Edgar, a highly respected media writer from the La Trobe University, and the </para>
          <para class="block">Australian Journalists Association which on a number of occasions has made calls for a full royal commission to inquire into all aspects of media ownership in Australia. Some media proprietors themselves have expressed their concern as to the way in which they are being caught in a squeeze play by the kind of cross ownership pressures which are steadily developing and pressing in upon them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ranald</inline> Macdonald, the managing director of David Syme, has been by far the most articulate expresser of that point of view from within the media ranks themselves. </para>
          <para>From our own side of politics, the Labor Party, the call for a royal commission or a major inquiry into the whole position of media ownership in Australia has been made repeatedly.

              <para>-Perhaps. We will await the honourable senator's resurgence with some interest over the next few months. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alston</inline> described the developments in the Fairfax interest in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> as being thoroughly unhealthy. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen,</inline> whose judgment has been improving somewhat in recent times with his statements on the Olympics, has expressed some concern on the future of media developments in Queensland. In this chamber, when this matter was debated last year on 30 August, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> said, among other things, that the potential concentration of the print and electronic media was a serious policy issue and it is squarely before the Government as a matter requiring examination. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>The strongest statement has come from the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott),</inline> a member of this present Government and this present ministry, who said on 29 November in a very widely reported speech- and deservedly so- at a symposium at the Sydney Opera House on Moral Rights of Artists: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The rights to publish any literature and other artistic expression are under threat if the power to control the mass media is in the hands of a few. </para>

            <para>The media has an awesome power. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Later in the same statement he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The opportunities for artistic expression, for full truthful reporting are necessarily limited and the dangers of authors and other creative artists becoming pawns of the media and of publishing houses are necessarily heightened, as these are concentrated more and more in the hands of a few. </para>
            <para>In such circumstances claims that editorial or other policy is being left in an independent position are unconvincing and hard to tally with the facts. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But so much has been said over and over again. The question before us is: What is the Government doing about it? The short answer is: Nothing at all. Repeated calls for royal commissions, for other forms of inquiry, for clarification of the public interest criteria as they now stand, supported by the High Court, in the Broadcasting and Television Act have fallen on completely deaf ears so far as this Government is concerned. It has taken the course of opting out of its responsibilities in the broadcasting area, saying that it is a matter for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to resolve under those public interest criteria. </para>
          <para>For a time it looked as if the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal was discharging that responsibility, and was prepared to look at concentration issues as part of the public interest criterion. That came to a head in the Newcastle radio station 2HD decision. But in the Channel 10-Murdoch decision in the middle of last year, the Broadcasting Tribunal, confronted for the first time with a concentration issue squarely involving crossownership of print and electronic media chickened out, saying that consideration of this matter was not a matter for it but one of policy for the Government. But, since that time, since the matter has been batted back to the Government in this way, there has been a deafening silence from the Government as to how the matter should be resolved, how the criteria should be applied, and, what public interest ought to mean so far as media concentration is concerned. The failure of the Government to acknowledge the necessity for an inquiry into this whole area, preferably in the form of a royal commission, failing that by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal itself, is another demonstration of its total failure to come to grips with the necessity of having a properly constituted broadcasting system that is appropriate to our democratic society. </para>

            <para>The failure of the Government to develop and implement a broadcasting policy appropriate to a modern democratic society. </para>

          <para class="block">I read out the resolution in full because the information which has just been put before the Senate by the previous speaker says nothing about a broadcasting policy, says nothing about the implementation of it and does not even describe in detail or in any inference whatsoever what is appropriate to a modern democratic society. </para>
          <para>We have had a fairly detailed discussion of certain other elements which are part of the media situation in Australia without any comment as to how they can be resolved. There has been little or no attention to the matter which is immediately before the Senate. I recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> has come to a situation under certain difficulty. I regret, with all other honourable senators, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan,</inline> who is a member of my Senate committee, has been indisposed for so long. We miss her contribution this afternoon. I take the point that the Opposition is referring to something which it calls- ( <inline font-style="italic">Quorum formed).</inline></para>
          <para>The Senate is debating, I repeat, a matter of public importance which was brought forward by the Opposition. It deals with the matter of broadcasting policy in a modern society. As I indicated to the Senate a few moments ago, the </para>
          <para class="block">Senate was not treated to any substantiated criticisms of a broadcasting policy, but rather an attack on business matters which I think might be debated under another heading altogether. </para>
          <para>I suppose that for all of us, whether in Government or in Opposition, it is easy to be critical of broadcasting policies, because broadcasting in any country must aim at being all things to all men- and it can never be that. It will always be under criticism because it is not all things to all men. A nation's population comprises a huge number of societies; they are urban and rural, they are all ages, they are management and labour, they are educated and sophisticated, and they are people with other interests, needs and desires. All these people demand a thousand different kinds of broadcasting services. They require their broadcasting services at all hours, in all languages, and frequently require them in repetition. They require them in sound, in picture, in colour and in text. So a broadcasting policy must provide the whole range of society's needs for entertainment, sport, news and comment, minority audiences, special tastes in the area of culture and the crafts, and special requirements in business, the sciences, religion and the humanities. All these things are demanded by any society in the area of a broadcasting policy. </para>
          <para>A broadcasting policy needs to cope with and to be part of the information explosion, the new technologies, the new speed of society, and of course the changing and alternating tastes of the community. Added to all of this, in our country it has to be worked out in an area which is as large as Australia and which has a population that is divided between a concentration on the seaboard and a scattering across the outback. We also have to recognise the roles of management accountability as well as the demands and returns from the market place and the responsibility to the taxpayer. To add to all of that, there is the fact that the world of broadcasting is an international world with program exchanges on a nation to nation basis and broadcasting agreements between governments and between nations. There is also the world of program exchanges and technical exchanges, both of which have to be related to international agreements. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline></para>
          <para>In the first instance, any government policy, initiatives and aims must have the widest and most diverse objectives if they are to make a fruitful and useful broadcasting policy. Today the Government therefore aims to ensure that all Australians receive the best possible communication. The Government's policy is that modern technology be used to provide those services at the best possible cost. The Government policy is that diversity be provided and that there be a real element of choice in the broadcasting system. The Government also supports the Australian Broadcasting Commission, as it develops high quality broadcasting services. The Government's policy includes the development of multicultural services, and services in a whole range of other areas as well. I speak rather in the generality, but the policy aims of the Government reflect the complex demands to which I gave some detailed attention a few moments ago. They reflect the complex demands that are made upon a broadcasting system and the details of a broadcasting policy and, further, the requirements that a government must undertake in order to fulfil its role in providing a broadcasting service within a democratic society. </para>
          <para>Broadcasting policy' is a very wide term. It encompasses a range of issues from the use of the radio spectrum allocated for broadcasting purposes, right through to the processes for determining the grant of broadcasting licences to non-government organisations. Following the World Administrative Radio Conference conducted in Geneva last year, additional frequencies for television in the very high frequency band could be made available. To free the additional frequencies for television purposes would require, however, moving some radio services from the VHF band, and this would present some problems both in timing and in cost. When we are looking at a broadcasting policy we are looking at the effective and efficient use of the radio spectrum. It is the intention of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> to report soon to Parliament on the results of the conference to which I have referred and the processes that the Government will be following in seeking views on the better use of the radio spectrum following the decisions of the World Administrative Radio Conference. All of this proves the point that the Government is developing a policy that is appropriate to a democratic society. </para>
          <para>Since the Government was elected in 1975 there have been a number of major developments in broadcasting policy and practice in Australia. The first development has already been referred to. It resulted in the publication of what we now know as the green report. This report has resulted in many changes in broadcasting policy, most of which have been accepted by the Government. The most important recommendation of the Green report which was implemented by the Government was to replace the former Australian Broadcasting Control Board with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The former Board, as I think everybody very well knows, was the major authority at the time for considering the changes in broadcasting policy and practice. It was also the authority which recommended to the Minister the grant of licences for commercial purposes. </para>
          <para>The situation exists today where, with the .establishment of the Broadcasting Tribunal, the Government has placed the responsibility for broadcasting planning with the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal now has the responsibility for considering applications for the renewal of commercial and public broadcasting licences and, where appropriate, granting new licences. The decision to establish the Broadcasting Tribunal and to give planning responsibilities to the Minister was the most important structural change to take place in broadcasting over many years. The process for the hearing of licence renewal applications and for the granting of licences now provides for- I take up the words of the Opposition's matter of public importance- a greater domestic process, the reflection of 'a modern democratic society' and a greater public involvement in the process than has been apparent formerly. </para>
          <para>Other significant decisions in broadcasting have also taken place since the change of government in 1975. 1 will take a moment or two to list some of them. Public radio licences are now available for a range of community purposes. For the first time we have a policy for the development of commercial frequency modulation broadcasting in the major metropolitan areas. As we all know, a major review has been announced which is to give consideration to all of the aspects of the operation the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and a report is to be brought down in March next year. A new establishment will be a broadcasting council which will advise the Minister on planning for development within the broadcasting frequency bands. Another establishment will be a broadcasting information office. This will soon be established to provide a further avenue for research and it will provide a further avenue for public involvement in the development of broadcasting. ( <inline font-style="italic">Quorum formed).</inline></para>
          <para>In discussing further the matter of public importance proposed by the Opposition I point out that the Minister will be introducing significant amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act in this session. Included in the amending Bill will be proposals relating to the establishment of the Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting </para>
          <para class="block">Corporation; reference to the general inquiries into broadcasting matters by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; and reference to the extension of broadcasting services by enabling the licensing of services in remote areas to take the direct broadcast of the national service using the INTELSAT- the Interim Communications Satellite Committee- satellite for this purpose. The Government has already announced a program under which 46 remote localities will be provided with programs from this service. The Government has also decided that, in the national interest, it will develop a domestic communications satellite system for Australia. A satellite Project Office has been established within the Postal and Telecommunications Department. </para>
          <para>The Minister has also announced approval for Teletext services to become operational. Teletext is a broadcasting data service. Other systems are being developed in this area which will be put on trial for future use. The other services likely to be considered are the French Antiope service and the Canadian Telidon service. Data broadcasting services will enable immediate access through domestic television receivers to a whole range of information services. There are also plans for the development of cable television services which are closely linked with a number of developments similar to those in the United States of America. In addition, the Government has received notice of interest by private operators in developing what they call a pay off-the-air television service. This will involve a commercial operator transmitting special programs which can be received on a domestic service. </para>
          <para>All these developments and many others are exciting. They will enable a greater development of information services. I draw attention also to the social consequences of the new services which will be of considerable significance. Micro-electronics has opened up vast applications of information services which have the capacity for dramatic change within the community. For this reason, decisions have to be considered carefully and the public must be involved as much as possible in considering the issues. </para>
          <para>The Opposition's case falls to the ground. It has not been proved. In addition to the points which have been made, there will be, in summary, amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act; developments in the broadcasting system; new policies appropriate to Australian content; the introduction of commercial frequency modulation services; the development of a domestic satellite; ABC funding on a triennial basis to enable the Australian Broadcasting </para>
          <para class="block">Commission to have greater management of its own affairs; the Tribunal being authorised to hold additional inquiries; the implementation of a broadcasting council and other offices; and cable and pay television. In all of these areas there will be extensive consultation with the industry and with the community at large. Therefore, the Opposition's case about the Government's failure to implement a broadcasting policy in a modern democratic society has not been proved. It has failed miserably in all aspects.

          <para class="block">The purpose of the Bill before the Senate is to authorise The Pipeline Authority to construct a natural gas pipeline from Dalton, on the main Moomba to Sydney pipeline, to Canberra. The Bill provides for construction of a 273 millimetre pipeline at an estimated cost of $7. 5m. When completed in 1981 the pipeline will be operated and maintained by the Pipeline Authority, carrying natural gas from the Cooper Basin gas fields in South Australia. The Government's decision to construct the pipeline was announced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on 27 September 1979. </para>
          <para>Introduction of natural gas to Canberra will aid the Government's liquid fuel conservation program by providing further opportunities for significant liquid fuel substitution. The changeover to natural gas could replace over 250,000 barrels of oil useage by 1982- the first full year natural gas becomes available in Canberraincreasing to over 400,000 barrels by 1987. The Government, as the major user of oil in Canberra, can set an example to the private sector by rapid changeover of its facilities to natural gas where this is shown to be economic. </para>
          <para>Natural gas will enhance industrial and commercial prospects in Canberra and the surrounding region with consequent employment benefits. Some 200 new jobs are expected to be created during the construction phase of the Dalton to Canberra spur line and gas reticulation network, with a permanent direct addition to the work force of 60 to 70 persons to operate and maintain the spur line and reticulation network. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>- I must object to these Bills being dealt with concurrently. I believe that they ought to be dealt with separately. It is necessary for the Government to appreciate that, if Government senators continue to behave in the manner in which they behaved at Question Time, it will be difficult for the Opposition to give the co-operation that it has given to this point. I think it is necessary for me to make the point that the program of the Senate can proceed smoothly only if the Government and the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> in particular understand how strongly we feel about the series of events which led to the expulsion from the chamber of one of the Opposition senators. We do not take that matter lightly; we take it very seriously. It seems to me that we will have to show the Government how difficult it will be to get its program through the Senate unless it has the understanding of the Opposition. That understanding has failed today. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that a motion contrary to Standing Orders can be moved. When the Standing Orders set out the procedure, I do not know whether any honourable senator has the power to move a motion contrary to that procedure. That is made clear when an honourable senator wants to discuss one of the Bills proposed to be dealt with cognately without the others. We have dealt with many Bills together when their likeness has been such that they can be discussed together. But when Bills are taken together it may well be that a particular point that an honourable senator wants to make on one of the Bills is swallowed up in the debate. I ask that these Bills be dealt with as the Standing Orders provide. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill, together with an associated tax rates Bill, gives legislative form to previously announced changes in the basis of taxing income of trusts and of dependent children. Also included in the Bill are provisions dealing with the taxation value of housing provided to employees by their employers. Previously foreshadowed measures to counter schemes of tax avoidance that seek to exploit the deduction for bad debts are another part of the Bill. The Bill will also confer tax deductions for gifts towards relief efforts in Kampuchea and East Timor. </para>
          <para>Let me deal with the last of these matters. The Government believes that the level of human suffering in Kampuchea and East Timor is such that we should add to Australia's support by allowing tax deductions for gifts to the appropriate appeals.(Quorum <inline font-style="italic">formed).</inline> Accordingly, the special concession of a deduction for gifts of $2 or more will apply to gifts made in the current financial year to the International Disaster Emergencies Committee Kampuchean Relief Appeal and to the Australian Red Cross East Timor Appeal. The response to the appeals clearly indicates that the granting of tax deductions has been welcomed throughout Australia. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will recall that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> announced broad proposals on the taxation of income of trusts and dependent children at some length on 26 July last. </para>
          <para class="block">After a careful examination of the many responses to this announcement, from individuals and organisations, the Government decided on a number of modifications to eliminate potential anomalies and unintended consequences. Details of these were given in the Treasurer's statement to the House on 14 November 1979. Against that background, I think that I can in this speech confine myself to the main features of the proposed arrangements as reviewed and modified. </para>
          <para>Broadly speaking, the new system applicable to income of dependent children will apply to the taxable income, whether derived directly or through trusts, of children under the age of 18 years at the end of the year of income. But there are to be several important exceptions. Thus the new system will not in any way affect children who are married at the end of the year of income or are in full time employment then. There are also to be exclusions for double orphans and handicapped children. These exclusions will, quite properly, keep the income of a large number of children entirely outside the new system. Income not so excluded will, at base, bear tax under the proposed new system. Particular categories of income, whether derived directly or through a trust, will, however, be excluded and will attract tax only according to the tax rules applicable to individuals generally. </para>
          <para>Thus, income from deceased estates, or from property left to the child by a deceased person will be outside the new system. So too will income from the investment of other sums coming directly to a child on a person 's death, such as the proceeds of a life insurance policy or a lump sum from a superannuation fund. Income from property transferred to a child by another person to whom the property was left by a deceased person, if transferred within three years after the death of that person, will be excluded if within limits set by relevant rules of intestacy. A child in full time employment will, of course, be outside the new system altogether but, as regards a child not categorically excluded in this way, employment income from part time work and income from a business conducted by the child alone or with another minor will both be outside the new system. Income from the investment of compensation paid for damages, for example, for loss of parental support or for personal injury is not to be subject to the new system; neither is income from funds raised by public appeal for the relief of persons in necessitous circumstances. Income from court -ordered settlements arising as a result of divorce or judicial separation, income from the investment of a child 's lottery winnings and income from the investment of savings out of any of the excluded categories of income make up the balance of the classes of income excluded from the new system. </para>
          <para>Experience regrettably having shown that there will always be those who will seek to take unintended advantage of provisions designed, as these exceptions are, to provide relief in particular circumstances, the Bill contains a number of safeguards against exploitation of the exceptions to avoid tax intended to be charged. These safeguarding measures aim to ensure, for example, that profits are not diverted to a child 's business by relatives or other persons not at arm 's length, and that income from a child 's investment is not inflated by similar diversions. </para>
          <para>Income to which the new system appliestermed in the legislation 'eligible' income- will for 1979-80 be taxed at a minimum marginal rate of tax of 47.07 per cent in the hands of the person who is taxable in respect of the income. However, if the eligible income does not exceed $1,040 the special rate will not apply. That means that if the total taxable income does not exceed $3,893 and the eligible income does not exceed $ 1 ,040 no tax will be payable. If the eligible income exceeds $1,040, shading-in arrangements will apply so that the special rate will not be fully applicable until the eligible income exceeds $3,625. Up to that point the average rate of tax will, of course, be lower than 47.07 per cent. If a person has other income as well as eligible income in excess of $1,040, the other income will be taxed in the normal way. This means that the zero rate will apply to the first $3,893 of other income, and the standard rate of 33.07 per cent to other income between $3,894 and $16,608. </para>
          <para>Trust income to which a child under 1 8 years of age is, or is deemed to be, presently entitled is already taxable in the trustee's hands and will be taxed under the new system on the same basis as would apply if the child derived the income directly. This means that, as to trust income to which the new system applies, the trustee will be taxed at the minimum marginal rate of 47.07 per cent, subject to the $1,040 threshold and shading-in arrangements. As to other trust income, the trustee will be taxed at ordinary personal tax rates including the zero rate on income up to $3,893. </para>
          <para>As the Treasurer indicated in his statement on 14 November, the Bill will authorise relief, by way of a rebate of pan or all of any increase in tax payable as a result of the new system, in respect of income arising from arrangements entered into on or before 26 July 1 979. An applicant for relief will need to establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Taxation that the circumstances are such that it would be unreasonable that the whole of the extra tax should be payable. The basis for this relief in the ordinary case where one or both parents have a taxable income is spelt out in the legislation. It is to the effect that a child, or the trustee for a child, will be eligible for a rebate to the extent that the tax otherwise payable on the relevant eligible income is greater than the tax that would have been payable on that income if it had been derived by the parent, or the parent with the higher taxable income. If the child has minor brothers or sisters also in receipt of eligible income, the eligible incomes of all of them will be added to that of the relevant parent in ascertaining how much tax the income would have borne in the parent's hands. In determining the amount of any rebate under this provision, the fact that a parent's income has been reduced by artificial tax avoidance arrangements may be taken into account by the Commissioner. </para>
          <para>The Government believes that this rebate, together with the specific exceptions and exclusions provided in the Bill, should ensure that application of the new system will operate appropriately. However, to make doubly sure, the Commissioner will be given a discretionary power to allow a rebate of part or all of the extra tax payable as a result of the application of the new system if cases should arise where it is shown to his satisfaction that exaction of the full amount would entail serious hardship. In both of these discretionary areas, the Commissioner's decision will be open to the usual rights of objection and appeal. </para>
          <para>As previously foreshadowed, the Bill will, again with some exceptions, alter the arrangements for taxing accumulating trust income, that is to say, income of a trust which no beneficiary has, or is deemed to have, a present entitlement. At present, this income is taxed in the trustee's hands, either at the maximum personal rate of tax or at ordinary personal tax rates but not including, except in relation to the first three years of a deceased estate, the zero rate of tax on the first $3,893 of income. The first change proposed is that a beneficiary who has an indefeasible vested interest in accumulating trust income will be treated as being presently entitled to the income. </para>
          <para>Other accumulating trust income will be taxed at the maximum person tax rate, 61.07 per cent for 1 979-80. However, subject to rules designed to guard against their exploitation for purposes of tax avoidance, there will be significant exceptions. First, the accumulating income of deceased estates will continue to be taxed as at present; that is, the income will bear ordinary personal rates of tax, including the zero rate for the first three years and will attract the benefit of a minimum taxable income of S417 and associated shading-in arrangements thereafter. Secondly, bankrupt estates, and trusts of moneys received as compensation for a particular event, trusts of moneys payable on the death of a person and funds raised by public appeal for persons in necessitous circumstances, will continue to have accumulating income taxed at ordinary personal rates of tax, without the zero rate but with a $41 7 minimum taxable income and associated shading-in arrangements. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline></para>
          <para>As the legislation is only now being considered in the Parliament, the Government has decided that it would not be appropriate to impose any obligation on people concerned to pay provisional tax for 1979-80 on the basis of the proposed new arrangements. This decision means that the new arrangements on income could be seen as having a 'double' effect when assessments on income of the year ending 30 June 1980 are made after the end of the year. These will, of course, show both tax for 1979-80 and provisional tax for 1980-8 1. Accordingly, taxpayers who wish to avoid this apparent doubling-up' effect may do so by applying to have 1979-80 provisional tax varied under the existing self-assessment procedure. The Bill also provides an option for those not otherwise liable to pay provisional tax for 1 979-80 to pay that tax on the basis of the new arrangements. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>before leaving this aspect of the legislation, I should point out that the Bill in the form before the Senate incorporates two amendments proposed by the Government and adopted by the House of Representatives. When the Bill, in its original form, was introduced on 22 November 1979, the Treasurer indicated the Government's intention to delay passage of the Bill to enable interested parties to examine and comment on technical aspects of the proposed tax on income of trusts and minors. Although no comments were received in response to that invitation, the Government's own review of the original Bill brought to light the need for two amendments of a technical kind. One makes it clear that the proposed new arrangements are not to apply to persons who are permanently blind. The other ensures that the higher rates of tax under the proposed new arrangements will not apply to employment income as defined, particularly in the form of superannuation benefit payments, when received by a trustee on behalf of a minor. </para>
          <para>I come now to the subject of employees' housing. Honourable senators may recall that on 13 June 1 979, following completion by the Government of its review of the provisions dealing with taxation of the value of housing accommodation provided for employees, the Treasurer foreshadowed certain changes to the provisions. As the Treasurer indicated on that occasion, the Government believes that a general provision which brings to account for taxation the value of employee benefits is a necessary part of an effective system of personal taxation. Such a provision must, of course, operate in a practical manner having regard to the many and varied circumstances which it must cover. To assist in that direction, amendments proposed by this Bill will make it clear that the Commissioner of Taxation is to take into account all relevant matters in assessing for income tax purposes the value of any housing accommodation provided to an employee. In particular, the amendments proposed will ensure that, to the extent appropriate in the circumstances, specified matters will be brought into consideration as factors tending to reduce the amount of the taxable benefit. </para>
          <para>Remoteness or isolation of the area in which the accommodation is located is one such factor. Any lack of choice by employees in the matter of accommodation and whether occupancy is subject to any onerous conditions imposed on the employee concerned are others. Whether the quality or size of the accommodaton provided exceeds the standard of accommodation that the employee would ordinarily seek is another. All these stated factors will ensure that, as far as possible, full account is taken of those circumstances which might ordinarily reduce the value to an employee of housing benefits granted by an employer. To the same effect will be a specific requirement for the Commissioner to take into account whether it is customary in the particular industry for employers to provide free housing for employees or to provide housing at a low rent. This matter is to form part of the valuation criteria because the Government is conscious of longstanding arrangements between employers and employees in some industries under which accommodation is customarily provided either without charge or for a charge less than the fair rental value of the accommodation. These arrangements are common in respect of industry and employment outside the capital cities and in relatively remote or isolated areas of Australia. </para>
          <para>The valuation criteria to be expressed in the law are to apply in respect of 1977-78 and subsequent income years. The Bill will authorise amendment of assessments for 1977-78 and 1978-79 made before the Bill comes into operation where the new measures would result in a reduction of the value of housing benefits included in the assessments. Such amendments may be made whether or not the employee has exercised the rights of objection and appeal that the law provides. The backdating to 1977-78 will not, of course, retrospectively create any liability for tax on housing benefits. </para>
          <para>Finally, the Bill contains amendments foreshadowed in the Treasurer's statement of 12 June 1979 to counter tax avoidance schemes that exploit the income tax deduction for bad debts. This is done through arrangements under which the loss claimed to be suffered by way of a bad debt is effectively recouped in a non-taxable form. Amendments to provide a counter to tax avoidance schemes of the recoupment type that exploit deductions ordinarily available for expenditure incurred in borrowing money, in discharging a mortgage, in the acquisition of trading stock or by way of interest or rent were foreshadowed in the Treasurer's statement of 24 September 1978 and 1 March 1979. They were enacted last year in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act (No. 4) 1979. The amendments now proposed will extend the operation of those provisions so that they apply also to bad debt schemes. </para>
          <para>Reflecting the statement of 12 June, the amendments will mean that a deduction will not be allowable for a bad debt where the debt is incurred in respect of a loan made after 24 September 1978 as part of a tax avoidance arrangement entered into after that date. For the amendments to apply it will be necessary that the arrangement involves the receipt by the taxpayer or an associate of a compensatory benefit the value of which, when added to the tax benefit sought in respect of the bad debt, would effectively recoup the taxpayer for the loss incurred in respect of the loan so that no real loss is suffered. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>you will note that the amendments proposed by this Bill are to apply to loans made after 24 September 1978. This is the date on which the Government's intention to act against recoupment arrangements was originally announced and is in accord with the warnings given at that time that, if further recoupment schemes were to emerge, the Government would, with effect from that day, act against them as outlined in that announcement. </para>
          <para>The statement of 1 March 1979 with respect to schemes of this type entered into to exploit the deductions for borrowing expenses was an earnest of the Government's intention in this regard. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> Despite that, the bad debt schemes emerged and it has again been necessary to act. I trust that by now the Government's determination to put an end to tax avoidance schemes in which taxpayers seek deductions for losses or outgoings which, in a practical sense, they do not bear is clear both to those promoting the schemes and to taxpayers contemplating paying fees to promoters for access to deductions under such schemes. However, should this still not be the case, I repeat again that the Government will not hesitate to amend the income tax law to counter any other schemes exhibiting similar features, and with effect from 24 September 1978. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer also announced on 12 June that losses generated by bad debt schemes would not be permitted to be carried forward for deduction into a future income year. This is in accord with the policy of the Government announced on 24 May 1979 that paper losses produced by tax avoidance schemes, including recoupment schemes, are not to be allowed to be carried forward as income tax deductions. The amendments proposed will mean that losses created by bad debt schemes in 1 977-78 or earlier years will not be allowed as carry-forward deductions in 1978- 79 or in subsequent income years, while such losses manufactured in the 1978-79 income year will not be deductible against income of 1979- 80 or subsequent years. As is usual, the technical features of the Bill are dealt with in an explanatory memorandum that is being made available for honourable senators. It will be noted that the memorandum bears the title Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1 979 under which it was introduced in the House last year. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill will amend the Income Tax (Rates) Act 1976, which declares the rates of tax payable by individuals and trustees. Its purpose is to declare the rates of tax payable on income of dependent children, and trustees for them, that comes within the scope of the new system for taxing such income proposed in the Bill that I have just introduced. In speaking to that Bill, I mentioned that the income in question is to attract a minimum tax rate for 1979-80 of 47.07 per cent. That rate is declared in this Bill, which also provides for the special tax threshold of $ 1 , 040 that is to be available.

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>MARGARET GUILFOYLEThe main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Currency Act 1965 to empower the Treasurer to issue gold coins of four denominations. In July last the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> announced that the Government had decided to issue a 'collector' type gold coin with a face value of $ 100, and was considering the possible issue of a 'bullion' type gold coin. In view of the subsequent increase in, and the continuing volatility of, the price of gold, it has become desirable to revise some of the details of the proposed coins. This was foreshadowed in the Treasurer's Press release of 13 December 1979. The Government has now decided to issue the collector coin with a face value of $200. It is intended that the coin will be composed of 22 carat gold, have a diameter of 24 millimetres- slightly larger than a 10 cent piece- and weigh 10 grams. </para>
          <para>Because of the volatility of the price of gold it is no longer practicable to provide in the legislation for the collector coin to be issued at its fixed face value. Rather, it is proposed that the issue price of the collector coin be determined for each batch of coins sold. The price would be set at a premium above the value of the coin's gold content just prior to sale but it would not, of course, be set below the face value. With the current price of gold in the vicinity of 450 Australian dollars per ounce the issue price of the collector coin in uncirculated condition would be at or just above its face value of $200; after allowing for costs this would provide a seignorage of the order of $65. In addition, it is intended to issue the collector coin in proof condition at a premium above the price of the uncirculated coin. Although certain issues associated with the issue of a bullion type gold coin have yet to be resolved, it is proposed to make provision for the issue of a bullion coin containing one ounce of fine gold with a nominal face value of $100. This coin would be issued at a price including a relatively small mark-up over the value of the gold content at the time of issue. </para>
          <para>Because the ounce bullion coin may now be beyond the reach of many small investors, it has also been decided to provide for the possibility of issuing two further bullion coins with nominal face values of $50 and $25 and containing a half and a quarter ounce of fine gold respectively. If it were decided at a later date to issue one or both of these coins, they would be priced on the same basis as the one ounce coin. If this Bill is passed into law during the current sittings of Parliament, it is expected that the Royal Australian Mint would be able to strike the first issue of the collector coin for release around about September this year. Subject to the satisfactory settlement of outstanding issues, the first bullion coins could be released later in the year. </para>
          <para>I now outline the main provisions of the Bill. The amendment in clause 4 will have the effect of up-dating the principal Act by extending it to the Territory of Christmas Island, as Australian currency is now the only currency with legal tender status in that Territory. Clause 6 will amend section 14 of the Currency Act. which empowers the Treasurer to cause to be made and issued coins of the denominations of money and standards of composition specified in the Schedule to the Act, by providing for the denomination of the proposed $200 collector coin to be varied from time to time by regulation. This will provide more flexibility should a significant change in the price of gold necessitate a change in the denomination of the collector coin. </para>
          <para>Clause 7 will insert a new section 14a in the Act, sub-section ( 1 ) of which will provide for the proposed $200, $100, $50 and $25 gold coins to be issued at the respective prices determined from time to time by the Treasurer. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> As I have mentioned, because of the potential volatility of the price of gold, it is not practicable to set in advance in the legislation the price at which the $200 coin is to be issued. In the case of the bullion coins, to which the other three proposed denominations will apply, this provision will allow coins containing a specified weight of gold- one, a half or a quarter fine ounce- to be issued at a price including a relatively small mark-up over the value of its gold content at the time of issue. This is normal pricing arrangement for gold bullion coins issued by other countries. Sub-section (2) of the proposed new section will empower the Treasurer to delegate his power under the section as frequent determinations may need to be made in relation to the issue prices of the coins. Subsection (5) will allow the Treasurer to give directions in relation to the exercise of any such delegation. </para>
          <para>Clause 8 will amend the legal tender provisions in section 16 of the present Act. The effect of the present provision is to place a limit of $5 on the legal tendering of coins of the denomination of 5, 10, 20 or 50 cents and a limit of 20 cents for 1 or 2 cent coins. The amendment will provide that coins of the proposed denominations for the gold coins will be legal tender for the payment of a debt of any amount. The other amendments effected by this clause are of a purely formal drafting nature. Clause 1 1 will amend the schedule to the principal Act to provide for the introduction of the $200, $100, $50 and $25 gold coins and to specify their standard composition as eleven-twelfths gold and onetwelfth metal. The opportunity has also been taken to include in the Bill provisions that effect purely formal amendments to the existing Act by bringing the wording of the respective provisions into line with present drafting practice. They do not effect any substantive changes. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline></para>
          <para>This Bill will provide the legislative authority for the issue of gold coins in accordance with the broad intentions of the Government as previously announced. I am sure that the proposed collector coin will enhance the reputation of the Royal Australian Mint and will be keenly sought after by numismatists. For those desiring to invest in gold as such, the bullion coins will provide gold of a specified weight and fineness in a form authenticated by the mint and will, I believe, prove to be very popular with such investors. </para>
          <para>The issue of gold coins by Australia will also draw attention to this country as a producer of gold. Further details of the respective coins, including the designs, will be announced nearer the date of issue. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to implement the Government's decision to continue to provide bounty assistance to the shipbuilding industry in Australia. Under the Ship Construction Bounty Act 1975, bounty is currently calculated as a specified percentage of the lowest acceptable Australian tender price. </para>
          <para>The revised scheme, as proposed by this Bill, will commence on 1 July 1980, and will introduce a new simplified procedure under which bounty will be payable to eligible shipbuilders of vessels exceeding 1 50 gross tons and fishing vessels exceeding 21 metres in length, in an amount finally assessed as a percentage of the cost of construction or modification of such vessels in Australia. Fishing vessels must be for commercial purposes and it is not intended to use this bounty for defence vessels. </para>
          <para>The new scheme follows the Government's consideration of advice and recommendations by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report No. 219 of 25 July 1979 entitled 'Ships, Boats and Other Vessels not Exceeding 6,000 Tons Gross'. With one exception, the Government has decided to adopt the Commission's recommendations for bounty assistance in so far as they related to that assistance after 1 July 1980. The Commission recommended that, in the first two years of the revised scheme, the industry be assisted by a bounty at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">2Vh</inline> per cent of the construction cost of a vessel. It also recommended that this rate be reduced to 25 per cent in the third year, to 22 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent in the fourth year and to 20 per cent thereafter. The Commission considered that a reduction in the rate of 27'/2 per cent to 25 per cent after two years would minimise disruption to those firms whose investment plans have been based on present levels of assistance. The Commission further recommended that for vessels exceeding 1,000 gross construction tons, bounty be payable at a rate of <inline font-style="italic">29lh</inline> per cent if construction was commenced before 31 December 1980. However, the Government has decided that the 27!£ per cent bounty rate will be retained for more than two years until 30 June 1 984, to minimise further the possibility of disruption to the local industry because of the current world overcapacity of vessels which is expected to continue into the mid- 1 980s. From 1 July 1984 to 30 June 1986 the bounty will phase down to the long term rate of 20 per cent. </para>
          <para>The scheme, as proposed by this Bill, will thus provide for the payment to eligible shipbuilders of a bounty at the rate, in respect of vessels exceeding 150 but not exceeding 1,000 gross construction tons and in respect of fishing vessels exceeding 2 1 metres in length, for the purpose of commercial operations and based in an Australian port, and where construction of the vessel is commenced during the period 1 July 1 980 and 30 June 1 984, of 27½ per cent of the construction cost. This rate will phase down to 25 per cent for vessels commenced between 1 July 1 984 and 30 June 1985; and to 2214 per cent for vessels commenced between 1 July 1985 and 30 June 1986. A long term bounty rate of 20 per cent will apply from 1 July 1986. In respect of vessels exceeding 1 ,000 gross construction tons, where construction of the vessel is commenced during the period 1 July 1980 to 31 December 1980, bounty will be payable at the rate of 2916 per cent of the construction cost. From 1 January 1 98 1 these vessels will attract bounty at the rates applying to vessels not exceeding 1 ,000 gross tons. </para>
          <para>In addition to the bounty on construction, the Bill provides for a bounty to be paid in respect of the modification of vessels at the rate of 20 per cent of the cost of the modification providing that cost exceeds $400,000. This will replace the existing bounty under the Ship Construction Bounty Act 1975 of 25 per cent of the cost of modification providing such cost exceeds $500,000. Finally in relation to bounty assistance, the Government has decided that the present requirement for a ship-owner to enter into an agreement to repay bounty if a vessel built with the assistance of bounty is subsequently taken off the Australian coast or registered abroad, will not be adopted under the new scheme. However, vessels built for export will remain ineligible for bounty. If the level of activity in the industry in 1979-80 continues into 1980-8 1 it is estimated that the cost to the Commonwealth of the new bounty scheme in that year will be about $ 17m. </para>
          <para>For the benefit of honourable senators, I will now briefly outline other assistance measures for this industry. It has been decided that imports of vessels not exceeding 150 tons gross and fishing vessels not exceeding 2 1 metres in length will be dutiable at 25 per cent. This sector of the industry has a high degree of natural protection and the Government considers that continuation of assistance at about previous levels will not be inconsistent with promoting an efficient allocation of the community's resources. Other vessels are dutiable at 2 per cent when permanently imported. It has also been decided that vessels will remain prohibited imports under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. Nevertheless, under the shipbuilding assistance arrangements, importation of new vessels and certain second-hand vessels- for example, over 10,000 tons gross- will be permitted, subject to such importation being in accordance with the Government's shipping policy requirements. </para>
          <para>The Government considers that the new arrangements will provide this industry with clear indications of its long term assistance levels, thereby creating a stable environment in which the industry can plan and develop. It is expected that the new bounty arrangements will encourage increased efficiency in the industry without significantly influencing the level of employment and activity. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to implement the Government's decision to provide adjustment assistance to smelters in Australia of refined tin. The Industries Assistance Commission in its report No. 223 of 13 August 1979 entitled 'Tin </para>
          <para class="block">Ores and Concentrates' recommended that export control on tin ores and concentrates and tin metal- other than those required by Australia's obligations under the international tin agreement- no longer apply; that the smelting and refining of tin ores and concentrates in Australia be assisted by means of a bounty payable at the rate of $50 per tonne of refined tin produced from Australian tin concentrate; and that the bounty be paid for a period of three years commencing on the date on which the export controls are removed. </para>
          <para>In its report the Industries Assistance Commission considered that the removal of the export controls could improve returns to tin miners and expand tin mining activity in Australia. However, because the Government is concerned that the immediate removal of the export controls could lead to a sudden reduction in the supply of Australian tin concentrates, with a consequent adverse impact on the Australian smelting industry's capacity to adjust to lower levels of activity or to find alternative supplies of concentrate, it has been decided to phase out the export controls during 1980 and 1981. Under these arrangements, in 1980 individual export permits will be granted to tin miners if supplies of Australian tin concentrate to local smelters are maintained at not less than 75 per cent of the respective miners deliveries to the smelters in the fiscal year 1978-79. In 1981 this proportion will be reduced to 50 per cent and all export controls- other than those necessary to meet Australia's international tin agreement commitments- will cease at the end of 1 98 1 . </para>
          <para>To complement the phasing out of export controls, the Government has decided to provide assistance to Australian smelters by way of a bounty scheme, commencing on 1 January 1980 and ending on 31 December 1982, at the rate of $50 per tonne of the weight of refined tin produced from Australian tin concentrate, providing that the refined tin is produced at registered premises during the period to which the Act applies. The Act provides that this bounty will only be payable in respect of refined tin, produced from additional concentrate supplies which miners deliver to smelters above their specified minimum levels which I referred to earlier. With the removal of export controls at the end of 1981, bounty will be payable in respect of refined tin produced from all Australian concentrate delivered to the smelters in 1982. On the assumption that concentrate deliveries to smelters will continue at the 1 978-79 levels, the cost of the bounty scheme is estimated to be approximately $65,000 in 1980, $130,000 in 1981 and up to $250,000 in 1982.I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to implement the Government's decision to provide assistance to producers in Australia of penicillin. The question of assistance for the production in Australia of penicillin stems from a report by the Industries Assistance Commission on 2 August 1976 entitled 'Pharmaceutical and Veterinary Products'. In that report the Commission concluded that, on economic grounds, there was no case for assisting the local production of penicillin, and recommended that the tariff assistance in respect of this product be removed. However, the Government is of the view that penicillin production capacity in Australia should be maintained for health and defence purposes. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> This is for the reason that penicillin is regarded by the medical profession as the best and most widely used antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infection and, in times of emergency, penicillin- especially penicillin in the form of injectable procaine- is the drug of first choice. The Government has therefore decided to provide assistance, by way of a bountry scheme, for the continued production in Australia of phenoxymethylpenicillin otherwise known as penicillin V, and benzylpenicillin, otherwise known as penicillin G. For the information of honourable senators, penicillin V is used for the production of most of the penicillin formulations made in Australia, with the exception of injectable forms.

            <para>- Before the suspension of the sitting, my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Margaret Guilfoyle was in the process of reading the second reading speech on my behalf. I shall now continue. Penicillin G is used for the production of the injectable forms and phenethecillin, which is a semi-synthetic penicillin. The amount of penicillin produced in Australia is sufficient to satisfy the annual local demand for human consumption. The Australian demand for human consumption of penicillin G, and penicillin V is around 7,000 kilograms per annum and 15,500 kilograms per annum respectively. The scheme, as proposed by this Bill, will provide for the payment to Australian producers of a bounty at the rate of $38 per kilogram of the weight of the penicillin for penicillin V, and $29 per kilogram of the weight of the penicillin for penicillin G, provided the penicillin is used by the producer, or sold by the producer for use, in the production in Australia of antibiotics, during a period to which the Act applies. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The scheme will operate for 5 years with an initial overall annual limit available for payment of bounty of $250,000 for penicillin G and $650,000 for penicillin V. Provision is made in the Bill for the rates of bounty and the annual limits available for payment of bounty to be varied by regulation if annual reviews reveal the need for such variation following movements in penicillin prices overseas and the level of cost increases in Australia. In addition, because it is intended to coincide the removal of the customs duty on imported penicillin with the introduction of the bounty scheme, clause 2 of the Bill provides for the Act to come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation. If production costs and demand in relation to this product remain relatively stable it is estimated that the cost to the Commonwealth of the scheme for the 5 -year period will be about $4.5m. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. ( <inline font-style="italic">Quorum formed).</inline></para>

              <para>-Honourable senators will recall the Government's decision in 1976 to transfer to the Northern Territory Government powers to control executive functions similar to those exercised by State government. The transfer of powers was part of the Territory's move towards self-government. The amendments to the Air Navigation Act flow from this decision. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the transfer of powers in relation to civil aviation. The actual transfer of powers will be made by amendment to the Regulations under the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 which will be laid before the Senate in the near future. The Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments have been in close consultation on the transfer of powers relating to civil aviation and it was agreed some time ago that the transfer would not proceed until the relevant Northern Territory authorities gained experience in this specialist area and to allow the Connair Pty Ltd subsidy contract to run its course to termination. Honourable senators may be aware that Connair has now been taken over by East- West Airlines Ltd and a new company is to be established to operate the Northern Territory regional airline. The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> has agreed to continue subsidy payments until the contract terminates on 30 September 1 980 provided that the services previously operated by Connair are maintained. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The effect of this Bill will put the Northern Territory in the same position as the States in regard to the control of air services within the Territory's boundaries. Accordingly, as is the position in the States, the Northern Territory Government will have the power to issue licences on economic and public interest grounds. The Commonwealth will retain control of matters relating to safety and operational issues and will only grant licences where an operator has established it can comply with the relevant criteria. Both a Commonwealth and Territory licence will be required before intra-territory services could be provided. As a consequence of the proposed amendments to the Air Navigation Act contained in this Bill, appropriate amendments are necessary to the Air Navigation Regulations. These will be laid before the Senate shortly. The Government shares the Northern Territory Government's concern that an early completion of the transfer be achieved. </para>
          <para>I am sure honourable senators will agree that this is an historical occasion. It would not be appropriate for me to make this speech without mentioning the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> J. Connellan, the founder of Connair Pty Ltd. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connellan</inline> 's pioneer spirit brought air services to many remote areas of the Territory, places which were often unreachable by land transport. I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Minister and the Government to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connellan</inline> on his fine efforts.

Honourable senators will be aware that the functions of the Australian National Airlines Commission are set out in section 1 9 of the Act. To make fully effective the transfer of Executive authority for civil aviation within the Northern Territory to the Northern Territory Government, the operations of Trans-Australia Airlines are required to be subject to Northern Territory law. </para>
          <para>The Bill proposes that all intra-Northern Territory operations of TAA will be subject to licence by the appropriate Northern Territory authorities. State-Territory operations, such as the Perth-Port Hedland-Darwin route currently operated by TAA will not be affected. This amendment will place TAA in the same position as Ansett Airlines of Australia or any other airline in regard to intra-Northern Territory services and therefore is consistent with the Government 's policy that its transport business undertakings are not advantaged or disadvantaged as compared with their competitors.

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Pig Meat Promotion Act 1975. That Act provided that funds for the promotion of pig meat derived from a pig slaughter levy be channelled through a trust account. It also established a Pig Meat Promotion Advisory Committee to make recommendations to the Minister on promotion expenditure from the trust account and on the rate of levy for promotion purposes. </para>
          <para>Under the present legislation, an officer of the Department of Primary Industry enters into contracts and agreements for promotion to implement the program recommended by the Committee. Work for the Committee is currently arranged through contractors, when frequently it would be better if carried out by Committee employees. The current levy of 13c per pig slaughtered yields about $450,000 a year. No government contributions are involved. The Amendment Bill provides for some changes in the powers and responsibilities of the Committee. With promotion activities expanding, it is considered appropriate to make the promotion Committee a body corporate with powers to promote and enter into promotion contracts, and to be able to employ its own staff. </para>
          <para>The current trust account arrangements will be maintained and the program of expenditure will continue to be subject to ministerial approval. However, with a committee that is incorporated, and with promotion activities wholly funded by industry, it is appropriate for the  Chairman  of the Committee to be a producer representative rather than a departmental officer as at present. The  Chairman  will be nominated by the Australian Commercial Pig Producers Federation, the National producer body, from the two members representing the Federation on the Committee. The amendments result from requests to the Government by the Federation. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

Honourable senators will recall that in a statement to the Senate on 1 May 1979, the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> foreshadowed such legislation when he announced that, following consultation and agreement with the States and the Northern Territory, the Authority was to be established and be responsible for the planning and staging of a major commemoration of the Australian Bicentenary 1988. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para>
          <para>The Authority is registered as a company, limited by guarantee under the Australian Capital Territory Companies Ordinance 1962. In keeping with the bipartisan approach so appropriate to this nationally important matter of the Bicentenary, the subscribers to the memorandum and articles of association of the Authority are the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr John McLeay),</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen),</inline> the Premier and the Leader of the Opposition in each of the States, the Chief Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> B. Reid,  Chairman  of the Authority. The Minister for Administrative Services announced recently the names of the 1 7 members of the board of directors of the company, seven of whom are appointees of the Commonwealth, one from each State and the Australian Capital Territory. Another seven are appointees of the States and the Northern Territory, one from each; and two are appointees from this Parliament, one from the Government side and the other from the Opposition. The seventeenth member is the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Mr J.</inline> B. Reid. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will appreciate that a board of directors of 17 is somewhat large, but for reasons that will be obvious it could scarcely be smaller. To make it any larger would of course tend to make it unwieldly; indeed it could become quite counter-productive. At the same time, there is much talent and experience available which should be brought to bear upon the planning and staging of the Bicentenary, not only to achieve the objective of a national commemoration, but also to achieve it well and in the best possible way with the solid support and involvement of all Australians. The framework of administrative arrangements agreed with the States and the Northern Territory, the memorandum and articles of association of the Authority and this Bill have been designed with this in mind. </para>
          <para>The Bicentenary year is less than eight years away, but in that time, for different phases of the preparations, there will be a need for different skills, different approaches, different experiences and different considerations. To meet this, the articles of association provide for varying terms of appointment of directors. They can be for two, three, four or five years and so provide for stability and continuity of the board. Some directors, whose experiences would be of great benefit to the board, may not be willing to undertake long term appointments. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> The initial appointments recently announced, because it is the initial period, are all for short terms. With the exception of Western Australia, the States and Northern Territory appointees and the Commonwealth appointee for the Australian Capital Territory have three year terms, while the other appointees have two year terms. The two Federal parliamentarians have been appointed for three years. </para>
          <para>The  Chairman  was appointed by the Prime Minister and the Bill provides for the termination of his appointment in the event of misbehaviour or incapability or on six months notice should either party wish such termination. The States and Territories bicentennial committees will provide the opportunities for effective representation of community and other interest groups. As well, the directors of the Authority are empowered under the articles of association to appoint additional committees consisting of members and/or such other persons as they think fit. The provision for staggered and varying terms of appointment of directors, together with the committees to be established within the overall Bicentenary framework, will provide the opportunities for all sections and members of the community individually and collectively to be involved to the best advantage. The Government has in mind aboriginal and ethnic groups and young people being involved in the framework of the Bicentenary at all levels. </para>
          <para>This Bill, together with the memorandum and articles of association of the Authority, provides an arrangement which confers upon the Authority an appropriate degree of autonomy and flexibility to enable it to operate in a businesslike way, yet at the same time provides for its accountability to the Parliament through the Minister for Administrative Services, who may give directions as to the policies the Authority is to follow. The Auditor-General will audit the Authority's accounts and any appropriation by the Parliament for purposes of the Authority will be subject to the usual parliamentary scrutiny. The Authority will report annually to the Minister, with copies going to each of the Premiers of the States and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>It is envisaged that some major Bicentennial project, which could be revenue producing, would be handled but by a separate organisation set up especially for the purpose. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed.)</inline> The Bill will enable the Authority, with the Minister's approval, to form or invest in subsidiary companies for the purpose of promoting or pursuing any such projects. The Authority and its wholly owned subsidiary companies will be exempt from Commonwealth, State or Territory taxation. In the case of a partly owned subsidiary, the Treasurer may, by notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> declare such a company to be similarly exempt. </para>
          <para>The application of moneys is restricted to payment within the objects and powers of the Authority in discharge of costs, expenses and other obligations. Moneys not immediately required may be invested or deposited at an approved bank, in Commonwealth securities or as otherwise approved by the Treasurer. The Bill provides that the standard controls applying to statutory authorities will apply so that the Authority, with the approval of the Treasurer, may borrow moneys for the purpose of promoting its objects, which of course are set out in the memorandum of association. </para>
          <para>The Authority is required to consult with the Public Service Board before determining terms and conditions of service or employment of persons. It is deemed to be a Commonwealth authority for purposes of Part IV of the Public Service </para>
          <para class="block">Act 1922, an approved authority for the purposes of the Superannuation Act 1976, and the Bill also provides for the rights of public servants who may become employed by the Authority, to be protected. </para>
          <para>Overseas experience has indicated that it is of great importance that there should be effective control of the exploitation of words, things and activities relating to the Bicentenary. Without such control, substantial revenues can be lost. The Bill provides protection for the name, symbols and certain words and expressions when used in conjunction with certain relevant dates or figures. Maximum penalties of $2,000 for a person and $4,000 for a corporation are provided and as well offending goods or articles may be subject to forfeiture. Forfeiture is considered to be more effective than the imposition of relatively low fines and does not necessarily require the conviction of a person from whom the goods are seized. Revenue to be gained from licensing and franchising the use of symbols and expressions will assist the Authority to meet the cost of the Bicentenary celebrations. With the passage of this Bill, the Authority will be able to proceed with confidence with its important task. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of the Bill is the implementation of a honey research scheme similar to those in operation for a number of other rural industries. A statutory honey research scheme has been requested by the honey industry to permit an expanded research program considered by the industry to be essential to its future progress. The existing non-statutory research arrangement is seen as being quite inadequate in the light of problems related to bee diseases, pesticide hazards, honey bee nutrition and bee breeding which the industry faces. The Bill is modelled on existing legislation for similar rural research schemes. Research is broadly interpreted in clause 3 of the Bill to cover the scientific, technical and economic aspects of beekeeping and the production, packing and marketing of hive products. It includes the training of people for research, publication of research findings and the dissemination of information and advice. It allows scope for a wide range of research. The Bill provides for the establishment of a Honey Research Trust Account to receive the equivalent of an industry levy-export charge to be imposed for research purposes, to be matched dollar for dollar by the Commonwealth as industry contributions are spent. Other payments into the trust account will include income from gifts, sale of assets and produce and interest on investment. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> Within the trust account are to be two separate accounts, one for matchable income from the research levy-export charge plus the Commonwealth contribution, the other for non-matchable income. This will permit expenditure from either account as provided in clause 7. Research expenditure will be subject to the approval of the Minister on the recommendation of the Honey Research Committee set up by the legislation. </para>
          <para>The Honey Research Committee will be made up of two persons representing the honey industry, two representing research organisations and one, the  chairman,  representing the Department of Primary Industry. Committee members are to be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of the organisation concerned. Provision is made for the payment of remuneration and allowances to members of the Committee in keeping with normal practice and subject to determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline></para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline>MARGARET GUILFOYLEExisting departmental staff will administer the research account and provide the secretariat of the Research Committee. It is proposed that the provisions of the Honey Research Bill come into operation on the date of royal assent. This will enable the early appointment of the Research Committee to consider and recommend to the Minister a research program for 1980-81. Circumstances will not permit a full scale program to become effective in the first year. Funds for research will be contributed by the industry through a levy on honey sold on the domestic market or used in manufacture and a charge on honey exported. </para>
          <para>To facilitate the imposition and collection of the proposed research levy-export charge, it is intended to utilise existing legislative machinery under which an industry levy-export charge is collected to finance the operations of the Australian Honey Board. I shall introduce separately four Bills which should be treated as cognate legislation but I shall now refer briefly to their purposes. The Honey Levy (No. 1 ) Amendment Bill 1980, the Honey Levy (No. 2) Amendment Bill 1 980 and the Honey Export Charge Amendment Bill 1980 will enable an additional levy or export charge to be collected through the same mechanism as moneys for the operation of the Australian Honey Board are collected. The Honey Industry Amendment Bill 1980 will have the effect of reserving to the Honey Board the appropriate amounts of levy or export charge. The research levy-export charge will come into operation on 1 July 1 980 at an initial operative rate of 0.25 cents per kg of honey. The operative rate may be varied by regulation up to a maximum of 0.5 cents per kg. At the initial operative levyexport charge rate, industry contributions to the research account would be of the order of $50,000 in a full year at normal levels of honey production. The Commonwealth would match on a dollar for dollar basis expenditure of those contributions for research in accordance with the provisions of the legislation.I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- On a number of occasions in this chamber, I have mentioned the problems of local government. According to the draft program, later this week we will be debating a local government Bill in this place. Tonight I take the opportunity of this first reading debate to mention how one of the local government shires in Queensland is trying to obtain additional funds to finance its operations and to obtain recognition for the special hardships which it faces. I refer to the shire of Burke in the far north of Queensland. The shire of Burke covers an area of approximately 42,000 square kilometres. To put this in perspective, one should realise that that is about three-fifths of the area of Tasmania. The boundaries of the shire of Burke are interesting to look at. The north boundary is the coastline of the Gulf of Carpentaria; to the west the boundary is the Northern Territory border; to the east the border is the Leichhardt River; and to the south there is a zig-zag border line of 70 to 100 miles below the Gulf coast. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Although the area of the shire of Burke is vast, the population is small. In fact, the population totals only about 1,500 people. One can easily understand the difficulties faced by a shire council with such a large area to service but with such a small population to provide the finances for its operations. The administrative centre of the Burke Shire Council is located at Burketown, which has a population of only 1 50 people. To give an idea of the isolation of Burketown, it is interesting to look at what are the nearest major centres of population. They are Mount Isa, which is 5 10 kilometres to the south; Cloncurry, which is 380 kilometres to the south; and Normanton, which is 220 kilometres to the east. </para>
          <para>Burketown has, and freely admits that it has a number of difficulties. They include insufficient housing. In fact, recently when I was at Burketown a number of Aboriginals approached me and pointed out that when they came there from outlying centres there was no hostel in which they could live and there was no temporary accommodation which they could use; they had to camp by the riverside. As well, Burketown has poor telephone and mail services. There is only one telephone line to Burketown, so if someone is ringing in or ringing out nobody else can use the telephone line. Often when one wants to send a telegram the lines are down and the telegram cannot be sent. The mail services are not daily as they are in the metropolitan areas. Burketown has few fences and few gardens; it has few lawns. In other words, it is not the sort of town that most people would look forward to living in. Burketown has no television- which I concede sometimes can be a blessing- for people's enjoyment. There is no railway and there are no sewerage facilities. </para>
          <para>The cost of living in Burketown is very high. For instance a carton of 24 stubbies costs $20. To put this in perspective for those people who do not often drink a stubbie, the regular price of such a carton in Brisbane is $10.65. A loaf of bread in Burketown costs $1, which is about double the cost in a metropolitan area. In the whole of the shire of Burke- honourable senators may remember that I said that the area of the shire of Burke was about three-fifths of the area of Tasmania- there are only 1 6 kilometres of bitumen. </para>
          <para>Despite all of these disadvantages, the Burke Shire Council has embarked on tourist promotion of the Burke shire. The main purpose of this tourist promotion really is not to attract tourists to the area, but rather to make other Australians aware of the problems of people in areas such as this. Actually, a great amount of tourist potential exists in the Burke shire. Yet it is so far from other centres of population that tourists very rarely get there. However, the Shire  Clerk  told me on a recent visit that tourism had stepped up by about 1,000 per cent over the last year. When one realises what the base figure was before it was stepped up by 1,000 per cent one realises that this would not be all that difficult to achieve. I point out that the promotion that has been carried on to attract tourists, or perhaps to make people aware of what the Burke Shire Council's problems are, is no mean promotion. Last year, the Shire Council spent $38,000 on promotion; this year it has budgeted for promotion to the value of $85,000. For a shire with a population of 1,500 people this really is a remarkable effort. </para>
          <para>Tonight I point out something in relation to the Burke Shire Council that perhaps is of interest; that is, that whilst it is not compulsory to have a passport to visit Burke shire, it is almost compulsory to have a passport to get out of the shire. One can travel quite freely into and out of Burketown, but rarely does a visitor come away from the Burke shire without the shire 's passport. I would like to describe this passport, what it costs and what benefits are available to a person who takes it. I have purchased three passports in recent years. I purchased one when I first went there, I purchased one for my pilot because it was expected that he should have one and when I last went there I purchased one for another pilot. </para>
          <para>I will explain what this passport is. I suppose that one could call it a promotional gimmick, but it is an interesting promotional gimmick. In some respects it looks like a real passport. On the outside it has the words 'Shire of Burke on the Gulf of Carpentaria, Queensland- Official Passport'. Underneath it has a number, as all passports do. My passport is No. 02465, which seems to indicate to me that the sale of the passports had been fairly good prior to when I bought mine. The inside of the passport is similar to the passports we have when we travel overseas. The introduction of this passport states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The shire chairman and all councillors of the Council of the shire of Burke requests and requires in the name of Burke Shire Council all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hinderance and to afford the bearer such assistance and protection as may be necessary. </para>
            <para>This passport remains the property of the bearer whose name and photograph appears on the next page. The rights and privileges associated with the passport are not negotiable to any other person. The passport is not valid unless stamped and signed by the shire clerk, Burke Shire Council. </para>

On the inside the passport is just like a normal passport, showing the name of the bearer, the address and the bearer's signature. The passport has a photograph, if one can supply a photograph. This passport contains some interesting things that one does not normally find in one's Australian passport or in the passports of other countries. For instance, the passport states: </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> indicated before, one almost obtains the freedom of the city. One does not quite gain the freedom of the city, but when one purchases a Burke Shire Council official passport one is given a certificate of citizenship of the Burke shire. Amongst other things this certificate states that the bearer:   is hereby declared to be an Honorary Citizen of the Shire of Burke and is therefore entitled to the certain specified privileges as detailed in the aforementioned passport </para>
          <para class="block">I did fail to mention that the passport of the Burke Shire Council is much less expensive than an Australian passport. The Burke Shire Council's official passport costs $5 only. Of course, one does not have to go to Burketown to obtain such a passport. I am sure that if all those honourable senators who are interested were to contact the Shire  Clerk  at Burketown they would be able to obtain a passport quite readily provided they sent along their $5 for its purchase. </para>

Therefore, I have outlined the efforts which have been taken to show the determination of the people who live in this isolated area of Australia to gain better recognition of their problems. </para>

            <para>- Before I commence my speech on the first reading me, a money Bill I draw your attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> to the state of the <inline font-style="italic">House,(Quorum formed).</inline> It is my belief that an elected member of parliament should not speak to an unconstituted House. But, despite my calling for a quorum- I note that some honourable senators are leaving the chamber- I will now have to proceed to speak to an unconstituted House. I think that there is some obligation on members who are paid by the electors to look after their business to attend this place. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The question on which I want to speak is unbelievable and too important to be heard by only a few honourable senators. I wish to talk of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, and in particular of the Bureau of Customs, and to query how crooked a department can be before an investigation is made. I refer to the transfer of the powers of the Narcotics Bureau. This was done after the release of a report on drugs and after a Minister had verified the honesty of a member of the Narcotics Bureau who was sacked two weeks later when the corruption in that section of the Bureau of Customs came to light. It was said that even people who were hawking drugs in Australia had access to the computer arrangements in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to detect drug smugglers. Not only was the Narcotics Bureau transferred from the Department to the Australian Federal Police but also the Minister for Business and Consumers Affairs was changed. One queries whether the new Minister has made any improvements to the Department. </para>
          <para>I refer to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Aleksander</inline> Wacyk, a Polish Ukranian, who has lived in Australia for 24 years. He has Polish and Russian citizenship. He also has Australian citizenship as he has been naturalised. He operates a wholesale jewellery company in South Australia and has some mining interests. He was invited to a trade forum at the World Trade Fair at Poznan in Poland at the invitation of the Polish Government in June 1979. He took with him much jewellery in the hope that he could open up trade throughout Europe. He also took samples of expensive jewellery for display at the Fair. He returned to Australia with the samples of jewellery on 6 July 1979. He landed at Sydney Airport where Customs officials searched his luggage. While the two investigating officers were searching his luggage they pulled out of it various trinkets, pendants and bracelets and put them in their pockets in front of the man. Each said: 'This is for my wife'. When he complained they replied: 'It will be very dangerous for you if you make any complaint about this'. </para>
          <para>It <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> unbelievable that such a thing should happen, but we can prove that it happened. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline> then went to the ombudsman at the airport, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> Smith, who introduced him to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr G.</inline> McShane of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McShane</inline> took all of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk's</inline> jewellery and said: 'We will send a police squad to the homes of the two investigating officers this night to see whether we can discover the stolen jewellery '. He said that he would keep the jewellery for identification purposes and would return it within two days. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McShane</inline> gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline> a receipt for the jewellery that he had retained. He identified each piece of jewellery on the document and signed it. The receipt is numbered B.390 and bears the name J. G. McShane, the investigation officer for the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. </para>
          <para>At the end of my address I shall table the receipts. I will not seek their incorporation as I do not think they would mean anything to anyone reading the debate. The officer retained the whole of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk's</inline> jewellery. Apparently the police raided and searched the investigating officers' homes that night and found at each officer's home two pieces of jewellery of a total value of $200 which could be identified as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk's</inline> jewellery. Although they promised to return the remainder of the jewellery it took a fortnight before some of it was returned to Customs officers at Port Adelaide, South Australia, from whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline> took possession of it. I shall also table a receipt signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline> which indicates the jewellery that he received from the Bureau of Customs at Port Adelaide. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline>was informed that other jewellery was not returned because the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs was keeping it for the furthering of its investigations of the two officers. Subsequently two officers from Canberra visited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk's</inline> home and returned what they claimed to be the remainder of the jewellery, other than the four pieces in relation to which the two officers were charged. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline> queried this as the jewellery that the Customs officers had signed that they had received in Sydney- apart from the four pieces retaineddid not correspond to what was returned that night. The value of the missing gems was $7,000. The officers said that they could not account for this. They said that the previous night they stayed at a hotel in Sydney where the door to their room was not locked. Is this the way they behave as custodians of valuable jewellery? </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk's</inline>daughter, a practising solicitor in Adelaide, wrote to the Secretary of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. She said that unless the Department returned the pieces of jewellery, which were samples borrowed from another individual for trade display purposes, they would have to take some action. As a result of her request to the Department, which is proof of the incident which I am explaining, she received a letter dated 20 November 1 979 from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr M.</inline> A. Besley, the Secretary of the Department. The letter reads: </para>
          <quote>

          <para class="block">A Customs officer took this man's jewellery, put it in his pocket and said: 'This will be for my wife'. For that he received as punishment an official reprimand'. I do not know what is meant by an 'official reprimand '. But is this sufficient for that type of theft? These two officers threatened <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline> that he would be in serious trouble if he said anything about the matter. This conveys to me that they believed that the jewellery was contraband on which duty was payable and that they thought that they could take what they liked. This indicates that in that section of the Department officers will allow contraband into Australia if they get sufficient reward. I may be mistaken in that belief. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline> was given a straight out threat. If the officers believed that the man was honest and could prove he took jewellery out of Australia I cannot see any purpose for blatantly thieving the articles which resulted in their receiving an official reprimand. The Secretary of the Department also stated in his letter: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">

          <para class="block">The last I heard, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline> still had not heard from the Department when those four items would be returned. They are not items now under dispute; only the theft of the items is involved. We do not know whether those Customs officers are still inspecting luggage. The letter from the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs continued: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(c)">

I am further satisfied that there is no evidence to indicate that they were retained by any officer of the Department. To the extent of those items, and  futher  items retained and since returned but not listed thereon, the receipts were in error and such arose solely because of the efforts made by Departmental officers to avoid inconvenience to your client, who wished to fly to Adelaide that evening. In those circumstances, the officers unfortunately had an inadequate opportunity to physically check the goods retained with the receipts given. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">These two officers stole $200 worth of jewellery from this man. They were detected and have received an official reprimand. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline> has lost $7,000 worth of gems that did not belong to him. The Department of Business and Consumer Affairs officers had them. This is shown by a receipt they signed to indicate that they took possession of them. Now the Department denies that it took possession of them but claims that the officers wrongfully signed the receipt. What has been done with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McShane,</inline> who was so neglectful in his duty that he signed a receipt which he now denies was a correct inventory of the goods he had received? That inventory is a statement of the Department. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline>has lost $7,000 worth of jewellery which he had when he landed in Australia but which according to the receipt was taken from him by Customs. He signed receipts for reclaiming jewellery, but no jewellery shown on receipt number B390 has never been returned to him. The two investigating officers from the Bureau of Customs said that the jewellery may have been pinched from a hotel in Sydney. The Department says that it takes no responsibility and no blame. Now the Department says that one of its senior investigating officers signed a receipt in mistake to let this individual catch a plane to Adelaide. It is unbelievable that an officer would make such a mistake. No one would think it would be possible. </para>
          <para>As a result of the seizure of the jewellery <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline> lost his samples which he was due to sell in Adelaide. He had to terminate his business and is now in serious financial difficulties as a result. Not only did he lose $7,000 worth of jewellery but he also lost his business and he is now trying to make a living as a real estate agent.  His  business was completely ruined and he lost his savings from that successful business, savings which he had built up over 24 years in Australia and from which he had educated his children. All of this has been lost by nothing other than blatant theft by the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. But the Department tries to get around that allegation by saying: 'We signed the wrong receipt. We never had the jewels. We never took them '. That is the only excuse that the Department can offer for not returning the jewellery. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk's</inline>daughter, who is a solicitor, has advised him that he has a legal claim against the Government, obviously. I would think that the information that I shall seek to table tonight is proof of that accusation. I think that that action will succeed in court. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline> is faced with the task of fighting the Commonwealth Government which will take many thousands of dollars he has not got. Although his daughter is a lawyer, she could be only a junior lawyer in any court proceedings against the Commonwealth Government. I doubt very much <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk's</inline> capabilities of rectifying the wrong of theft by a government department against him, an Australian citizen, who went overseas for the purpose of trade promotion and who came back and fell into the hands of very crooked officers of the Department. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk's</inline>whole attitude has been straightforward. He protested when the officers put the jewellery in their pockets and said: 'This is for my wife'. He went to the ombudsman, who took him to the investigating officer. They had a search of the premises that night. The two officers were found guilty under the Public Service Act and were given an official reprimand. Goodness knows what that means. I want to know how these two officers who were found guilty of theft of jewellery from this person coming into Australia were punished. What has happened to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McShane,</inline> a senior officer of the Department, who signed a document stating that he had received goods, which he now claims he never received? What inquiry has been made regarding the two investigating officers who admitted the loss of $7,000 worth of gems but who said that those gems may have been left in an unlocked room in a hotel in Sydney? Is this the guardianship that we give to people entering Australia with precious jewellery? I leave those questions for the Minister for Special Trade Representations <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Scott)</inline> to answer. I hope that he will contact the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland)</inline> and that we will get an answer. I seek leave to table the four documents by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> McShane on behalf of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs acknowledging the articles that he retained possession of at Sydney Airport for follow-up investigations. </para>

I seek to table the receipt signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wacyk</inline> regarding the goods that he obtained when the officers sent the jewellery to the Customs Bureau, Customs House, Adelaide, on Wednesday, 15 August. That receipt shows the disparity in relation to the goods received. There are another lot of goods which the two investigators brought over, but which do not contain the goods mentioned in receipt B390, which is admitted by the Department which states the goods were never received. </para>

            <para>- I take advantage of this first reading debate on a money Bill to raise a number of matters that relate to the activities and the administration of the Parliament. It is not my intention to speak at length, but I want to raise the old, and I suppose vexatious, question of members of the Parliament, including members of the Senate, and their rights in relation to the Executive of this nation. While I continue to be a member of the Senate I will continue, as I have done in the past, to press for the rights of senators to ask questions and to receive answers to those questions. It concerns me, on picking up today's Notice Paper, to see a question placed there as long ago as February 1979. Some 14 months ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> asked a Minister in this chamber- not a Minister in another placethe Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack),</inline> for certain information as to his activities or the activities of his personal staff in relation to meeting certain people engaged in the lobbying business in Canberra. I do not care what answer the Attorney-General may or may not give to that question, but I suggest that after a period of 14 months <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> is entitled to receive some sort of answer. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are other complaints in a similar vein. One of my questions was placed on the notice paper on 5 June 1979, nearly 12 months ago. It asks whether any offer has been made by the Channel 9 television network to the Australian Broadcasting Commission to enable the Commission to telecast cricket tests to viewers who will not be serviced by the Channel 9 network or the regional commercial television stations which are to take up the Channel 9 telecast. The cricket tests have been and gone and since that question was placed on the Notice Paper on 5 June of last year. There still remains no answer to that question. </para>
          <para>I tell the Minister for Special Trade Representations <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Scott)</inline> that he should transmit to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> that if, by the time the supplementary estimates for his Department and the ABC have come into this Senate I have not received an answer to that question, I will be moving for the deferral of the estimates of the Postal and Telecommunications Department and the Australian Broadcasting Commission until I receive a reply to that question. It is a very simple question indeed. It astounds me that members of the Government can bury their heads in the sand and allow statutory authorities to permit these questions to remain on the Notice Paper. I hope that the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission will take heed of the fact that a question was placed on the Senate Notice Paper on 5 June 1 979 inquiring into certain matters that I would consider were of paramount importance to the administration of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This question still remains unanswered on the Notice Paper. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa,</inline> three days later asked this question addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) Are the range and quality of services offered by the Commonwealth Professional Employment Office to be reduced? </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Will the Minister assure the Senate that neither a fee for services, nor commission charges, will be introduced in the Professional Employment Office. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">I would have thought that a matter of that nature would have been covered in the Budget of 1979-80 and that the question could have been answered by this stage. </para>
          <para>I must tell the members of the Government through the Minister for Special Trade Representations, who is at the table, that it is inexcusable that no answer has been given to any of those questions that were placed on the Notice Paper before the commencement of this parliamentary session in February of this year. If the Minister likes to peruse the Notice Paper, he will see that there are still a great number of them. I make an appeal to him, to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick),</inline> and to all of their ministerial colleagues in this place to see that not only their own departments but also the departments that they represent in this chamber have some awareness of the responsibilities of members and the responsibilities of the bureaucracy to the Executive, and the responsibility of the Executive to the Parliament. </para>
          <para>I have mentioned those matters in relation to questions which remain unanswered. I now mention one or two of the questions that have in fact been answered. I must say that, as a former Minister in the Labor Government, I do not necessarily blame all the Ministers themselves directly for not being able to survey all of the answers that are given in this Parliament. I make that excuse lightly on their behalf, because basically Ministers have a responsibility to be responsible for everything that goes into this Parliament in their own names. But I know that members of the bureaucracy put down answers and then, subject to the Minister's approving them, the answer comes into this Parliament. I know that, if there are 10, 15 or 20 answers given at the one time just before Question Time commences or before Parliament starts each day, it is very difficult indeed for the Minister to peruse each of the answers that have been provided. I know that from my own experience. </para>
          <para>I draw the attention of the Senate in particular to an answer to a question that I had placed on the Notice Paper on 27 February 1 980. 1 asked: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) How many: (a) old age, and (b) invalid, pensioners are resident (as at 26 February 1980) in each of the Federal electoral divisions of: (i) Gwydir; (ii) Banks: (iii) Barton; (iv) St George; (v) Hume; (vi) Lyne; and (vii) New England . . . </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">These are Federal electorates in New South Wales in which I have a particular interest. The answer was provided to me on 5 March, about a week later, in this form: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Statistics relating to the number of pensioners and beneficiaries in Federal electoral divisions are published annually in a publication called 'Recipients of Pensions, Benefits and Family Allowances in postcode districts and electoral divisions. This publication was forwarded to all senators on 3 March 1 979. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Now, 12 months after, I am asking for information that is supposed to be provided on an annual basis, and the Department serves up an answer of that nature to the Minister saying that the information that the honourable senator wants was provided 12 months ago, when in its own answer it says that the information is provided on an annual basis. If I might say so, it is now 31 March 1980. The last return was provided on 3 March 1979, and there is still no additional information concerning the number of old age and invalid pensioners resident in the electorates throughout New South Wales, or indeed throughout Australia. </para>
          <para>It is just not good enough for the senior officers of any department to reply to a question of that nature in which a member is seeking legitimate information, is entitled to the information that obviously is or should be available to this Department on a computer basis, and according to the department's own answer is provided on an annual basis. The last time the answer was given was on 3 March 1 979. 1 am seeking information which applies at the end of February 1980, and the Department still does not provide the information. I would suggest that not only the Ministers to whom I have referred here- the Attorney-General, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)-</inline> should have a look at the Notice Paper and the failure of their departments to provide answers to the questions on that Notice Paper, but also the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle)</inline> should have another look at the answer provided by her Department to question No. 2465 of 5 March 1980 to see whether the Department can come up with another outlook. </para>
          <para>I also refer to an answer which was given to me recently as a result of a question that I placed on the Notice Paper on 21 February of this year concerning the total production of avgas in Australia and the percentage of Australian avgas requirements that had been imported in each year <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> 1 975 to 1 979. 1 must say that this question was placed on the Notice Paper following representations that I had made to the former Minister for National Development, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman,</inline> as a result of it having been brought to my attention that there was an acute shortage of avgas in the western districts of New South Wales, particularly in the Hay district in which, because of the size of the holdings that exist in that part of the State, as the Minister at the table would know, there are great problems involved in the mustering of cattle and sheep, and it is necessary for this to be done quite often these days by light aircraft. It was drawn to my attention that there was an acute shortage of aviation fuel in the Hay electorate and I made representations to the former Minister for National Development in September of 1 979. </para>
          <para>Apart from the initial acknowledgment to my representations, I did not hear anything from the Department or from the former Minister until the new Minister for National Development and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> assumed responsibility for that portfolio. I received a reply from him dated Christmas Eve, 24 December. I note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> in his reply to me has penned in his own handwriting to the typed reply: 'I regret the delay in replying'. In a three-foolscap-page letter that had been written to me, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> set out the problems as they relate to the supply and the shortage of avgas in Australia. He pointed out that Australia needs to import about 50 per cent of its aviation gasolene requirements, the balance being manufactured at the Altona refinery of the Mobil oil company. I will not go into the details, but in his reply the Minister said:   oil marketing companies, in consultation with the Government, introduced an allocation system for the users of aviation gasolene. This allocation is based on priority use and is related to last year's offtake. </para>
          <para class="block">I repeat that sentence: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This allocation is based on priority use and is related to last year's offtake. </para>

          <para class="block">The letter continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">In effect emergency services- Flying Doctor, Air Ambulance, Search and Rescue and the like- receive their total requirements while other users receive available supplies according to the following list of priorities. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I emphasise the words 'according to the following list of priorities'. The priorities are then set out as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Scheduled air services, commuter airlines </para>
            <para>Agriculture </para>

            <para>Private use. </para>

          <para class="block">In the same letter the Department, through the Minister, said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The actual allocations applied in each location are determined by the current stock position and the anticipated date of replenishment. They can vary from as much as 100 per cent of last year's offtake in some locations to as low as 45 per cent in others, and may vary widely in the same location at different times. ' </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Later, on the same subject of establishing priorities for the allocation of the supply of avgas, the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>An additional initiative taken by the Government is the establishment of the National Petroleum Advisory Committee. The purpose of this Committee, which includes representatives of a wide range of petroleum product consumers, is to advise the Commonwealth and State governments, through me, on the appropriate arrangements and priorities for the allocation of liquid fuels during any period of supply shortages. In this connection the Committee, as a priority task, examined the present allocation system for aviation gasoline, and recently recommended that it be maintained till the supply situation eases. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Again, for the sake of emphasis, I read that last sentence again: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">In this connection the Committee- </para>

          <para class="block">That is the National Petroleum Advisory Committee-  as a priority task, examined the present allocation system for aviation gasoline, and recently recommended that it be maintained till the supply situation cases. </para>
          <para class="block">Because of those sentences appearing in the letter that I received from the Minister for National Development and Energy, I placed a question on the Notice Paper on 21 February asking, amongst other things: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>What percentage of Australia's Avgas has been supplied to: (a) New South Wales as a whole; and (b) provincial areas and city areas of New South Wales. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">This is the pertinent one: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>What percentage of New South Wales Avgas supply has been allocated to: (a) scheduled air services; (b) commuter airlines; (c) agricultural use; and (d) charter operators, in each year from 1975 to 1979. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Honourable senators will recall that the Minister said that these things are taken into account, bearing in mind the amount of usage in the last financial year and bearing in mind the priority of the allocations as required. One can imagine my surprise when the Department or the Minister came up with the answer that statistics were not available for (3) (b) and (4). If there are no statistics available to the Department of National Development and Energy as to the supply last year or the year before, and the priority requirements of each of these services, how can there be a genuine, fair, and indeed any just allocation of avgas when it is in very short supply? </para>
          <para>I suggest to the Minister for National Development and Energy that whilst he is new as the Minister of his Department he should have a good look at the way in which his Department is handling the affairs of this very important national problem. I am far from satisfied not only with the answers that the Minister has given without notice but also with the answers that his Department has supplied as a result of questions placed on notice. When I asked what percentage of Australian avgas requirements had been imported in each year from 1975 to 1979, the answer that was supplied by the Department, and it was supplied early this month, was: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Net imports of Avgas as a percentage of Australian requirements were: 1975- 43.5 per cent: 1976-58.8 percent; 1977-70.3 per cent: 1978-40.6 per cent: 1979 data is not yet available. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">When I saw that the net imports of avgas, as a percentage of Australian requirements, had risen from 58 per cent in 1976 to 70 per cent in 1977 and had fallen to 40 per cent in 1978,I decided to do some research as to why it was running so high in 1 977.I got in touch with the Parliamentary Library. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard one sheet of information supplied from revised statistics of the Australian Bureau of Statistics and a telephone conversation between the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Department of National Development and Energy. </para>

          <para>I tell the Department of National Development and Energy now that when its supplementary estimates are before the Parliament, I will be seeking clear and cogent reasons as to why, on the one hand, it can come up with a percentage of figures, and why, on the other hand, the Parliamentary Library, after discussion with the Bureau of Statistics and the Department can, tell me that the import figures for avgas in 1977 and earlier are unavailable.

              <para>- I note that my good friend from the Northern Territory, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson,</inline> is in the chamber. I have read the remarks that he made last Thursday in relation to those aspects of immigration policy that affect the people of the Northern Territory. Frankly, I believe that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is either misinterpreting Government policy or acting in most unjust and inhumane ways in the administration of that policy. I strongly suggest to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Macphee),</inline> who has recently been appointed to that portfolio, that he have a very close look at the way in which his Department, and particularly his Sydney office, is administering this section of Government policy. The way in which it is being administered means that it is practically impossible in every circumstance for a reunion to take place unless all but one of the members of a family are in Australia before the family reunion policy comes into effect. If that one person has something wrong with his case, even if it is of the minutest nature, he or she has very little hope of joining the remainder of the family in Australia. If two members of the family are involved and if, by way of illustration, one is in Hong Kong and the other is in Ottawa, certainly there is no hope at all of that person from Hong Kong being admitted on the basis of a family reunion. This would not be allowed because he or she has a brother or a sister in some far-flung region of the world. </para>

          <para>I could tell honourable senators case after case where this sort of situation has arisen. A man might have his mother, his father, his brothers and his sisters in this country, with another member of the family married and settled down in the United States of America or Canada. I think it is terribly wrong and unjust that, if the man in Singapore, Hong Kong, Berlin or wherever it might be, wants to come to Australia to join the great bulk of his family in this country, he has my hope and Buckley's of doing so if one member of the family resides anywhere else in the world. I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to have another look at the way in which his Department is administering that policy. I believe that in many circumstances it is being terribly unjust not only to the person who is lonely in his own country but also to the family in Australia. </para>
          <para>The final matter I raise is the problem of drought relief. I spent the last weekend in Nyngan in the west of New South Wales and in Armidale. There can be no doubt that New South Wales, the State that I and a number of other senators have the honour to represent in the Senate, is going through an horrific time because of drought. Previously, when a State government made available $5m for drought relief, any sum required over and above that $5m was picked up by the Commonwealth. In other words, if a State government wanted to make available $10m for drought relief the State would pick up the first $5m and the Commonwealth would pick up the rest. In the case of $15m being made available, which I have cited as an example, the State would pick up $5m and the Commonwealth would pick up $ 1 Om. It concerns me to know that since 1979 the Commonwealth has provided that the State shall meet the first $10m in the provision of drought relief and that the Commonwealth will meet only 75 per cent of any further amount spent by the State. </para>
          <para>This is throwing a great burden on the people of New South Wales, particularly at a time when practically the whole of the State is stricken with drought. Farmers are being placed in a terrible situation. Workers, particularly those in country towns, are finding it extremely difficult to get work. The employment situation is being aggravated by the drought. Whilst New South Wales is contributing substantially to the amelioration of the drought situation I believe that the Commonwealth is not facing up to its proper responsibilities in this matter. I draw that situation to the attention of the Senate in the hope that it will be sheeted home to the Government and that the Executive, in its early deliberations in Cabinet, will have another look at its drought relief policy in relation to the State I represent in this Parliament, New South Wales. I sincerely hope that the Commonwealth will contribute much more to the amelioration of the situation and join in the efforts that are being made towards overcoming the serious problem of drought relief. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline></para>

            <para>- Many times in the last year honourable senators have warned the Government about the serious run-down in research funding in this country, especially in our centres of learning, the universities. I have done so myself several times. I recall that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Puplick</inline> has also followed this matter closely. I do so again because we are now reaching the stage where, presumably, the Government is considering what it will do in the allocation of funds in the next Budget. I feel that the Government really should take a hard and broadminded view of this matter. So many people have said that we are prejudicing and jeopardising our position as a nation in relation to other countries with which we would normally regard ourselves as being equal. I think this matter has reached almost the proportions of a major scandal. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Shortly I will quote extensively from the organisation most concerned; that is, FAUSA- the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations. I believe that they have looked into this matter with the greatest of care. They have put a lot of attention and time into researching this matter for reasons other than their own self-interest. There may be an element of self-interest in this situation but I think their real motivation is one of serious concern for the problems of this country if we allow this situation to continue, with the real value of research funding continuing to decline year after year as it has done in recent years. </para>
          <para>I have looked carefully at the document entitled 'The Research Crisis' which was recently issued by FAUSA. It is obvious that the picture is one of problems everywhere. There is a sort of general run-down. The point is that the further this run-down is allowed to go, the more difficult it will be to recoup the situation. As in any kind of competition with other countries, or as in any kind of progressive move, the further one drops behind the greater the effort required to catch up. It is not simply a matter of adding the effort that was not put in beforehand; something like a square of that effort is required for the lost ground to be overtaken if, indeed, in research in this modern world that kind of ground can be regained completely. FAUSA states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Progress has been impeded because of the inability to purchase or maintain equipment, the inability to obtain research assistants, a lack of post-graduate and post-doctoral workers . . . <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> This is particularly significant in what one might call the progressive sciences, where new research or innovative work is required. A number of academics to whom I have spoken have said it is not possible for them, at the present level of assistance, to get the people with the real brains and intelligence that they want. It is possible to get somebody and, without reflecting generally on the ability of people on research grants, it is an axiom in any field in this world that a certain amount has to be paid to get the best. I think this Government is beginning to forget that in this case. Australia 's best are going overseas, and we are losing them at a rapid rate. Experience has shown that frequently we do not get back those who are lost overseas. FAUSA continues:   the lack of access to overseas conferences and contact with workers in similar fields overseas through conference leave and study leave. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I would have thought that this was so obvious a necessity that to expect any inventive or creative mind to work without being exposed to the stimulus of its brother or sister workers overseas is quite ridiculous. This situation of Australian research funding was adequately summed up by the Australian Science and Technology Council in its science and technology report of 1977-78. 1 think it is worth quoting again, because ASTEC advises the Prime Minister in the field of science. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There are many areas where Australia has established an enviable reputation in fundamental research. Nevertheless the Council believes that the skills and experience of the most able of the staff members in the tertiary education sector are under-utilised. First, the financial assistance available for research projects of real merit and promise is inadequate so that the contribution which first class researchers can make is less than likely. Secondly, there is insufficient interaction between the education sector, government laboratories and industry. Thirdly, there is at present no adequate comprehensive mechanism for the development, adoption and manufacture of discoveries and innovations resulting from research in universities and colleges and in some government laboratories. </para>

          <para class="block">On this theme, in paragraph R5.35 the Williams report states: </para>
          <quote>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">This document is full of authenticated reports from university staff and highly respected academics throughout Australia of just that happening. I remember that last year I rose in this place and asked a question of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> who was then Minister for Education. I asked whether he was not aware that some sort of brain drain was going on in Australia. He said that, no, he had no evidence of any brain drain. I pointed out to him at that stage that FAUSA was saying there was such a drain. I hope that now the Government will realise that that kind of brain drain is definitely going on, and that its performance compared with that of other countries is less than adequate. There is an interesting comparison of the initiative of overseas countries in regard to research with that of Australia. It shows Australia in a very bad light indeed. Recently I read a number of admirable and very forward looking documents of the United States National Science Foundation. It reported recently to the  President  as follows: </para>

            <para>In Canada, there is a five-year plan fora dramatic increase in research development. The budget for the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council is to be increased by 32 per cent. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Australia's equivalent body- the Australian Research Grants Committee- had its funds cut by 3.6 per cent in real terms in the last Budget. I understand also that the Canadians are planning a much expanded program of scholarships, fellowships and research associateships. There is available an interesting comparison of the percentage of gross domestic product expended on research and development, the natural sciences and engineering. This is compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, using 1975 data, although the Australian figures are based on 1976-77 figures. Those figures show Australia to be fourteenth in line. The table shows a most remarkable situation. It is not surprising that the United States is highest, with 2.4 per cent of GDP; then follows Switzerland, 2.2 per cent; the Federal Republic of Germany, 2.1 per cent; the United Kingdom, 2.1 per cent; the Netherlands, 1.9 per cent; France, 1.8 per cent; Sweden 1.8 per cent; and Japan, 1.7 per cent. These are the advanced countries with which Australians would like to feel some association. We might wish to be like those countries, but that is not the case. We are down with Finland and Italy at 0.9 per cent. There are only four OECD countries that have a lesser percentage of gross domestic product than Australia. They are an interesting lot. One is New Zealand, which has much greater financial problems than this country. The others are Ireland, Spain and Portugal. Are we placing ourselves in the most suitable position in the world in regard to research? Do we see ourselves as a sort of banana republic, a worn out and broken down society than can say that it is justifiable- the amount of funds spent on research is a matter of choice for this Government- to associate this country, in terms of effort and innovation, with New Zealand, Ireland, Spain and Portugal? Government members and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> say that we have a great future ahead of us, and that there is this tremendous decade of the 1980s. All I can say is that if we have a tremendous decade in the 1 980s it will not be because of anything that this Government has done. I do not see how anything could be retrieved in that way unless a different situation does occur. </para>

That brings up another matter. I suggest to the honourable senator- I am sure that this point is so obvious that it will already have occurred to him but I will make it- that the real crux of the matter is in the figures I have given. It is in the diminution that has been forced on this country in the research area. It is such a basic matter that the Government ought now, with the Budget coming up, have a good look at it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has reminded me of the work of the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment.

          <para>I now refer to some of the views of academics.

I would be here all night if I mentioned the views of all the academics who wrote for FAUSA. I read them myself. They are a most interesting collection. It is striking how many important areas of research are being knocked about because of the lack of funds. I hope that honourable senators will try to get a copy of the document entitled 'The Research Crisis' and read it through. It is well worth reading. I know that we have many papers to read but this is an important one. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think that we could take that as a reasonable view. I will not go into this document in detail but I will summarise it. On page 29 other scientists have described how they could not get on with their work unless they got on their knees and begged to overseas foundations to let them have the money to continue. Here again, I suggest that there is a problem for this country. </para>
          <para>I would not be so naive as to think that any money comes across without some sorts of strings being attached to it. Naturally, if a scientist gets money from an overseas foundation he will try his best to work in with its program and help it where he can. There is nothing disloyal or wrong about that, lt is simply the natural and normal reaction that a normal person would have, especially as he would probably realise that he would not get any money from this Government. He would try to get it and continue to get it from other countries. </para>
          <para>I am tempted to talk about more specific cases but I will not do so. I will refer to the generality. The effect of inadequate research funding on the standards of universities themselves as teaching organisations has been mentioned. The document states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>During the early 1950 's the quality of scholarship in Australian universities was such that those of us wishing to gain a Ph.D. had no choice but to travel overseas. The academic status of our first degrees was such that it was generally necessary to have a Masters degree before being accepted for entry into an overseas Ph.D. program. If the present level of funding continues we will rapidly revert to the status of the early 1950's. </para>

            <para>The most distinctive features of the universities are research and training and research. In recent years there has been a reduction in real resources for research.

He said: </para>

          <para class="block">I hope that those words are getting through to honourable senators. They are not without their importance. I emphasise the words 'major problem areas of energy and the restructuring of society around new work ethics and expectations '. Have those words become cliches already? As with road accidents and a few other things will honourable senators and the Government allow them to drift quietly out of their consciousness and not worry about them any more?

            <para>In a time of decreasing funds for all of tertiary institutions it is probably inevitable, however regrettable, that some of the premium placed upon small-mindedness by the community at large should spill over into these institutions themselves.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think that Professor Osmond made a very important point. When we start to cut down funding in this area, with the world being what it is, we cut down on the more inventive, innovative and valuable programs. In other words, the instinct of the academic and his department is to duck for cover and to let established programs go on. They say: 'We have established programs. They may achieve results in a certain amount of time. At least we have them. Let us get on with those. ' What happens is that the young guy, the chap coming up who may be of some great service to this country and who in other countries is respected as of importance and value, does not do the work. He is frustrated for a while and in the natural course of events he gets a job overseas.  His  new colleagues are glad to have him there. That is what I mean by the brain drain. I think the Government should do some studies and look at the figures if it does not believe that it is happening. </para>
          <para>One other point I thought worth mentioning is intractable pain, something which has been mentioned a number of times in this country recently. Recently a conference on it was held in Canberra. That conference showed how little work is being done on this terrible problem. Intractable pain refers to the pain suffered by people dying of incurable cancers, who at present in this country do not have enough done for them in that area. <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Diana</inline> Elton of the Department of </para>

That seems to be an intelligent approach to adopt because, after all, the pain centres are in the brain. A few years ago we all believed that acupuncture did not work; now we all know that it does work. <inline font-weight="bold">Ms Elton's</inline> research would seem to be a reasonable type of research which perhaps should be encouraged.

          <para class="block">The study leave which I mentioned earlier is necessary for the creative and inventive mind. FAUSA mentions also libraries and journals, which of course are basic to any program of research to enable those carrying out the research to have a basic knowledge of what has been going on elsewhere. In that regard, a committee of which I am a member has heard from witness after witness- this evidence has been taken in public hearings so there is no harm in my referring to it here-of the lack of co-ordination, the lack of any central computerised clearing point for research in this country. It is done just at an old boy level, with the left hand often not knowing what the right hand is doing. The next point mentioned by FAUSA is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>An increase in external research funding, particularly ARGC and NH&amp;MRC funding which need an immediate increase by at least 50 per cent. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It sees the situation as having broken down to such an extent that a 50 per cent increase is needed now to restore the situation. Another one, which is close to my heart and that of the Australian Democrats is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Restoration of the value of post-graduate awards to a level where they are not an absolute disincentive to students to pursue post-graduate study; and an increase in the number of these awards. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>It is no good increasing the number of awards unless we raise the amount. As I have said here before- I will go on saying it until something happens- it is stupid for us to go on paying the amounts we are to say, a married research student with two children, when by the time he has paid for his travel, his clothing and a few other items and now, of course, has paid tax, he is worse off than a married man with two children who is on the dole. Apparently it is the Government's view of the society that such a man, who is doing valuable research- the first leg of research- a person whom a senior researcher would turn to for assistance and want an intelligent reaction from, is worth no more and probably less than a similar person who is on the dole. That seems to me to be a quite disgraceful situation. The next point made by FAUSA is a good one. It reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Creation of a national system of post-doctoral fellows to inhibit the ' brain drain '. </para>
            <para>Creation of 'centres of excellence ' in research as proposed by the Universities Commission in 1975, but not to the detriment of funding of individual research projects. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think that is a very important point too. Research is not something about which we say: 'We will give this X thousand dollars or X billion dollars and it is okay to take away from one area and give it to another'. If we want results we have to have a steady increase across the whole field. Libraries, research centres and universities are all dependent upon each other. It is to be hoped that we want the country to undertake a total research program. Finally, FAUSA makes the following point: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The fostering of greater understanding between universities and industry. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think the Government has fallen down very badly in that respect. There is a tremendous problem of communication, especially in the field of science. There is a mistrust of science in the community, which largely has been brought about by a few areas of science, especially nuclear technology, which has frightened people, and for good reason. But I think many valuable areas of science are underestimated. Perhaps that is part of the problem. Is it that the Government is giving in to what it sees as the view of the electorate? Is it that the Government feels: People will be nasty to us, they won't vote for us next time, unless we show these academics, these jumped-up people, these silvertails, that they have to be kept in their place'? I would have hoped that the motivation of the Government was at a somewhat higher level than that, but I am beginning to have my doubts. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of the Bill now before the Senate is to introduce, from the date of Royal Assent, an export duty on uranium concentrate produced from uranium ore obtained from the Alligator Rivers Region in the Northern Territory. The rate of export duty to be imposed is to be 1 lc per kilogram of anhydrous triuranium octoxide (U3 Os) contained in the uranium concentrate. This duty is to be imposed in recognition of the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities related to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. </para>
          <para>The Government has already taken special steps to ensure that uranium mining in this region is carried out in such a way as to minimise the impact on the environment, and in particular that the standards and technology being applied in this region are adequate, and consistent with overseas developments. This is achieved through the provisions of the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act 1978 which created a supervising scientist, a co-ordinating committee and an Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute. Special arrangements have also been made with the Northern Territory Government to ensure that the interests of the Commonwealth in the areas affected by uranium mining are appropriately served. The operations of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service in the Kakadu National Park also contribute significantly to the protection of the environment in that area. </para>
          <para>The Government therefore considers that the mining companies involved in uranium mining should contribute to the cost of machinery the Government has established to protect the environment. The objective of the proposed export duty is to obtain that contribution. On current estimates of exports of uranium concentrate it is expected that revenue from this duty will be about $945,000 in the next three years, and as production and export reaches planned levels the revenues will increase accordingly. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney)</inline> has just stated, the purpose of the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Bill 1980 and the Customs Amendment Bill 1 980 is to impose a levy of 1 lc a kilogram on the export of uranium to fund environmental protection activities in the Northern Territory. The Opposition will be opposing the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Bill in the Senate as it did in the House of Representatives. The Opposition will continue to oppose all aspects of uranium mining until such time as it is convinced that adequate safeguards on the proliferation of nuclear material exist and that a safe technology for the disposal of reactor waste has been developed. It is quite clear to any reasonable person- which, by definition, excludes <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Titterton, Charles Court and Lang Hancock among others- that such a safe disposal technology does not exist. Let me quote the Government 's own Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council. It pointed out in November last that: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The storage or disposal of solidified high level waste in repositories in deep geological formations on land is unlikely to be undertaken even on a pilot scale, for at least 10 years. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In addition to the problem of the disposal of waste from the nuclear reactors, there is, of course, the ever present problem of weapons proliferation which ought to have become more evident in the last few months with the instability which has occurred with the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, with the general instability of the region and with the desire of the United States in particular to arm Pakistan in the belief, correct or otherwise, that such a strengthening of Pakistani military capacity is necessary to provide a counterveiling power to a Russian dominated Afghanistan. There is a very real danger that countries such as Pakistan will develop a nuclear capacity and then, with the pan-Islamic movement which seems to be developing over much of the Islamic world, be tempted ultimately to supply nuclear material to people such as  Colonel Gaddafi  who, to say the very least, would have to be regarded as an eccentric ruler if not a psychopathic ruler. </para>
          <para>The Government for a couple of years has consistently made grossly exaggerated claims about the economic potential for uranium mining in Australia. The plain fact of the matter is that the sales potential in the world is rapidly declining as more and more countries either substantially postpone their previously planned nuclear programs or wind them back. For example, the International Energy Agency has cut its estimates of expected nuclear reactor capacity. In 1975 it estimated that by 1985, 610 gigawatts of electricity would be produced in nuclear reactors. By 1 978 the Agency had reduced the estimated production in 1985 to 220 gigawatts. That represents in that short period a reduction in the estimated electricity output of something over 60 per cent. Of course demand for uranium is tied to the electricity output of reactors practically on a one to one ratio. </para>
          <para>So, this clearly declining world demand for uranium, at least in the medium term, will inevitably mean that the Government will be induced to encourage desperate efforts by Australian producers to sell an expanding volume of production on a shrinking market. That probability will be exacerbated by the Government's failure or refusal to accept the recommendation of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox, which stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That construction of mines in the region (the Alligator Rivers Region) be commenced sequentially at appropriate  invervals. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The recommendation for sequential development- that is, ensuring that mine development does not run ahead of market capacitymade by the Fox Commission has been rejected by the Government. On purely economic grounds this is a crass decision to take. Three projects- Nabarlek, Ranger and Yeelirrie- have already been approved by the present Government. </para>
          <para>There has been a great deal of very loose talk both in Adelaide and in Canberra about the prospects for unanium mining at Roxby Downs. Other minerals may be mined at Roxby Downs but it is clearly nonsensical to suggest that there is potential for the economic development of this mine primarily as a uranium mine. If the other three projects for which planning is already in a more advanced stage proceed, there is no possibility that further output of uranium from Roxby Downs can be sold without seriously depressing the prices which can be obtained. To assert, as the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner,</inline> did a while ago, that there would be employment multiplier of 1 5 to one consequential on the development of Roxby Downs is nonsense. It is consistent with the degree of veracity which we have come to expect from that Minister. </para>
          <para>I would like to make a few more general observations about the nuclear question and perhaps to give some personal opinions. I am probably by inclination a pessimist. My experiences in life, particularly my political experiences, have led me towards that way of thinking. Perhaps that has something to do with my belief- one could say it is a 5 1 /49 belief- that ultimately the world will be forced into nuclear energy because no acceptable alternative will be developed. However, that is not a decision which the world is obliged to take at this time. There is certainly no urgency to rush into nuclear power. Those who are urging Australia and other countries to do this have grossly misrepresented the realities of the energy supply-demand situation. </para>

            <para>-! wish to bring to the Senate's attention a petition that was presented to me last Saturday and which I was not able to present at the normal time of presenting petitions because it was not correctly worded. Therefore at this point I draw it to the Senate's attention. It was presented to me by the Charlie Tango Club, a citizens band radio organisation in the Capital Territory. The petition is signed by about 100 members and supporters. It makes two points. Firstly, the Charlie Tango Club, in common with other CB radio organisations around Australia, wishes to see the use of the 27 megahertz citizens band radio service extended beyond 1 July 1982. Secondly, the club would like to see more channels within the 27 megahertz band available to CB radio operators. The Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> on 27 March announced that there will be an inquiry into citizens band radio which will examine these issues, or at least some of them. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that statement and the terms of reference for the inquiry. </para>

            <para>The Government is to review the policy on the most appropriate radio frequency arrangements and regulations for the Citizens Band Radio Service (CBRS). </para>
            <para>Announcing this today, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tony</inline> Staley, said that submissions would be sought from all sectors of the community. </para>
            <para>The Minister said that when the CBRS was introduced on 2 June 1977 the Government indicated that the service would use both VHF and UHF frequencies. It occupied 18 channels at 27 MHz in the VHF band and 40 channels at 477 MHz in the UHF band. Use of the 27 MHz service was to end in June 1982. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline>said that he had long been concerned that the decision to move the service out of the 27 MHz area in 1982 would be potentially unworkable. </para>
            <para>I have frequently reiterated this view in meetings with user groups, CB organisations and relevant sectors of industry,' he said. 'I have always intended to review the matter at the end of the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC), which was held in November last year. Today's announcement gives effect to this long-standing undertaking'. </para>
            <para>The Minister noted that the introduction of CB radio had led to some interference to television and other electronic equipment. 'I believe that the position has now stabilised', he said. 'The level of complaints in recent times has fallen quite considerably'. </para>
            <para>A tribute should be paid to CB radio organisations and clubs and indeed, the great majority of CB users, for their efforts to regulate the service so that the usefulness of the service, particularly in safety and emergency situations, would not bc placed in jeopardy. ' </para>
            <para>The Government had learnt from the introduction of the CB service, and the Postal and Telecommunications Department had arranged for further staff increases to ensure proper management of the radio frequency spectrum. </para>
            <para>In keeping with these developments the Government is now seeking to fully canvass all viewpoints before any final decisions on the frequency arrangements for CB are taken.' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline> said. </para>

            <para>Details of where to send submissions and of closing dates would be widely advertised within the media, and major user organisations and business interests would be notified in writing, the Minister concluded. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Productivity has provided the following reply to the honourable senator's question: (I), (2), (3) and (4) In the Media Release of 22 January 1980, I announced that the Commonwealth would initiate a project to develop an integrated plant nursery system covering plant cultivation, packaging, transport and export distribution. the purpose of the project was to assist the Australian horticultural industry to participate in the large international markets for indoor plants. 1 stated that the original concept for the project was proposed by General Nurseries Pty Ltd and that following a detailed evaluation of the situation and further development of the original concept I had authorised the Department of Productivity to fund and co-ordinate a project under the ' public interest ' provisions of the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976. The Department, assisted by private industry, would co-ordinate a joint government-industry co-operative effort to develop the equipment and handling systems to allow the Australian horticultural industry to become a major exporter. No assistance for General Nurseries Pty Ltd was outlined in my statement and no contractural relationship exists between the Department and General Nurseries Pty Ltd. Therefore the Department has had no reason to seek detailed information on the company's shareholding or financial performance and I am unable to provide the details requested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston.</inline></para>
