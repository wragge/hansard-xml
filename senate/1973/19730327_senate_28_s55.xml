              <para>- I have never accepted the proposition that we must get used to political terrorism, involving bombings, murder, intimidation and that democratic governments are powerless to suppress such activities. That such actions have occurred in Australia with increasing frequency in recent years is beyond dispute. There was a curious defeatism and lack of initiative in successive Liberal governments&#39; reaction to these outrages. Honourable senators will recall that, throughout the last session of the last Parliament, the former Attorney-General was asked a great number of questions by Labor senators about the activities of Croatian extremists in Australia. A constant theme in his answers was that, although there were undoubtedly individual Croatian extremists in Australia who were prepared to resort to the most violent methods in alleged furtherance of their cause, there was no credible evidence that any Croatian revolutionary terrorist organisation existed in Australia. For example in the Senate on 24th August 1972, he said:  the searches and investigations carried out by the Commonwealth Police hitherto have not been able to discover any evidence of an organisation. </para>

          <para class="block">He again repeated this assertion on 19th September 1972 in answer to a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland (Hansard, page 894). lt is important to remember that the time when these questions were being asked and answered was a time of great public concern about terrorism. </para>
          <para>The reasons for this were twofold. Firstly, in June 1972, a group of 19 Croatian terrorists crossed into Yugoslavia from Austria and engaged in terrorist activities in Bosnia. Six were Australian citizens and 3 others had previously lived in Australia. As a result the Yugoslav Government presented a strongly worded aide-memoire to the Australian Government alleging, inter alia, that the headquarters of the HRB (Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood) were located in Australia, that the Australian Government had provided shelter for the ringleaders (who were named) and that the HRB, which had been thought by the Australian authorities to have been defunct for some years, had been reorganised early in 1972 as the HIRO (Croatian Illegal Revolutionary Organisation). </para>
          <para>Following receipt of this aide-memoire, the Commonwealth and State police conducted a series of raids in Melbourne and Sydney during the month of August and a great deal of material was seized. It is to be assumed that the first law officer of Australia, the AttorneyGeneral, would be kept informed by the police of the  Tes  u Its of their investigations, especially as he continued to be closely questioned in the Senate about Croatian extremist activities. And, indeed, he admitted on 19th September 1972 (Hansard, page 902) that he had seen a lot of material in the possession of the Commonwealth Police. </para>

              <para>- The second factor which highlighted the question of Croat terrorism in Australia and which attracted special attention from the Commonwealth and State police was the occurrence of 2 bombing incidents in Sydney on 16th September 1972 involving premises and persons connected with the Yugoslav community. These incidents left unaltered the then AttorneyGeneral&#39;s statement that there was no organised terrorism among the Croatian community in Australia. One must assume also that the Attorney-General would have known that a cache of explosives and documents had been discovered in the Warburton Ranges outside Melbourne about the middle of 1972 and that amongst these documents were several stating the aims and objects of an Ustasha-type organisation known as HIRO (Croatian Illegal Revolutionary Organisation). This is the very organisation to which the Yugoslav Government&#39;s aide-memoire made reference. However, when the Senate rose on 27th October 1972, neither the Attorney-General nor any Other member of the Liberal Government had produced any evidence of the existence in Australia of organised Croatian terrorism and it held firmly to the position that no such evidence existed. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>On taking over the office of AttorneyGeneral, I considered it my duty to find out for myself whether this was true and to inform the Senate and the people of Australia of the facts. The impending visit to this country of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia gave special urgency to this investigation since, if the true picture was different from that painted by the previous Government, the present Government was entitled to entertain grave fears for the safety of our distinguished guest and would be in duty bound to take adequate precautions for his safety. I am now in a position to state categorically that the Liberal Attorney-General&#39;s oft-repeated assertion that there is no credible evidence of the existence in Australia of organised Croatian extremism cannot be sustained. The contrary is true and was true at the time he made such statements. </para>
          <para class="block">The evidence - overwhelming evidence - is to be found in documents which I am about to table. </para>
          <para>These documents come from the files of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, the Commonwealth Police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I point out that although some of the documents tabled contain a classification stamp such as &#39;secret&#39; or &#39;confidential&#39; they are no longer so. They have all been declassified and no breach of security is involved in tabling them. In contrast to the last Government&#39;s policy of trying to sweep this problem under the rug, we propose to bring it into the full light of day. I now table the documents. These documents establish beyond doubt that Croatian terrorist organisations have existed and do exist in Australia today. There is incontestable evidence that 3 extreme Croatian terrorist organisations exist in Australia today. They are the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood (HRB); the United Croats of West Germany (UHNj); and the Croatian Illegal Revolutionary Organisation (HI RO). There are 2 youth organisations that have very revolutionary aims and have been used as recruiting grounds for the 3 extreme terrorist organisations. These youth organisations are the Croatian Youth (HM) and the World League of Croatian Youths (SHUMS) There are 2 umbrella type general organisations which by their publications, training camps, discussion groups, funds and close links with their national organisations provide the climate for the forming of the inspiration to the youth groups and the extreme terrorist organisations. These umbrella organisations are the Croation Liberation Movement (HOP) with its official Ustasha movement within it (UHRO) and the Croatian National Resistance (HNO) and its Croatian Armed Forces (HOS). Also tabled is a summary of the documents which 1 seek leave to have incorporated. </para>

            <para>- The summary contains, inter alia, the report of the Crime Intelligence Bureau of the Commonwealth Police force dated 6th March 1968; papers about the notorious Andric brothers; papers about Jure Marie including the structure of the Croatian troika terrorist cell, a selfcontained group of 3 terrorists consisting of an intelligence officer, a scout and an explosives expert; documents concerning all of the Croatian organisations I have mentioned; and documents indicating links with overseas terrorist organisations as well as other related documents. lt is impossible to draw any other conclusion from the evidence than that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> on the most charitable view of his conduct, displayed an irresponsible indifference to information which was available to him and which proved up to the hilt the seriousness of the problem to which Labor senators repeatedly attempted to alert him. Let me give a striking example. The Yugoslav aide-memoire was received by the Australian Government on 16th August 1972. Among those named in the aide-memoire as being one of the ringleaders of Croatian terrorism  i3  one Jure Marie. He was already well known to the Commonwealth Police. He first came under notice in 1963 after a group of 6 Croatian terrorists, allegedly from Australia, entered Yugoslavia illegally for the stated purpose of waging a guerrilla campaign against the regime. Marie was linked with the organisation of this incursion. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Investigations conducted over a period of 4 years established the existence in Australia of a terrorist organisation known as the HRB (Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood). Marie was one of its leaders. After a number of police raids in 1967, including on Marie&#39;s premises, the HRB appeared to become moribund in a formal organisational sense, although as we now know it continued to operate through troikas or cells. However, Marie continued to be the subject of scrutiny by the Commonwealth Police and a possible prosecution of him under the Commonwealth Crimes Act was considered in October 1970. He was also the subject  of  memoranda from the Commonwealth Police to the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department on 9th August 1971 and 12th September 1972. In view of the questioning in the Senate to which he was being submitted at the time one assumes that the  former  Attorney-General would have seen these memoranda. </para>
          <para>Marie was one of those whose premises were searched by the Commonwealth Police under warrant on 22nd August 1972, following receipt by the Australian Government of the aide-memoire from the Yugoslav Government in which he was named. Among the documents seized were a detailed map of the area where the Bosnian guerrillas had illegally entered the country, a letter discussing an initial ruling body of an independent Croatia including, significantly, the name Rover of whom more later, and a receipt from Wollongong Post Office for the transmission of a registered postal article to one Vegar at Offenburg, Austria; (Vegar was one of the guerrillas killed in the Bosnian operation); a bank slip issued by the ANZ Bank. Wollongong, acknowledging transmission of money to Vegar; a letter detailing future plans for the recruitment of volunteers to Australia for further incursions into Yugoslavia. One of the letters signed refers to the fact that the &#39;financial resources of the organisation which we took with us from Victoria as well as those received later, have now been used up&#39;. Does this sound like an individual operating independently of an organisation? The Commonwealth Police certainly did <inline font-style="italic">noi</inline> think so. Their conclusion is as follows: </para>
          <para>The evidence contained in this document when taken into consideration with that enumerated in the aforementioned memorandum of 7 November 1972, would seem to irrefutably implicate Jure Marie with a Croatian Nationalist Organisation which apparently exists in both Australia and Europe and which has been engaged in an attempt to overthrow the recognised Government of Yugoslavia. It is also considered that, regardless of what this organisation is called, it is in fact a resurgence of the former Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood (HRB) and appears to involve a number of persons who were previously identified as members of the HRB. As you will recall in our initial assessment of the allegations made in the Yugoslav aide-memoire presented on 16 August 1972, we expressed &#39;serious concern about the possible existence of a clandestine terrorist organisation in Australia&#39;. We also stated, inter alia: With regard to the allegations about the HRB, I would draw your attention to our earlier reports (reference 224/283 headed Croatian Nationalist Activities in Australia, dated 5 July 1972, and reference X.61, headed Srecko Blaz Rover, born 3 February 1920, Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, dated 20 April 1972) indicating the possible resurgence of a HRB type organisation. In the past it has generally been assumed that the HRB as such ceased to operate as an organisation in Australia circa 1967-1968. In the light of intelligence gathered by this Force over the past nine months, the allegations of its continued existence by the Yugoslav Government must be taken seriously. </para>
          <para class="block">The police report from which J have quoted is dated 23rd November 1972. However, a preliminary report on documents seized from Marie, Rover and others was made by the Acting Commissioner of Commonwealth Police to the Attorney-General&#39;s Department on 12th September 1972 and the AttorneyGeneral would undoubtedly have seen this report. Though all the seized documents had not been translated at this stage, there were references to maps, to the receipt for the transmission of money to Vegar and to handwritten items relating to the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood and the organisational infrastructure of a troika group. In short, on or soon after 12th September 1972, the then Attorney-General was in possession of evidence that the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood had been revived, was functioning actively, and was associated with the June incursion into Yugoslavia which had been the subject of complaint in the Yugoslav Government&#39;s aide-memoire of 16th August 1972. Yet on 19th September 1972 he returned to his denials of the existence of any Croatian terrorist organisation in Australia and never resiled from that standpoint throughout the life of the Parliament. </para>
          <para>A responsible Attorney-General, aware of Marie&#39;s past role as a leader of HRB, aware of the fact that Marie had been named as a terrorist in the Yugoslav document, aware of the anxieties about the resurgence of Croatian terrorism expressed almost daily by Labor senators, would surely not have reacted to the raid on Marie&#39;s premises and the seizure of documents 1 have referred to in the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> reacted. Let us examine his conduct in this matter in some detail, since it is symptomatic of the previous Government&#39;s attitude to the problem. The first point to note is that the raid on Marie, and other suspected terrorists, was not made at the Attorney-General&#39;s instigation. On 23rd August, the day after the raids, in reply to a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne,</inline> he stated in part: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The position as I have stated it for several weeks - that there is no credible evidence of any Croatian terrorist groups in Australia - still stands. The searches which were made yesterday by Commonwealth Police officers, together with State Police officers, were not directed towards obtaining any such evidence . . . I should state that the searches yesterday were made as part of a police investigation and were made without my knowledge. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think that honourable senators may remember the anger with which that was expressed. Parliament rose on 27th October without any information being given to the Senate about the contents of the seized documents. Marie had been named as a terrorist in the Yugoslav Government protest presented to the Australian Government on 16th August 1972. A bland interim reply was given to the Yugoslav Government on 20th October 1972, mentioning that the matter was being investigated but making no admissions about the presence of Croatian terrorist organisations in our midst, even though evidence of the existence of such organisations was in the possession of the Attorney-General when the interim reply was given. No further reply to these allegations was ever made by the Liberal Government to the Yugoslav Government. Yet the conclusion reached by the Commonwealth Police and conveyed to the Attorney-General&#39;s Department as early as 17th August 1972. was in these words: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the aide-memoire -  does contain a core of almost irrebuttable fact. </para>
          <para>In addition, the Director-General of ASIO on 7th September 1972 stated in reference to the aide-memoire in a letter to the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s Department: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Also in general terms, some of the information is almost certainly inaccurate; other portions contain elements of truth but appear exaggerated; and yet other statements are well-based. Overall the Aide Memoire and enclosures contain sufficient accurate material to suggest that it would be ill-advised to dismiss the allegations as either exaggeration or fabrication until such time as the results of current inquiries are known. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">ASIO never retreated from that stand and subsequently agreed with me that the aide-memoire contained a core of irrebuttable truth. And yet, on 19th September, the Attorney-General said in this place: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It comes to the question whether we should accept allegations made by the  President  and the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia as having a basis in fact notwithstanding that our investigation of those allegations in Australia has proved that the allegations are without such a basis. Simply, it comes down to this: Does this Senate accept what is alleged by the  President  and the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia in preference to what our own Commonwealth Police have found and what I have stated? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It had taken the then Attorney-General only a month to forget the Commonwealth Police&#39;s core of almost irrebuttable fact&#39;, and less than a fortnight to forget the cautionary advice of ASIO. </para>
          <para>In one of the many debates on this subject last year <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> indignantly asked me - Hansard, page 925 - whether I gave greater credence to the allegations of the Yugoslav Government than to the statements which he had made. The answer is: Yes, and so do the Commonwealth Police and ASIO. As though the evidence I have already supplied were not enough to convict the last Government, through its Attorney-General, of misleading the Parliament and the nation, of deceiving a friendly foreign power, of imperilling the lives of Australian citizens by shutting its eyes to the evidence of organised terrorism, there is yet another, perhaps more glaring example of the existence of a dangerous, violent Croatian revolutionary terrorist organisation in Australia. </para>
          <para>This organisation, separate and distinct from the HRB - the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood - is the Australian Branch of the UHN- the League of United Croats of West Germany. Its leader in Germany is one Ante Vukic whom our Commonwealth Police considered such a dangerous man that they advised the Department of Immigration against granting him a permit to visit Australia in May 1972. The organisation in Germany was associated over the last decade with attempted murders of Yugoslav officials and attacks on Yugoslav embassies and employed strong-arm squads to threaten other Croats living in Germany for the purpose of either conscripting them into the organisation or extracting financial contributions. </para>
          <para>A branch of this murderous organisation was formed in Sydney around June 1971 and its membership and activities were well known to the Commonwealth Police. Its meetings, ironically enough, are or were held in the Ulster Room of the Irish National Association Hall in Devonshire Street, Sydney. Its leader is a man with a particularly violent record named Jakov Suljak.  His  name will certainly not come as a surprise to the former AttorneyGeneral since he wrote to the senator on 25th October 1972, after being arrested on a charge of assault and mentioned in the course of his letter that he had also been accused of the &#39;city bombings&#39;, an obvious reference to the bombings in Sydney on 16th September 1972. </para>
          <para>In June 1969 Suljak was jailed in South Australia for a period of 9 months for 2 particularly brutal assaults. He had already been charged with similar offences on 5 separate occasions and is at present on bail pending trial for assault and being found in possession of an unlicensed pistol. On 11th November 1969, the Commissioner of Commonwealth Police, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> Davis, recommended that he be deported, but his recommendation was not acted upon. </para>
          <para>Among the voluminous documents on Suljak and the Australian branch of the terrorist organisation UHNj which I have tabled today is a letter dated 30th May 1972 from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Davis,</inline> Commissioner of Commonwealth Police, to the Department of Immigration. The letter, a copy of which was in the files of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, sets out the fact of the existence of this organisation, its meetings, its office-holders and its involvement in breaches of the peace in Sydney over the preceding months. </para>
          <para>A brochure produced by the Special Reports Branch of the Department of Immigration in August 1972 on Croatian extremist activities makes special reference to the UHNj, its organisation in Australia, its activities and its members. A copy of this brochure was forwarded to the Attorney-General&#39;s Department on 25th August .1972 and it was specifically directed by the Permanent Head of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> himself.  His  most vehement denials of the existence of extremist Croatian organisations followed shortly after his receipt of this document, which is among the documents tabled today. </para>
          <para>Moreover, if the former Attorney-General was unwilling to accept the evidence which abounded in government files, he had only to read the daily newspapers to discover that the New South Wales police stated in court proceedings which were fully reported, that Suljak was a member of what was described in the press as a Croatian terrorist movement, the United Croats of West Germany. </para>
          <para>When Suljak was arrested on 19th October 1972 a considerable quantity of documents was seized from his dwelling. These documents established the fact of transmission of funds from the Australian branch to the parent body in Germany. A number of photographs of armed men were also found, including one in which Suljak can be seen standing beside a Ustashi flag in the company of other armed men. There is no doubt that the members of the Sydney branch of UHNj consider themselves Ustashi. Both the letter of Commissioner Davis of 30th May 1972, and his detailed report of 26th October 1972 refer to incidents in which the organisation was involved which clearly demonstrate its Ustashi allegiance. For example, they publicly displayed an Ustashi flag at Sydney airport and also at a Croatia versus Yugal soccer match in Sydney on 15th August 1971. Several of their members have admitted to the police that they consider themselves Ustashi. </para>
          <para>In an article by Suljak in the NovemberDecember 1971 edition of the organisation&#39;s paper &#39;Croatian Call&#39;, he urged Croats in Australia to support UHNj and stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is our duty to support the Croatian Liberation struggle ... for without a bloody shirt there will be no Independent State of Croatia. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He does not confine his appeals to the journalistic level but regularly &#39;stands over&#39; other Croats for donations to the cause. </para>
          <para>At this point honourable senators might well ponder a few questions. Why was this man, Suljak, not deported in 1969 as recommended by the Commissioner of Commonwealth Police? Why has his organisation, which flaunts its Ustashi allegiance, and which is acknowledged by ASIO in another document which is tabled today, to be a terrorist organisation, been allowed to continue in existence? And, above all, why was this existence denied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood?</inline></para>
          <para>A rather surprising beneficiary of the former Attorney-General&#39;s benevolence is one Zdenko Marincic. Marincic arrived in Australia on 16th January 1970. He became Secretary of SHUMS (Union of Croatian United Youth of the World), which, despite its innocent sounding name, is under the effective control of Srecko Rover and is suspected by the Commonwealth Police of being an extremist front organisation (see letter from J. Davis to the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, dated 8th June 1972). He first attracted police attention on 29th November 1970 when he removed a Yugoslav flag from the balcony of the Southern Cross Hotel in Melbourne during Yugoslav National Day celebrations and burned it. For this offence he was convicted on 9th February 1972 and fined. </para>
          <para>On 19th May 1972 Marincic hastily left Australia. This was shortly before the &#39;Bosnian incident&#39; which has already been referred to. Marincic turned up in Frankfurt, Germany, but the German authorities refused him entry. He had not obtained a re-entry permit before leaving Australia, so he has no right at all to be here. Nonetheless he returned to Australia on 24th May 1972 and was immediately arrested and charged the next day with having a firearm in his possession. He was convicted and sentenced to 9 months imprisonment. This was not a simple firearms offence. When he left Australia hurriedly on 19th May 1972 Marincic took with him a rifle and 4 silencers which he concealed in a toy koala. </para>

              <para>-  The 4 silencers were concealed in a toy koala. When the rifle was discovered the German authorities refused him entry and he returned to Australia with gun and silencers. He also was in possession of a booklet in the Serbo-Croatian language containing instruction on sabotage and of the names and addresses of Ambroz Andric in France, Adolf Andric in Germany and Pave Vegar in Germany. AH 3 of these men were named in the Yugoslav Government aidememoire as participants in the Bosnian incursion and it will be recalled that Jure Marie had also maintained contact with Vegar. Al! 3 were killed in this adventure, according to the Yugoslav Government. Surely it is a reasonable inference that Marincic went to Germany to join the Bosnian incursion or at least to help equip it. </para>

          <para>On 18th October 1972, the AssistantDirector of the Special Reports Branch of the Department of Immigration recommended Marincic&#39;s deportation. In weighing up all the considerations, including Marincic&#39;s probable fate if returned to Yugoslavia, the AssistantDirector said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I believe the strong doubts which exist about his past and future involvement in potentially violent Balkan politics should be exercised in favour of Australia and therefore recommend that Zdenko Marincic be deported. Such action, I suggest will have a salutary effect  upon  those Croatians u/ho le Australia as a base for pursuit of their ideals and will also provide the Yugoslav authorities with a positive indication that Australia neither supports nor ron,dones extremism. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I venture to suggest that they are sentiments with which the overwhelming major:tv of Australians would agree. These sentiments, however, did not find favour with the then Attorney-General. </para>
          <para>In a long and carefully argued submission to the Minister for Immigration dated 1 2th November 1972, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> reversed the priorities as between the interests of Australia and those of an obvious Croatian terrorist in favour of the latter.  His  letter, which is among the documents tabled, should be closely studied by everyone who is interested to discover the basis of his curiously tender regard for men whose preferred methods of asserting their political beliefs are the bomb and the gun. Let me quote just one passage from this extraordinary letter:  1 appreciate your concern that Marincic is a person whom we could not safely allow to remain in Australia. I understand your apprehension is that he is a man with a propensity to violence and that, &#62;n view of recent happenings involving violence to persons and property, we have a paramount obligation to the Australian community to remove him from the country. </para>
          <para>Naturally I share your apprehension that we should knowingly allow a person of violent proclivities to remain in this country if he is an immigrant whom we can deport. But this is a matter of balancing the likely harm to Australia against (he consequences of deportation. It is relevant in each case to note the country to which a person will be deported. </para>
          <para>I have indicated the traditional and accepted rule - applicable not only in the past in this country but also in the USA and the UK - that deportation or extradition does not take place where a person is likely to be dealt with for his political opinions by the country to which he is sent. I believe that this outweighs all other considerations in this case. </para>
          <para class="block">In the event, Marincic is still among us. However misguided one might consider an AttorneyGeneral who placed the interests of an obvious terrorist ahead of the interests of the Australian people, there might be some who would be impressed by the countervailing libertarian considerations on which his submission is apparently based. There is, however, a fatal flaw in this argument, which assumes that the deportation of Marincic would inevitably place him at the mercy of the Yugoslav police. The chief law officer of Australia must have been familiar with the decision of the High Court in the case of Znaty v. The Minister of State for Immigration and Another (1972 Argus Law Reports page 545). Judgment in this case was delivered on 25th February 1972, that is, some 9 months prior to the letter to the Minister for Immigration urging him not to deport Marincic. </para>
          <para>The judgment of the Court in that case clearly established the right of the Government to deport a person to anywhere. Counsel briefed by the Attorney-General submitted that the law was and had been since 1903 that the Government is not bound to send the deportee back to the place from which he came and the Court approved that submission. If we assume that he was familiar with this decision and surely he would not undertake to advise the Minister for Immigration without familiarising himself with the uptodate state of the law regarding immigration matters, we can only reach one conclusion about his conduct in this matter: In order to protect a terrorist from deportation, he misinformed the Minister responsible for the issuance of a deportation order about the legal consequences for the terrorist of such an order. </para>
          <para>This is a serious charge but is supported by an earlier example of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> benign view of the rights of terrorists. This case involved none other than Jure Marie, about whom I have already said a great deal. On 4th July 1972 the Attorney-General&#39;s Department put a submission to him that he should recommend that Marie&#39;s application for a passport be refused. The officer of the Department who made this recommendation pointed out that ASIO&#39;s latest report and the most recent Commonwealth Police report on Marie indicated that he was deeply involved in Croatian nationalist activities and was prepared to support acts of violence against Yugoslavia, that there was a real possibility that he would, if granted a passport, be a participant in acts of violence directed against Yugoslavia and that, if this occurred, it would be an embarrassment to Australia&#39;s relations with Yugoslavia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> rejected this advice from his Department and was not in favour of refusing the passport to Marie. Fortunately, the Minister for Immigration did not grant Marie&#39;s application. </para>
          <para>In a previous debate on this subject <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> indignantly repudiated the charge that he was &#39;soft&#39; on Croatian terrorists. Surely that was a mild charge to lay at the door of a man whom the documents prove to have been the active protector of terrorists! On 21st September 1972, 2 high-ranking officers of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, alarmed by recent events, especially the bombings in the streets of Sydney, called <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> him and drew to his attention certain Croatian publications and discussed the various Croatian organisations. Their submissions to the Attorney-General are among the documents produced today to the Senate. One of these officers, who had been specially assigned 6 years earlier to Croatian affairs and was considered in the Department to be the expert on this subject, expressed the view that 2 of these organisations, HOP and HNO, &#39;were not primarily cultural but political and militarist&#39;. A few weeks later this officer was relieved of all duties concerning Croatian matters. </para>
          <para>The tone of the last Government&#39;s attitude towards Croatian terrorism was set as long ago as 27th August 1964 by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies.  His  statement was precipitated by a complaint by the Yugoslav Government following 2 incidents: </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline>gave a little lecture on Balkan history and stated that police &#39;had found no evidence whatever to support allegations of Ustashi violence towards individuals of Yugoslav nationality&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> went on to say:  lt is understandable that some Yugoslav migrants of Croatian origin should continue to hope for the establishment of an independent Croatia and within a democracy like Australia they have a Tight to advocate their views so long as they do so by legitimate means. </para>
          <para class="block">That is a reasonable proposition but I leave it to honourable senators to judge whether the means&#39; T have disclosed today are &#39;legitimate&#39;. The long list of unsolved crimes of violence tells an eloquent story of the indifference of governments of 23 years duration to the means&#39; used by Croatian extremists to attain the goals <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> smiled on so benignly. The police have done their best with inadequate resources and no encouragement. They could hardly fail to draw the conclusion that successive Liberal governments could not have cared less whether they succeeded or not in crushing Croatian terrorism. To be sure, there were sporadic cries of alarm from individual Ministers. For example on 3rd December 1969, the Honourable Philip Lynch, then Minister for Immigration, wrote to the then Attorney-General Hughes expressing:   . . concern al the likely serious consequences if Croat nationals in Australia are permitted to continue unchecked their terrorist activities and  outrages  against representatives of the Yugoslav Government and authority generally in this country. 1 have reason to believe that the terrorists are endeavouring to create the impression amongst Yugoslav migrants in Australia that the Croatian extremists have the support of significant sections of Australian society and even the government. I am moreover concerned with the likely, effect upon our relations with Yugoslavia, especially iri terms of our migration arrangements with that country, of continued incidents of this kind and the apparent inability of the law authorities to apprehend offenders. </para>
          <para class="block">The Minister recommended that the Government should make a strong statement that outrages &#39;of this kind will not be tolerated&#39;. That was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> in government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> out of government speaks in a different tone. Last week he condemned the precautions taken to protect the visiting Yugoslav Prime Minister as &#39;hysterical&#39;. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline>Barwick, then Minister for External Affairs, also expressed his concern shortly after the 1963 incursion into Yugoslavia. In a letter addressed to the AttorneyGeneral and the Minister for Immigration dated 6th January 1964, he wrote, in part: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In essence, the problem is one of &#39;keeping an eye&#39; on immigrant extremists, while operating within the framework of existing law and practice. We should not abandon our democratic principles of tree speech, belief and association but I would hope that migrants are left with no misunderstanding of the disfavour with which the Government would view any activities which might reasonably give rise to objections by the present governments of their countries of origin. With this end in mind. I should like to suggest that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation should maintain some supervision over migrant groups (making no attempt to disguise its surveillance) and bring to your attention any activities which might be considered to have contravened sections 30 (A) or 30 (C) of the Crimes Act.  In  appropriate circumstances, it may, be necessary to consider the desirability of prosecutions under the Act as a further deterrent to uncontrolled extremism, although this measure need not be adopted except in the last resort. </para>

The latter admits that he will use any means possible to achieve an independent Croatia; claims to know that one of the Andric brothers (since killed in the Bosnia incursion) made the pen bomb which exploded in Richmond Town Hall on 2nd September 1967, gravely injuring a young man; advocates the violent overthrow of the Yugoslav Government. Documents seized in the raid on Rover&#39;s home in August 1972, copies of which are tabled today including a map of the route to be followed by the incur.sionists, prove conclusively his personal involvement with the Bosnia incursion of June 1972. Also seized was a seal bearing the insignia of the Supreme Headquarters of the Croatian National Resistance and the Croatian Armed Forces, ammunition and documents relating to the instigation of guerrilla activity in Yugoslavia. </para>

              <para>- Is the honourable senator implying that because the guerrilla activity took place in Yugoslavia and not in Australia this should be of no account to the Government of Australia? A most significant document seized was a report from the Supreme Advisory Council of the troika dated 15th July 1972, indicating that an organisation has been set up in Australia on the basis of small cells or troikas. The manner in which these troikas operate is set out in detail in a report from the Commonwealth Police prepared on 6th March 1968 which was always available to the former AttorneyGeneral and which is among the documents tabled today. In a move to establish himself as the leader of Croatian nationalism in Australia, Rover was mainly instrumental in the setting up in May 1972 of KOHDA (Co-or dinating Committee of Croatian Associations in Australia). Affiliated with the Committee are such important organisations as HOP (Croatian Liberation Movement), HNO (Croation National Resistance) and UHNj (United Croats of West Germany). </para>

          <para>Now that it is clear that the new Government intends to cope vigorously with the problem of Croatian terrorism we hope and believe that it will be possible to gain the cooperation of that vast majority of peaceful Croatian citizens who are the first victims of the fanatical minority of their countrymen who engage in terrorism. The documents tabled show that Croatians have been intimidated to contribute money to the terrorists. The measures which we propose will put an end to this. What I have said about Croatian terrorism applies to all terrorism. I point to the case of the Bulgarian terrorists, Daskaloff and Petroff, who were convicted of throwing a bomb into the grounds of the Russian Embassy <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> Canberra and were sentenced to terms of imprisonment. Despite that these men were clearly liable for deportation, the previous Goernment did not deport them and they are still in our midst. </para>
          <para>The present Government&#39;s policy will be to deport aliens associated with terrorist organisations who have been convicted of crimes of violence, and become liable to deportation. Recommendations have been made that certain persons be deported, not necessarily to the country from which they came. AH proper procedures and safeguards of civil liberties will be observed. The Minister for Immigration makes the necessary orders. The new policy is to cut out the cancer of terrorism from our body politic. This should apply to all who are liable to deportation and from whom violence can be apprehended. The law will be used to deal with terrorism and violence. </para>
          <para>Important changes will also be made in our police and security arrangements. Pending the full report on the operations of ASIO and its relations with the executive government which 1 intend to present to Parliament during this session, the Director-General of ASIO will operate mainly from Canberra. This will ensure closer liaison with the Australian Government and the Commonwealth Police in combating terrorism. In the past there has been inadequate co-operation between ASIO and the Commonwealth Police in areas where their operations overlapped. This is a problem to which 1 have given much attention in the past few weeks. </para>
          <para>Another problem is that matters of national security often involve breaches of State criminal law. This has often meant that ASIO has not been supplied with information which bears on matters of national security. The conclusion I have drawn from this is that we need federal laws to cover crimes which may affect national security. </para>

          <para>I intend to recommend to Cabinet that legislation be introduced for new or strengthened Federal criminal laws to deal with offences such as the use of telephones or postal services to convey threats to persons or property; committing an act of violence against a foreign guest of the Australian Government; against diplomatic or consular personnel or premises or against persons or premises engaged in or used for overseas or interstate trade and commerce; acts of violence or threats of violence against Australian Ministers or officials of the Australian Government and others; acts or threats of violence or extortion by aliens; inciting in Australia acts of violence against a person or property in a foreign state with which Australia has friendly relations or to collect money or to train persons in the use of weapons, explosives or poisons in Australia for this purpose. I will also propose legislation to supplement the powers already possessed by the Australian Government to prevent the entry into Australia of terrorists or persons associated with organised crime. The Commonwealth Police will be strengthened, especially in its criminal investigation unit. The Commissioner had requested the previous Government to be supplied with extra staff and additional translators but this request fell on deaf ears. These requests have now been examined by my Department, found to be reasonable and appropriate, and I have approved them. 1 should like to add a word about events of last week. 1 am advised that terrorists came to Canberra last week with the intention of killing the Yugoslav Prime Minister. The Commissioner of Commonwealth Police, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> Davis, advised me that, frustrated in that ambition by security precautions, the terrorists might make an alternative attempt on the life of the Australian Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> or other Ministers of the Government. The unanimous opinion of the Federal law enforcement authorities was that it was unsafe for the Austraiian Prime Minister to walk through the Port Kembla Steelworks of Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd on Wednesday last. In this situation, I make no apology for any steps which I took last week to ensure that the intentions of violent terrorists were thwarted. Those who take the view that those precautions were unnecessary because nothing happened are indulging in a twisted form of logic. Toleration of terrorism in this country is over. Whatever we import from the rest of the world we do not need that. This Government is determined that terrorism in Australia will be resolutely stamped out. A list of the documents has already been tabled along with the other documents. 1 ask for leave to have it and a summary of the documents incorporated in Hansard. </para>

He studied Electronic Engineering. However, he left University in 1943, having been called up to serve in the Second Bojna Ustaske Vojnice (i.e. Second Battalion, Ustashi Armed Forces). He joined as a Private and in June 1944 was promoted to commission rank of Lieutenant. He served in Armoured Units in Sarajevo in the First Ustaski Zdrug (i.e. Brigade), ready to repel any Allied landing that might take place on the Adriatic Coast by the Western Allies. In 1945, on the downfall of the Axis powers, Rover went to refugee camps in Italy and Austria and in the next few years was involved in several guerrilla terrorist raids into Yugoslavia. In 1950 he migrated to Australia and has ceaselessly pursued the aims of organising the overthrow by force and violence the State of Yugoslavia. </para>

Translations for each of the papers are attached, together with a record of an interview by Sergeant E. H. George of the Commonwealth Police with Adolf Andric on 21st June 1966. Adolf Andric is very important in that he was an active terrorist member of this terrorist organisation while he was in Australia. After returning to Europe in 1969 he carried on his terrorist activities and maintained his association with other Croatians in Australia. Adolf Andric was a leader with his brother Ambroz, of the armed terrorist raiding party which entered Yugoslavia in June 1972. Many of the members of that raiding party had been recruited in Australia. Adolf Andric was an industrial chemist having had technical training in this trade in Yugoslavia before migrating to Australia. Many of the papers in document B17 indicate considerable experimentation in relation to poisons, explosives and bombs. These documents portray a picture of terrorist planning that is almost beyond comprehension. Several of the papers set out the fundamental principles of HRB. They also evidence a close association of other important members of the Croatian community with Adolf Andric. This is especially so in the case of Tomislav Lesic and Jure Marie. </para>

Lovric and Glavas took part in the raid. Kraljevic missed joining the group in Germany-Austria, due to his arrest for liquor offences in Victoria. Another Croatian named Zdenko Marincic who was associated with Kraljevic. left Australia at that time, but was turned back by German police at FrankfurtonMain.

The terrorist raid into Yugoslavia in June 1972 was mounted from Germany and Austria. This can be related to the document that contained a record of an interview between Superintendent Milte and Rover in which Rover stated that persons would be sent through Germany to fight in Yugoslavia. The evidence contained in Document 20 of Marie sending money to Vegar in Europe can be related to the statements made by, Tomislav Lesic on the ABC television on 19th September 1972, and contained in document 6(a).

          <para>- At this stage I shall speak briefly to the motion that the Senate take note of the statement. The Senate will appreciate that a paper which has taken about an hour to put down and which has been supported by a large number of documents cannot be considered immediately by the Opposition. Therefore we will seek to adjourn the debate on the motion which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> Before we do so I think that a few comments may be in order. Today we have listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> statement, which, as I have said, occupied almost an hour, lt has been delivered in an almost theatrical atmosphere. I suppose the honourable senator ought to be pleased that he had a full house. I am only pleased that people have not paid to come otherwise they would be asking for their money back because they must have been disappointed at what the statement contained. I thought that after the raid on Friday, 16th March- </para>

            <para>- I used the word &#39;raid&#34;. One would have thought that that would have been adverted to somewhere in the statement. But the most that can be said is that it was dismissed in 2 minor paragraphs on page 28 of a 30-page document. All we have listened to this afternoon has been a reiteration of statements about a reign of terror - most of which we have heard time and time again. One would have thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> would have at least attempted to justify his actions of the last 12 days and not make the statement which he made this afternoon. One is left with the impression that all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has attempted to achieve is a state of tension, and it is a state of tension which is often brought about by the continual presence of police. We have heard of threats of death, threats of bombings, threats of bombs in the Senate and of bullet proof glass What happened here today? We heard nothing at all about those things. All I can say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has deliberately not attempted to answer the question before the Senate: Why did he destroy the Australian </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">Security Intelligence Organisation? Why did he run away from speaking about the subject today? That is why we thought it would be far better to wait and see what this great statement was all about before proceeding to question time. Question time will be called on shortly and we will then be in a position to ask questions in order to try to fill in the gaps, because gaps do exist and they ought not to exist. Rather than spend some 60 minutes in this place trying to destroy his predecessor in office as Attorney-General it would have been far better for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to justify his own actions over the last 12 days, which have put the total security of this nation at risk. As 1 said earlier, I think the Senate ought to come back to the paper at a later stage and therefore 1 ask for leave to continue my remarks. </para>

It accords with what was forecast in Press statements. I propose to reply not today but in due course and in detail, chapter and verse, in the course of the debate, because I have been subjected to a monstrous vilification in which truth has played virtually no part. 1 have sat here- </para>

            <para>- I say that when it is said that there is evidence which is overwhelming and incontestable and it is all to be found in the documents, the fact that it is not identified and pointed out is in itself curious. I will search through the documents. Evidence is required to bring people before courts and to sustain charges. Evidence is required to declare that organisations are terrorist organisations and unlawful. I know that if I had had the evidence there would have been prosecutions. If I had had the evidence consideration would have been given to taking matters before the High Court. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has the evidence he ought to explain Why he has not taken people before the courts, why he is not applying to the High Court. What the statement ignores and where I say that I have been grievously misrepresented is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has ignored what the record will show to him; that is that many steps were taken.

          <para>CONFIDENTIAL </para>
          <para>12th November 1972 </para>
          <para>My dear Minister, </para>
          <para>I spoke to you on Friday last about the proposed deportation of  Zdenko  Marincic. I said that I would write to you and set out the basis for my concern whether this is a proper case for deportation. </para>
          <para>I know that Marincic is liable to be deported under sections 13 and 18 of the Migration Act. He  has been convicted of an offence punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer and that, without more, creates a liability to deportation. </para>
          <para>But it appears that the true reason for his deportation is that he is regarded as a Croatian extremist, so that it is not desirable he should be allowed to remain in Australia. That, however, is a ground to which section 14 of the Act relates. </para>
          <para>If you were to order the deportation of Marincic under section 14 he would have an opportunity to have the matter heard by a Commissioner appointed for the purpose. Whether he would avail himself of that opportunity is another matter. So, too, is the question whether sufficient evidence is available to satisfy a Commissioner that Marincic&#39;s conduct is such that he should not be allowed to remain in Australia. The Parliament has expressed a policy that a person who is to be deported on the ground of his general conduct should have an opportunity to have his case reviewed by an independent tribunal. </para>
          <para>I think it comes down to this. If Marincic were not a Croatian extremist and you would nevertheless order his deportation under either section .13 or section 18, then the policy expressed in section 14 is irrelevant. But if you would not have ordered his deportation under either of these sections if it were not alleged that he is Croatian extremist, then I suggest that the proper course would be to act directly and openly under section 14. Otherwise Marincic would be denied the opportunity to have his case examined in accordance with the policy set down by Parliament. </para>
          <para>It is, I think, clear that, if Marincic is to be deported, he must be told on what grounds he is being deported. </para>
          <para>But irrespective of whether the deportation is to he based on section 13, 14, or 18, I consider that there are fundamental policy issues which must be considered. </para>
          <para>Marincic is. obviously, a Yugoslav citizen who identifies himself with the cause which advocates an independent Croatia. As such, he is a person who is opposed to the existing Yugoslav Government. Indeed, the only conclusion to be drawn from his possession of the rifle and silencers is that he was prepared either himself to use them or knowingly to have others use them to foment some violent action in Yugoslavia or, possibly, against Yugoslav nationals overseas.  His  antipathy to Yugoslavia is revealed by the incident in which he was convicted for larcency of a Yugoslav flag. He has been involved in demonstrations against the Yugoslav Government. He is reputed to have been an office-bearer of a Croatian nationalist organisation. These facts reveal his proclivities. He is politically opposed to the Yugoslav Government. lt is public knowledge that the Yugoslav Government is faced with an internal political problem of some magnitude with respect to its Croatian minority. In quite recent times there have been political trials and I understand they are continuing. lt appears indisputable that persons engaged in or believed or alleged to be engaged in political activities against the Yugoslav Government face physical persecution. I use the expression &#39;physical persecution&#39; in the sense in which it has been interpreted in section 243 (h) of the United States Immigration and Nationality Act of 19S2 under which the AttorneyGeneral of the United States of America is autho rised to withhold deportation of an alien to any country in which, in his opinion, he would be subject to physical persecution. Physical persecution is taken to mean confinement, torture, or death on account of race, religion or political viewpoint. </para>
          <para>Yugoslavia does subject persons to confinement (and, possibly, unlawful killing) for their political viewpoints. There is incontestable evidence of Australian nationals and Australian residents (in each case of Yugoslav birth) being gaoled in Yugoslavia for alleged membership of Croatian organisations in Australia. I do not consider it can be disputed that persons arc liable to incarceration, at least, for their political viewpoint and it would appear to be immaterial whether the expression of their political viewpoint has occurred inside or outside Yugoslavia. 1 stress the fact that both our colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have been supplied with information as to the deprivations imposed on Croatians who have recently visited Yugoslavia. This information has wide currency in the Croatian community and is becoming more generally known. The persons concerned are not known by the Commonwealth Police to have been convicted of crimes in Australia but, apparently, membership of a Croatian organisation in Australia is a ground for punishment in Yugoslavia. I feel that stress must be laid on these matters because it cannot be said that we are unaware of the likely penal consequences of deportation of a Croatian Nationalist to Yugoslavia, particularly, where, in the case of Marincic, his record is publicly known. </para>
          <para>The fundamental question is whether, by the act of deportation of Marincic, we create a precedent almost, if not, without parallel in the English speaking world. What we would be doing is returning without request, an individual who is known to be antipathetic to a totalitarian regime, to be dealt with by that regime for his political opposition to it. If request were made, the decision would fall to be made on extradition principles and, on the application of those principles, he would nol be extradited. </para>
          <para>I am strongly of the view that this precedent should not occur. </para>
          <para>I invite your attention to a number of facts and circumstances which I consider are highly relevant. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government in 1962 refused (o deport a number of deserting Portugese sailors, in respect of whom fears were held as to what might happen to them if they were returned to Portugal. More recently, the Government declined to deport the Bulgarians Daskaloff and Petrov who had completed a term of imprisonment for offences in connection with the bombing of the Embassy of the Union of Socialist Soviet Russia. </para>
          <para>I refer also to the general principles of extradition law. These principles have been given express legislative effect in Australia in the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act and the Extradition (Foreign States) Act. These Acts provide first, that a person is not liable to be surrendered for an offence if the offence to which his surrender relates is an offence of a political character. Secondly, the Acts provide that the Attorney-General should not issue a warrant for the return of a fugitive if he has substantial grounds for believing that, if the fugitive is surrendered to the requesting country, &#39;he may be prejudiced at his trial, or punished, detained or restricted in his personal liberty by reason of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions&#39;. </para>
          <para>Furthermore, it has been judicially held that the discretion vested in the Attorney-General under the Extradition (Foreign Slates) Act to return a fugitive committed to prison to await extradition ought to be exercised in favour of refusing to surrender him whenever it would be wrong, unjust or oppressive to surrender the fugitive. I think that a similar test ought to be applied when deportation is being considered. </para>
          <para>I appreciate your concern that Marincic is a per- son whom we could not safely allow to remain in Australia. I understand your apprehension is that he is a man with a propensity to violence and that, in view of recent happenings involving violence to persons and property, we have a paramount obligation to the Australian community to remove him from the country. </para>
          <para>Naturally, I share your apprehension that we should knowingly allow a person of violent proclivities to remain in this country if he is an immigrant whom we can deport. But this is a matter of balancing the likely harm to Australia against the consequences of deportation. It is relevant in each case to note the country to which a person will be deported. 1 have indicated the traditional and accepted rule - applicable not only in the past in this country but also in the United States of America and the United Kingdom - that deportation or extradition does not take place where a person is likely to be dealt with for his political opinions by the country to which he is sent. I believe that this outweighs all other considerations in this case. </para>
          <para>I invite attention to the fact that Marincic has not been convicted of any act of violence in this country. Nor is it suggested that he has been implicated in any way in any act of violence. That he must be taken to have been prepared to engage in violence or to support the violent acts of others overseas is, I believe, undeniable. But this does not establish a propensity to commit violent acts endangering life in this country. </para>
          <para>I think his case clearly raises the need for amendment of the Crimes Act to cover the overt acts of preparation to commit violence overseas and for this offence to be punishable with a heavy gaol sentence but, on the facts as known, Marincic has committed no offences other than the 2 non-violent offences of which he has been convicted. </para>
          <para>I also note with concern the Commonwealth Police report of 21st September 1972 that Marincic is aware of rumours that he might be deported and is in a considerable state of agitation. Apparently both the Commonwealth Police and your Department are concerned with the likelihood of Marincic attempting to escape or commit suicide if he believes he will be deported. I consider that if the latter eventuality occurred, the decision to deport would be regarded as having precipitated it and in the light of all the circumstances I believe it would be extremely difficult publicly to justify the decision. </para>
          <para>I invite you to consider also that, if Marincic is deported there will doubtless be pressures from some quarters for other Croats to be deported. This will highlight the difficulties to which I have adverted. </para>
          <para>I reiterate my very deep concern that the deportation would be a departure from established practice and a denial of certain human values which, albeit as a lawyer, I regard our Government as having always maintained and which I shall always strive to have maintained. </para>
          <para>If, notwithstanding my basic concern about the deportation of Marincic back to Yugoslavia, you still consider that an order for his deportation should be made, then in my view the proper course would be to proceed under section 14 of the Act so that Marincic has an opportunity to place all the considerations which he would wish to urge before an independent commissioner. 1 am sending copies of this letter to our colleagues, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. </para>

            <para>-I said when I rose to make this personal explanation that I proposed in due course to traverse each of the many allegations which have been made. I repudiate entirely that there is any basis to the attack which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has made, an attack which I regard, asI have read the statement, as apparently the prime purpose of what was said today. But I have a reputation. I can speak and I can use my voice to defend what I believe is right and just. I think that what the Senate and the people of Australia have been treated to today is a malicious use of parliamentary privilege to build up a case without foundation for the sole purpose of pouring scorn and calumny upon a person whom the Government chooses not to like. In due course I shall make a statement. </para>

          <para class="block">Before and after that visit, arrangements were set in train by me for the protection of the Yugoslav Prime Minister. Certainly, as a result of the visit which I had to the ASIO headquarters, the arrangements for the Yugoslav Prime Minister were tightened. I think that there was a recognition by everyone concerned that the precautions taken ultimately were the most stringent of such precautions taken in Australia. They were greatly to the credit of all who were concerned, not only the Commonwealth Police Force, but also the police forces of the States which co-operated to a very high degree. I make special mention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mahony</inline> of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department who, in the first place, co-ordinated the arrangements which were made and laid down the procedures to a point where the ultimate operational responsibility was transferred to the Commissioner of the Commonwealth Police. 1 am glad to say that all that I did assisted in the efficacy of these arrangements. </para>

            <para>- It is a fact that the Anderson survey of television audiences which was taken last month - February - showed a general decline in the numbers of people whom it records as watching television. From recollection, I understand that there was a general decline in numbers to a situation where some 44 per cent or 45 per cent of possible viewers were not watching during the prime viewing time. However, I am told that this survey does not agree with the other survey - the McNair survey - which, of course, also is relevant to the total television scene. From time to time survey results which have been produced have later proved to be less than fully reliable. Therefore, at this stage one could not be quite confident of any conclusion in this area. It is quite possible that the audience available for television during this period declined because of tha influence of daylight saving. I am given to understand that the survey has been the subject of some concern to the television industry and that some queries about it have been raised by the industry. The Government, in conjunction with the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, is considering ways in which the quantity and quality of Australian programs can be improved. </para>

Is it a fact that the United States of America is exporting to Australia very large consignments of carpets made of synthetic fibre at prices far below the cost of production in Australia? Is it also a fact that a high percentage of this carpet is banned by United States law for use in that country because it is highly inflammable? If so, what action is being taken to protect the Australian carpet industry and the Australian people against unfair competition and inferior and dangerous products? </para>

As his statement contains do reference to this declaration that 200 dangerous Yugoslavs were on their way to Yugoslavia, I ask: Where have the 200 dangerous guerrillas got to?

Under the new arrangements I think that the nearest parliamentarian to me is the Leader of the Opposition. I also doubt that he would have made such a statement. I do not know about that. I do say this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President:</inline> There have been incursions into Yugoslavia. I would not be as disposed as is the honourable senator to scoff at any talk of incursion. I know nothing of 200 guerrillas. I have not authorised any statement about 200 guerrillas and, so far as I know, no-one in authority has given any credence to any statement about 200 guerrillas. </para>

We have asked them to report on the situation in the various countries and to see whether there is a possibility that people can renounce their former citizenship - this could be a way of doing it, or, if not. we will have a report on how it could be done. At present there is a warning placed on passports regarding this matter. So far this subject has not been finalised. All the answers have not been received. When they are a statement will bs made on it. </para>

            <para>- I think that some 3 police officers accompanied me. They were people who had some special acquaintance with matters of Croatian terrorism. In order that the Senate may not be misled by that statement, let me say that there were a number of police at the headquarters of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I think there were 27 but I am not quite sure. May I further say in answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question that no police officer opened any file and no police officer inspected any file. </para>

As a result of the recent visits to ASIO - I have had 2 in the last few days - and as a result of other action whch has been instituted by me in relation not only to ASIO but also the Commonwealth Police, I propose to take the course of combating terrorism in this country. Action will be taken for deportation in cases where that is appropriate, having regard to the observance of the rights of persons and their civil liberties and to what crimes of violence they may have committed, and to initiate prosecutions in cases where that is appropriate. </para>

I appreciate the Government&#39;s policy of noninterference in the affairs of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, but am I given to understand that negotiations are proceeding between the New South Wales Rugby League and the Australian Broadcasting Commission to televise rugby league replays on Saturday evenings? Has the New South Wales Rugby League suggested that portions of some matches should be telecast on Sunday afternoons? Will the Minister use his persuasive powers to request the Australian Broadcasting Commission to come to a reasonable arrangement with the Rugby League to ensure that the greatest game of all is telecast for the benefit of Australian audiences? </para>

            <para>- As one who used to participate in the gentlemanly, noble and skilful sport to which the honourable senator referred but who now, as a result of the passing years, is a mere but nonetheless keen spectator, I was interested to hear that question asked by the honourable senator. I have been given to understand by the Australian Broadcasting Commission that it has not recently been involved in negotiations with the New South Wales Rugby League. I believe that the Commission has an agreement with the New South Wales Rugby League to telecast the Sydney match of the day on a delayed basis - that is, the replay to which the honourable senator alluded. I understand that this usually means that the match of the day is telecast at 6 p.m. on the evening of the actual match. That agreement still has a period of some 2 years to run. Presumably any negotiations currently being held with the Rugby League would involve the commercial stations. However, it was only yesterday, I think, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Buckley, Chairman</inline> of the New South Wales Rugby League, rang me to say that negotiations which had been proceeding with the commercial stations had fallen through and that he intended to make fresh negotiations with the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I will ascertain the result of those negotiations and let the honourable senator know. </para>

Later I was supplied with a photostat copy of a file. At the headquarters of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation I did not take away any files. I was supplied later at various times with a great deal of information which came from files. Some of this information was supplied on the same day. It was photostated. A good deal of it was supplied subsequently. Of course, 1 saw a great deal more than is involved in what has been received. Does that answer the honourable senator&#39;s question? </para>

            <para>- As a result of a Commonwealth and State Ministers meeting on 16th March it was agreed to continue the rural reconstruction scheme which was initiated by the previous Administration. The amount of $3 6m may be supplemented by the Commonwealth at the request of each of the States on a 10 per cent basis, matched by the States on a dollar for dollar basis. The commitment is for 12 months. I can assure the honourable senator that future reconstruction schemes will be looked at in the light of the need which exists in the countryside for that finance. I assure the honourable senator also that if the need continues to exist the scheme will continue. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator asks an interesting question. I remember that these matters arose at the time of the Springbok tour. Of course the real position was that the senior law body of the world, the United Nations Organisation, through resolutions of the General Assembly and also by certain other resolutions of its constituent bodies called upon persons - that is, governments and people everywhere - to do what they could to object to the crime of apartheid. The United Nations drew particular attention to the necessity to break off all cultural and sporting contacts with those countries which practised apartheid. I think that the action of those who protested in a peaceful manner against the endeavours of the previous Government to break the decisions of the United Nations was to be highly commended. I hope that this Government will continue to observe United Nations decisions, noi only in the letter but also in the spirit, and will not want to have any cultural, economic or social ties with those countries which are practising a form of conduct towards their fellow men which is detestable. </para>

            <para>- I am unaware of all the details involved in the honourable senator&#39;s question. I do know, however, that under the last Government in the 12 months to February last some 200 post offices were closed. It is therefore a matter that would require a lot of consideration. The simple answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question is that since assuming office this Government has appointed a commission of inquiry into the affairs of the Post Office and 1 understand that the commission will soon commence the taking of evidence. So far as career opportunities are concerned, the development of regional centres will be an important matter. It is felt by the postal administration that there should be greater scope for career opportunities in those areas. </para>

            <para>- Actually it is the Australian Wool Corporation which is investigating the feasibility of an acquisition scheme for the Australian wool clip. My latest information is that it will be some time yet before the report is ready. I have indicated that I do not want it to be a hurried report but that I want it to be a well documented report because the implications of what may arise from that recommendation will have very far reaching effects in the Australian rural community. I shall wait until the Corporation&#39;s report is available, which I think will be some months yet. </para>

          <para>- Of course the honourable senator will be assured of that. Ever when orders have been made against persons the procedure of habeas corpus is available to them to test whether the orders have been properly made. I think we must go further than that. We ought to have a proper mode of appeals, especially where there is an element of discretion in an order. I do not wish at this time to go into all the technicalities. Where persons become liable to deportation not so much automatically - if I may use a term of art - because of convictions or imprisonment but because of their conduct, there is already provision in the Act for a mode of appeal to a commissioner who is constituted by a judge or other official. I think that mode of procedure would appeal to honourable senators. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We have a policy, which has been announced, of having an administrative court of appeals not only in regard to administrative decisions but also in regard to a whole host of other decisions. These procedures ought to be instituted to enable persons to appeal against the administrative decisions of agencies or other bodies, especially when they are so personally affected as by deportation. We intend to introduce that procedure and I can assure the honourable senator that work is proceeding on the matter. </para>

            <para>- It is with very great pleasure that I feel able to answer yes to the honourable senator&#39;s questions. I am pleased to see the attitude adopted by the honourable senator. When he refers to terrorists, I take it that he means, and 1 think everyone would understand him to mean, and that he is speaking in the context that there must be grounds for action. Proper procedures must be followed. I thank the honourable senator and I assure him that in the last several weeks, with the approach of the visit of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, it was not as easy to act as may be thought by some persons who would scoff at the gravity of the situation in Australia. If some of them were aware of the assessments of the gravity of the position, even right up to the very end, they would not so lightly dismiss the precautions which were taken. </para>

          <para>I assure the honourable senator that so far as I can I will see to it that people are not bombed in the streets of Sydney or subjected to terrorism or violence. Let us put it bluntly: I am not at all satisfied with the steps that were previously taken. I am quite sure that those people who are concerned federally with law enforcement authorities also are not satisfied with the steps that were taken. I propose, while observing all the due procedures, to do everything I can to stamp out terrorism and violence in Australia. </para>

            <para>- In addressing my question to the Attorney-General I advise him that it is based on a statutory declaration I have in my hand. Can the Attorney-General explain why the home of Franjo Till, a Croatian invalid pensioner of 17 Nineteenth Street, Narrabundah, Australian Capital Territory, was entered and searched in the dead of night - at 3.25 a.m., to be precise - on 18th March last by a Commonwealth policeman, one Alfred Meir? Does the Minister know that Alfred Meir was accompanied by one other man in plain clothes who spoke fluent Croatian and who refused to identify himself? Is he aware that no member of his police force speaks fluent Croatian? Is he aware that the Commonwealth police officer could not or would not produce a search warrant, even when Till asked for it? Is he aware that this raid took place in the presence of 6 adults and a number of children, all of whom were wakened and terrified by a raid so typical of Nazi Germany? Does he know that nothing was found in the pensioner&#39;s house? Can he explain why the man accompanying Constable Meir was, according to Till, a member of the Yugoslav secret police? If so, why was a member of the communist secret police allowed to take part in a raid upon the home of an Australian citizen? Can he inform the Senate how many Yugoslav secret police came to Australia with the man who he called a distinguished visitor, one Bijedic, once c&#39;hief of the secret police in Yugoslavia? Can he inform the Senate how many Yugoslav secret police accompanied raids upon Australian homes in Canberra during the past 10 to 12 days? Can he attempt to justify the series of raids which he knows were made upon Australian homes - private property - during this period, without search warrants? Is this intended to be the standard procedure by the Minister&#39;s new FBI or should I say Murphy&#39;s Mafia&#39;? </para>

Is he also aware that these sufferers have returned to Australia with their limbs intact and able to lead normal lives? In view of this, will he obtain the medical reports of some of the people concerned prior to going to Germany and after their return? Would he have the oxygen therapy treatment of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Moller</inline> thoroughly examined for the purpose of having the treatment made available in Australia so that these people will not have to go to such expense to have their treatment in Germany? </para>

As a result, I am told that it is intended to embark on an intensive advertising and educational campaign in some 19 foreign language journals that are circulating in Australia and, additionally, that the campaign that has been waged on radio and television will be stepped up. Tn this regard discussions are to take place tomorrow between officers of my Department and officers of the Commonwealth Department of Health, and tomorrow evening the Minister for Health and I will be in discussion about establishing a much more effective campaign over the media. </para>

            <para>- Referring to the statement made by the Attorney-General this afternoon, I ask him: Will he apply to the violence and terrorism instigated by certain trade unions, such as the Building Workers Industrial Union, principles similar to those which he proposes to apply in relation to the alleged but as yet not proven violence by certain Croatians within Australia? </para>

            <para>- If violence and terrorism are practised by any section of the community they should be dealt with. I think that attitude has to be taken. I do not accept what has been said by the honourable senator.  His  principle that in the community the approach to violence and terrorism should be broadly the same, of course, must be right. Let it be understood that violence and terrorism, if one may say so, are by no means restricted to a minority of the Croatian community. There is violence in other spheres. In regard to the area of organised crime, unfortunately most of what occurs is not in the Federal sphere and it cannot be dealt with by the Commonwealth Government. It is a matter for the State authorities to take steps in their spheres to deal with violence. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Attorney-General. It refers to the visit to Australia of the Yugoslav Prime Minister, reference to which was made in the statement of the Attorney-General earlier today. Was the Attorney-General given an assessment of the risks involved in the visit of the Yugoslav Prime Minister? If so, when was this assessment made and when was it given to him? Is it referred to in the documents which he tabled today and to which reference was made in his speech? If not, will he make it available, preferably to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate? </para>

            <para>- I was given at various times and by various persons a number of assessments of the danger involved in the visit. I sought those assessments, and I insisted upon having them. They varied in degree only in the sense that I think that the least risk referred to was an extreme degree of risk. A particular assessment which I can bring to mind was one that the danger was so great that the visit should not be held. That assessment was made by a very high Commonwealth officer. Other assessments made were that the risk was extremely great. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think the Senate will be interested to learn, broadly and without going into all the details, that I took the view that there should be complete co-ordination in this matter and that there should be discussion with the Yugoslav authorities. I wanted to be certain that the best possible procedures could be instituted and that the Yugoslav authorities accepted and were satisfied with the procedures. I insisted that the procedures be worked out to arrangements which could be undertaken by one person with the operational responsibility and with th&#39;e full authority for the carrying out of those procedures, and that was done. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to &#39;the Attorney-General. I refer to a statement made by the then AttorneyGeneral, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt,</inline> in Parliament on 20th September 1949: </para>

            <para>To all intents and purposes the Director-General of Security is free from ministerial direction. That arrangement is essential in order to maintain maximum internal security which, I have no doubt, all honourable members wish to have preserved. </para>

          <para class="block">In view of the oft-repeated claim by Labor members that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> was an outstanding Attorney-General, and in view of the full acceptance of that principle as enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt,</inline> does the present AttorneyGeneral now uphold that principle? </para>
          <para>Senaor MURPHY- The position of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and its Director-General is not one which should be misunderstood. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has made a lot of remarks on television which have astonished me, and probably have well astonished the Organisation, about the relationship between the Organisation and the executive Government. The previous Government, apparently unbeknown to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> took steps to ensure that there was a proper relationship between the Director-General and the executive Government. The Director-General acknowledges, and apparently did acknowledge, although the former Attorney-General seemingly was not aware of it, that the Director-General is subject to the directions of the Attorney-General of the day, as are the other officers. </para>

              <para>- This is question time but it would appear that we are carrying on a debate. I look at section 5 of the Act, as the honourable senator has suggested, and I say that if one wants to understand the relationship between the Organisation and the executive Government one has to look at the terms of the Act, including section 6, where one will see the answer which apparently the honourable senator seeks. I would have thought that any Attorney-General would have sought to ascertain the proper relationship. That appears in consequence of that section which provides that the Director-General shall hold office on such terms and conditions as the Governor-General determines. That is subject to the next succeeding sub-section. </para>

              <para>- 1 thought there was a reasonable apprehension that the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia would be the target of violence in Australia. I . think it was particularly unfortunate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> should, without any request of me and without any basis whatever, suggest that I was - I forget the word he used - personally acquainted with the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia. The only acquaintance I have had with the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia - the distinguished visitor to this country - was that which I had with him on the occasion of his visit a few days ago. I regret that the honourable senator saw fit to make the remark that he made. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Is the Minister aware that it was reported by a Brisbane television station that the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia was given a 19-gun salute on his arrival in Australia? Can the Minister explain to the Senate the justification for that action, as I understand that only visiting royalty and heads of state are entitled to such treatment? </para>

            <para>- I wish to direct a question to the Attorney-General. During the Attorney-General&#39;s nocturnal raid on the headquarters of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation were certain members of the ASIO staff, including the DirectorGeneral, held incommunicado for several hours? If so, was the Prime Minister made aware of the Attorney-General&#39;s intention to employ such tactics during his nocturnal visit? </para>

            <para>- I find it difficult to answer a question which is so full of misstatement. Firstly, when I met the Director-General it was in the light of day. I forget what time of the morning it was. Secondly, I was greeted by the Director-General, taken on a tour of the building and asked to address the staff of ASIO. I did so. I spoke to the DirectorGeneral and some members of his staff for some considerable time. I cannot understand the suggestion by the honourable senator. Certainly the Director-General was not held incommunicado. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Attorney-General. I am concerned at the first step which occurred on the night of 15th- 16th March last. Is it a fact that the Attorney-General called at the home of the Regional Director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in Canberra in the middle of the night of 15th- 16th March in company with Commonwealth police, got the Regional Director out of bed and took him at that hour of the night to the headquarters of ASIO in Canberra? If this is the case, why did the Attorney-General act like a petty Gestapo leader? </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Attorney-General. Reference was made in  the Attorney-General&#39;s statement to the fact that some of the documents which were tabled this afternoon bear the classification stamp &#39;Secret* or &#39;Confidential&#39;. The AttorneyGeneral said that they are no longer so, that they all had been declassified and that no breach of security was involved in tabling them now. I now ask the Attorney-General: By whose direction and authority were these documents declassified? </para>

            <para>- I suppose the ultimate authority for doing that would be the AttorneyGeneral, but in taking such action, of course, the advice of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was sought. In fact, as would be expected, assistance was sought to ensure that such documents as were declassified were properly declassified. What one would expect to happen has happened. </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of what was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulivihill</inline> as being the action of the Queensland Government. The policy of the new Government is to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination. I think it has been announced already that legislation will be introduced into this Parliament to implement the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination. As I conceive <inline font-style="italic">it,</inline> it will be possible, pursuant to that legislation, for this Parliament to insist that any form of racial discrimination be eliminated in Australia, whether such discrimination be by the Federal Government and its agencies or by State governments and their agencies. Bear with me a little if I am not able to speak with certainty on the matter. My understanding is that we will be able to legislate generally to forbid the pactice of any form of racial discrimination throughout Australia. That applies to employment and other activities of life. </para>

            <para>- As I recall- I take it the Senate is not requiring that I exercise absolute precision - it was somewhere shortly before midnight and shortly after the Senate had risen. As to who asked the regional director to attend, I think my private secretary telephoned the regional director and asked him to come. The persons who were present were the regional director, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt,</inline> another officer, myself, my private secretary and a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Milte.</inline> There was one or maybe more Commonwealth police officers present who were normally on the premises. They were not part of any proceedings or conversations. I think they were all the people in the building. </para>

Does the Minister recall the scurrilous and damaging disclosures made in this place last year when it was learned that the Liberal-Country Party Government had contemptuously approved the action of planting an informer in the embassy of a friendly nation and had used the information supplied by that informer to sabotage the effective role of that embassy? </para>

            <para>- I suppose they were let in by the Commonwealth police officer who was there. Frankly, I do not know, but I assume that this would be the appropriate procedure. I am not sure how many Commonwealth police officers are on duty in the building. The person who would give the direction would be the officer in charge of the Victorian division of the Commonwealth Police. Ultimately, police officers act on the instructions which are given to them. </para>

I told the Senate, as to a- number of the other matters, that I intended to make a full report to it about the structure and operations of ASIO. I have answered a great number of questions on this subject. I trust that honourable senators are not attempting to divert the Senate and others from the statement on the Croats and terrorism and the performance of the previous Government in this matter. </para>

            <para>- Order! I shall answer the question.  I  received a letter this morning from the Leader of the Government in the Senate asking that the normal broadcasting day for the Senate be changed from Wednesday to Tuesday.  I  then convened, with the agreement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> in another place, a meeting of the Joint Statutory Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. At that meeting we proceeded to elect a  Chairman,  and  I  take advantage of this occasion to make the announcement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> was elected  Chairman  of the Committee. The matter was discussed and a decision was made to transfer the day for broadcasting. Having said that,  I  wish to state that this morning  I  examined this whole matter of questions. Until 26th September 1967 it had been the practice of the Senate that when the Minister in charge wanted questions without notice to be concluded he asked, without proposing any motion, that further questions be placed on the notice paper. Upon his making such a request the  President  then proceeded to deal with questions upon notice or the next business as the case may be. This practice was based upon the well established rule of procedure that there is no obligation upon a Minister to answer questions. In other words, it is entirely discretionary with Ministers as to whether or not they answer questions. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On 26th September 1967 a Minister, inadvertently I think - my recollection of this is quite clear - took the unusual course of moving that further questions be placed on the notice paper. The  President  intervened and stated that it was the practice of the Senate that a Minister had the right to ask that further questions be placed on the notice paper without proposing a motion. Objection was taken and the matter was resolved when the motion was moved by an Opposition senator, and agreed to, that questions without notice be proceeded with. Since that time no Minister has attempted to terminate question time as long as honourable senators wished to ask questions.  I  might add that the duration of question time has increased markedly from about 45 minutes prior to 1967 to 80 minutes at the end of last year, and 110 minutes - that is, an average of nearly 2 hours - during the first weeks of the present session. Notwithstanding the September 1967 proceedings, there is still no obligation upon a Minister to answer questions, and if the Minister in charge asks after a certain time that further questions without notice be placed on the notice paper  I  believe that  I  have no alternative but to call the next business. </para>

With great respect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Presidest,</inline> what you have said should not just disappear as a statement laid down by you.

The Senate then ought to determine the issue for the time being.  I  am terribly conscious of the fact that what happens with respect to one Senate cannot bind the next and that the Senate is always mast of his own place.  I  can say only that  I  am one of those who prefer to work by the Standing Orders and to use Senate practice only as a guide and not as something which is occasionally used to override or almost divert one&#39;s attention from the Standing Orders.

I think he very properly raised the question that this matter should be debated and considered by the Senate. I think that is a view which would commend itself to all honourable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> moved a motion to the effect that the Senate take note of your statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> The motion was then put by you without further debate.

No</inline> opportunity was given for debate on that statement. I understand that you are now about to proceed to the calling of questions on notice. I have a number of questions which I have been painstakingly waiting for 12 days to ask. I feel that the Senate should be a forum in which the representatives of the people can ask questions. Even if Ministers are not prepared to answer those questions, at least we should be given the opportunity of asking them. I raise the point, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> we should still be dealing with questions without notice until you direct that no further questions without notice may be, asked. If that situation arose the Senate could then determine what its course of action would be. I have risen on a point of order to ask a further question without notice. </para>

              <para>- I wish to speak to the point of order. It seems, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that you made a statement in which you gave a ruling. The Leader of the Opposition moved that the Senate take note of your statement. That motion was adopted by the Senate when it was put to the vote. It seemed reasonable to us on this side of the chamber that it be carried. We did not object to that and your statement has been dealt with by the Senate. With respect, it seems that not only have you stated what the position is but also honourable senators have endorsed the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition, and therefore we should proceed to questions on notice. </para>

I suppose confession is good for the soul but evidently the Attorney-General does not wish to indulge in it in relation to his own activities. I did expect that what I had said regarding your statement would be debated further. I now realise that I should have asked for leave to continue my remarks if some other honourable senator had not taken the adjournment. </para>

I will reactivate this question by giving notice of motion so that this matter will not pass unnoticed by the Senate and so that the rights and privileges of honourable senators will not be taken from them. It will be more than interesting at that stage to see what attitude is taken to that motion by the great parliamentarians who now sit opposite.

The  President  of the Senate is appointed to hold that position in order to uphold the orders and laws of the Senate, which are the Standing Orders, and the practices which have been accepted. It is on that basis that I made the ruling which I made. Therefore I do not face with any terror any motion of dissent that may be forecast. </para>

            <para>- Order! AU I am saying is that this morning I anticipated that during this day matters would arise which would concern honourable senators. Several matters crossed my mind. Naturally, as  President,  one of the matters which crossed my mind was question time. This morning I spent some time with the Clerks of the Senate investigating all aspects of questions and the control that could be exerted over them. I, personally, am not in any way depriving honourable senators of the right to ask questions. I am merely saying that it is my opinion that the ruling which I have given and which is based on a practice which has existed for a great number of years is correct. I am not prepared to throw a practice overboard unless I am directed to do so by the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has mentioned that he will give notice on a subsequent occasion to move to see that this matter is put in another light. It is the right of the honourable senator to do so and I do not shrink from that. </para>

The Senate now having apparently finished with the matter of the Attorney-General&#39;s statement, I ask why the Senate is being broadcast this day. </para>

              <para>- Honourable senators will recall that I mentioned earlier that a request was made to me quite properly by the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether it was possible to change the day for broadcasting to Tuesday. Senate proceedings are normally broadcast on Wednesday. I replied that this matter lies within the total province of the Joint Statutory Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. The Committee met this morning under the chairmanship, ultimately, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker. Senator O&#39;Bryne</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> were there as representatives of the Senate. After considered debate it was decided by the Committee that it should accede to the wish of the Leader of the Government in the Senate and change the day for the broadcasting of the Senate from Wednesday to Tuesday. This decision was based on a precedent. On the occasion of the resignation of the then Prime Minister, the right honourable J. G. Gorton, the Senate, holding the right to broadcast on Wednesday, was asked whether it would allow the broadcast of proceedings to be transferred from the Senate to the House of Representatives. It was the wish of the Committee that permission should be granted for this broadcasting change to take place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> I add for your personal information that neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> nor myself voted on the question. </para>

In the context in which he put it, violence would be anticipated against the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia. I think it is most unfortunate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> in any way sought to put together what he did in a question in the Senate. The best I can say about what the honourable senator has just now put is that he has gravely misunderstood what he ought to have had clear. At no stage whatever have I accepted remarks which have been made by him or anyone else which are in any way disparaging of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">It gives me great pleasure to move this motion. The service that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> has rendered to good government through his membership and chairmanship of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee is a service that demands acknowledgment by the Parliament.  His  unflagging dedication to what must often have been an onerous task has been and will remain an example to all of us who serve in this place. The new  Chairman  of the Committee faces an unenviable task in having to follow in the footsteps of such a hard working and determined predecessor. </para>
          <para>All of us here are well aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood&#39;s</inline> devotion to the responsibilities he has as an elected representative of the Australian people. On occasions, largely as a result of the admirable independence he has shown, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> has been described as a maverick and even a rebel. It is not for me here today to judge whether or not these descriptions apply or whether, if they do, they are inappropriate. What we do know without any shadow of a doubt is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> is a man who has, throughout his lengthy parliamentary career and his service on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, been thoroughly committed to the traditional principles of parliamentary representation. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>primary concern has always been that the rights of individual Australians be upheld through their elected represenatives, such as himself, working through the institutions of the Parliament of Australia. In this regard his unswerving commitment to this fine principle has probably been unsurpassed.  His  role and reputation as  Chairman  of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has spread far beyond this country.  His  particular expertise is recognised by parliamentary institutions in a number of countries. The British Parliament, for example, asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood&#39;s</inline> advice on how it could best make a committee like our own Regulations and Ordinances Committee work. This is an appropriate commendation of a man who has made it his personal responsibility to ensure the proper workings of the Committee. The Parliament owes much to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for his contribution since 1950 and especially since he became the Committee&#39;s  Chairman  in 1953. </para>
          <para>An excellent example of the principles which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> applied to his role was his Committee&#39;s disallowance of a regulation giving retrospective agreement to payments of $8,000 and more to flight crew officers. In explanation, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> made his priorities clear. He said that the regulations concerned had violated the principles of parliamentary control of expenditure. He added: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Not only, has the Parliament been denied the right to approve or disapprove all expenditures; public moneys have been expended by the Minister with no authority either explicit or implicit. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is the kind of action and attitude for which the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> as  Chairman  of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee will be remembered. At times his high principles may have brought him rebukes from his former governmental colleagues and his party, but he held fast to what he saw as his duty. For this he deserves nothing but the highest praise. </para>
          <para>When I came to this Parliament I did so with a knowledge already of what had been achieved by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood.</inline> That body and his work have become known throughout the English speaking world for the way in which a parliamentary committee has carried out the supervision of delegated legislation. Some years ago there was a fear that regulation making might get out of hand and it was important that there be proper management of this by the Parliament. I noted, even before I came here, that in the journals on public law the work of this Committee under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> had been described as the most effective work of any body in the parliamentary system. Recognition of that work is to be found in learned journals and also in the fact that visits have been made to Australia by distinguished visitors to see how the Committee worked and what made it work. What made it work obviously has been the dedication of the members of the Committee and particularly of its  Chairman. </para>
          <para>I think that each time the work of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has been raised in the Senate it has drawn special praise not only from the Government but from all honourable senators. During the period when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> was the  Chairman  it was one of the most successful examples of the operation of the Parliament. It is through the committees that the Parliament is able to work effectively. Debates in this chamber are important. So are the committees. Committees cannot work unless their members are devoted persons. This is especially so of the  chairman.  The Senate is indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for what he has done over the years. He has brought credit not only to the Committee and to himself but to the Senate and to the Parliament for his achievements. On behalf of the Government and, I think, of the Senate, I thank him. I ask the Senate to join with me in placing upon record this appreciation of what is, I think, an absolutely unprecedented length of .service on a committee.  His  service has been not merely a lengthy service but an outstanding and unprecedented service in the interests of the nation. </para>

            <para>-  The Opposition wishes to be associated with tha remarks made and the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy. Senator Wood</inline> is, of course, well known to us on this side. Both my <inline font-weight="bold">deputy Senator Greenwood</inline> and myself were blooded on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I think many other senators on this side were also blooded - I use that term in its correct sense - under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood&#39;s</inline> chairmanship. Perhaps it was there that we learnt that occasionally one should stay with principle and not with one&#39;s Party. Most of us who sat under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood&#39;s</inline> jurisdiction took a leaf out of his book at one time or another. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> has said, 20 years is a long time. I believe that length of service is not as important as quality of service. lt is the quality of service which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Wood brought to the position of  chairman  to which we pay tribute tonight. The quality of service was just not in the fact that he was a good and active  chairman  and that he enjoyed his work; the quality of service resided more in the fact that he had the courage to face his colleagues in government, to disagree with them and to come into this place and vote according to his conscience. No higher tribute could be paid to any senator. </para>
          <para>Now that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> occupies the chair which was occupied so distinguishedly by his predecessor, this is one of the challenges which he must pick up. We on this side have never been caucused, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> would not have been caucused even if we had been caucused. I think that is terribly important. If this Committee has had the standing which we claim that it has had it has had that standing because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> has always said: &#39;This Committee is above Party politics. Its decisions must be arrived at on the correct principles&#39;. That is what made the quality of his work so important. It was principle above party politics. I think it is for the incoming Committee to stay with the challenge which has been carried so ably for 20 years by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood.</inline> It is for that that the Opposition thanks him and wishes him well. </para>

            <para>- I support the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and endorsed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> on behalf of the Opposition. I endorse fully the sentiments which both honourable senators have expressed. I would like briefly in my own way to pay my own tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood.</inline> I have had the privilege and pleasure of serving on 2 committees of this Parliament with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> since I came here approximately 8 years ago, and on every instance on which I had the privilege of sitting with him on those committees I had occasion to appreciate sincerely the guidance and good judgment which he brought to bear upon their deliberations. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This is a most significant time in the history of this very important Senate committee, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. Perhaps I should put the record straight. The association of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> with this Committee is of a duration of 23 years or thereabouts. In fact it slightly exceeds 23 years because he first became a member in February 1950. He acceded to the office of  Chairman  in 1953. I think it was a very great tribute to him that his colleagues saw fit to return him as  Chairman  of that Committee for an unbroken period of 20 years. I think it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the occasion might arise in the next 2 years when we can once again pay tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for having achieved the very rare distinction, which it would then be surely, of having had a continuous active association with this Committee for something in the vicinity of a quarter of a century. </para>
          <para>I realise only too well the weighty task which I assume on acceding to the important office of  Chairman  of this Committee. I do not hope to emulate the time of service of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> on this Committee; I think that would be expecting too much. What I will try to do throughout the course of my chairmanship of it, with the help of my colleagues on the Committee from time to time, is to emulate the standard of work and performance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood,</inline> the dignity which he brought to the office of  Chairman  of the Committee, and the manner in which he was able to extract from every member of it their very best on all occasions. I had the privilege - I appreciated it very much indeed - on the occasion of the initial meeting of the Committee a few days ago to pay tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> on behalf of those who were assembled there as current members of it and to indicate to him that I felt certain that the sentiments I was then expressing would be the sentiments of all those who have been distinguished members of the Committee in past years. I am very grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for his kind consideration of all the issues raised since I have been on the Committee. I think that as <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman Senator Wood</inline> brought great credit to a very creditable and most outstanding Committee of this Parliament. I sincerely hope that it will be within my capacity to attempt at least to emulate the level of performance and wonderful service which he has given to the Committee and to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I speak on behalf of the Democratic Labor Party and, in particular, on my own behalf. The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances congratulates <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> on the work he has done and the contribution he has made to the functioning of Parliament as a member and  Chairman  of the Committee. I pay this tribute to him, I being, in this chamber, perhaps apart from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> the one who at the earliest time was associated with him on that Committee. I have been a member of it, except for some years, since I think 1951. The Committee, by its nature, really is a professional committee. It is one on which a number of legally qualified gentlemen sit, and it is one before which legal problems come up for constant attention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> is not a lawyer, but in spite of that he always enjoyed the respect of all members of the Committee. Those who had professional qualifications brought their particular professional skill to it and operated under a lay  chairman.  They respected his judgment and they respected his acceptance of their professional advice. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline>is one member of this chamber who has a particularly high regard for the parliamentary institution. I do not know whether this is as a result of his work on the Committee or whether his dedication to the Committee is as a result of his interest in Parliament and in its proper functioning, but certainly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> is essentially a parliamentary man. That, I think, is reflected in the work he did on this Committee which essentially is in the interests of Parliament and in the interests of the parliamentary proceedings. On behalf of the Democratic Labor Party I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for the work he did on this Committee for this Parliament. It was a long term, it was a fruitful term, and it was a term that will be remembered always in the records of the Parliament and in the recollections of those who had the privilege of serving with him and of knowing of his work on this Committee. </para>

            <para>-  I wish to associate the members of the Australian Country Party with the tributes that have been paid by previous speakers to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for his 20 years service on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I cannot go back as far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> - to 1952  -  but I can go back to 1958 when, as a new member of this Parliament, I together with the  Deputy  Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee),</inline> was a member of the Committee. I well recall the assistance, encouragement and advice I received at that time from the  Chairman  of the Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood. Senator Webster,</inline> who served on the Committee for 3 years, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie,</inline> who served on it for 6 years, join me in paying this tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> and in wishing &#39; him well in the years to come. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I think you also served on the Committee. I couple your name with the remarks I have expressed in appreciation of the service performed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood.</inline></para>

            <para>-  I think most of what could be said about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> has already been said. I do not want to reiterate what has been said; I just want to lend my name to the remarks that have been made about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood&#39;s</inline> chairmanship of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I spent many years on that Committee, lt is not without some regret that fate and the electors of Australia have decided that I should not serve for an extended period on the Committee. I did appreciate the guidance and the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> during the time 1 was a member of the Committee. My impression of him as an individual was that he had such an obsession for the purity of the decisions of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee that nothing deterred him from performing his duty. He took away from the Committee the whole question of party politics and repeatedly expressed the view that issues should not be decided on party political lines. During the long term of my membership of the Committee I found it rare for its votes not to be either unanimous or almost unanimous. Whenever the Committee made a decision that was contrary to the policy of the Government at the time, Ian Wood never faltered in supporting the decision of the Committee as against supporting any other consideration of this House. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Because of its control and supervision of regulations and ordinances the Committee was feared by the Government. That was because it was known that a recommendation of the Committee would be carried in the Senate. That fear resulted in very few motions for the disallowance of ordinances and regulations being brought down in the Senate. Because it was well known that the Committee desired regulations and ordinances to comply with certain criteria, departments and Ministers would, at the request of the Committee, amend many regulations and ordinances or make satisfactory arrangements to meet the criteria laid down. I think the stage has been reached where this Committee is now working satisfactorily in conjunction with the&#39; Government and the Parliament. I think that is due to nothing else but the chairmanship of Ian Wood, who has taken the bitterness out of party politics. He has now retired from the position of  Chairman  of the Committee. I would like to express to him my appreciation for the years I served on the Committee under him. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to prolong the discussion of this matter unduly, but I would like to say, as one who has been a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee for over 3 years now, that I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> has made a memorable contribution to parliamentary government in this country. The Committee of which he was  Chairman  for so long is probably the most important committee of this Parliament. The role which it performs is a role which is essential to parliamentary democratic government. The role of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee is to see that no arbitrary action is taken by the Executive, whichever government may be in office, and that matters of substantive law may be imposed upon the people of Australia only by proper forms which provide for legislation by decision of the whole of the Parliament, except in very rare instances where authority is given to the Executive so to act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> has approached this question as a parliamentarian and as one who believes in the authority of Parliament, which ultimately is the authority of the people. For that reason, I believe he has made a major contribution to democracy in this country. He has approached every question with complete objectivity. Every issue which has come before the Committee he has looked at as someone who has been appointed to uphold the authority of Parliament, to uphold the authority of the democratic system and to oppose the arbitrary exercise of Executive power. For doing this, I think his name is one which should be long remembered in the history of this country. </para>

            <para>- It is very rarely that I get up to make a congratulatory speech. In fact, this is only the second occasion on which I have done so. I do so only when I think the person concerned deserves it. I cannot give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> any higher praise than that. The only other person about whom I have spoken in this way was the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford.</inline> Not only does Australia owe a lot to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood;</inline> I also owe him a lot. I can remember the reason why I became a mem ber of this chamber. It was because of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood&#39;s</inline> attitude towards the government of the day. He was right in opposing its views on the economy. I can remember many honourable senators who sat on his side of the chamber ostracising him, sending him to Coventry, because he was prepared to stick up for what he believed to be right and voted accordingly. There were other honourable senators in this chamber who sat near him who said they were going to vote against the government of the day but who never did so when the crunch came. I admired <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for doing that. I have always admired him for his independence. He should be sitting in this corner of the chamber with the 3 Independents and not where he is sitting at present. 1 have never been a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Until recently Independent senators were not appointed to committees. But I soon realised from sitting in this chamber that whenever <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> said a regulation should be disallowed he was advocating the correct procedure. 1 have never known him to be wrong, I must pay him a tribute for that. I think that not only the political parties - the Australian Country Party, the Australian Democratic Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia and so on - but also the whole of Australia owes a great debt of gratitude to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for the independent attitude he adopted as  Chairman  of the Committee, for what he has done and for the troubles he has had to suffer at the hands of, especially, his so-called friends because he has been independent. I wish to thank him for what he had done. </para>

            <para>- I wish to express a few words of tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for what he has done over many years for the Parliament of Australia. I believe that I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for longer than anyone in this chamber. I do not know whether we have ever had a cross word to say between us. If we have, we have been able to make up our differences afterwards. I would like to pay a personal tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> for the work he has done on behalf of the people of Australia. I know of the difficulties he has experienced at times. I can readily recall that on at least 2 occasions there were moves afoot that he not be endorsed by his party for the Senate team. On each occasion the people of Queensland, particularly the people of northern Queensland, rallied to his support. Consequently he won endorsement. I pay <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> the compliment of saying that I would regard him as the most difficult political opponent in Queensland to defeat in the history of the Senate. I wish to thank him very much for the work he has done on behalf of the people of Australia. </para>

I take it as a very great honour that the Senate should pass this motion of appreciation, because in my long term in the Senate such a motion has not often been moved. I am deeply conscious of the tributes that have been paid. Many of the honourable senators who paid those tributes served with me on the Senate Standing </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. It is wonderful to know that they still retain for me the feeling that apparently they had when they were serving on that Committee. </para>
          <para>The great work that has been achieved by the Committee - I believe that it has achieved great work - has been due not to me alone. In a very great measure it has been due to the members who comprised the Committee during each Parliament. As I look around this chamber I see many honourable senators - many of them have spoken tonight - who served on the Committee. Many of them have taken up higher positions in this Parliament. In fact, as I look across the chamber to the Government side I think of 4 Ministers in the present Government who served on the Committee. I just cannot recall all the other Ministers who have served on the Committee. Several honourable senators who were Ministers in the previous Government served on the Committee. This goes to show that the quality of members who comprised that Committee was very high. </para>
          <para>One can recall many incidents that occurred over the years in which various senators played their part. I hold very dear in my heart and mind the great work which many of them contributed and the wonderful association that I have had with them. The honourable senators to whom I refer will know that I am thinking of them. Over the years various incidents took place which were high-water marks in the work of the Committee. When I first came to Canberra from north Queensland, which is so far removed from the Parliament, I found that I had been appointed as a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. In my ignorance 1 said to the then Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> - now Chief Justice Spicer - &#39;What on earth have they put me on this committee for? I though that I would be placed on a committee which dealt with the Library or other things in which I have been interested.&#39; I well recall his saying to me: 1 am surprised to bear you speaking like that, Ian, because we thought we were paying you a compliment by putting you on that Committee.&#39; With those words I began to think about it and then I became interested in the work of the Committee as one of its members. </para>
          <para>After I was elected as  Chairman  the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rex</inline> Pearson asked one of the gentlemen who helped to write the Constitution what were the actual aims of the Committee. He said that the Committee was a most important committee of the Parliament. </para>
          <para>Because of the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> and others, I realised the importance of the Committee and I concentrated as much as possible on its work. Over the years I became intensely interested in it. Those honourable senators who had to fight with me earlier on that Committee will remember that the Government of the day, of which I was a supporter, almost always put up a resistance to our recommendations. Fortunately the Senate held firmly to the majority of our recommendations and so we were able to carry the day. Eventually it appeared to the Government that it was necessary to recognise that the Committee was doing parliamentary work and the Government gave way. With the loyalty of the Committee members we managed to establish in the minds of the Government and this Senate that the Committee was not a party political committee but a parliamentary one. </para>
          <para>I was delighted to hear so many honourable senators speaking about keeping the work of the Committee, above party politics. 1 was very glad to hear Government senators speaking along those lines. Having spoken to the Attorney-General, the  Chairman  of the Committee and some of the other members, I am quite satisfied that the Committee as at present comprised has great ability and that its members will continue on the very high plane on which the Committee has operated in the past on a non-party basis. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline>recalled as a matter of great pride in the Committee&#39;s work that only a year or so ago the British House of Commons Committee wrote to us and asked us to set up a complete charter of the type of work which it should carry out. For the mother of all Parliaments to make such a request was a real compliment because most other parliaments write to the British Parliament for advice. I got my Committee together and we framed what we thought was a very comprehensive policy for that Committee to pursue. It was pleasing to note that the Secretary of the British House of Commons Committee reported that that Committee had decided to accept our recommendations. That was a very fine tribute to our Committee which, I understand, is considered in parliamentary circles outside this country to be one of very great value. </para>
          <para>I accept and appreciate very greatly the wonderful sentiments which have been expressed here tonight and which have touched me deeply. I accept those sentiments and the vote of appreciation of the Senate as a great honour, but in doing so it is very clear in my heart and mind that a great number of honourable senators assisted me by the wonderful work they have done. Some of them, particularly those with legal knowledge, have been very valuable members indeed. I sincerely hope that these tributes paid tonight will establish in the minds of honourable senators more than ever the necessity for this Committee to carry on as it has done, at least in recent years, on a non-party basis as a truly parliamentary committee. I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President, Senator Murphy,</inline> the Leader of my own Party, the Leaders of the other parties and honourable senators generally. I am very deeply conscious of this great honour and I most sincerely appreciate it. </para>

            <para>- I rise in accordance with the Standing Orders of the Senate which allow me to speak to the motion for the first reading of a Bill which the Senate may not amend. I do so because the Standing Orders permit me to deal with matters relevant and non-relevant to the issues which are raised by the Bill itself. I desire to speak about the conduct of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy),</inline> the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and the Government of the day because, over a period of some 12 days, the people of Australia have been denied information about unprecedented events which occurred in this country. I refer, of course, to the situation in which the Attorney-General, accompanied by Commonwealth police officers, went in the middle of the night to the Canberra regional office of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and on the following day, accompanied by some 30 police, attended the headquarters of the ASIO and, according to Press reports, herded the staff into a holding area and held them there until the Attorney-General said that they could go free. As he has admitted today, the safes were sealed to preserve information from some unknown, unidentified person. The public of Australia have seen the ridiculous farce of an Attorney-General unable to obtain information in any way except by the strong arm tactic of taking his police force into the offices of one of the statutory bodies for which he is responsible. </para>

          <para>At the time this occurred it aroused concern throughout Australia. From the objective chairs in which the editorial writers of the newspapers sit, concern was expressed and questions were asked as to why this had occurred. On the Friday of the week in which this occurred the Attorney-General was reported at lunch time as saying that he was not prepared to make any statement. But I suspect that it was the pressure which developed throughout the afternoon which led him to make a short and uninformative statement on the night of 16th March. How informative was it? It was a statement which simply said that the Attorney-General had visited - a nice euphemism - the offices of ASIO; that he had had discussions - again a nice euphemism - with the Director-General of ASIO, and that he had inspected files. Then the AttorneyGeneral proceeded to smear the past Government with totally unfounded and unwarranted accusations, and he sought to obscure the issue by saying that it was necessary to take stringent precautions for the protection of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia. </para>
          <para>Day after day the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden,</inline> the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> I myself from my position in this chamber, the Leader of the Australian Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> and other members of the Parliament asked for an explanation as to why this was done. But there was not a word from the Prime Minister; not a word from the Attorney-General. Day after day editorials in newspapers indicated concern and expressed the desire that the AttorneyGeneral should at least explain why he did this. But still there was nothing forthcoming. Why should there be a refusal to give any information whatsoever as to why these events had occurred, particularly from a Government which was elected on its pledge that it would provide open government? Of course, in the absence of any information there was a great deal of speculation, speculation which was fed to the newspapers so that day after day we read: &#39;It is believed&#39;, &#39;Government sources say&#39; and &#39;It is reliably reported&#39;. </para>
          <para>The character of the Director-General of ASIO was taken away because no statement was made by the Attorney-General who is responsible for him in this Parliament. One word from the Attorney-General could have retrieved the reputation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbour.</inline> It could have been retrieved because today at question time the Attorney-General was asked whether at any time the regional director of ASIO in Canberra or the Director-General of Security had ever refused to make information available to the Attorney-General for which he had asked. The answer came from the Attorney-General: No. Yet day after day we have assumed from newspaper reports that in some way the Director-General of ASIO was at fault. I believe it is absolutely unpardonable conduct for an Attorney-General to allow a senior representative of this country who holds a national position to have his character smeared in that way when, by one statement, it could have been retrieved. </para>
          <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Prowse)</inline> - Order! My attention has been drawn to the standing order under which, although an honourable senator is permitted on the motion for the first reading of a money Bill to discuss a wide range of matters, he is not permitted to discuss matters which are before the Senate in the form of a notice of motion. Therefore I suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> that you do not continue to debate the subject which you are now debating. </para>

              <para>- I am not aware of any notice of motion the debate upon which is being transgressed by what I am saying. Today a statement was put down in this place. If I were debating that statement which, of course, is an order of the day for the next day of sitting then, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I might be subject to your strictures. But I am not debating that motion, nor am I debating that order of the day because there was absolutely nothing in the statement which the Attorney-General put down today which gave any reasons why this unprecedented raid on ASIO took place. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I invite your attention and that of the Clerks who advise you to the statement which was put down. I ask you to point to any area of that statement which refers to the raids which took place and why they took place. It is that point which has caused me to rise tonight. I think it is an abuse of parliamentary office for the Attorney-General to refuse to say anything for 12 days, giving the impression that when Parliament sat he would say something, yet when the Parliament sits and when questions are asked evasive answers are given and the opportunity is taken to refuse to answer any more questions. </para>

              <para>- Would you be quiet for a few minutes? If you cannot add anything to the dignity of this place, please let someone else try to do so. Very obviously <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is dealing and has dealt exclusively with the things that surround the whole question of the statement presented this afternoon, which was the subject of questions ad nauseum all afternoon. You would be placed in an impossible position, as would any other  chairman,  if you were asked to say that the exact words or sentences used by an honourable senator were not in the statement. It is very clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is canvassing and making an attack on the whole question of things associated with that statement. There will be plenty of opportunity to debate the statement in time to come and therefore this is just a way of getting around your ruling. Your ruling, as he said, is absolutely correct - there is no doubt about it. If you are not going to have order in this place, you will downgrade the parliamentary system. I suggest that you make our ruling quite clear that not only the statement but all those other things adverting to it cannot be referred to. </para>

              <para>- I wish to speak to the point of order. Your ruling is one with which we all agree. It is obvious that everyone agrees that if a matter is before the chamber there is no right to debate it. The question is one of interpretation of what is the subject matter before the chamber. The matter before the chamber is a statement which was read to the Senate today, and there is a motion on the business paper for the Senate to take note of the document <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has said that there is nothing in the document relating to the method of visiting the headquarters of ASIO. However, if we look at the whole document we see that it cites papers which were obtained at ASIO. The whole document refers to the fact that evidence was found as a result of a visit to ASIO. This is the whole thing that can be discussed when we discuss the motion that the Senate take note of the document. Honourable senators may not have 2 vehicles for the purpose of discussing the one motion. Everything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> says tonight - and he thinks he is justified in vindicating himself because the proceedings are being broadcast - can be said when the leaders of the parties are prepared to bring on this notice of motion. For instance, it is stated that the most significant seizure was a report from someone. One can go through the statement that was made today to see that it relates to documents which were taken from ASIO. The discussion tonight is on the method of approaching ASIO. </para>

              <para>- I rise on the point or order. I submit it is transparently plain that the subject matter of the order of the day of the Senate is the ministerial statement on Croatian terrorism. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is using his right to speak according to the standing orders on an entirely different subject - the abuse made by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> of his ministerial position in relation to ASIO. It is only a coincidence that that abuse might have been the means, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> seems now to confess, of giving rise to all these Murphy-furphies in the Croatian statement. That does not deny the difference between the subject matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> speech - the abuse of ASIO - and the subject matter of the ministerial speech on Croatian terrorism. </para>

If one set out to prepare a document to cover this subject and to exclude any reference to the ASIO raid it could not have been done more effectively.

I can find quite sufficient to talk about without referring to the statement. What I am concerned about is the fact that no statement has been made about the circumstances of the raid on ASIO offices or the reasons for it. I am even more concerned that in the intervening period a pernicious campaign of smearing and attributing of blame and fault to people has been developed through, in some way, handouts to the Press which have led to headlines for a week to 10 days. I am also concerned that the public were told that when the Parliament resumed on 27th March - that is today - a statement would be made which everybody assumed would give the reasons for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> unprecedented actions. </para>

It hurts them to be accused and that the record should justify the accusation that they are shutting out inquiries about why one of the Government&#39;s Ministers behaved in the way that he did.

The Canberra Times&#39; said: &#39;ASIO&#39;s powers to be stripped&#39;. The &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39; said: &#39;ASIO head certain to be sacked&#39;.

The Brisbane &#39;CourierMail&#39; said: &#39;Move for top spy to quit&#39;. On 19th March the &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39; said: &#39;Government to curb ASIO&#39;. On 20th March the Melbourne &#39;Age&#39; said: &#39;Backing from PM - support for Murphy on ASIO likely&#39;. Those headlines illustrate the material being fed to the Australian people over the course of the week. Who has fed out this material? It was not done by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> No, he has kept a discreet silence because if he said anything openly he might have been subject to questions, although goodness knows how one would get an answer from him. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> appreciated that if he said anything he might be expected to provide answers.

The result is that there is scarcely a Croatian in this country who can go around as he wishes, although he believed this to be a free country in which he would be treated as the equal of his colleagues. How many examples have we all heard of Croatian children who have been smeared and regarded as terrorists and have had nasty questions asked of them at school? Yet this is the result of the actions of a Government which said it came into office to unite and not to divide. </para>

              <para>- I rise to a point of order. It would be hard to imagine a clearer breach of standing orders than the last few sentences spoken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> They highlight the other points of order that have been taken by honourable senators on this side of the chamber. It is clear that it is impossible to discuss the subject which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> purports to be discussing without discussing a matter which is on the notice paper and which involves infringement of standing order 419. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> does not find it possible. With every second sentence he gets back on to the question of Croatian extremism. I submit that the question which he purports to be discussing - that is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> visit to the ASIO offices - and the question which was the subject of a debate here today are so inextricably interwoven that it is impossible to speak of one without speaking of the other. The best possible illustration of that is in the last 2 sentences we have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> It is impossible for him to discuss the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> in visiting the ASIO offices without discussing a subject which is on the notice paper, which brings him in breach of standing order 419. For that reason, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I submit that your earlier ruling was correct and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is hopelessly out of order in this discussion. </para>

              <para>- I acknowledge and apologise for the fact that in developing my case I trangressed your ruling <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President.</inline> I had not intended to do so. I do not want to take it very much further because the real point I am concerned about is the failure to answer questions of public moment, the refusal to allow Opposition senators to ask questions, and the use of the forms of the Senate to change the broadcast of the Senate proceedings from one day to another in order to prevent the clearest possible airing of the points Opposition senators are making, not just for themselves but for the people of Australia. In the last week there has hardly been an editorial which has not raised questions that remain unanswered. For example, the Melbourne &#39;Age&#39; wants to know why these disturbing events took place. It wants to know why it was necessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to take such spectacular and public action to obtain the files of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbour.</inline> The &#39;Age&#39; wants to know what legal basis there was for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> action which bore a very strong resemblance to a raid. The onus is now on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to explain what he did and why he did it, according to the &#39;Age&#39;. It goes on to say that he must take the first opportunity to do so and show that ASIO was withholding facts which were of potential value in ensuring the safety of the community. The point is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> today said categorically, and I repeat it, that ASIO was not withholding facts. If he concedes that ASIO was not withholding facts then I think that all the quest tions which the newspapers have been asking become all the more pertinent. If ASIO was not withholding facts, why did he have to go in the middle of the night and raid the Canberra office? Why did he have to send all those police to the ASIO headquarters in Melbourne? Let it be known that these are questions which the Attorney-General has declined to answer and by his deliberate act in this place he has refused to answer. </para>

            <para>-  The matters raised by the former AttorneyGeneral, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> in relation to what has transpired in the past  12  days and particularly today are matters, I believe, of great importance not only to the Senate but also to the people of Australia as to whether they do not give rise to real concern for the actions of one man whose assumption of power has been extreme. It has been an extreme assumption of power which he has not been prepared to explain either to honourable senators in answer to their questions or to the people of Australia. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was making his point - I take up from where he left off - why is it that an Attorney-General of Australia should require the Regional Director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to be called to his office in the middle of the night? I remind honourable senators that it happened to be on the night that the Parliament rose for a period of  12  days before it met again. I remind honourable senators that therefore there was no occasion on which honourable senators or members of the House of Representatives would be able to ask questions in relation to what had happened for a period of  12  days. Was that just a coincidence? Is this a matter which requires explanation by the AttorneyGeneral?  I  suggest that it is. Why should it be a coincidence that it happened on that night? Why call the Regional Director of ASIO out of his bed in the middle of the night to answer questions, produce documents or whatever may have been the case? These are inexplicable matters concerning which the Attorney-General refused to answer or evaded answering numerous questions this afternoon. </para>

          <para>We have an extraordinary situation in which for some reason arising out of those discussions or arising out of what happened on that night, there were allegations in the Press that the Regional Director of ASIO had been kept prisoner for  4  or  5  hours or more. We do not know whether that, in fact, happened because we did not get an opportunity to ask adequate questions in relation to it. The giving of answers to those questions that were asked was evaded. But we find, as Sena tor Greenwood has said, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> did admit and state quite categorically and positively that he had not experienced any failure to co-operate on the part of ASIO.

              <para>- Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President.</inline> Certainly, it was not my intention in any way to offend against your ruling. I thought that I was carefully keeping away from the matters which were contained in the statement. I was dealing with the evenf.3 which occurred more than a week ago - during the week before last - in relation to the actions of the Attorney-General in what has been described by the Press as a &#39;raid&#39; upon ASIO, followed by a further raid upon ASIO. I would like to comment that in relation to that the Attorney-General has told us in answers to questions that he received cooperation, but notwithstanding that, he went to ASIO headquarters in Melbourne having sent before him some  27  officers from the Commonwealth Police Force apparently to take possession of the building and certain of the contents of the building and to seal files to preserve them. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Why should the files require preserving? From whom they were being preserved is something we do not know and the AttorneyGeneral will not tell us. What is so secret about all this? Has secrecy gone to the head of the Attorney-General? Is there some aspect of his cops and robbers role of the past  10  days which has brought to him a desire to abdicate completely any idea of assuming the role of the leader of open government and which has caused him rather to assume the role of the leader of closed government? Why should it be necessary to bypass the Australian director of ASIO, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbour?</inline> Why should it be necessary for the Commonwealth Police Force to take possession of the ASIO building in Melbourne rather than simply directing or requesting the director, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbour,</inline> to seal the files? Obviously, he had some reason for not wishing to contact that man. Why is this? No explanation has come from the Attorney-General. There are many questions which require urgent answers. This country was refused a request made properly by the Australian Democratic Labor Party for the Parliament to be called together urgently to be informed as to why these extraordinary actions were being taken. They are actions unprecedented in the history of Australia since the Eureka Stockade. I am glad that that remark has brought forward from Government supporters who are. interjecting a reawakening of their conscience in relation to this matter. No doubt, they will be able to see the significance of the sorts of points that I make - &#39;that when power is used in a manner which is irresponsible and arrogant then it brings forth a resistance which is right and proper in circumstances in which people question and argue as to whether that power should be used in that way. Presumably, we will find the Attorney-General now turning on his former compatriots who organised violent demonstrations. </para>

              <para>- Yes, I do. We will find him turning on his former compatriots who organised violent demonstrations during the period of the Moratorium campaign, during the period of the violence which was associated with the visit of  President  Johnson to Australia, during the violence which was associated with various union activities in Australia and during the various other instances of violence which Australia has known in the past 3, 4 or 5 years. Perhaps we will find the Attorney-General sharply rebuking these people and taking action in respect of the declarations by persons such as the very well known leading members of the Australian Labor Party who advocated and organised violence in those circumstances. These are the things which obviously not only are we not permitted to ask questions about but concerning which it is the intention of the supporters of the Government to drown out free speech and prevent me and other members of the Opposition from being heard. Why should not we be entitled to say what we wish to say in the interests of the people of Australia and in the interests of the good government of this country? There are many aspects of the alarm which has spread in this country as a result of the actions of the Attorney-General.

There should be no need to ask those questions because every one in Australia knows exactly why this was done. It was done because of the attitude of the former AttorneyGeneral whose credibility in this chamber is practically nil at the present time. It was because of his actions that the present AttorneyGeneral had to take action to get the information. All this nonsense we hear- </para>

              <para>- I am so pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is going to work on his report because we have been waiting for that report for so long, I had to listen to his trash. If he thinks that I am talking trash, at least he should sit there and take it. Trash for trash, if that is his opinion. We are wondering why the Attorney-General had to do things at midnight. I do not know what is so particularly sinister about midnight. It happened to be a time that suited the people. The whole of Australia knows that the reason why the Attorney-General had to go and interfere with the affairs of ASIO was that ASIO was not doing its job by the Australian people. </para>

              <para>- It is unfortunate for me that I should be speaking at night when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> is awake. Usually he is asleep. This reminds me that I must speak in the afternoon. As far as the pub|ic is concerned ASIO may have done a good job, but it was subservient to the Liberal Government of the day and it did not take into account the interests of Australia; it took into account the interests of the Government. That is obvious from all the facts which have appeared in the newspapers. This is what has happened. If anyone had any right to interfere it was the present Attorney-General because the previous one was so cowardly that he did not interfere, or if he was not too cowardly to interfere in the affairs of ASIO, he should be dismissed from this House as a traitor to this country for allowing this to go on. He knew the facts but he preferred to allow people- </para>

              <para>- I suggest with great respect, that the  Deputy President  has given a ruling which we can expect to be applied consistently during this debate, that is, that the subject matter of the statement which has been called a ministerial statement on Croatian terrorism and which has become an order of the day is not the subject of this debate. The subject of this debate relates to the administration by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> of ASIO. In that respect, I submit that debate has been permitted by a ruling of the Chair with which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and the Senate should comply. </para>

              <para>- I use it quite often because it is the only way in which I get a chance to speak. I would not have spoken in the debate except that I was in my room and I heard on the broadcast system the exAttorneyGeneral refer to the ridiculous farce of the Attorney-General. I thought to myself: This is carrying it a bit too far. Red herrings are being strewn across the path.&#39; This debate would not have taken place tonight except for the ridiculous statement of the exAttorneyGeneral that he did not know what ASIO knew. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I did not refer to the document; I just referred to ASIO. What ASIO knew, the ex-Attorney-General knew. That is the point I was making when I was made to sit down. The ex-Attorney-General knew that there were acts of terrorism, and he said that there were not any. He tried to lull the public into believing that there was no such thing as terrorist actions in Australia, and all the time there were. What is more important - a few Croatians or the Australians who get injured in these bomb accidents, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> called them? Of course everyone, except members of the Liberal Party, know which is the most important. Now we have the tears dropping from the eyes of the Democratic Labor Party and the </para>

              <para>- ASIO overlooked it. I cannot mention it. This makes it awkward. Let us return to the crux of the matter that was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> and that is the raid on ASIO. Everyone in Australia, except the Liberal Party, believes that this raid should have taken place because ASIO did not conform to what it should do. The security services of other countries owe some allegiance to a Minister. ASIO does not owe any allegiance. </para>

The  Deputy President  referred to that standing order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> has made allegations which can come only from the statement and from what he believes from the statement - I leave aside the fact that they are totally untrue insofar as they relate to me - yet he is not reprimanded.

              <para>- I make it quite clear that I was not referring to the statement. I was referring to the facts as they appeared in the &#39;Age&#39; and in the &#39;Australian&#39;. I know that those examples of the media are dear to the heart of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> If that is what appeared in those 2 journals, obviously it must be correct. That is what I am referring to. It has been published. Everyone is aware that these things have been published. So I support the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s action. I think he was quite correct in descending on ASIO. At question time we had to listen to a lot of nonsense about locking the safe. Would honourable senators opposite trust an organisation which did not tell its Minister what was going on in Australia? Of course they would not. </para>

The dreadful thing is that the ex-government was caught in the wrong. It now is trying to attack the present Government not on what was actually found, because the ex-Government knows that it has no leg to stand on, but on how the Government did it. It does not matter how the Government did it. In the interests of Australia, thank God it was done. Thank heavens we found out the position today. I hope that the Attorney-General and his Gov ernment are strong enough to carry on and finish the job. Any people who are found guilty of acts of terrorism should be deported. </para>

            <para>- We have just listened to a speech which confirmed the correctness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull&#39;s</inline> conclusion in one respect and that is, that 3 or 4 weeks ago he gave himself a public certificate of senility warranting the fact that he should not stand again for the Senate. Senility oozes from him in every word he drips. Through the throughtfulness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> at the first opportunity that afforded itself, we are debating a subject that is of high national importance, that is, the position of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in the constitution of this country. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> descended upon the organisation, after arrangements were made for a police force, some 20 or 30 in number, literally to take possession of the organisation&#39;s equipment and to preserve the files. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> has revealed what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> hoped to conceal, namely, that the real reason for that raid was his distrust of the Australian Security Intelligence organisation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull,</inline> in his irresponsibility, came to light with the gorgeous statement that the Organisation would not even tell the Minister what was going on in Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>During questioning this afternoon one explicit answer, one at least, was given by the Attorney-General. The question was: Did the Director-General or his  deputy  ever refuse information requested by the AttorneyGeneral? The answer was no. But, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> the constitutional position of ASIO goes further than that. For good or for ill, in a Parliament in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> is a thoughtless member, the Act of Parliament still stands in a form that obliges not only the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> but also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> to conform. While there is an Act of Parliament on the statute book it is a cardinal rule that Ministers comply with it. This statute says that the organisation - meaning the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation - shall be under the control not of the Minister but of the DirectorGeneral, and in no place in the statute is the Director-General made subject to the direction, the control or the authority of the Minister. The Director-General receives his appointment from the executive government but on terms offered to him and to which he agrees. It is stated specifically in the statute that the appointment of the Director-General shall not be terminated except in accordance with the term of his employment. That security, free of ministerial interference - interference or raid - is deliberately accorded the Organisation. When the statute comes to define the functions of the Organisation it states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The functions of the Organisation are - * * * </para>
            <list type="loweralpha">
              <item label="(b)">
                <para>to advise Ministers, where the Director-General is satisfied that it is necessary or desirable to do so, in respect of matters relevant to security . . . </para>
              </item>
            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Parliament has gone out of its way to make emphatic the situation that the discretion as to whether it is necessary or desirable to advise Ministers is the discretion, not of the Attorney-General but of the Director-General of the Organisation. Here we have a unique inversion of the constitutional position, which Parliament has laid down in those unique terms, invaded by the Attorney-General, not on any basis of default, maladministration or distrust by ASIO, but in a case where the Organisation has never refused the Minister any information requested. But we have an unscheduled visit - a raid - by the AttorneyGeneral with police already in possession of the files and equipment of ASIO. </para>
          <para>If that is not sufficient to stun the conscience of the nation and to make Parliament consider the fitness of the Attorney-General to be in charge of such a delicate body as the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, it is time that we all gave a little attention to the gravity of the matter. It would be an enhancement of the Senate&#39;s level of debating if the clownish contributor to whom we just listened, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull,</inline> would be good enough to spend more than a  30-minute  interrupted appearance in the chamber. I say that the abuse of ASIO was revealed by the facts partially answered during question time today and, we hope, to be more fully extracted as the week goes on. These facts show a dismal abuse of the unique constitutional position of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in Australia, and we al&#93; ought to be obliged to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> for raising this subject on the first opportunity tonight that enabled us to raise it since it could not be fully explored at question time. </para>

            <para>- I  do not wish to engage in the vulgar abuse which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> directed against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> but there are some things which the Senate should deal with in considering the matter raised this evening by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> The matter raised by him this evening undoubtedly was raised in order to deflect attention from other much more serious matters which have come before the chamber, but I think it is very interesting to try to discover precisely what the Opposition is trying to do. What is alleged by members of the Opposition? They allege that late at night - apparently that upsets them; apparently they subscribe to some sort of curfew - the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy),</inline> the principal law officer of the Commonwealth, attended the premises of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, an organisation constituted by Act of this Parliament. It was given a charter by this Parliament; that charter being established by an Act of this Parliament. Section  5  of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act sets out the functions of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and its Director-General. Section  5 (1.)  (c) states specifically that the functions of the Organisation are:   . . to co-operate with such Departments of State and authorities of the Commonwealth and, so far as is practicable, with such Departments and authorities of the States and of other countries as are capable of assisting the Organisation in the performance of its functions. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Its functions are to preserve the security of this country, and the Attorney-General is the Minister of this Government who is empowered to preserve the law and order about which the previous Attorney-General so often spoke and for which so often he showed his contempt. It has been alleged that the Attorney-General visited the offices of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation late at night in company with members of the Commonwealth Police Force - not, it will be noted, in company with members of the Australian Labor Party, in company with members of the Waterside Workers Federation, in company with members of the Communist Party or in company with staff of the Yugoslav Embassy, but in company with members of the Commonwealth Police Force. </para>

              <para>- Yes,  27  members of the Commonwealth Police Force, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> has awakened from his slumbers to advise me. It is rather curious  that  members of the Opposition, who were recently driven from the government because of their attitude towards questions like this and who purport this evening to be defending the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, should show their hatred and contempt for the Commonwealth Police Force by suggesting that there is something improper in the presence of Commonwealth policemen in the offices of ASIO. I would be very interested to learn from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright, Senator Greenwood</inline> and other honourable senators opposite precisely what are the nature of the allegations which they wish to make against those 27 officers of the Commonwealth Police Force. Do they believe that they are people who should not have this information? Are they saying that the people of Australia should not have reliance on the Commonwealth Police Force? That is the only interpretation one can draw from their continual mention of the number of members of the Commonwealth Police Force who were present on this occasion. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>One would have thought, as members of the party of law and order, that the presence of these Commonwealth policemen, on whom they used to rely in order to send to gaol people who would not fight their wars for them in Vietnam, would have delighted them. One would have thought that they would have been delighted that members of the Commonwealth Police Force were present. One would have thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and the party of law and order would have said: &#39;We might have had some doubts about this, but there were 27 members of the Commonwealth Police Force there, so it must have been all right&#39;. But what have they said? How have they established that there was something wrong with what happened? They have said: &#39;It must have been terrible. It must have been crook. There were 27 members of the Commonwealth Police Force there&#39;. That is what we have heard from the party of law and order. </para>
          <para>What are honourable senators opposite alleging? They are alleging that the AttorneyGeneral extracted some information from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. The people whom they appointed to high office in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation  -  I do not criticise them for this; I do not think it should be unlawful to subscribe to the policies of the Liberal Party of Australia - were people whom they knew to be close to the policies of the Liberal Party because they knew that they were the sort of people who would be more interested in prosecuting an 18-year-old who would not go to fight in Vietnam than in prosecuting those people who were attempting by violence to overthrow the government of a country with which this country has diplomatic relations. They are suggesting to us that the Attorney-General of a democratically elected government - a government democratically elected only last December - should not have available to him information in the possession of an office which was allegedly created for the protection of security in this country. That is what they are saying. </para>
          <para>Mention has been made by some of a police state. The mind boggles at the audacity of people who say that there is a police state in existence when a democratically elected Minister knows what the police are doing. Apparently their concept of democracy is having a political police force whose activities are secret to the Attorney-General. Their concept of a democratic, properly run society is one in which those police officers appointed by an outgoing government should not be responsible, should not report and should not be visited by the Attorney-General of the incoming government. That, of course, is the complete reverse of a police state. A police state is a state in which the police or quasi police organisations have authority over the democratically elected government. The reverse of a police state is that society in which democratically elected officials have authority over the police. That is what those people are complaining about. They are complaining about the fact that the AttorneyGeneral of a democratically elected Labor Government should know what the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation is doing. </para>
          <para>Apparently honourable senators opposite are now complaining that the Attorney-General has said nothing critical of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. They are saying: &#39;It is shocking that he went along there and yet he has defended ASIO tonight. He has not said anything against ASIO&#39;. Apparently that surprises them. Apparently their view was that anybody who went into ASIO would have plenty to complain about They are rather astonished that the AttorneyGeneral did not have anything to say about </para>
          <para class="block">ASIO. That has hurt them. What are honourable senators opposite trying to say? Why do they suggest that the Attorney-General should have gone there? This has been implicit in the questions which they have asked this afternoon. What they have been implying but what nobody on this side of the chamber has been implying - with perhaps the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull,</inline> insofar as he can be regarded as being on this side of the chamber, which he is geographically but not in many other respects - is that the AttorneyGeneral would have gone to ASIO only if he had been tipped off that somebody at ASIO was concealing something. </para>
          <para>They are saying that as if it is an indictment of the Attorney-General. By way of complaint they are saying: &#39;You would not have gone there unless you thought you would find something.&#39; What an extraordinary complaint. They are saying: &#39;How badly the Attorney-General has behaved.&#39; They are saying that someone has told the AttorneyGeneral that his law enforcement officers are concealing information from him and that he went to ASIO and got it. What an awful thing to do. What a horrible thing to do. These unfortunate people were safely concealing information and this wretched AttorneyGeneral, relying merely on the vote of over one-half of the people of Australia - that was all he was relying on - goes around there and takes their information from them. Supporters of the Government have not said that. That is what members of the Opposition said. If it is not what they have said, what have they said? What are they complaining about? What are they saying is improper about the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s visit to the offices of ASIO? </para>
          <para>We know very well the reliance which members of right wing panties have placed on ASIO. I do not want to involve the AttorneyGeneral in any of these matters. We have not heard members of the Opposition referring to the article which appeared in the &#39;National Times&#39; a week ago which alleged that a journalist was approached by a Liberal Party member of Parliament and a Country Party member of Parliament, who had been offered ASIO information in order to blackguard members of the Labor Party. Honourable senators opposite have not had anything to say about the case which was reported in this morning&#39;s Press of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sgro,</inline> a member of the Australian Labor Party in Victoria and a member of the Painters Union, who was </para>

              <para>- Yes, the former Attorney-General set himself up as the champion of civil liberties, the man who presided over the administration of a department which repeatedly refused naturalisation to citizens of this country who had never been convicted of any offence. The former Attorney-General refused entry visas to many persons who wanted to come to this country - without any charges being made, without any follow through ever being made and without anyone ever being told why they were not being allowed to come to this country. These were the actions of the previous Government for more than 20 years. Yet tonight its supporters pose here as the champions of civil liberty. </para>

              <para>- I am talking about the present Attorney-General at the moment. What has the Attorney-General tried to do? Apparently he has tried to extract some information from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. He went to its office late at night. Apparently it was too late for some senators opposite, although apparently time does not always worry them, because one remembers that when they were in government they were quite happy to have somebody&#39;s house searched on Christmas Day when they thought a draft-dodger was there. I do not think they ought to be too sensitive about the time at which visits are made to people&#39;s premises. In order to justify the complaint about the Attorney-General&#39;s trying to find out what is going on inside the security organisation of this country we have been treated to a plethora of balderdash. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>We have heard people talking about raids taking place without search warrants. Why does the Attorney-General need a search warrant to go into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation? If he did need a search warrant to go in there, it shows a remarkable lack of competency on the part of the DirectorGeneral that he was not aware of this and did not refuse to hand over the documents. If  a  search warrant were required one would have thought that the Director-General himself would have known about this and would have said: &#39;You cannot have the documents. Where is your search warrant?&#39; But he did not say this because no search warrant was required. Is it to be suggested that if the Minister for Overseas Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> visits the Tariff Board at midnight, or Christmas Day or at any other time he has to take a search warrant with him when he goes there? Is that what honourable senators opposite will say? Will they say that if an honourable senator goes along late to have the tea and scones which are served in such a mediocre fashion in the dining room he has to have a search warrant with him to get into the place? Thu apparently is what honourable senators opposite are suggesting. They have said that private homes were raided without search warrants. Which private houses were raided without search warrants? </para>

If there were some malpractice let us hear about it, because I can assure the Senate that I am no more keen on the Commonwealth Police raiding anybody&#39;s house without a search warrant , than the Liberal Party pretends to be now. Honourable senators opposite were quite happy about the absence of search warrants when they were able to make raids under the Crimes Act in relation to breaches of the National Service Act. I did not hear any objection then about the absence of search warrants. This sudden discovery of search warrants by the Opposition is edifying but somehow unconvincing. </para>

          <para>But all of these matters have been completely spurious. What has happened is that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth has visited the offices of ASIO and there obtained certain information. That is all that has happened. That is the only information that is available. There have .been certain Press reports which have said one thing and then said another, but the only cold hard facts that are known are that the Attorney-General visited the office of ASIO and that the Director-General - the Attorney-General has said this himself - did not conceal from him any information. Nor have we heard any complaint from the Director-General. If the Director-General is  a  man of principle; if it is true, as is either alleged or implied by everybody who has spoken from the opposite side, that there has been some breach of the Act, that the </para>

I know that I certainly would not tolerate such a position if the facts as alleged by the Opposition were proved to be true. But clearly they are not the facts and the Opposition senators do not have one shred of evidence to justify the things they have been saying.

It was the duty of the AttorneyGeneral to examine every possible source of information in his endeavour to ensure not only the safety of visiting dignitaries but also the safety of Australian citizens. If he had any doubts that he was receiving full information it was his duty as Attorney-General to obtain that information as quickly as possible in order to avoid possible bloodshed. Surely we should not allow anyone to condemn a Minister who by his very action produced conclusive proof that his visit was absolutely and completely justified.

            <para>- I do not think it is necessary for me to advert to the nonsense just put before the chamber by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Negus.</inline> There is not a shred of proof, an atom of proof, to confirm what he said. Therefore I do not propose to waste any time in chasing him up blind alleys. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> apparently has been so brainwashed by his recent visit to his friends in Hanoi to give them such aid and comfort as his presence would undoubtedly do that he is quite incapable of understanding the processes in a democratic community. In his cavalier fashion - perhaps I should almost say clownish fashion - he is a little like the gentleman who slaps up windmills which nobody is defending and then knocks them over himself with tremendous gusto. I refer to his statement, that people on this side of the chamber alleged that searches were made of private houses without warrants but had changed their minds about producing the evidence. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a statutory declaration by Franjo Till, an invalid pensioner of 17, 19th Street, Narrabundah, which abundantly will rebut the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon.</inline></para>

            <para class="block">I,  Franjo  Till, invalid pensioner, of 17. 19th Street, Narrabundah, Australian Capital Territory, a naturalized Australian citizen, do solemnly and sincerely declare that at approximately 3.25 a.m. on Sunday morning, 18th March, 1973, a number of plain clothed policemen woke my family and myself by knocking and kicking at the door of my house at the above address. </para>
            <para>They called me by my full name,  Franjo  Till&#39;,  in  such perfect accent that I  thought  they were some of my own Croatian friends. For this reason I opened the door. </para>
            <para>Two men in plain clothes immediately pushed me back into the room, and walked in. There were 4 children, children of a visiting friend, sleeping in that room. </para>
            <para>I asked these men who they were, I asked them to identify themselves. One produced papers showing him to be a Commonwealth Police Officer, by name of &#39;Alfred Meir&#39;. I am positive that the second man, who refused to identify himself, was a Yugoslav police officer, because though he spoke very little to me he pronounced Croatian names and spelt them rapidly in a way which is not possible for one not from my own country. They asked for the names of everyone in the house, and wrote them all down. Including the names of the children. </para>
            <para>The Police tried to make everybody, including the 6 children under the age of 10, to get up. The children were very frightened, and began to cry. </para>
            <para>I asked the Police repeatedly did they have a warrant to come into my house like that, but they said they did not need one, and they did not produce one. </para>
            <para>As there were more than  6  adults in the house, visitors from Melbourne, the Police could not do much in the way of search without putting people out of the house. They did not do this, but they looked through the house thoroughly without touching anything. They left after about15 minutes. They did not at any time tell me why they had forced their way into my house or what they wanted, or by what authority. At no time did they produce a warrant to search my house. Their attitude to myself, my wife, and my guests was very rough and insulting. When they left, I followed them outside, and found that there were more Police waiting outside, in  a  proper marked Police car. </para>
            <para>The next day the Police returned, when my wife was alone in the house. They forced their way into my house again, against my wife&#39;s will to let them in. </para>
            <para class="block">AND I make this solemn declaration by virtue of the Statutory Declarations Act 1959, and subject to the penalties provided by that act for the making of false statements in statutory declarations, conscientiously believing the statements contained in this declaration to be true in every particular. </para>

              <para>-  I have 4 other documents here, all of which rebut the clownish suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> that there is no evidence of a search and entry of private property without warrants. All of this relates to the whipped up pantomime which has been foisted on this country for the past 12 days. This evening we have heard the Tasmanian Devil howling from his corner in the chamber a great deal of drivelling nonsense suggesting that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was indifferent to the welfare ofhis country. </para>

              <para>- He is certainly no longer in the chamber. Of course, solicitude for the country as distinct from solicitude for Sena tor Turnbull is a radical new departure on his part.I do not want to chase him up any blind alleys, either. There are 2 or 3 other matters. The most significant point in the course of this debate has been the sane, cold, calm, judicial expression of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> when he posed the question and pointed out that at question time today <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> admitted that ASIO had never withheld information from him. </para>

              <para>- All I say is that the matter was referred to at question time and my recollection is that the Attorney -General admitted that ASIO had not withheld information from him. The most obvious thing about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> raid on ASIO and the matters related thereto is the complete and absolute absence of any evidence anywhere as to the necessity for it. We had what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> calls a visit, taking along 27 police officers - quite a lot of people to carry a visiting card. After <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> performance at question time this afternoon I think that his credibility must be at the lowest ebb at which it has ever been. </para>

              <para>- Well, 23 all.I speak subject to correction by an expert on that. They want to get rid of ASIO. This pantomime to which the nation has been subjected for the past 12 days is merely an exercise in this process. The sooner we get rid of all the humbug, cut the cackle and come to the real reason for the raid, the better the nation will be served. Apparently all one has to do under the present Administration is to make wild allegations, leak stuff to the Press, radio and television, make melodramatic assertions about one&#39;s own department in Canberra or Melbourne, and one comes up with a legal case which a first year student would be ashamed to put forward and which a simple suburban lawyer would view with absolute horror. I know this is a revolutionary theory but I believe that even members of ASIO have rights. It is the sort of thing which they would not receive from honourable senators opposite. I know it sounds silly but they are devoted servants of this nation. They do not deserve the odium which has been heaped upon them by the AttorneyGeneral to carry his baby for his own ideological shibboleths. </para>

          <para>During the recent raid in Melbourne the Commonwealth police, according to the newspapers - presumably these were inspired leaks - herded approximately 400 people into the auditorium of the ASIO building. Information comes to me from another source that among these people were a large number of terrified young female typists who were weeping and wailing and upset, not knowing what the local version of the Mafia was doing. It is a fact that a number of members of ASIO were denied their personal freedom as a result of the arrival of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> friends on this visit. Admittedly this was for only a short time but the visit was almost probably illegal. I would hesitate to give a constitutional opinion but it is probable that all members of ASIO who suffered this tort, instigated by the Attorney-General, would have a right of action against the Commonwealth for this interference with their rights. </para>
          <para>In dealing with socialist activities it always pays to read the works of socialist writers. It would be conceded generally, even by people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon,</inline> that George Orwell was a very famous and distinguished socialist writer. I suppose that in general terms George Orwell is famous for 2 things. One is his Animal Farm&#39; and the other, of course, is 1984&#39;. In the masterly novel &#39;Animal Farm&#39;, you will recall, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> the little parable about pigs securing ascendency over the entire farm. The pigs were running it as a socialist enterprise. They gathered the produce and sold it. But, as in all socialist societies there happened to be certain internal, economic, cultural and social difficulties. In order to distract attention from these difficulties it was necessary that the pigs in &#39;Animal Farm&#39; have a diversion. It was necessary that they have someone upon whom they could lay the blame for all their own shortcomings and their own difficulties. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> as you will recall from your own erudite studies, this diversion was called &#39;Snowball&#39;. Snowball was a rebel pig. It is not my intention to go right through &#39;Animal Farm&#39; showing the similarities between the activities of the AttorneyGeneral and the head of Orwell&#39;s &#39;Animal Farm&#39;. But it is almost impossible to escape the view that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> activities in ASIO are a pure Snowball. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is using a diversion. He is exercising his rights to conduct a diversion, if he wants to, and that is the - </para>

              <para>- Well, the honourable senator is not capable of taking it in. I do not know why honourable senators opposite should feel that a socialist parable should be so objectionable. I would have thought that they would like to have learned a bit of real socialism. But it appears that they are socialists only when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> or someone else who can whip them into shape is about. We return now to the almost impossible position in which the Attorney-General has placed his own Department. Even before this obnoxious raid on his own Department there were Press allegations that Great Britain and the United States of America were already withholding security information. </para>

            <para>- On 7th March 1973, Senators Jessop, Young and Davidson asked me, representing the Minister for Labour, questions relating to employment in South Australia, labour shortage at Riverland Cannery and unemployment relief, respectively. I undertook to secure additional information from my colleague, the Minister for Labour. The Minister for Labour has provided the following information: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Commonwealth Employment Service recruitment activities on behalf of growers and the Riverland Cannery began before the fruit picking season commenced with intensive canvassing of employers for projected vacancies. Vacancies were released through the C.E.S. network of offices supplemented by special measures such as recruitment of Aborigines from north western areas, extensive advertising and recruitment of weekend pickers amongst school cadets. </para>
            <para>These efforts resulted in the placement by the C.E.S. of more than 4,000 pickers and 200 cannery workers. </para>
            <para>It is difficult to reconcile with the facts the number of persons referred to in the questions as being on unemployment benefit. At the end of February 1973, only 4 males and 1 female were in receipt of unemployment benefit for the whole of the Renmark C.E.S. area. Indeed, there was a very considerable decline (nearly 30 per cent) in the numbers on unemployment benefit in South Australia as between end-January, 1973, and end-February, 1973. </para>
            <para>At the end of February, 31 males (including 13 school leavers) and 27 females (including 11 school leavers) were registered with the Renmark District Employment Office and there were unfilled vacancies for 130 males and 138 females. </para>
