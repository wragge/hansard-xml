Does the Minister agree that if this occurs it will further weaken the Australian Government&#39;s position in any air traffic rights discussions with the United States if alternatives are precipitously closed off? </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the present trade mission to China being headed by the Minister for Overseas Trade and Secondary Industry. Is it a fact that the Minister has had a conference with the Prime Minister of Cambodia&#39;s Government in exile, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Penn</inline> Nouth, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> indicated his personal support for the guerrilla forces in that country? If so, in view of the fact that Australia recognises and has diplomatic relations with the Cambodian Government headed by General Lon Nol, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> is presently on an official trip as a representative of this country, will the Government expressly dissociate itself from the remarks apparently made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns?</inline> Further, in view of the Prime Minister&#39;s clear indication when he was reported to have rebuked <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> earlier this year that he, the Prime Minister, would be the sole spokesman for the Government on foreign affairs, why is <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> able to repudiate his Prime Minister so often and still remain in the Ministry? </para>

            <para>- Some pretty familiar propaganda is associated with the question asked by the honourable senator. The honourable senator asks whether the Government will dissociate itself from statements &#39;apparently made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns&#39;.</inline> I do not know how one can either associate or dissociate oneself from statements &#39;apparently made&#39;. In due course we will find out whether <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> has said or done anything that would be cutting across Australian Government policy. No evidence is available that he has done so. If he has, the Government will deal with the matter. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labour. In view of the, total trade and communications bans imposed on France by the Australian Council of Trade Unions because of the proposed nuclear tests in the Pacific, does the Minister expect that the trade unions will impose similar bans when a further nuclear test date is announced by China, which is reported to be currently negotiating new trade agreements with Australia? What action is the Government taking to prevent so-called industrial unions involving Australia in political strikes and embargoes which pre-empt the Government&#39;s responsibility for foreign affairs? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator probably knows that really his question ought to be directed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> who represents the Prime Minister in this place. The subject of nuclear tests is largely one related to foreign affairs. With respect to the action of the ACTU, I understand that; in another place this morning, the Prime Minister advised the Parliament that he. is conducting negotiations with the ACTU. All I can say to the honourable senator in expressing an opinion with respect to the ACTU&#39;s ban is that this is an attitude which is designed to affect the tests to be held in the area with which we are concerned and which is of concern <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the ACTU. The area of concern is more important than is the question of what China might do in the foreseeable future. I understand too that the trade unions which are affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the International Transport Workers Organisation have asked the ACTU and Australian unions to support the international ban. The unions in the area that will be affected by the French tests so far have similarly supported the international call for these bans. That is all the. information that I can provide to the honourable senator. Largely the question is one which falls within the ambit of the responsibilities of the Minister representing the Prime Minister. </para>

            <para>-  I direct a question to the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General. Further to my question yesterday concerning the statement in the &#39;Illawarra Mercury&#39; newspaper of 27th March that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> told an Australian Labor Party victory dinner at Port Kembla on 2nd March that people should write to him if they wanted Australian Security Intelligence Organisation dossiers, I again wish to raise this matter with the Minister. Will he urgently investigate how many such dossiers have been distributed to the public, especially in view of the fact that my office has since been in touch with the editorial office of the newspaper which believes the report to be accurate and to contain no errors? Further, the newspaper states that no ALP official in Wollongong or any member of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> staff has complained to it that any question of inaccurate reporting is involved. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation. By way of preface, I refer to  the laudable gesture of Qantas Airways Ltd in assisting to make available transport facilities for Australian participants in the Festival of the Brides held in Slovenia in Yugoslavia. Why has not Qantas sought to make direct flights to Belgrade and Zagreb in view of the high charter flight loadings of JAT, the Yugoslav national airline, rather than, as hinted, suggesting a cut back of charter flight facilities which can only penalise the intending passengers? </para>

            <para>- Qantas Airways Ltd will conduct affinity charter flights to other countries by arrangements made in accordance with Australian Government policy on charter flights. At the present time, Qantas considers that the traffic between Yugoslavia and Australia does not justify any increase in these charter flights. The question of charter flights to Yugoslavia and other countries is under constant review. At the present time, it is considered that insufficient normal fares are available to permit an extension or continuation of such charter flights. These charter flights will be considered from time to time in the light of Qantas policy, taking into consideration the flights already available to the public, the traffic that may be expected from a flight and the question of services from one country to another. If arrangements could be made at any time - services warranting it - Qantas would be prepared to- provide charter flights. </para>

Is it also correct that some of the more popular programs will rate the lowest points?

If this is so, is this one method of reducing the number of commercial television stations and an indirect method of obtaining some Government control over the television media? </para>

            <para>- I have seen the report which appeared in at least one if not 2 morning newspapers. The report is not quite correct. The introduction of a new points system is a serious attempt on the part of the Government and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to improve 1jj6s/73- <inline font-style="italic">s-</inline> I6U the quality and standard of Australian television and to remove, to some extent, many of the anomalies and weaknesses in the current straight quota system by which a station gets the same number of quota percentage points, as it were, for a gardening talk as it would for employing many Australians on a professional variety program. I note that one of the newspapers which gave coverage to the report has proposed this morning to conduct a poll of its readers on the proposed points system. Given that the details of the system as published by the newspaper are incomplete and deficient, frankly such a proposal can be regarded only as being thoroughly irresponsible. It would be like conducting an election before any of the parties had a chance to outline their policies. The results of any such poll cannot be considered to be at all relevant. If the newspaper concerned had waited until full details of the system had been made public, as they are expected to be next month after the Broadcasting Control Board has had dicussions with the licensees of the commercial stations, as is required under the Broadcasting and Television. Act, it would have been much more responsible and it might even have been helpful. I suggest that, a poll at this stage would be utterly irrelevant. </para>

          <para>It is most unlikely that Australian television viewers are about to be deluged by a spate of poetry readings on television in peak hour viewing times. Commercial stations are goverened to a very large extent by the rating systems, and the proposals set -out by the Control Board at this stage and which have just been forwarded to the commercial stations allow for complete flexibility in the programming arrangements of the stations. It is not mandatory for a station to program according to each category which is set out. I can hardly visualise, for instance, Abigail of &#39;Number 96&#39; being charged with responsibility of singing &#39;The Last Rose of Summer&#39; or Paul Hogan of Channel 9 being asked to recite for an hour Henry Lawson&#39;s poem &#39;Faces in the Street&#39;. The existing standards contain a category for the arts. Despite the fact that there is such a category, very little, if any, of this type of programming has been carried out. If stations want to carry it out, they are entitled to do so and they are entitled to receive a points credit for doing it. Whether they do so is a matter .for them. The new system will allow complete flexibility in their programming arrangements. </para>

          <para class="block">Just prior to my coming into&#39; the Senate the Minister for Health did give me some information on this matter. The Minister for Health has advised me that&#39; no batches of influenza vaccine have failed &#39; this year and that the backlog of orders by distributors, which at one stage had reached almost 6 weeks, should fall to 2 weeks by the end of this month. There have been&#39; some wild public statements about the efficiency of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, : but, according to the Minister for Health,, the&#39; facts are, as students of an illustrated science strip in some leading daily &#34;newspapers 1 will realise, that appropriate virus strains have to be decided some months in advance of production. </para>
          <para>As soon as the prevalent strain in the recent northern winter was confirmed by the World Health Organisation production was started in anticipation of orders for 800,000 doses, based on last year&#39;s orders of 55,000 doses. Before last Christmas that was revised to 1.2 million doses because of unofficial reports of a mild Northern Hemisphere epidemic. That, of course, does not mean that there need necessarily be an unusual incidence of influenza in Australia this year. Present indications do not indicate the likelihood of a major outbreak. By the end of May, 2 million doses will have been issued, subject to routine final sterility testing. This has been achieved by 24 hours a day 7 days a week operations. That compares favourably with the efforts of private enterprise producers in the Northern Hemisphere who, as it so happens, at a corresponding period in the Northern Hemisphere winter .completely failed to meet their own demands and have been unable to assist  us, as our Government laboratories have in the past assisted their countries. The Minister for Health advises me that in 1 967, in the United States, for example, several firms were unable to produce a satisfactory vaccine until late in the winter. Our Commonwealth Serum Laboratories produced 5.5 million doses in Australia during the following epidemic season, which was 10 times the previous year&#39;s average output. Bulk concentrate was sent to the United Kingdom to supplement that country&#39;s production. </para>

            <para>- 1 ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health a question which is supplementary to the one that he has just answered. Will he ask the Minister for Health to allay the confusion that exists amongst patients, chemists and doctors as to whether a person needs one or two injections of the new influenza vaccine for booster purposes? If a person is having an immunisation he needs 2 injections and the following year he needs only one. But certain advice from the instrumentalities of the Department of Health indicates that a person needs 2 injections. The Department of Health implies that a person needs 2 injections because it has changed the pharmaceutical benefits list from one injection to 2 injections. </para>

If a person has not been immunised previously he still needs 2 injections and, because of the added different strain A, he needs to have a booster.

The development of trade between Australia and overseas markets is primarily the responsibility of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns,</inline> and although I am basing this .only on Press reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns&#39;</inline> efforts in China, I would say they have. been of great value to Australian primary producers.

Has the Minister&#39;s attention been drawn to a report in the &#39;Australian&#39; newspaper of 15th May suggesting that acting upon the Campbell report on university and college of advanced education staff salaries the Government will break the existing nexus between the rates of pay applying in universities and colleges of advanced education?

            <para>- Under the stabilisation scheme which- would normally expire this year the system of first advance has been used, with a final payment made after the Australian Wheat Board has disposed of the wheat. For many years that first advance has been $1.10. It is normally determined in February of each year. This year the Government decided to increase that first advance by 10c to an effective amount of $1.20 for the 1973- 74 crop. That is the first method of payment. In the case of the pool payments a much more involved and complicated system operates. I can only say to the honourable senator that this is one of the matters which have exercised my mind quite a deal since I took over this portfolio. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not like the present system at all because of the factor which the honourable senator mentioned. To me it does not seem reasonable that a grower should have to wait for extended periods of up to 3 years, as he does at the present time, to receive the balance of the value of the goods which he has delivered to the Wheat Board. But these matters will be the subject of review this year. In fact, today I issued a Press statement on this matter. I trust that after some careful consideration of the whole system which is operating now we can come up with something which will obviate the very point which the honourable senator has raised. </para>

Cairns, is currently actively seeking maximum expansion of trade between Australia and China while at the same time, the same <inline font-weight="bold">Dr J.</inline> F. Cairns and other Government Ministers and members, together with the Australian Council nf Trade Unions, are working to impose a ban on Australian trade with France? What is the Government&#39;s policy with regard to trade and sanctions as to France and China? Does it intend to be consistent on the. principle involved? If the Government does not support the current trade union ban against France, will the Government take all action necessary to ensure that the ban is removed . and that the government of this country is restored to this Parliament? </para>

            <para>- The long and involved question asked by the honourable senator concerns trade and arises out of the nuclear tests being conducted at the moment, mainly by France but possibly in the future by China. I do not see anything incongruous in sending a trade mission overseas to try to develop trade with another country. That the country happens to be China I know does upset some honourable senators opposite. We now recognise China. We have exchanged diplomatic representatives with China, and the sending of a trade mission to China is a normal flow-on from that. I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> to say that the Government was assisting in a ban on French goods. That, of course, is hot true. </para>

            <para>-My. question which is directed to the -Minister representing the Prime Minister- follows other questions which have been asked. I am hopeful that, the Minister will answer this one. In view of the Prime Minister&#39;s telegram to. executive members of the- Australian Council of Trade Unions, stressing&#39; that action of the type which the ACTU was then sponsoring by way of bans on. communications and trade with France was clearly contrary to the national interest, what does the &#39;Prime Minister now propose to do in the light of the repudiation of his request by &#39;the ACTU and in the light of the fact that action contrary to the national interest is now taking place? I ask seriously: Are we to expect that once again the sectional interest will be&#39; paramount to the national interest? </para>

The situation is in  a  state of fluidity at the moment. Emotions were aroused. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is interjecting. He has asked his question. Perhaps I had better not say what he might do if he had the power. The views of the Australian Government in both fields in which we were interested have been made known. It is a difficult situation when strikes and nationwide boycotts take place. Obviously, the Army cannot be called in to shoot people, to mow them down, or to do those things which might be in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> mind. </para>

I presume that details of the conditions to which the honourable senator has referred on this occasion have been conveyed to the Minister for the Environment and Conservation by the Western Australian Premier. It is unlikely that a reply would be given to the Parliament before it had been given to the State Premier but 1 shall take up the matter with the Minister and if there is anything on which I can inform the honourable senator I shall certainly do so. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation. Acute concern is developing following the announcement by the Government that the development and resiting of Brisbane airport may not be accomplished before 1980. The Minister will be aware of the new policies of the domestic airlines in introducing economy fares, and the existence of the curfew on aircraft operations at Brisbane airport. A problem will arise in accommodating the increased air traffic within the curfew time and it may be necessary to extend it. In the light of all those circumstances, can the Minister tell us anything encouraging about the earlier resiting and completion of the Brisbane airport? </para>

The Government is in the process of acquiring that land at the present time and I believe plans are being drawn for that development. On the question of when the work will start or when the work will be approved, other Government expenditure must be taken into consideration and priorities established. This project will be considered by the Treasurer in formulating the forthcoming Budget for the purpose of deciding when a date can be set for the commencement of further development of Brisbane airport and a program established for construction and completion of those works. </para>

            <para>-Previous answers to questions and the debate on the transport services to King Island have indicated that the Commonwealth Government and, I think, the State Government are fully aware of the urgency of the need to provide some other facilities for the purpose of transporting goods to and from King Island. A study revealed to the Commonwealth that the Straitsman&#39; was not a paying proposition on the King Island run and therefore interest was lost in using that vessel for that purpose. Press reports - their reliability I do not know - have stated that the Tasmanian Government was considering making approaches for the purpose of hiring the &#39;Straitsman&#39; for a trial period until such time as it could be replaced with a ship more suitable for the service to King Island. No definite plans have been presented to the Commonwealth in respect of any proposal to hire the &#39;Straitsman&#39;. The question is continually under review by the Tasmanian Government and the Commonwealth Government. A decision could be delayed somewhat, I think, as a result of the motion agreed to by the Senate recently to refer this question to a Senate Select Committee because if the Commonwealth acted to provide other transport arrangements for King Island it could well be said to be inconsiderate of the decision of the* Senate to appoint the Committee to inquire into the suitability of the &#39;Straitsman&#39; and it could- </para>

I ask: Is not the Australian Broadcasting Control Board an independent statutory corporation, autonomous and responsible for discharging the duties prescribed under the Broadcasting and Television Act, including the important responsibility of providing adequate and comprehensive programming? Is not the proposed imposition of a particular points system based on Labor Party policies a serious interference with the Board&#39;s charter?

          <para class="block">During the course of the recent Federal election campaign the Prime Minister said that in the carrying out of this section of the Australian Labor Party policy we would seek the utmost co-operation of all commercial television and radio licencees. In the implementation of this section of our policy, I have set out to achieve that co-operation and assistance. I can state that to date I have received the utmost co-operation and assistance from the commercial licensees. I can assure the honourable senator that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is a statutory authority within the terms of the Broadcasting and Television Act and that it is regarded by me, as the Minister, as a statutory authority within the terms of that Act. All of the negotiations that have been carried out on this subject to date have been a matter for the Australian Broadcasting Control Board which is now about to consult the commercial licencees. </para>

Finally, has the Government any plans to introduce FM at an earlier date than that previously announced? </para>

              <para>- It is the policy of the Australian Government, as announced during the course of the recent Federal election campaign, for the Government to introduce frequency modulation broadcasting, if it is at all technically possible, at a date earlier than that which was envisaged by the previous Government when it accepted the recommendations of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board.

I am assured by the technical advisers of the Board that whilst it would be possible to introduce frequency modulation broadcasting in the very high frequency band, if there were adjustments to some television stations, there is a problem with the broader aspect of the mat ter. I am not a technical man in this regard, but my technical advisers assure me that, after giving the matter very great and detailed consideration, the overall national interest of the country so far as frequencies are concerned would be best served by ensuring that frequency modulation is introduced in the ultra-high frequency band. I mention, for the benefit of all honourable senators, that I have asked the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to convene a seminar in Melbourne some time after the Parliament rises for the winter recess - probably about the last week in June - so that all these technical matters can be explained to members of the Australian Parliament. </para>

As it obviously must be very embarrassing for the British and Australian governments, which collaborated in a long series of tests and got all the nuclear information that they wanted, to suggest that France should stop after having gone only part of the way in its investigations, would it not be a much better alternative for Australia to ask the Government of Great Britain to make available to France the full information which it has obtained with our assistance and so make it unnecessary for France to conduct further tests? </para>

But we know a lot more about pollution today, particularly atomic pollution. I do not believe that even the previous Government would have allowed atomic bombs to be exploded in Australia if it had had the knowledge that it has now. The present Government certainly would not have done so. It is all right to be wise after the event. That is the situation in which we find ourselves at the moment. I imagine that that is going to be some embarrassment to us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> has picked up some of the case that I think is going to be used against ais - we are used to that sort of thing happening in this place - and presented it to the, public.

We discussed my proposals this morning, he took them to a meeting of his Party and he made these rather minor amendments to which I have no objection. While I am on my feet there is one thing that I. should say. It is not intended that these amended sitting times should apply this week. As paragraph (2) of the motion states &#39;That,&#39; unless otherwise ordered it will be ordered that these amended sitting times do not come into vogue until next Tuesday. Then it will depend on how the legislation flows through this chamber. I should think that We will sit on Friday of next week, but it does not necessarily mean that we will siton every Friday. Obviously we will not sit around if there is nothing to do. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I wish to indicate firstly my pleasure at the opportunity that I have to deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> each day. Generally, at about 8.30 each morning we meet and sort out a lot of these problems. I appreciate his courtesy in seeing me at that hour. The Opposition does not object to these extended sitting hours. We realise that the Government is now putting through in almost a sausage-machine fashion across Kings Hall, an enormous amount of  legislation and that the Bills will be introduced into this place with a rush as from tomorrow or if not tomorrow, as from next week. Whilst we do not want to put this chamber in the sort of situation where legislation is guillotined or rushed through without due consideration being given to it, we realise that the Government is entitled to have its legislation brought before this chamber and properly considered. It is for that reason that I have agreed to an extension of the sitting hours. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>From reading the notice paper of the other place I know that there is a lot of legislation to be considered, and we are prepared to deal with it. I think that our attitude on this question of sitting hours indicates that the Opposition in this chamber is not frustrating the Government&#39;s legislative program. Time and again I have indicated that we will do our utmost to defeat those Bills to which we are opposed and that we will give the speediest possible passage to those Bills to which we are not opposed. Again I should like to thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> for his co-operation in this matter. </para>

          <para>- The Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> is asking the Senate to agree to extending the sitting hours of the Senate by about 1 U hours a week. This is a practice that has been followed over the years. Usually at this time of a sessional period the Leader of the Government in the Senate or his  Deputy  has asked the Senate to approve of extended sitting times. One has to have a sense of humour when one has been a member of this place for a long time. Last year I was sitting in the chair which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> presently occupies and I asked the Senate to agree to extending the sitting times by 4 hours a week - without any sittings on Friday:&#39; - because I thought that the House of Representatives would rise on about 25th May. Now, 12 months later, almost to the very day, the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate is asking the Senate to agree to an increase of Hi hours a week in sitting times because the House of Representatives is expected to rise on about 24th May. When I proposed an extension of the sitting hours <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> the Senate on that occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> said.* &#39;Well, looking at the legislation coming forward, I do not think that we should agree to this at this stage&#39;. I accepted his suggestion and I put the proposal aside for a further week, with the result that when we finally rose 3 important pieces of legislation had not even been considered by the Senate. Therefore, on that hand 1 believe, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> should be given extra time in the sittings of the Senate during the coming weeks. The Country Party is prepared to stay here until we complete the legislative program. </para>

            <para>- Having said that, I now want to say - some honourable senators might not say &#39;hear, hear&#39; to this - that although I will not oppose it, I object to the proposal to sit on Fridays because 80 per cent of my members have to travel for 5 hours to reach their homes. I admit that in the past we have sat on Fridays, and I recognise that the members of the now Government have agreed to do so, and I accept that. In accepting it, however, I say that if we are to sit for a few hours on Friday then let us sit for the whole of Friday and Friday night as well. </para>

            <para>- I would have plenty of takers on that one, would I not? I join with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> in accepting the proposals put forward. I have some doubts about them but if we have to be here for a couple of weeks after the House of Representatives rises to finish the legislation that ls before the Senate, then we in the Country Party will support the Leader of the Opposition by being here to see that this legislation gets full and detailed consideration. I support the proposals. </para>

          <para>-  On behalf of the Australian Democratic Labor Party I indicate that although the burdens of sitting will be extremely heavy and as the legislation which is to be considered is extremely important, one would hope that the demands of time do not make the proper consideration of it even with the extended hours, unsatisfactory. The items of legislation are important. They represent changes of policy in the hands of a new government which necessarily will require examination and would receive comment, criticism and opposition. Towards the end of long sitting periods one could expect some exacerbation of situations which I trust will not eventuate. I issue the mildest of rebukes to the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee).</inline> These proposals were distributed  -  I acknowledge that to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> - but there was no actual personal&#39; consultation, I understand, between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> and, I think, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> as there was with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> I am subject to correction if I am wrong. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> would be the first to concur with me when I say that very often situations can be overcome by close consultation prior to the matter being brought into this chamber. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that we should not be healing the iteration and reiteration of allegations that the Opposition is holding up legislation. One of the matters to which the present Government has pointed with some pride is that it has moved very quickly, much more quickly than previous governments had done in a comparable period of time. Those movements have been made not only legislatively but also administratively. But once a government crowds in or claims it has crowded into a few brief months what might have been done over an expanded period, one must expect that many more . matters of a general non-legislative character would be coming before this chamber for analysis and criticism. </para>
        <para>As we know, certain actions have been taken which we might describe as administrative and these have precipitated the attention and the criticism of the Opposition. A government which wants to do so much of an administrative character must, expect that. Therefore it does not appear - logical that, those things having been done and having attracted discussion and opposition, those who have a duty to ventilate their opposition and to express their criticism should be in any way criticised and told that the result has been an impediment to legislation. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said, there has been no substantial impediment to legislation, if any at all. The major Bills which are still to pass through this chamber have not, as yet been impeded by any other matters. A great deal of legislation has already proceeded through this chamber. &#39; For the reasons I have suggested and because of the sheer physical burden and the possibility that as a result honourable senators will not be able to give that alert attention which is customarily given in this place by so many we do not welcome additional hours. I hope that the suggested new hours will operate. I assure the Government that this motion will attract .the complete support and co-operation of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. </para>

I do not mind the extra hours and I do not think anybody else does. But we are taking up possibly an hour and a half, an hour and a quarter, or more at question time.

          <para>- in reply - I thank the Leaders of the Parties and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Negus</inline> for their comments. Firstly, in relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne&#39;s</inline> comments, I point out that I certainly have no objection to talking to Party leaders. But in this situation the motion went on to the notice paper and I thought that that would give everybody 24 hours in which to make their comments. I certainly welcome those comments. I know that nobody likes sitting on Fridays, including myself. I suppose the honourable senators from Western Australia get it worst.  I  am a Western Australian who, unfortunately for the last few months, has not been very interested in trips to Western Australia. I understand the position quite clearly. I point out that the motion includes the words &#39;unless otherwise ordered&#39;. If We could get through the vital Bills more quickly- that is those which are going to be rejected or amended and sent back to the other place - this would be taken into account in trying to dodge Friday sittings and we could certainly amend the sitting hours. While I am on my feet  I  inform the Senate that later in the day I will move a motion to enable us to meet at the normal time tomorrow, otherwise when this motion is passed we would meet half an hour earlier tomorrow. And Friday will not come into the matter. </para>

        <para>Question time was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Negus.</inline> He suggested that there be no question time on the extra day on which the Senate sits. This thought crossed my mind too. We are sitting for a specific purpose. But question time comes up. I make no suggestion that it be cut out because it is something which the Opposition always wants. But if there is any suggestion that we make question time shorter, or something like that, then  I  could well fit in with the suggestion. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Negus</inline> has a point but it is the sort of thing which the Government cannot suggest. If it is something on which the Opposition wants to co-operate and if it wants to halve question time, make it less, or to go the full hour, then I am completely in the hands of the Senate. I thank the Senate for its help. As I say, we do not have to adhere to this arrangement. If we have had a bad day and we have got some Bills through, there is nothing to stop us from adjourning a few minutes early. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-  The Senate is debating the Commonwealth Electoral Bill (No. 2) 1973. As the name of the Bill suggests, it is the second of some four or more electoral Bills to be presented, the overall aim of which is to alter very drastically the nature of the electoral laws in this country. As we learn more of the Government&#39;s intentions in this regard it emerges that its aim is to alter the electoral laws so as to entrench the Australian Labor Party in power. Indeed, it is a pity that the Government in bringing down this legislation did not bring down the whole series of Bills so that the Parliament and the people of Australia could see as a whole its intentions regarding the alteration of the laws, because any alterations to electoral laws strike right at the heart of the individual franchise of the elector. Indeed, the very sovereignty of the elector is threatened by variations to the laws which may adversely affect him. So every elector in Australia has a keen interest in what is now being done. I suggest that the Government should have introduced in parallel with this Bill its Bill to provide that the Senate be enlarged by some 4 senators from the Territories. As I mentioned last night, I would find such a Bill destructive of the very nature, shape and intention of the Senate. This Bill would alter the Senate as a States Mouse. Indeed, it threatens to put the control of government in Australia into the hands of a handful of people in the territories. Because those people are predominantly public servants we could have the situation in the future where the decision of government, the balance in this Senate, could be decided by those who predominantly represent the Public Service. That is a principle which has been rejected throughout the world. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Moves also have been foreshadowed to alter the method of voting. It is not clear whether the Government intends to breach its electoral promise not to bring in first past the post voting. It is not clear whether it intends to introduce the beautiful euphemism called the modified preferential system, a device aimed at getting all the advantages of the first past the post system while pretending not to do so. It is pertinent when considering this legislation to keep in mind that the Government has announced its intention to bring in alterations to the electoral laws, the intention and effect of which will be to destroy the minority parties and groups in this country. Not only the Australian Democratic Labor Party, which has been a special target- of the Labor Party, but also every minority party - I refer specifically to the Australia Party, the Defence of </para>
          <para class="block">Government Schools party, every group of people which bias a right to exist, to express its views and to seek to get a representative into this Parliament - is threatened by the present Labor Government. This Bill represents a cynical misuse of power. The Labor Government which .cynically exploited the second preference votes of the Australia Party, the Defence of Government Schools party, the Women&#39;s Electoral Lobby and others, will now discard them in case the preferences of those parties should turn against them. If the Government does not live up to its promises, and that is likely, then those who elected it are to be exterminated in case they use their power to defeat it. Every person who believes in the right of minority groups or minority individuals in this country to have the right of election, should look to the threat that is inherent.in this foreshadowed legislation. </para>
          <para>Against that is one segment of this Bill which appears to be all innocence. It seeks to alter the considerations which distribution commissioners must have in mind when they change the shape, size and content of the 123 federal electorates in Australia. When 1 refer to distribution commissioners I atn talking of people who, tinder the previous Liberal Government, were men of massive integrity, senior public servants who discharged their jobs with complete objectivity. That has been proved by the results. Those people were mostly Commonwealth electoral officers, surveyors-general and top public servants who know how to be non-partisan and &#39; to serve the &#39; public, had desiderata given to them to help them in their decisions on the. shape, size and content of electorates. </para>
          <para>Lest anyone should think .&#39;that what the Labor Government is now seeking to alter are some wicked things that a Liberal government put into the Electoral Act in order to entrench itself in office, I want to! say, firstly, that it is the proud and accurate boast of the previous Liberal Government&#39;! the present Liberal Opposition, that throughout the whole of its 23 years in Government the redistributions carried out under its supervision and through this Parliament at all times preserved the principle of majority rule. That is the true: test of a proper electoral system; the true test of the principle of one vote ope &#39; value which is being humbugged in the mouths of members of the Labor Party in this debate. The: true test is that a party which gets the majority of votes shall get the majority of seats. </para>
          <para class="block">That happened in all cases under our distributions. Indeed, I understand that the Australian Labor Party on 2nd December 1972 received 49.6 per cent of the voltes in Australia and received S3. 6 per cent of the seats. That happened under a distribution carried out by the Liberal Government of the day. That is proof of the principle of at least one vote one value. </para>
          <para>The Government is not seeking to change some devices of burs. It is seeking to change essentially the principles which were enshrined by great Labor Prime Ministers. 1 refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chifley, Mr Curtin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scullin.</inline> Those principles were in the Act and were accepted as being essential to the Act by Labor governments of the past. The onus is on the Labor Government of the day to say why these principles are wrong now if they were right then and were right throughout the 70 years of federation. I remind you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> that the first of the 3 proposed changes in the Bill before us is to reduce from 20 per cent to 10 per cent the tolerance which the distribution commissioners have to put electorates either above or below the quota. To explain that, if the average size or quota of an electorate in Australia is 60,000 electors, under the present Act and throughout the course of history the distribution commissioners have been enabled to make electorates 20 per cent larger or 20 per cent smaller than the quota. That provision has been in the Act under Labor governments of the past. It was there during the time of the massive changes to the electoral law by the Chifley Government in 1948. It was there during the time of the massive changes which a man named Arthur Calwell brought about and which led to an alteration of this chamber. I refer to the introduction of proportional representation which in my judgment has altered immensely for the better the quality, nature and character of this chamber. 1 pay <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Calwell</inline> the respect due to him for that action of the past. </para>
          <para>The things 1 have spoken of have been in the Aci all that time. There is nothing new in them. There was no plot by some Liberal government to bring in these things. As I reminded the Senate last night, the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review reported <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> this matter in 1959. That Committee consisted of responsible officers, experts of the day such as the Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ainsworth,</inline> the Common wealth electoral officers, and the surveyorsgeneral of each of the States, and it reached a preponderance of view in favour of leaving the 20 per cent tolerance in the Act, although the parliamentarians, by majority, reached another view. The important thing is that those who had the non-partisan view reached the conclusion that the 20 per cent provision ought to remain. The Government is not seeking to remove something which the Liberal Party included in the Act for its own benefit. It is seeking to remove something which has been in the Act throughout history, something which the expert officers of the day recommended should remain. We of the Liberal Opposition&#39; also think it should remain. The same applies to the provision which provides for the divergencies in the seats which must occur as a minimum to bring about a redistribution. </para>
          <para>The second of the changes seeks to guide the electoral officers, the distribution commissioners, on the nature of electorates. 1 refer to disabilities of remoteness, distance, sparsity or density of population, or the area of a division. It is true that the specifics of this provision were written into the Act in, 1 think, 1965 but it is equally true that throughout the 70 years of federation the distribution commissioners read those terms into the existing Act and carried out distributions in accordance with them. In other words, since federation distribution commissioners .have always considered the specifics regarding the difficulties and disabilities of size, remoteness and distance. So, I repeat that we are not talking about a provision which a Liberal government inserted. </para>
          <para>I repeat also that if .the principle of one vote one value is to be tested it has to be applied to an electoral system so, in the end, the conjunction of all the electorates and their results produce a majority of votes and a majority of seats. That always happened under the previous Liberal Government which- left on the statute books legislation which worked absolutely fairly, honestly and impartially. We are proud to say that. No one can say that the previous Liberal Government, in its .23 years of office, sought to- gain specific advantage from the electoral laws. The results from the ballot box- have proved otherwise. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the working of these specifics. The first question is whether the tolerance ought to be 20 per cent or 10 per cent above or below the quota. It is&#39; important to keep in mind that members of the Labor Party concede straight away that there must be a per.centage tolerance. They say: &#39;Yes, of course there must be a percentage, but we think it ought to be  10  per cent and not  20  per cent&#39;. There is no argument on their part that there ought to be no movement from the quota at all. The argument is only in terms of degree. They tend to argue that in the past the practice of determining the size of electorates as either above or below the quota in a large fashion has been abused for a subjective electoral purpose.  1  reject that theory.  1  remind the Senate that in the last redistribution in  1968  the distribution commissioners of the day put some  90  of the  125  seats in the House of Representatives  10  per cent or less above or below the quota. Ninety seats out of  125  were very close to the quota, being either above or below. Some  6  seats were  15  per cent above or below the quota. Some  27  seats were  10  per cent or more. Some  90  seats were below  10  per cent. The distribution commissioners, while having the power to use the  20  per cent tolerance, used it rarely. The tendency- </para>

              <para>- It was in  1968.  lt was the last redistribution, the one which is functioning now. The fact is that the distribution commissioners, men of great integrity, used with great discretion the tolerances provided. lt is important to examine whether the principle of one vote one value would work in Australia in the current electoral climate better at a tolerance of  20  per cent or  10  per cent.  1  will spell out that argument. The need to have a tolerance derives from the fact that the numbers of electors in an electorate are never static. They are either increasing or decreasing. It is rare indeed that any stagnation of population occurs in any electorate. The growth of Australia in the past  20  odd years, together with our great migrant intake, has resulted in great expansion occurring in the number of electors in some electorates. The aim has always been to try to achieve a situation in which the&#39; commissioners would place the enrolments of seats that were growing in population as such a point below the quota that half way between that redistribution and the next redistribution the number of electors in those seats would reach the required quota. So, in the period between one redistribution and the next redistribution, the population of those electorates would move from below the quota to above the quota and at the median point of that redistribution period-would equal the quota. The reverse occurred in electorates which were of declining population. They would be put above the quota at the start of a redistribution period. Their population decline would be such that at. the median point between redistributions they would reach the quota and then begin to decline. Indeed, by that device one gets the best of all possible chances that the one vote one value principle will operate. Clearly, at any time in an electorate which has more electors enrolled than the quota set, the value of the vote of an elector in that electorate would be less than in an electorate which has fewer electors than the quota prescribes. If such a population declines from above the quota to below the quota the value of a vote evens out over a cycle.  </para>

          <para>It has been normal for governments of the past to hold redistributions about every  7  years after a census takes place. If that is done, the pattern I have described would emerge. As some honourable senators have pointed out no seat better than the seat of the Minister for Services and Property, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly,</inline> who initiated this Bill, better illustrates the point. That is the seat of Grayndler. The population of the electorate of Grayndler has moved vastly. The population has declined and the number of electors has moved very rapidly through a great range. Therefore, it is important that that electorate should be put above the quota, as the commissioners have done, at the start of a redistribution period because the population will be well below the quota when a&#39; new redistribution occurs. I say to the Senate that to express best the principle of one vote one value a tolerance of  20  per cent should be adopted. In the period between  19&#39;68,  when the redistribution occurred, and the next election the population of a number of seats had grown so fast that they were already out of kilter. This is the important factor. It is important because of the rapid growth in the provincial seats in the suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney, lt is important that those seats should be put below the quota so that they can grow above the quota and in the cycle the principle of one vote one value can be evened out. </para>
          <para>It is important also to put this matter again in perspective. How do other countries face up to this problem? How does Australia compare with other countries in the equity, pf its approach. It is interesting that in Canada - a country with many similarities to Australia, and a great democracy - under the 1965 Redistribution of Representation in the House of Commons Act a variation of not more than 25 per cent is provided. Does any honourable senator say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Trudeau&#39;s</inline> Government is gerrymandering? If he does, let him get up and say it. In Britain the electoral system is old fashioned, like so many of its practices, including the lack of a written constitution. Matters of this nature have not been spelt out. Constituencies vary from 40,000 to 80,000 electors without any difficulty whatsoever. In France, at the last election, constituencies ranged from 25,000 to 150,000 electors. I think honourable senators on the Government side tended to quote United States practices and decisions made there. It is interesting to note that in the famous cases which were recently before Chief Justice Warren, as in Wesberry v. Sanders in 1964, the meaning of &#39;as nearly as practicable&#39; was interpreted. In the United States today a percentage of the order of 15 per cent variation from the quota is accepted as being &#39;as nearly as practicable&#39;. If that interpretation were, applied in Australia some 117 seats of the 125 seats in the House of Representatives at the last redistribution would have been within the 15 per cent tolerance; only 6 seats or sowere above that tolerance. Therefore, compared with other countries Australia has a pretty healthy record in this respect. We have  observed the principle of one vote one value better than any other country. We express it in the ballot box better than any other country. We can proudly say and proudly acknowledge that the distribution commissioners who have been appointed in the past have been people of absolute integrity. </para>
          <para>There has been a great deal . of talk by members of the Australian Labor Party about alleged gerrymanders. I remind them, and all subsequent Labor speakers in this debate, that if they speak in that way, they are implying that people such as the Chief Commonwealth Electoral Officer, the. Commonwealth electoral officers of the various States, the surveyorsgeneral and departmental heads of that status and independence over the decades have brought about a corruption, a gerrymander or a fraud. It was those people who brought about these redistributions and who are given the task of interpreting the Act. They have done a magnificent job. I want to say this: </para>
          <para class="block">There is no need whatever for the Labor Government to alter in any way the laws of this land in relation to electoral matters if it wants to bring about a major gerrymander. If it were to choose people who were flexible in their approach to electoral matters to fill the positions to which I have referred, a gerrymander could be produced. </para>
          <para>The real test of this Government will come when it appoints the distribution commissioners. The real test for those distribution commissioners will come when they accept the need for absolute objectivity. 1 simply acknowledge that over the years the people who have done this work have been magnificent. I reject out of hand any suggestion that in the past 2 decades any public servant, electoral officer or distribution commissioner has been a party in any way to any kind of adverse influence by the government of the day. I hope that in the years to come we will be able to say the same when looking back on the term of this Government. </para>
          <para>I turn to the question of what this Bill is trying to do. There has been an enormous reaction on the. part of Government senators who say: &#39;Because of. their size we will not have country electorates - such, as - Darling, which occupies one-third  of New South Wales, Kalgoorlie, Grey or any of these great electorates, throughout Australia&#39;. We will not have two or three thousand less electors in those seats than in others because that would be bad. It would not be in -. accordance .with the principle of one vote, one value&#39;. I want to say that on the votes- cast in the ballot box in my State . of New South Wales in December 1972, one country vote, taking into account the electorate of Darling and all these other large electorates, was equal to 1.06 extra metropolitan votes. I think that any person in the city would agree to this very marginal loading because of the size and remoteness of some country seats and the need for the members concerned to get to. their electors. The value, of a vote is to be judged not only by its value in the ballot box. It should be judged by the availability of the member of the House of Representatives or senator to his constituents. It should be judged on his ability to visit  the hamlets, villages and towns in his electorate. In some cases, he has to visit 20 or 30 municipalities or shires throughout his district. </para>
          <para>The acquisition of local knowledge enriches the value of parliamentary representation. If we have weakened representation of a country electorate such as Darling caused by a superficiality of knowledge, a vote in that country electorate has not the value of a vote in a city electorate such as Phillip which has an area of 3 square miles. So the concept of one vote, one value is enormously complex. As I say, if we were to remove the electorate of Darling from New South Wales and leave in the electorate of Eden-Monaro - it would take 2 days to drive around its 122 polling places - one country vote at the last general election was equal to 1.04 extra metropolitan votes. That tiny margin is some very small recognition of the fact of distance, remoteness and the enormous difficulty of servicing any electorate the size of Eden-Monaro, Gwydir, Riverina or Hume. It is important that the people of the rural electorates of Australia should understand very carefully the intention of the Labor Government. The. Labor Government, in its electoral laws, is aiming to weaken the representation of the people in the towns and on the farms throughout Australia. It is a deliberate attempt to make it difficult - even impossible  -  to give proper representation in the Parliament to country electors. </para>
          <para>I remind the Senate and the people of Australia that nothing the previous Government did in the electoral field was unacceptable to the Chifley Government, the Curtin Government or the Scullin Government. All these principles contained in the present Commonwealth Electoral Act have stood the test over 70 years. They are being altered now. The real question that must be asked is this: Why is the. Government doing this? The Government that mouths the principle of one vote, one value is seeking to bring about a gerrymander of a massive kind, despite the fact that gallup polls are now starting to run against it. The inevitability of its policies, particularly those in relation to inflation, its industrial laws and its foreign policies will accelerate this trend. It is trying to defeat the will of the people. This is the very negation of democracy. If there is one reason for which a parliament exists, it is for the sovereignty of the individual elector to be expressed in the ballot box. This is the one time in 3 years that the elector can say: &#39;\ have the power to decide who shall and who shall not form the government. I have the power to recall&#39;. That is 4he elector&#39;s moment when he decides at the ballot box. This proposal is an attempt to frustrate. This Senate over the last 5 months has demonstrated the real reason for its existence - its responsibility for State rights and its sensible approach to reviews. It has been doing a job of review and stopping irresponsibility. It is to be destroyed in that purpose by means of the 4 or more bills relating to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The people of Australia must understand this: The Labor Prime Minister of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> has an incensive hatred of the Senate. Opposition senators have sitting opposite us on the Government benches men who have signed a pledge to commit a kamikaze act to support a party platform to abolish the Senate and themselves. Many of them have done that intellectually without knowing it. But they come here and talk of the rights of the Senate when it suits them. They talk of the numbers game and say that it is shocking that the Opposition uses its numbers to defeat something. But they are now proposing to play the numbers game themselves. </para>

            <para>-  The purpose of the proposed changes in the Commonwealth Electoral Act is to bring it into line with the principle of one vote, one value. This will mean a reduction in the variation permissible from the quota specified in section 19 (1.) of the Act from one-fifth to one-tenth or, in other words, from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. Also they mean a revision of the factors to which the distribution commissioners are required to give due consideration by deleting references which hitherto have been in the Act. Those references are: Disabilities arising out of remoteness or distance, density or sparsity of the population of the division and the area of the division. Finally, it is provided that a redistribution may be directed whenever one-quarter of the number of electors in a division of a State differs from the quota by one-tenth, which is the fraction now inserted in lieu of the previous 20 per cent - one-fifth. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One would imagine, as a result of the contributions from the speakers who represent the combined view of the Opposition, that the views of the Australian Labor Party have been hidden in past years, that it has never endeavoured to explain itself in respect of the principle of one vote, one value and that it has, in fact, endeavoured to fool the Australian people. The evidence shows that to be contrary to the facts. The evidence shows that the Labor Party, in its policy and platform, has consistently adhered to the principle of one vote one value and has consistently moved in the Houses of Parliament amendments to achieve that objective. Therefore one has to doubt the hysterical statements which were made by some Opposition speakers in an endeavour to draw incorrect conclusions and to suggest that the Government&#39;s attitude and its proposal in the Bill are open to other considerations. When introducing the Bill in the other place, the Minister for Services and Property <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> made the Government&#39;s position quite clear. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Free elections are basic to a democratic society. But free elections in themselves are not enough - the results must reflect the will of the majority both in individual constituencies and throughout the nation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Each Opposition  speaker  has suggested that he agrees with those principles. Yet by the time each had participated in the debate each had gone to a great deal of effort to decry that principle. Of course the greater the tolerance under which distribution commissioners operate the more electorates can be manipulated and gerrymandered. The smaller the tolerance the less opportunity there is for suggestions that manipulation can take place to be given any credence. It is interesting to examine the arguments of the various Opposition speakers. For instance, the previous <inline font-weight="bold">speaker. Senator Carrick,</inline> had the temerity to suggest that it was Government speakers who were suggesting that previous redistributions had been fixed by those who had been charged with the responsibility of redistribution, whether they were senior public servants, judges or retired judges. In fact, it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus,</inline> the principal spokesman for the Democratic Labor Party, who in opposing the Government&#39;s propositions, made that point and suggested that all redistributions carried out by all governments in the past had been fixed. I challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> to name a Government  speaker  who has suggested that redistributions in the Commonwealth sphere have been influenced by governments, Oppositions or persons who had not been given the responsibility to carry out the redistribution. </para>
          <para>Speakers who opposed the electoral changes - all Opposition speakers - have consistently tried to give a false impression that the Government was attempting to gerrymander the Australian electorate. This is a curious position for them to take,, considering the great electoral gerrymanders which have been carried out by Liberal-Country Party State governments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> who was an official of the State Liberal Party in New South Wales, would know something about that. Here we have this great contradiction. We have one  speaker  for the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> suggesting that great lengths of time between redistributions were required to prevent frequent redistributions and to allow a settling down situation. Can he explain how it is that the New South Wales Liberal Party, of which he was a significant administrative member when he was a full time &#39; official, has engaged upon the third redistribution in the past 7 years, whereas the State Labor Government in. its 24 years in office carried out only 4 redistributions? If the State Labor Government, which was defeated in 1965, had been responsible for a bodgie redistribution, which has been suggested by some Opposition speakers,&#39; - it seems that the State Government made a pretty bad fix because it was defeated- at the 1965 election. </para>
          <para>What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> . seems to fail to understand&#39; is that in the. post-war period there has been the most significant population change in Australia&#39;s history. .This significant change requires recognition by Commonwealth and State government&#39;s. We are concerned not only with what has been done federally but with what has been done in the States. The Labor Party&#39;s, policy, which we are pledged to carry out iri dub course, states that our Government &#39; is pledged &#39;to ensure that the House of Representatives and each State House of Parliament is composed of members directly elected from electorates in each of which the number of people is as nearly as practicable the same&#39;. I do not think there is any secret in that. The Party&#39;s policy is clear. Its endeavours are clear. Its purposes in introducing: the Bill are not open to anything other than serious consideration. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the subjective situation in the States. It is very interesting to refer to the contribution to the debate of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> He pleaded with us to omit any reference to what happens in the States. He said:  1 suggest to all honourable senators that they confine &#39;the debate on this Bill to what happens under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. If we started to talk&#39; about the gerrymanders that have taken- place under all governments, composed of all parties, of all political colours, in almost all States, we could be here until Christmas.&#39; </para>
          <para class="block">It is interesting to note that the Opposition should take the view that we should not take into consideration what have been the established policies of other governments. We have to examine what has been the attitude of the other political parties. Because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> and other speakers have endeavoured to attack the motivation of the Government, we are entitled to attack the motivation of the Opposition parties wherever they have been in government. Let us look at the position in Queensland and South Australia. Let us see how little regard the Liberal-Country Party governments in those States had for electoral justice. in Queensland the coalition Government, led by the Country Party, created a gerrymander so great that it was possible for the Labor Party to get  46.75  per cent of the vote, as against  42.23  per cent for the LiberalCountry Party coalition, and yet win only  33  seats as against  47  seats won by the Government. It is significant that no Opposition spokesman has made any reference to that fact. Yet we are asked by the leading Opposition spokesman, the Leader of the Opposition in this place, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> to make no reference to that gerrymander. In Queensland the Country Party, led by this great democrat Bjelke-Petersen, can poll less than  20  per cent of the total vote and win  26  of the seats. The Labor Party can poll <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> times that vote and gain only  7  seats more. Yet the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party in the other place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> accused the Federal Labor Government of sheer political skulduggery in introducing the Bill. Where is the credibility of the Country Party in these matters? </para>
          <para>In South Australia events over the years were so bad that books were written about the gerrymander in that State. In the  1959  State election - one could go back to each election prior to that and find somewhat the same result - the ruling Liberal Country League received  37  per cent of the vote as against the Labor Party&#39;s  49.5  per cent of the vote. Yet the Liberal Country League was returned with  16  seats, while the Labor Party won  13.  Do we hear any complaints from Opposition spokesmen? No, of course we do not, because over the years they have shown themselves to be completely unconcerned about electoral justice. It is a lot of poppycock for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> to talk about electoral justice, the rights of the voters, the rights of rural communities and the rights of people when he turns a blind eye to gerrymanders of this kind. </para>
          <para>I have already referred to the events that took place in New South Wales recently. In the very week in which this legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives the New South Wales Liberal-Country Party Government, virtually in the dead of night, rushed a Bill through the New South Wales Parliament without giving the Opposition Party and the Independents in that Parliament an opportunity to consider fully the very drastic alterations that were proposed to the electoral laws of that State. Do honourable senators opposite maintain that that action was taken for the purpose of further^ ing electoral justice? It was taken purely and simply to enhance the fading electoral prospects of the Liberal-Country Party in the election to be held in New South Wales next year. </para>
          <para>There has been a great deal of comment from Opposition speakers, particularly those from the Country Party and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> who was the last  speaker  in the debate, about the alleged desirability from the point of view of country people to retain the imbalance that exists between the rural voter and the urban voter. No argument has been advanced to show that, as a result of this imbalance both in the State and Federal Parliaments, the lot of the rural dweller has been improved. There is no evidence to show that a person has to represent a rural voter before he can act and vote conscientiously on matters affecting the rural community. The Opposition Parties favour the retention of a system which is undemocratic and which gives the conservative parties an inbuilt advantage. </para>
          <para>The accusations that the Government is trying to gerrymander the electorate are completely groundless. Not one speaker has produced any evidence to that effect. In fact, it has been the Opposition Parties and their counterparts in the State spheres that have been responsible, when in government, for the greatest gerrymanders in Australia&#39;s history. The Government is attempting to reduce the variation from the quota of voters in federal electorates from  20  per cent to  10  per cent. This is not merely a whim of the new Government. The Labor Party has consistently advocated such a proposition in the Parliament since  1961. &#39; </para>
          <para>It is necessary to examine the motivation of some of the Opposition speakers, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> in objecting to this legislation. In his contribution to the debate last evening <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> painted a false picture when he endeavoured to create the impression that the evidence of one of the witnesses before the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review represented the view of that Committee. Quite the contrary is the case. One has only to look at the draft constitutional alterations suggested by that Committee to see that I am correct. Honourable senators on this side of the chamber have referred to the all-Party character of the Committee. It was a Committee made up of 12 members. Significantly enough, the principle was established in relation to this Committee of appointing 6 members from the Government side and 6 from the Opposition side. It was not the bodgied up sort of committees that we have seen emanating from the actions of the Australian Democratic Labor Party in this chamber during this session. It was recognised even in 1959 that there should be an all-Party approach to the question of equality of voting power. The Committee made this unanimous recommendation to the Parliament: </para>

          <para>It is a simple mathematical fact that the margin of 20 per cent, allows one division to have up to 50 per cent more electors than, another- division in the same .State. As a result, we have the sort of imbalance about which. I have spoken in South Australia and Queensland. Let me refer also to. what happened in, for example, New South .Wales in the .196&#38;. election. I quote these figures , only because, they are comparable to those, of all the other elections. It took 26,000 votes, in New South Wales to elect a member of the Labor -Party. Even though the principle of redistribution in &#39; New South Wales cannot be &#39;&#39;compared with that of Queensland, it took! 20,000 votes to&#39; elect someone from the Country Party and 26,000 to elect someone&#34; from the Liberal Party. Despite the parity that &#39; exists in New South Wales between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party and despite the disparity that exists in that State between those Parties and the Country Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> :Askin, the Premier of New South Wales, is- going about a last minute redistribution because the winds of change are blowing pretty fiercely in New South Wales. He has sought to find some consolation in an electoral redistribution. On the previous occasion when there&#39; was an elec&#39;toral redistribution in New South Wales the Government spokesman who- introduced the Bill into the State Parliament said that the reason there had to be changes -was that the electorate of Temora in New - South Wales had 17,000 voters whereas- the electorate of The Hills had 33,000 voters.&#39; This was regarded as- sufficient justification for the </para>
          <para class="block">Government to make last minute changes to the electoral laws. Of course, in  1968  the figures were  20,000  for Temora and  32,000  for The Hills. So very little had been done to reduce the imbalance that existed between those  2  electorates and which is now being cited by the Liberal-Country Party in New South Wales as justification for a last minute electoral change. </para>
          <para>The justification for the variations is that consideration should be given to disabilities arising out of remoteness or distance, the density or sparsity of population of a division and the area of a division. Surely in this day and age those factors ought to be taken more into consideration than they would have been in the previous  70  years of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> spoke. We do not have the communication problems in  1973  that we had in  1906.  If difficulties do exist, I am sure the Parliament could be prevailed upon to provide additional resources to those members who may experience some difficulties in servicing their constituents because of the area of their electorates. However, the difficulties do not warrant the sacrificing of the principle of one vote one value. The Leader of the Opposition in the other place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden,</inline> agrees with my contention, because when he was speaking on this Bill in that chamber he said: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. one vole one value. I do not reject that concept but I say quite specifically and unequivocally that there is no time at which that can be achieved in all its pristine purity. Nevertheless the law should do all it can to as near as practicably achieve it. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">So the Leader of the Opposition in the other place has suggested that we should work towards this objective. But if one considers the contributions from honourable senators opposite one finds they suggested that there is something ulterior, something to be feared in the legislation which the Government has brought before the Parliament. What has to be considered is that elected governments should be truly representative of the will of the people, but there is sufficient evidence to show that that is not the case in a number of State government areas. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that if the present imbalance which exists in the Federal sphere is not be corrected, the same sort of imbalanced government could emerge. </para>
          <para>We are entitled to say that people living in rural areas have no need for greater representation in the national Parliament than do people who live in the cities. We know that more than  80  per cent of the people live in the cities and that it was in the cities where the voting changes took place at the last election. The plight of the people living in cities occupied the attention of the Labor Party and resulted in the Labor Party being elected to office. It has never been suggested that we are not concerned about the problems facing the other  20  per cent of the people. If we are not frustrated by honourable senators opposite, we will be introducing legislation to take into consideration the problems facing the people who live outside the great metropolises and also the needs of those people. </para>

              <para>- In due course the honourable senator will be surprised at the legislation which this Government has in mind. It will solve the problems which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster&#39;s</inline> party failed to solve in the  23  years in which it was a part of the coalition Government. Last evening we listened to a great contribution from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus.</inline> He selected isolated reports of the Victorian Labor Party and of the Minister for Labour <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> and suggested that there should be drastic alterations in the whole electoral system. I thought that we were to be asked to vote on an amendment; that is what I thought he was suggesting when he spoke in this debate. It is interesting to note that now that the Australian Democratic Labor Party faces the prospect of having its number of representatives reduced from  5  to  2  in a Senate election, it is putting pressure on the Victorian Liberal Party and possibly on the Victorian Country Party to change the voting system in that State in order to provide for proportional representation, or whatever other name <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> calls this new voting procedure. It is interesting to note that hitherto the Democratic Labor Party has not shown any great interest in voting procedures. But now that there is a distinct possibility that members of that Party may be out of jobs very shortly, they are resurrecting the matter of proportional representation with a view to finding jobs for their representatives. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> stated, that there are members of the Labor Party - and I would be one of them - who believe that there is some merit in the proportional system. There is nothing wrong with having a private view about these matters, anymore than there was in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline> having a point of view about proportional representation, or in the same point of view being expressed by a committee of the Victorian Labor Party. I am not sure whether that committee finally got its view adopted as the policy of that Party, but that is quite immaterial. The fact is that many people in the Labor Party probably would agree that there should be changes in the electoral system. </para>
          <para>Therefore, it is rather novel for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> of the Democratic Labor Party to suggest to us that it does not matter very much what we do. He says that the system can be fixed, whether there is a 20 per cent variable or a 10 per cent variable. Other Opposition speakers say that the end of the world will come if we reduce the variable from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. I do not know who is the expert on this matter. Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> the expert? Members of the Democratic Labor Party are seeking to become the leaders of the Opposition in this place; that is the way in which they have been carrying on in recent times. Who are we to believe? Are we to believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> speaks on behalf of the Opposition, or that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> speaks on behalf of the Opposition? Their contributions are quite contradictory. </para>
          <para>The question of an optional preferential system has been raised as some sort of red herring in the debate. I am one who would be prepared to look at any reasonable proposition and to take into consideration all the views of the various political parties regarding the question of voting changes. But to suggest that the Labor Party is committed to a firm policy on this matter, that it is seeking to ignore the expressed will of the people and that it is seeking to bring about a situation where there will be elected a government that will not reflect the will of the people is quite contrary to the expressed views of the Leader of the Labor Party, of the platform of the Party and of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review which found sufficient weight of evidence to make a unanimous recommendation to the Parliament in 1959. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline>on behalf of the Country Party, spent a great deal of time denigrating the Labor Party&#39;s approach to electoral reform. He took us all around the world in order to justify his action. Other honourable senators also did this.

            <para>- I desire to make a short contribution to this debate in opposing this Bill. We are debating a Bill which provides for the redistribution of all the electorates in Australia. It is a short Bill but it is a very important Bill, lt seeks to make 2 principal alterations in the instructions which are to be given to the distribution Commissioners who are to be appointed. It is seeking, firstly, that the 20 per cent tolerance above or below the quota be reduced to 10 per cent. I think it has already been pointed out that the 20 per cent tolerance has been in the Commonwealth Electoral Act since just after federation. It has never been found necessary by any previous government - Labor governments or governments from our side of politics - to change the tolerance. The change was apparently suggested just recently when the present Government decided that it does not want to give such a big tolerence because it thinks that the areas outside the metropolitan areas have too few voters. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that it is a physical impossibility to keep within a 10 per cent tolerance. Populations in some electorates change very quickly. It is all right to say that when the number of voters in electorates get above or below the tolerance we should have another redistribution. We do not want redistributions every year or two. We have the spectacle now of people not knowing what electorate they are in, not knowing who is their Federal member, not knowing who to approach for help and advice. Only recently we gave the vote to the 18, 19 and 20-year-olds in this country. According to the number of these new electors in each electorate, the enrolments are pretty slow and this could upset the redistribution to some extent and a sudden spate of applications for enrolment just before the election could change the quotas very much. As I have said, the 20 per cent tolerance allows the distribution commissioners a wider latitude. It allows for most electorates to keep within this tolerance for a much longer period and so avoid the necessity for continual redistributions. </para>
          <para>The Bill proposes to remove certain instructions to the commissioners which have been in existence for some years. The instructions which it is proposed to remove are, I believe, very fair and cover the whole of Australia and make it fairly easy to hold a redistribution. They are, the disabilities arising out of remoteness or distance, the density or sparsity of population of the division and the area of the division. It is proposed to substitute another series of instructions for the commissioners, the first of which is: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>community of interests within the Division, including&#39; economic, social and regional interests. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Let us consider some of the electorates.I mention, firstly, Kalgoorlie, the largest in Australia. It includes the city of Kalgoorlie, the Ord River and the iron ore mines. How in the name of goodness can the commissioners consider this as a community of interests within the division including economic, social and regional interests? It just happens that it is a big part of the State of Western Australia and has to be included in one electorate and cannot, therefore, fall within this instruction to the commissioners. </para>

              <para>- Maybe he does, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Minister.</inline> We hear from many of his electors in different parts of the huge electorate of Kalgoorlie: &#39;We never see our member. Where do we get in touch with him? He has not the time to travel around the electorate to meet us to ask us about our problems&#39;. He might be all right but many electors of the Kalgoorlie electorate are not happy about it. Next, let us consider the electorate of Darling which takes in the city of Broken Hill, much of the area round the Darling River, some of the richest pastoral districts in New South Wales, and goes into the mixed farming areas. I have been told that at one time one-half the wealth of New South Wales came from this electorate.I do not know whether that is the case now. Another instruction to the commissioners is that they are to take into account the &#39;means of communication and travel within the division&#39;. In the electorate of Darling, if one wants to get to Bourke from Broken Hill it is necessary to go to Sydney and then go back unless one has a car. To go from Bourke to the southern part of the electorate &#39;around Wentworth one has to go via Sydney and Melbourne. The pre vious member was always complaining about this setup of his travelling arrangements. It was not a good set-up for travelling. Yet the commissioners are supposed to draw up electorates by taking this instruction into account. </para>

          <para>The electorate of Kennedy in Queensland, under the Bill with the 10 per cent tolerance, will have 5,000 or 6,000 more electors added to it. It already takes in a very large part of Queensland from the mining area of Mt Isa down to the mixed farming areas near the coast within about 200 miles or a little more of Brisbane. This must be added to under this new set-up. Is it any wonder that many people in this area are complaining about the proposed new arrangements and are opposing them? </para>
          <para>This is part of the Government&#39;s electoral legislative program and apparently the legislation will be brought in piecemeal. We believe that the Bills could have been brought in together and that we could have debated the whole concept of the Government&#39;s electoral legislative program instead of dealing with a Bill now, another in a month&#39;s time and another or perhaps a couple more in the next session. We have already passed the Bill to provide the vote for 18-year-olds and, as I have said, those young people are apparently not enrolling as quickly as many had expected they would. Apparently some of them are not so interested in enrolling. However, as election time nears that position will probably change. Now we have this Bill and we are told that several other Bills are to follow. One of them, we are told - we do not know how many of them will come to pass - is to provide Senate representation for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. We are told too that the Australian Capital Territory will be able to elect 2 members to the House of Representatives instead of one, and we are told by the grapevine- </para>

              <para>- The Premier of Queensland is quite able to look after himself. He has done a very good job and he is doing a very good job. We are told that there will be a number of amendments to another important Bill which is to be introduced in the Budget session. Why could not many of these things be done at the same time? The Minister for Services and Property <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> who was in charge of the Bill in the other place made the statement that he did not want cows, haystacks and trees to be taken into consideration. Apparently the Minister does not want to admit that representation of the sparsely populated areas is much more difficult. When one is a member of the Senate and is doing his job, he learns of the problems of the members who represent these areas as he goes around them trying to help the electors or when he is working in electorates which cover big areas that have a sparse population. Compare the situation in those electorates with the situation in city electorates, some  of  which have been reported as covering only a handful of square miles and around which the member can drive before breakfast. I have said that in the more sparsely populated areas the constituents have the greatest difficulty in contacting their member and having a personal interview with him. True, they can write to him but that is not the same. Many electors like to meet their member, have  a  talk to him and put their problems  to  him. Government senators have staled here last night and today that there have been  no  complaints from their members for the electorates of Kalgoorlie, Leichhardt and Grey,  to  mention but three. </para>

              <para>-  I said that last night Government senators said that their members for the 3 electorates that I have mentioned support the Bill, and have said they have had no complaints from their electorates. I am saying that the electors have complained to us and to other honourable senators that they cannot find their members, they cannot see them and they cannot get in touch with them. The electorates are too big. </para>

          <para>I shall mention the position in the United States of America which has been referred to several times. Until recently the State legislatures drew up the boundaries for the congressional seats. This arrangement has apparently worked pretty well. Congress was told that it could have so many seats in such and such a State and the electorates were drawn up. It has not been left to the Federal legislature to redistribute in the United States. I now come to the Mother of Parliaments in the United Kingdom. The electorate of Kelvingrove has 19,019 voters as compared to the electorate of Antrim (South) which has 144,734 voters. </para>

              <para>- Just recently we have heard a lot about one vote one value. I am not saying that we condone this; I am not saying that it is right. But our position is not too bad when compared with the position in some of these other countries. I am pointing out what happens in other countries. I am pointing this out to answer the one vote one value argument. In the electorate of Kelvingrove in the United Kingdom it took 6,106 votes to elect a Labor man. Yet in the electorate of Billericay in Essex it took 47,700 votes to elect a Conservative member. Is that one vote one value? I say that it is not. </para>

              <para>-  I gave the number in the electorate, originally. This situation has been in operation for a long time in the Mother of Parliaments in the United Kingdom. They do not have redistributions too often. Labor governments and Conservative governments have been in office for a good while, and they have not seen fit to change the position. They thought that it was suitable for the. Mother of Parliaments, the home of democracy. It is interesting to note that in Britain an Act was passed to reduce the frequency of redistribution to between 10 and 15 years. Here we want to make the period much shorter than that. </para>

              <para>- The United Kingdom found these arrangements very suitable and I see no reason why we in Australia should not do the same thing and have longer periods between redistributions with a bigger margin of tolerance. There is nothing to stop the present Government from having a redistribution under the present Act if it wants to, except in Western Australia. We agree that it is necessary to have a redistribution in Western Australia. I suggest that if the Government wants to get on with the redistribution it could so so. This is a Bill to diminish the representation of areas outside the big cities and to increase the representation of the big cities. Today almost half Australia&#39;s population is in Sydney, Melbourne and the satellite cities. If this Bill is carried and put into effect Australia, in the numbers game, will be. dominated by Sydney and Melbourne. </para>

              <para>- When the sitting of the Senate was suspended I was just concluding my address on the Commonwealth Electoral Bill (No. 2). I had said that almost half of Australia&#39;s population is now located in Sydney and Melbourne and satellite cities, and that if this Bill were carried and its provisions put into effect Australia, under this numbers game, would be dominated by Sydney and Melbourne. The areas which earn most of Australia&#39;s export income would have even less say in the government of the country. Their voice in Canberra would be much weaker. 1 refer now to balanced development. If this Bill were carried and its provisions put into effect, I just wonder whether we would only be paying lip service to. balanced development. I think the whole scheme is part of ari overall plan to develop Sydney and Melbourne at the expense of the rest of Australia. I believe that the Bill is part of a master plan to enable the Government to centralise and socialise everything in Australia, to destroy our federal system of strong States united in a federation, and to centralise all power in Canberra. I believe that the Australian electoral system compares more than favourably with those used in most other democratic countries. We have a system of compulsory voting. We also have a preferential system of voting which enables the person who votes to have a second or a third choice which is taken into consideration if his man does not get enough primary votes. I believe that except in Western Australia, redistribution is not justifiable at present. I believe that when it becomes necessary for a redistribution to take place the existing tolerance of 20 per cent should remain unaltered for the reasons I have already stated. I believe, too, that the Australian electorates are fairly drawn at present, otherwise the Australian Labor Party could not have won its way to the Treasury bench on 2nd December last. The more sparsely settled areas should have fewer electors in each electorate than the closely settled areas, as at present is the case. I ask the Senate to reject the Bill. </para>

          <para class="block">This amendment affects the proportioning of electoral strength between rural, electorates and city electorates and reduces the amount of. disparity from the quota from 20. per cent to 10 per cent. If any measure were .needed to restrict the Government in doing what, the Opposition has been accusing us of doing - I refer to the ability of a government to gerrymander - this measure would be ari added restriction. It surprises me to hear &#39;coming from the Opposition senators, particularly from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> the type of proposition which they have brought forth, namely, that the Government, the Labor Party, is endeavouring by means of this Bill to carry out a gerrymander of some sort to load the electorates in such a way as to perpetuate ourselves in government for an indefinite number of years. This is an outrageous suggestion. The proposition in the Bill is to limit the ability of any party so to do. For the long period of 23 years when the Opposition was in government it endeavoured to misuse the Commonwealth Electoral Act to its own advantage and, of course, this was to the disadvantage of the nation. </para>
          <para>If we believe in a 2-party parliamentary system, if we believe in democracy, if we believe that Parliament should be responsive to the will of the people, it is necessary that we give to the commissioners who are responsible for redistribution guidelines which will enable them to present us with a redistribution which gives equal value to each electorate. At the present time that is not the case. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> clearly stated last night in the most impressive speech of this debate, this has not been the case federally; it certainly has not been the case in Queensland; and it certainly has not been the case in other States. The electoral system, as it exists at the moment, has enabled one party, with the support of a minority party, to stay in power for 23 years. No democratic form of government can survive when one party stays in power for 23 years. When we seek to bring in an amendment to correct this position we are criticised and accused of endeavouring to take away from the people their rights within the electorates. Let us not forget that in the Senate each State is equally represented and each State has equal rights. The method by which they are elected has nothing to do with the end result. Whether there are fewer people in Tasmania than there are in Queensland or New South Wales, the purpose of this chamber is to have equal representation from each of the States. This is achieved. What we are suggesting is that each electorate for the House of Representatives shall have equal value, as far as is possible. That is the purpose of this Bill. </para>
          <para>To my mind the Bill does not go far enough. It improves the position by reducing the tolerance from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, which restricts the ability of any Party or any government to misuse a redistribution, if such a thing can happen. To a certain extent I am prepared to resist this. I believe that under the guidelines given by governments the distribution commissioners have endeavoured to do their best, but given the 20 per cent tolerance they have had far too much latitude. Virtually they have been given a direction from the Government that the guidelines per mit them to allow for this 20 per cent tolerance either way. This has meant in effect that the rural electorates have been advantaged while&#39; the more populous city electorates have been disadvantaged. Therefore, in this respect this Bill provides a definite improvement. </para>
          <para>This Bill is one of several that will come before this Parliament and each must be treated on its merits. This Bill should be supported. I am surprised at the attitude taken to it by the Opposition which has heaped abuse upon the. Government. We heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> the scare tactic used by the Australian Democratic Labor Party prior to the election on 2nd December. The tactic used on that occasion by the DLP was that if the people elected the Australian Labor Party to government it would change the electoral system and would stay in power indefinitely. Perhaps the DLP was judging the Labor Party by its own standards, the standards set by its Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> while he was Premier of Queensland. He was perhaps the best gerrymanderer of them all. He loaded the electoral system in Queensland so that even when the Opposition Party obtained more than 50 per cent of the votes it remained in Opposition with a minority of the seats. The example set by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> who is now Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, was promptly followed by the Country Party in Queensland led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen,</inline> whose efforts at gerrymandering have exceeded the efforts of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> as was shown by the election results outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ron</inline> McAuliffe last night, that is, that the Party with the minority of support is in power because of the electoral system operating in Queensland. </para>
          <para>It is important that in this nation we support the 2-party system which has survived so well in Great Britain. That system depends upon certain discipline. It depends upon party discipline. What is more, it depends on something that the Opposition abhors - the first past the post method of election. Providing that the electorates are of equal value throughout Australia, the first past the post system is the most honest, the most sensible, the most effective, the most simple way of electing a government to power. That system does not deny the minority parties a right to be represented in Parliament. In fact, where there are 5 candidates it offers a better chance for a candidate representing a minority party to be elected. Taking it for granted that in this case each of the electorates within Australia is of equal value, a minority party fielding a good candidate and with a good policy can achieve representation in the Parliament by gaining 30 per cent of the vote within that electorate. Why not? Why should not that be the case? </para>
          <para>Let us consider a system which, although it is not the best, is the best of those available. Lc.t us consider the preference system that has been foist upon us for so long and which gives so much power to a minority party such as the DLP. Use of the preference system in Australia has made it possible for the DLP and other minority parties to influence the Government. That system can decide which Party shall rule. Its use has negated the 2- party system. The preference system which is illegal in the United States of America and the United Kingdom does not give the best result. Why should I who have always supported the strongest party in an electorate and have always voted for the strongest candidate, be denied my preference when the second and third parties are allowed to play their preferences backwards and forwards? 1 support the strongest party in an electorate and have done so year after year but my preference has not been counted. I wanted the Australian Labor Party candidate to be elected. He was the strongest candidate and be topped the list, but when it came to counting the votes I found that he was not elected. Do I get a preference? Can I say that since John Smith, the Australian Labor Parry candidate, has not been elected, I do not want Billy Jones but 1 want Clarrie Harvey, or some other candidate? Why should not my preference be counted? But it is riot counted. The strongest party in an electorate, is denied the right of preference. This multitude of opinion, these opposition parties - the Country Party, the Liberal Party, the Democratic Labor Party, the Independents - continually assert that the preference system is the best method. It is not. </para>
          <para>There is a better method, a method between the preferential system and the first past the post system. I refer to the optional preference system. In that situation I can say that I want that particular person and no other. I can mark my vote against one candidate on the ballot paper and against no other candidate. Under the present situation -that vote is informal, but under the selective preferential system it would be counted, as would those of people who vote first for a certain candidate and then show their preferences down the line, 2, 3, 4, 5. What is wrong with that system? Why should so many votes be declared informal? I recall that in the electorate of Lilley it took 2 weeks for the result to be decided. We were scrutineering night after night until the early hours of the morning. I clearly recall how many votes were discarded as informal because the voter had placed &#39;1&#39; against the name df the candidate that he wanted but had not placed any other figures against the names of the other candidates. Why should not that elector&#39;s vote be valid? The preference system does not work because it is under direction from a political party. In fact it is under direction from the minority party. In the electorate of Lilley the preference system did not really operate because the party directed how an elector should vote when he went to the polling booth and received a card. So, in effect, to a certain extent preferences are a confidence vote imposed upon the electorate&#39; by the minority party which endeavours to frustrate the will of the majority of the people. </para>

              <para>- Let me tell the honourable senator that the seat of Lilley was won by a narrow margin by the Australian Labor Party on DLP preferences; much to the discomfort of Kevin Cairns &#39; who depended so much on those DLP preferences. The Australian Labor Party won on DLP preferences; the preferences were those of absentee voters. They were absentee voters who were not under the direction of the Democratic Labor Party. </para>

              <para>- Yes, we put out *how to vote&#39; cards. The point that I am making and which members of the DLP are supporting is that the preferential system does not really operate as it is intended. Firstly, the people who vote for the strongest candidate do not have their preferences counted &#39; and, besides, the other preferences are allocated at the direction of the Party. In the case of Lilley, it was the minority party. The proposition contained in this Bill ought to be supported but the 3 Opposition Parties - the trinity, and what an evil trinity it is - have decided to oppose it. Not only will they oppose this legislation but also will they oppose other legislation to be introduced. The Opposition Parties are on a collision course with the Government. This will be to their own disadvantage. They intend not only to object to and to frustrate the passage of this Bill but also to frustrate other electoral reforms. They have predetermined their attitude just as they predetermined their preferences at election time. That is how they have aborted, if I may use that word, the whole system. </para>

I can think of other systems of government and in particular one system of government which possibly would be to the advantage of this country as well as to the advantage of small and rapidly developing countries. However, I will not throw that cat amongst the pigeons tonight unless I am forced to. </para>

              <para>- It is the one party system. The one party system of government is in operation in many Commonwealth countries. The honourable senator should not decry it. Many countries are members of the Commonwealth of Nations, part of our Commonwealth, and have a one party system. They do not govern any less effectively than we do at the present time. I will speak now of the proportional system which the DLP has indicated it will support. The DLP is proposing to move an amendment to this Bill seeking to introduce the proportional system of voting. The DLP states that that method will give each vote an equal value. In judging that system the end result is important. What would happen in the Parliament under a proportional system? An effective government of the type which we have depended on for so long under the 2-party system is not achieved. The proportional representation method applied to House of Representatives elections will do to that House what the proportional representation method has done to this House. To the House of Representatives will be elected a multiplicity of parties to be bought and sold, as has happened in many European countries which have endeavoured to use that system. There would be a multiplicity of small parties owing no allegiance one to the other, changing their position within the Parliament, serving their own narrow purposes, frustrating the continuity of government and destroying what we have become used to in Australia and in the United Kingdom, that is, the 2-party system. That party system imposes a discipline upon members and protects members from other influences. What happens under a multi-party system? The result is the type of chaos which occurred in France and which led to a guided democracy and then a virtual dictatorship. </para>

              <para>- No. Independent senators hold the balance of power in this place and they have no right to hold that balance of power. They do not have the right to hold the balance of power as they do at the present time to frustrate the will of the people. They vote as they wish. The whole of this Parliament is subjected to the vagaries of the attitudes of independent senators. In the 2-party system of government with the first past the post method of voting independent senators would have to decide to what side of the Parliament they would contribute their talents. I would suggest to those honourable senators that they should make up thenminds as to which Party they should belong and then join that Party so that we can return to a 2-party system which will give continuity of government to this country. </para>

          <para>At the present time the whole of this country is frustrated by the efforts of the DLP. One only has to witness what has occurred in this House in the past 2 or 3 weeks to see an example of the irresponsibility of a minority party. This small groups does not even hold Caucus meetings. Its members can gather in the corridors of Parliament House. As one honourable senator suggested the other night, they can even meet in a telephone box. They do not need to hold Caucus meetings. They merely ring each other by telephone to suggest to one another the course that they will adopt on legislation. They come into this place and move motions which are supported by the Country Party - another quasi minority group - and the Liberal Party to frustrate the will of the Senate. They frustrate not only the will of this place but also the will of the government which was elected by the people. </para>

              <para>- What percentage of the vote did your Party obtain? It was about 30 per cent! What percentage did the Country Party poll? It received about 9 per cent. What percentage did the DLP obtain? It was about 5 per cent - a minority vote. But the DLP has the audacity to challenge the rights of a Party which attracted 49 per cent of the votes. The DLP is frustrating the Government&#39;s efforts. What the DLP deserves and what it will get because of its attitude is, soon enough, a double dissolution which will force the DLP to make up its mind which Party it supports. </para>

          <para>We need a simple form of election. The electorate requires that regularly, but not too often, it shall be required to vote for either one party or another. It should have a simple form for and method of electing a representative. It should be required to vote only for the person that it wants and should not be forced to vote preferentially by placing &#39;2&#39;, *3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;, and &#39;5&#39;, for example, against the names of other candidates giving such preferences a value equal to the first preference vote. It should not be required to do that. If a first past the post voting system is not acceptable, surely preferences can be indicated or not indicated. Either manner of voting ought to be valid. But what happens when we suggest such a thing and when we anticipate that such legislation might come forward? We &#39; heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> rise and state what we normally hear from members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party - that what we are out to do is to distort the electoral system and endeavour to place ourselves in power for a limitless number of years. What we really deserve as a Party is to have at least 20 years in government to make up for the 23 years during which the LiberalCountry Party Government made a shocking mess of the economy and of this country. I do not believe in this system. 1 have indicated what sort of an electoral system I would have if I had my way. But I could not even get support for it within my own Party- </para>

              <para>- I will .direct my remarks to the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> we have not had the benefit pf your chairmanship in the Senate for the last day or sp. For that reason the debates have ranged right across not only Bills introduced &#39; in the past but also Bills to be introduced in the future. When I commenced my remarks I indicated that tonight the Senate was concerned with a simple proposition; to reduce the permissible disparity between electorates from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. I even read out the title of the Bill. I have been indicating that the Bill would lessen the ability of any party to conduct a gerrymander. Instead of that being accepted by the Opposition, we have had outraged criticism from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie, Senator Carrick, Senator Byrne</inline> and other honourable senators opposite. </para>

          <para>If we are to have the democratic system of government to which we are accustomed, we must have a system which will make this Parliament responsible to the will of the people. This can be done only if the electorates are of equal value. It can be done only if there is a clear indication within each of these electorates of whom the people want. It should not be confused by some quasi preference system which has been imposed upon us for so long. Nevertheless, as you have indicated, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> the Bill has nothing to do with this. 1 suggest that such a simple Bill as this Bill should receive a speedy passage. Of course, it is not likely to have a speedy passage because for some reason the Opposition has decided to oppose it. It has also decided to oppose other Bills and indicated that although it will give a speedy passage to the bills that it supports, it will do its best to resist other bills. As far as I can gather, there is hardly a bill that it accepts. </para>

              <para>- Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President.</inline> I was in the course of saying that I believe that the Commonwealth democratic system, as operated by the Commonwealth Parliament since Federation, has reflected the will of the people, with few exceptions, better than those systems operated in most other countries. I would say that one of the exceptions would be  New Zealand. It has been reiterated during the course of this debate that the strength of political parties in the Parliament has reflected the number of votes that were cast for them in the electorates. This Bill is a pointer, a pipe opener or an indication of what, is yet  to come. We have heard something about the first past the post voting system. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Georges would use that system to obliterate small political parties. He would stifle their influence, nullify their preferences and eventually evolve a system under which only 2 parties would be elected to the Parliament. </para>

              <para>- Yes, I think that the honourable senator got it down to one party. The same first past the post system in the United Kingdom reduced the once great Liberal Party in that country to a party comprising 11 members in a House of approximately 600 members. As Lloyd George used to say, at every election his Party used to be tripped by the triangle. . It continued until there evolved a system in the United Kingdom under which there were only 2 parties. I have been amazed at times at the reflection of the votes cast because the votes cast for  a  certain political party were in no way reflected in the percentage of members returned. It seems to me to be  a  most haphazard, go-as-you-please method of electing  a  - Parliament. Contrasted to this, it has been claimed that the Tasmanian system is as near as possible to perfection, even with all its disabilities, inasmuch as the percentage of people who vote for the Labor Party, for example, is reflected in almost the same percentage of Labor members elected. In the United Kingdom it is hard to imagine such a system when comparing the number of electors who voted for a particular party with the number of members of that party who were elected to the Parliament. I believe that a lot of that trouble was due to the first past the post system that operated in that country. </para>

          <para>This Bill is a pointer. It does not contain much. The crux of the Bill is to be found in that part of the second reading speech of the Attorney-General and Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> which dealt with deleting references to disabilities arising out of remoteness or distance, the density or sparsity of population of the division, the area of the division and so on. He also spoke about altering the 20 per cent discretion to a 10 per cent discretion. A lot of the arguments which were used by supporters of the Bill fall to the ground.

I would not treat the people like a lot of cows and herd them into electorates which are supposedly equal in number of voters and not have regard to the problems which are confronting them and the type of representation which is necessary for them. A lot of the arguments of supporters of the Bill fall to the ground by reason of the fact that we are not dealing in any way with a normal country. Australia is not a normal country. Fourteen years have elapsed since the report of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review was tabled in this place.

              <para>- It is since 1969 that this growth towards centralisation has accelerated at such an alarming rate. The Bill has come at a time when the Government is proposing to do something about halting that acceleration. The Government has talked about the Albury-Wodonga scheme and other things. It has tried to do something about this monstrously centralised population which has no equal anywhere on earth. Senators, without any regard to that fact, talk about one man one vote under conditions in which the metropolitan area of Sydney alone elects as many members of the House of Representatives as do the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania combined. Is that a healthy sign? </para>

I  Van  think of no worse fate which could befall this country than that it should have one House of Parliament in the Federal sphere. Honourable senators should remember the position in respect of delegated State powers. The State parliaments will lose all their powers except those delegated to them. I cannot think of anything worse than the abolition of the Senate which would mean that the holding of power and the concentration of power was in the hands of a coterie which was largely from the big cities of Melbourne and Sydney. I cannot think of anything more calculated to rend Australia asunder. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable senator had taken some regard of the evils of excessive centralisation in history he might have said something very different to that. I wish to say a word or two about this fetish of one man one vote in this country where most of the people are herded into the cities. The Government proposes to apply that principle. There would be some logic in applying it in a country such as the United Kingdom. In my view, to try to apply it in a country such as Australia is sheer lunacy. But it is a fetish, a Wi&#39;l-o&#39;-th&#39;-Wisp, a delusion. The Minister, in his second reading speech, mentioned certain electorates, and I took note of the fact that in one electorate 43 per cent of the population did not have a vote. I suppose that they were not old enough to have a vote. In another electorate 60 per cent of the population did not have a vote. It was rumoured, it was reported and it was said in this place that the fairest way in which to perfect this one man one vote principle was to divide electorates so that they were commensurate with their populations. If we did that we would get a terrific disparity in regard to the people who actually voted. Eventually we would reach the stage, I think, at which we were just chasing a Will-o&#39;-th&#39;-Wisp. It is all very fine to try to apply these things when some political advantage is to be gained from them. In this place last year I heard the story about a union election. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I think 18,000 members did not get a ballot paper. That is one of the unions upon which the Labor Party claims that it is based. Now it proposes to bring forward legislation to facilitate the amalgamation of trade unions. That legislation will provide that only half of the membership of a union need vote on a proposed amalgamation and that only half of the membership voting need vote in favour of the proposed amalgamation for it to be given effect. In other words, just over a quarter of the membership of a union could effect an amalgamation that affects all of the members of the trade union concerned. There is a lot of merit in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> has said about this matter.

Years ago during the term of office of the Curtin Government I did something which I seldom do but which I have never forgotten - I sat at home and listened to a Parliamentary broadcast. Most of the speeches were sanctimonious speeches about a sacred principle that is enshrined in the platform of the Australian Labor Party, that is, the principle of one man one vote one value. Speech after speech was delivered on that occasion as to how this was the very essence of democracy. I have never forgotten that. It is one of those things that through the course of my lifetime has remained fixed in my mind.

I was a lot more innocent then than I am now, although I suppose I am still innocent. Billy Hughes was speaking about the kind of people whom I have heard delivering high principled speeches about how important it was that all the tenets of democracy should be observed to the utmost. Whenever I have heard that fantasy trotted out - it is fantasy because it is impossible to achieve - I have been left as cold as a stone. I shall cast my vote against this Bill. I take no notice of the various threats that have been handed out. </para>

            <para>- Opposition speakers have accused the Government of deliberately setting out in this legislation to secure a gerrymander of the electorate. What has in fact been happening, especially since 1966, is that the electorate has been intolerably weighted in favour of  a  minority Party in this Parliament, namely, the Australian Country Party. This Bill explicitly sets out to make the electoral weighting the same as it was before 1965. It is true that the one-fifth provision has been in existence since federation but the legislation was worded in such a way as to make it exceptional for a 10 per cent differential to be exceeded. The opposition to this Bill on the part of the members of the Liberal Party of Australia and, more particularly, the Country Party amounts to an example of what 1 would regard as political hypocrisy. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Since the Electoral Act of 1902, a 20 per cent weighting discretion in favour of rural electorates has ben allowed. Notwithstanding that allowance, and having regard to the conditions that existed in the first half of this century compared with the conditions that exist at this time - Australia has transformed itself from being only a primary production country to a primary production and manufacturing country - it was the custom and practice to have only a 1.0 per cent tolerance. Indeed, despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> of the Liberal Party had to say last night, a 10 per cent electoral tolerance was recommended by the all-Party Joint Committee on Constitutional Review, which was set up in 1956 and which reported to the Parliament in 1959. </para>
          <para>Serving on that Committee were some very eminent members of the Australian Parliament. One still sits in this chamber, namely. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who is a Liberal Party senator from Tasmania and who was a Minister in the previous Government. There were 2 members of the Country Party on the Committee, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamilton</inline> and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Drummond.</inline> The 4 members of the Liberal Party on the Committee were all lawyers. They were <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neil</inline> O&#39;sullivan; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> to whom I have referred; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alec</inline> Downer, who was a Minister for Immigration in the Menzies Government and later High Commissioner for Australia in the United Kingdom; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Joske,</inline> Q.C., as he was at that time, but who is now  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Joske of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. The Labor movement, which was at that time in Opposition, was represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> who was an eminent member of the Senate and a distinguished lawyer for many years; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> the present Prime Minister of Australia; and 4 members of a previous Labor Ministry, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Calwell, Mr Ward, Mr Pollard</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly.</inline></para>

            <para>The Committee considered the extent of! the problems which would arise from inserting in the Constitution a requirement that no division in a State should depart from the quota for that State to a greater extent than one-tenth more or one-tenth less. The Committee was assisted in its task by the then Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr L.</inline> Ainsworth, who also obtained the views of tha Commonwealth Electoral Officer and the Surveyor-General for each of the States.

The policy states that the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review will be implemented by a Labor Government. </para>

          <para class="block">That was when they were in government. They are still trying to tell this Government what we should do, but we will not tolerate that. In 1965 an amendment to the Electoral Act was passed, encouraging a 20 per cent tolerance to be allowed in order, to keep the Country Party alive in this Parliament. But if in 1959 an all-party Committee, comprising members of the then coalition Government - members of the Liberal Party and members of the Country Party who were in the minority in the coalition Government - and distinguished members of the then Opposition, the Labor movement, could reach a unanimous decision on a 10 per cent weighting, what is the difference now, or what suddenly became the difference in  1965  when a member of the Country Party for the first time in the political history of this country, as far as I can recall, became Minister for the Interior and responsible for the administration of the Electoral Act? </para>
          <para>As I have said, it is blatant political hypocrisy for members of the Opposition now to favour retaining the Country Party pressured amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which came into being in  1965  in opposition to an expressed all-party opinion of  1959.  Having regard to present day conditions in Australia, obviously the Act is outdated and outmoded. Let us face it. It is the usual practice following the taking of a census to proceed with a redistribution in all States to remove the malapportionment of electorates for the House of Representatives. Clearly the purpose of this Bill as has been stated by the Minister who introduced it, is to bring down legislation which will establish a quality of representation, a standard of representation, equality of representation as the paramount objective in the redistribution of a State into electoral divisions. As I said earlier, what this Bill does is explicitly make the electoral weighting as it was in custom and practice between  1902  and  1965.  It is true as I have said that the one-fifth provision has existed since federation, but the wording of the section was stated in such a way as to make it exceptional to exceed a  10  per cent differential. </para>
          <para>When the amendments were inserted in  1965,  according to Professor Crisp in his book &#39;Australian National Government&#39;, the wording encouraged its use because in the  1934, 1948  and  1955  redistributions only one electorate ever went below the  10  per cent quota, and that was the electorate of Darling which was held- always, as far as i can recall, by a member of the Labor movement. Some electorates went to  12  per cent and  15  per cent but none, so far as I can ascertain, ever went to  20  per cent. But in  1968, 5  electorates went above the quota of  10  per cent - this was after the  1965  Electoral Act which was put through by the Country Party - and  8  fell below. </para>
          <para>I have heard it said, and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> was the latest to say it, that opponents of the proposal for  10  per cent in the present Bill indicate the wide differentiations that occur in Great Britain and in Canada. On the other hand, however, our sister Dominion of New Zealand allows only a  5  per cent differential on the quota. We say plainly that it is the policy of the Australian Labor Government, the Labor movement, that in no terms should a person&#39;s vote depend on his geographical location. Commonwealth law fails in several ways to provide that one elector&#39;s vote shall carry the same value as does another&#39;s. That is part of the paramount importance of this legislation - equality of representation as far as is practically possible. The provisions of the outdated Electoral Act which we are seeking to reform by this legislation have allowed the distribution commissioners to set boundaries enclosing populations in particular electorates up to  20  per cent above or  20  per cent below a State quota figure. Since  1968  this power to vary electorate size from the quota has been applied principally by the commissioners to produce some rural electorates well below the quota and some urban electorates well above the quota. So there is a disparity in representation whereby a person living in an outlying area, in a rural community, can have a vote nearly twice the value of that of a person who lives in an urban electorate. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Constitutional Review to which  1  have already referred was not particularly happy about that type of gerrymander. At paragraphs  328, 329  and  330  the unanimous all-Party Committee had this to say:  328. The Committee concluded that the absence of constitutional guarantees in the Commonwealth Constitution had not prevented the rule of law from characterising the Australian way of life. The Committee believes that as long as governments are democratically elected and there is full parliamentary responsibility to the electors, the protection of personal rights will, in practice, be secure in Australia. The Committee has nol chosen, therefore, to recommend the writing into the Constitution of a charter of individual liberties. Instead, the Committee considers it appropriate, at this stage of Federal history and having regard to recent and contemporary world events, to recommend a constitutional amendment to protect the position of the elector and the democratic processes essential to the proper functioning of the Federal Parliament 329. Thus, the Committee concluded that it should recommend the inclusion in the Constitution of provisions ensuring the regular review of the electoral divisions of each State and also accord near uniformity to the value accorded to the votes of the electors for each of the States. </para>
          <para class="block">That is what this legislation is doing. In paragraph  330  the Committee went on to say:  330. One form of gerrymandering is the creation of electoral divisions in which there are substantial  disparities in the number of enrolled voters, so securing for a political party greater representation than it should have. </para>
          <para>That was the 1965 amendment of the Electoral Act by the Australian Country Party. The Committee went on: </para>
          <para>In making possible minority governments, the majority can be deprived of the Government of its choice and the way is opened for arbitrary action impairing the freedom of the individual even though that action stands condemned by the majority of the people who comprise the electors of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>Year in and year out, on the total aggregate of votes cast throughout Australia at Federal elections, generally speaking the Labor movement has secured more votes than the total votes of the Liberal Party, Country Party and Democratic Labor Party put together. </para>

              <para>- At the last election we received the overwhelming number of votes and for the first time, thank goodness, despite the gerrymander of the honourable senator&#39;s Party in 1965, the electoral weight of the people was so much against the then Government that they threw it out of office and now we are trying to bring parliamentary democracy back into the Australian electorate by reducing the 20 per cent disparity to what was normal custom, practice and tradition until 1965. Professor Crisp had something to say also on the 1965 legislation in his publication &#39;Australian National Government&#39;. Professor Crisp, as all honourable senators will know, is a distinguished professor of political science in Australia. </para>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Not more than 10 per cent, I emphasise -   the Leader of the Country Party and  Deputy  Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McEwen,</inline> between 1963 and 1965 prevailed on his Liberal colleagues in the composite Ministry, not only to retain the 20 per cent tolerance, but to amend the Act in ways calculated to permit a gerrymander - </para>
          <para>And he uses the word -   . . in favour of rural electors. In May 1965, the Country Party Minister for the Interior, J. D. Anthony, moved and carried the necessary amendments to the Electoral Act to open the way for the basis of territorial representation&#39; (or gerrymander) which, in a speech of June 1964, he also had declared to be his aim. </para>
          <para>There was no crude zoning of rural and metropolitan areas and fixing of different quotas of electors or aggregates of seats for each zone as has occurred in the more shameless of the State gerrymanders. The McEwen-Anthony formula was less blatant. First, the considerations&#39; to be taken into account by the Commissioners in drawing electorate boundaries were increased in number, with some of them being worded or re-worded to sharpen the requirement that rural electors be favoured. Secondly, the opportunities for interests and parties to apply pressure to the Commissioners in terms of the statutory considerations so favourable to rural electors were multiplied and made more open and pressure more difficult to resist. Both before they commence work and after they have drafted their proposed electorate boundaries there will be statutory &#39;open seasons&#39; for pressure to be applied. Moreover, the Chief Electoral Officer, who is responsible to the Minister for the Interior, has now been required, in the words of the Minister&#39;s Second Reading speech, &#39;to arrange for consultations between the Distribution Commissioners appointed for the several States for the purpose of obtaining uniformity in procedures and to ensure the proper interpretation of the law by the Commissioners&#39;. Thirdly, in the&#39; absence from the Act for the first time of any statement that the basic norm should be the quota figure or the democratic ideal of &#39;one adult- one vote - one value&#39;, the legislation can, as It was undoubtedly intended to do, produce only  a  rural-oriented gerrymander. Finally, the Country Party, if still unhappy with the outcome, may, as it did in 1962, seek the support of&#39; one or other of the major parties to throw out the Commissioners&#39; redistribution plans when they are tabled in Parliament. </para>
          <para class="block">Time has just about concluded for me. J wish to reply to 2 matters in relation to which the Government has been subjected to criticism during this debate. </para>
          <para>Two reasons have been propounded - mainly by members of the Australian Country Party - as to why the existing 20 per cent discretionary allowance should be maintained rather than 10 per cent proposed by the Government. The 2 arguments put forward by the Country Party to justify what one might call over-representation of rural areas were, firstly, that an area manageable in terms of transport and communication by the local member is essential and, secondly, that rural economic interests, particularly exports, are so important to the national economy that they must  have adequate representation. Frankly, the first argument can be dismissed easily because there is no evidence whatever that in the 23 years of the Liberal-Country Party coalition any real attempt was made to decentralise and develop country areas. Indeed, it was anathema to the coalition because decentralisation would bring workers into country areas and these might be prepared to vote for the Labor Party. That is the reason why few, if any, decentralisation policies were put into effect by previous governments during their 23 years of office. </para>
          <para>They have relied on the argument of local community of interest. Lel us take the electorate of Lyne in New South Wales which is represented by the Country Party. It is on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. It starts in the industrial area of Stockton, a suburb of Newcastle, where the workers are engaged in heavy industrial plants in and around the city of Newcastle. It goes up the coast to Port Macquarie, through the dairying district of Taree and the tourist region of Port Macquarie, Wauchope and other areas. Then it suddenly jumps the Great Dividing Range and goes to Walcha where there are grazing and timber interests. </para>

              <para>- That is OK. The Commonwealth Electoral Bill (No. 2) is the first episode in a long story of electoral jobbery which is about to unfold. Let there be no doubt about that. The Minister for Services and Property <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly),</inline> in his second reading speech in another place, promised a full scale review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. It has been said that he proposes about 100 amendments to the Act. So we have his word for it that a full scale review is proposed and that he hopes the amendments will be passed into law before the next election for the House of Representatives and the Senate. 1 understand that today the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> has issued further threats about a double dissolution unless his Bills are passed without delay in the Senate. Let me say on behalf of my Party that threats of a double dissolution hold no terror for us. The Minister has promised a full scale review of the Act. He has promised extensive amendments to it. In less formal language, the Minister is promising the Australian Labor Party members of parliament a safe tenure of office by gerrymander. </para>

          <para>The Prime Minister tested the wind quite recently for wholesale scrapping of the Act when he floated the idea of optional preferential voting. It will be recalled that during the last election campaign the Prime Minister said, when finally smoked out by the advertising campaign of the Democratic Labor Party, that he did not intend to alter the Act to a first past the post voting system until after the next election. Very recently he tested the wind by proposing his idea of optional preferential voting. Honourable senators will know, as everybody knows, that optional preferential voting is just a slight modification of first past the post voting. </para>

Of course, that is not necessarily a precedent which you would feel obliged to follow but I merely draw your attention to the fact - perhaps you were not in the chamber at the time - that tolerance has been extended where perhaps it was necessary to do so. I suggest that you may well take the same attitude. However, I understand that you are not bound by any departure and the precedent established by the previous occupant of the Chair. </para>

              <para>-  1 will not refer any further to first past the post voting since it upsets the Government senators to such an extent. However, I do want to say that the Prime Minister, having promised on the election eve not to introduce first past the post voting until after the next election, did talk about a system of optional preferential voting. He completely disregarded the promise he made on the eve of the election, which shows just how dubious the Prime Minister&#39;s promises are. I am reminded that they are like cats&#39; licences. Renewal is necessary every 4 months for them to be valid. The Prime Minister was forced to run for cover in relation to preferential voting, but &#39;let us have no doubt about the fact that the Government is still sponsoring this Bill as the first of a series of measures aimed at perpetuating the ALP in office by gerrymander. </para>

          <para>Much has been said about the inequalities of the electoral system. Let us have a look at some of the accusations that Labor has made about the present system being rigged against it. lt is interesting to note that every time a Labor spokesman endeavours to present an argument in support of his case that the present system is loaded against his party he always ignores the DLP vote when doing his sums. Of course, the truth is that the present Act is not at all unkind to the ALP. Let us look at the facts. The facts are that the system was never as unkind to the ALP as the electors have been, although it is worth saying that the system has been very unkind to the DLP. </para>
          <para>The election results since 1958 show that the Labor Party failed to win office whenever the people wanted out. On no occasion has the Labor Party been unfairly denied Federal office. In 1958, 42.8 per cent of Australian electors wanted a Labor government and 55.9 per cent of the Australian voters made it clear by supporting the DLP, the Country Party and the Liberal Party that they did not want a Labor government. In 1961, 47.9 per cent voted for a Labor government while 50.8 per cent voted against it. In 1963, 45.5 per cent voted for a Labor government while 53.4 per cent voted to prevent a Labor government from coming to office. In 1966, 40 per cent of the Australian electors showed by their votes that they wanted a Labor government while 57.2 per cent showed they did not. In 1969, 47 per cent showed by their votes that they wanted Labor government while 49.4 per cent were decisively opposed to it. </para>

              <para>- One cannot get away from these facts. The Australian Labor Party claims to be the biggest party in the country. We should not disguise the fact that this Government has never won the support of the majority of the Australian electors, that it has never won 50 per cent plus one of the votes in any election held from 1958 up to and including 1972. </para>

              <para>- That is not the question. In December 1972 the ALP won 49.59 per cent of the total votes cast. It was forced to depend upon the silver tailed pseudo-radicals of the Australia Party to gain office. The Party falsely claiming to be the Party of the workers depends for election on the whims of a millionaire and his hobby. Let us clear away once and for all this nonsense about the present Act being loaded unfairly against the Labor Party. That statement is just not true. Since 1958, the present electoral system has rewarded with office the parties able to muster more votes than their opponents. This is shown in the record. The fact that the ALP now governs with a minority - it has done so since the 1972 election - is an example of this, and it certainly is an argument in support of and not against the present system. </para>

              <para>- 1 do not like to hear this when we are dealing with a Bill. This Bill relates to the distribution of the States into electoral divisions. The opinion of someone about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> is irrelevant to the Bill unless that opinion relates to the distribution of electoral divisions. My previous point was that the whole question of the voting system was outside the ambit of the Bill.  I  appreciate that when 1 took that point of order some speakers had been wandering from the Bill to deal with elections, but surely a criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> does not help our discussion on this Bill.  I  respectfully submit that the honourable senator must keep his remarks somewhere near the point of relevancy. </para>

          <para class="block">My point is that the Government&#39;s contempt for democracy extends into this Parliament, and therefore this chamber must be very careful about accepting any proposed amendments to the Electoral Act which would perpetuate this Government in office. During the course of this debate one Labor Party supporter - I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> - referred to amendments made to the New South Wales Electoral Act by a Labor administration. He went to great lengths to instance the defeat of the Renshaw Government in 1965 as a case to prove just how fair and democratic the Labor Party was in New South Wales. Of course he did not spell out exactly what he meant by that remark. Everybody knows that the Renshaw Government was very narrowly defeated in 1965. The truth is that it polled only 43 per cent of the votes. Only 43 per cent of the electors of New South Wales wanted a Labor government in 1965 and 57 per cent did not. Yet, the Australian Labor Party almost won the New South Wales elections in 1965. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> tried to lead the Senate to believe that the defeat of the Renshaw Government in 1965 was an argument in support of how democratic the Labor Party is in New South Wales. </para>

          <para>The test of the value of the present Bill is whether its provisions advance the cause of democracy. Does it help in any way to achieve electoral justice? The answer to that question is no; it does not. Firstly, the Government proposes to replace the longstanding 20 per cent variation above and below the quota with a 10 per cent variation. In passing, I should note that the last Labor Federal Government, the Chifley Labor Government, accepted the 20 per cent variation when it initiated its 1948 electoral redistribution. Secondly, the Government proposes to abolish all reference to area, density and sparsity of population, remoteness or distance, from consideration by the distribution commissioners when they redraw electoral boundaries. On the question of quota, the DLP feels that the rapid changes in population in Australia, and the need for stability, justify the present arrangements. All honourable senators will be aware that the- 20 per cent variation establishes the limits that the Parliament permits to the commissioners. It is not a compulsory variation. The commissioners are not bound to use the full variation. They are permitted, but not compelled. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the question of deleting from the Act all reference to area, density and sparsity of population, remoteness or distance. When this Bill received its second reading in another place, it was quite clearly demonstrated that in New South Wales, the State that I represent, the Government could not establish its argument that rural interests were being outrageously over-represented in Parliament. As a matter of fact, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> pointed out earlier, by balancing out in New South Wales the average number of electors in non-metropolitan divisions against the average number in metropolitan divisions, it was found that the value of a country vote was equal to 1.06 of a metropolitan vote. Surely the distribution commissioners must be congratulated for the high degree of fairness that time has shown they have exercised in drawing these boundaries. If the difference between the value of city votes and country votes is the tiny margin that I have mentioned, the Parliament in 1965 was well justified, as I see it, in writing into the Act concern for electors living in divisions vaster than some of the largest nations of Europe, peopled by a thinly scattered population, remote from the great population centres of the Australian seaboard. It is not my purpose to speak any longer than I have done. I urge the Senate, despite the threats of a bullying Prime Minister, to reject the Bill now before it. </para>

          <para>The previous Government when, unfortunately for Australia, it was in power, neglected to carry out its responsibilities. The census of 1971 revealed that Western Australia, because of the increase in its population, should have a total of 10 seats in the House of Representatives. It revealed that Western Australia should have an additional representative in that House. That fact was brought to the previous Government&#39;s attention on innumerable occasions. But the Liberal-Country Party Government felt that it would be to its disadvantage to listen to what should be done in accordance with the law and it ignored that fact. Consequently, it is now the responsibility of the present Government to introduce legislation and to act in accordance with the law. I refer again to the second reading speech in which the Minister continued: </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> reminds me that there were threats of High Court action. The threats went even further than that. The threat in Western Australia was that there could be a challenge to the validity of the election held in December 1972 because the Government had failed to carry out its responsibilities in relation to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson was the Leader of the Government in the Senate at that time. I always remember what he said on one occasion when his attention was drawn to the possibility that people could be escaping from their obligations to pay income tax. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> asked him a question about whether his attention had been drawn to this. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson replied that it was the responsibility of government when something is wrong with the law to see that the law is amended and corrected. I agree. Everybody would agree that such a proposal should be put into effect. But this was not done by the Government that was in power in 1972. It thought that it would be to its political disadvantage to observe the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Consequently, we now have this legislation before the Parliament of Australia introduced by a Labor Government. What did the Attorney-General say in relation to equity of distribution?

              <para>- Thank you so much. The members of the Opposition have at least come to life and said: &#39;Hear, hear!&#39; It appears that they agree with that. Why do not they agree with what was recommended by the independent authority in 1959, the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review set up by this Parliament? What did that Committee recommend? It said almost precisely that one cannot have a perfect system but that there should be at the most a 10 per cent variation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> said tonight that if these same honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives had an opportunity to change their minds, they would do so now. Why would they do so? What is different now to when they made their decision in 1959? If there is a difference it is in favour of their unanimous recommendation because there are less people in the country areas of Australia now than there were in 1959. I repeat that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> said that if these gentlemen had an opportunity they would reverse their decision today. I have never known <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who was a member of that Committee, to hide his light under a bushel. I think that everybody would agree that he is very forthright in making his declarations. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> might know that better than I. But the situation is that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is going to change his decision - frankly, I do not think that he would - he must declare himself in the Parliament. I do not think that up to date he has declared himself in the debate. Consequently, I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico&#39;s</inline> statement was not in accordance with fact. Again, I want to quote from the second reading speech of the Minister. He said: </para>

            <para>The existing law allows Distribution Commissioners to depart from the quota of electors by 20 per cent either way and it is a simple mathematical fact that this margin, in application, allows a division to have up to 50 per cent more electors than another division in the same State. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I ask honourable senators: Is that position equitable? Is it equitable that one division should have 40,000 electors and yet another division h ave 60,000 electors? 1 do not think that an argument of that nature can be justified. I do not think it can be justified by the argument that some members may have additional miles to cover in their divisions. I believe that honourable senators would agree that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> has been fair to a vast majority of honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives. He has gone further now by providing additional allowances for members of Parliament who operate in divisions over a certain number of square miles. I just forget the exact figure. Irespective of the amount granted or the area for which the allowance will be paid, the fact is that he has recognised that some members in another place may have some of those difficulties. He has indicated in a positive way that they should receive an additional allowance to help them to overcome some of their problems. Is not that a fair proposition? Is that not an indication to the people of Australia and to honourable senators opposite that this </para>
          <para class="block">Government is conscious of some of the difficulties that may be experienced and that it is prepared to go out of its way to assist in overcoming them? But honourable senators opposite cannot sacrifice a principle with which the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, agreed - &#39;that there should be, as near as possible, one vote one value. It is incomprehensible that any senator opposite should attempt to justify some adjustment of that principle. </para>
          <para>What is the position in Australia today because of the shift in population? In some divisions the number of electors is well above the quota. In other divisions it is well below the quota. How can honourable senators opposite justify the division of Darling having 18.65 per cent of voters below the quota and the division of Grayndler having 14.01 per cent of voters above the quota? Comparatively speaking they are almost adjoining divisions. Let me refer to some other divisions. The division of Brisbane has 15.4 per cent above the quota. Griffith has 16.08 per cent above the quota. Kennedy has 17.95 per cent or almost 18 per cent below the quota. Swan in Western Australia, I am informed, has 15.76 per cent above the quota. How in the name of conscience can honourable senators opposite justify disparities of that nature? A law which permits such variations is most certainly not good enough, and it should be altered. That is the purpose of the Bill. </para>
          <para>There are other matters which, I believe, indicate that the Opposition is completely unaware of the whole intention of the Bill. To give an indication of this unawareness I propose to read some of the comments made by honourable senators opposite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> as recorded at page 1584 of Hansard of 15th May 1973, said: </para>

              <para>-  Yes, from the Opposition. I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> as one of my friendly foes. I sit on committees with him, and I appreciate his thoughts. I appreciate his sincerity of purpose. On this occasion I am sorry that I cannot agree with the way in which he referred to the report of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. In view of what I have just said, I want to be very charitable to him. If I continue to get a number of interjections from the other side I will not be quite so charitable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> has been referred to as the man who led the previous Prime Minister to defeat. The honourable senator quoted part of the Committee&#39;s report. He said that the Committee said that there should not be a tolerance of  10  per cent. In justification of that statement he referred to part of the report. I want to read the relevant paragraphs of the report, and I want to emphasise some of the words contained therein. Paragraph  345  on page  49  of the report states: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>The Committee considered the extent of the problems which would arise from inserting in the Constitution a requirement that no division in a State should depart from the quota for that State to a greater  exent  than one-tenth more or one-tenth less. The Committee was assisting in its task by the then Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr L.</inline> Ainsworth, who also obtained the views of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer and the Surveyor-General for each of the States. The preponderance of that opinion was clearly in favour of retaining the marginal allowance at the existing one-fifth fraction. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> intended to convey that that was a recommendation of the Committee. I will be charitable and say that he did not mean that, but the very strong inference was that he meant it. He failed to read the following paragraph, paragraph  346,  which states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Undoubtedly, it would be easier to apply a one-fifth  marging  than to work within the limits of a one-tenth marginal allowance from quota. Nevertheless, the Committee is satisfied that the problems of applying a one-tenth margin are quite manageable. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That puts an entirely different complexion on that section of the report. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> were present I would appreciate it if he were to make clear how he read that section of the report. </para>

            <para>-  I want to say at the outset that I oppose on 2 main counts the principle of lowering the 20 per cent tolerance to 10 per cent. I oppose it firstly on the ground of the impracticability of operating on a &#39;10 per cent basis. The Government has introduced this legislation under the guise of one vote one value. If it really believes in the principle of one. vote one value, why has it not brought in a system whereby there is no tolerance at all? The obvious reason for a tolerance is to ensure that it is not necessary to have an electoral redistribution after every election or maybe twice within the life of a Parliament. We must have some stability in our electoral system. The population density is shifting all the time. The other point is that in order to develop the nation on sound lines it is necessary to ensure that the remoter areas, particularly those areas from which the primary production of the nation comes, have adequate representation and a say in the national Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is no doubt why the Government has brought in this measure. It is not because the Government believes in a 10 per cent or 15 per cent tolerance or no tolerance at all but because the Government is itching to have a crack at changing the electoral boundaries and no redistribution is justified in any State except Western Australia at the present time. It wants to sort them out so that, as other members of the Opposition have already said, it can set itself up in office for years to come. The Government knows that it does not have as firm a grip on the Treasury bench as it would like. The Government is rushing the nation into socialism. This is just another part of its plan. 1 wish to speak for a while on the subject of one vote one. value. One of the drawbacks in a democracy is that, being a numbers game, the interests of minority groups are not protected. It is necessary to build a mechanism into a democracy to ensure that minorities get a say. The situation could arise in any election in this country in which, say, 2 parties were vying for votes and where one party got 51 per cent of the votes in every electorate and the other party got 49 per cent. Although 49 per cent of the population felt that the party for which it voted should be in government they would, in effect, have no representation whatsoever. That is why it is necessary in a democracy to build in some protective mechanism. That is why we have in this chamber in particular equal representation from all of the States. That enables the less populous States to have a say in the governing of this country. </para>
          <para>The situation could arise where Sydney and Melbourne, because of their populations, could dominate and control the House of Representatives. While representation in that House is on a population basis, there is some similarity between the interests of people in the country areas of Queensland and people in the country areas of New South Wales. The interests of those people can be protected if they have sufficient representation. The interesting point is that if we allocate a large amount of money for Sydney, nearly everyone in Sydney benefits. But if we allocate money for Albury-Wodonga, does that mean that the people in Mt Isa or in Tamworth will benefit from it? When a preponderance of the population is concentrated in one area, as in our big cities, the people in that area get the advantage because of the numbers and because of the situation with representation. There are so many members to represent their interests, whereas the people who are scattered throughout the country have in most cases only one member to look after many hundreds of thousands of square miles. </para>
          <para>It is sheer hypocrisy for the members of the Labor Party to come into this chamber and talk about one vote one. value. As has been mentioned, the Federal Executive of the Labor Party is selected on an equal basis among the States, irrespective of the population in the States. After all, the Federal Executive is the overriding and controlling body of the Labor Party; what it says goes. I do not say that that is a bad system, that the organisation should not say: This is the policy&#39;, and the members who are elected to the Parliament should not carry out that policy. If that is what members of the Labor Party believe in, that is fair enough, and I am not arguing about it. But the fact is that the Federal Executive is not elected on a population basis. </para>
          <para>This evening we received a sermon from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland on the principle of. one vote one value, but I have not heard him suggest to the Labor Party or to this chamber that because Tasmania has a population of only 420,000 people, it should have so many members on the Federal Executive, and that New South Wales with a population of 4.5 million should have 10 times as many members on the Executive. Also, it is proposed to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act to provide for 2 senators from the Northern Territory! lt is no good arguing, as Senators James McClelland argued yesterday, that the Constitution provides for this. There is no reference in the Constitution to 2 senators coming from the Northern Territory. </para>

              <para>- The Government is just doing this because it believes that it might be able to stack this chamber. The whole point is that the Government suggests that there should be 2 senators from the Northern Territory which has a population of some 30.000 or 40,000 people. Where is the principle of one vote one value in that? It is sheer hypocrisy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe,</inline> 2 of my Queensland friends, spoke earlier in the debate. They both follow a sport called Rugby &#39;League with which I too am associated. It is amazing bow they will support the principle of one vote one value particularly in the selection of Rugby League test teams. I remember occasions when Queensland was able to defeat New South Wales at Rugby League - I see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> grinning - but Queensland was not able to get one member in the test team because the numbers game applied; there were more selectors from New South Wales than from Queensland. Because Queensland did not have the numbers on the selection panel it did not have any representative in the test team. Queensland might as well have had nobody on the selection panel. These are the areas where democracy fails. </para>

          <para>Our nation is probably more centralised than any other nation. Concentrations of population are in certain areas. But most other nations have a great deal more elasticity in electoral matters than we have in Australia. There has been talk about the so-called gerrymander in Queensland. But the fact is that with all the redistributions- in Queensland we are nearer to equality of voters in electorates today than we ever were. So what is all this talk that only the Country Party carries out gerrymanders and the Labor Party does not do so? The Labor Party was in power in Queensland for 40 years and it had every opportunity to gerrymander, and, boy, did it do a job of gerrymandering! lt is no good for honourable senators opposite to say that the members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party did that. Honourable senators opposite are not too proud to own men like Ben Chifley, John Curtin, and Ned Hanlon in Queensland. They were the leaders of the Labor Party in the days when those so-called gerrymanders were carried out. </para>
          <para>As far as the Federal scene is concerned, I think honourable senators will recall the remarks that were made after the last redistribution. Most political commentators considered that in some States the government of the day had an advantage, that in other States the then Opposition had an advantage and that overall probably the Opposition gained out of the total redistribution. Surely that gives the lie to the stories about the gerrymander carried out by the government of the day. I am very concerned about what might happen if this Bill is passed by this chamber and becomes law because in the last few months we have had a fair taste of what this Government is likely to do and we have been given notice of a few other measures that are certainly revolutionary, as far as this country is concerned. </para>

              <para>- I reckon that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> would support the Senate&#39;s retention as long as he is here. Only when he was going out would he agree to its abolition. Perhaps it is in the back of his mind that one day the Senate should be abolished. I have no doubt that as long as certain other senators are here the proposal will not come to the fore as a real issue. It is amazing that while members of the Labor Party talk about abolishing the Senate they are also talking about bringing more members into the Senate. It is quite a ridiculous situation. There is no doubt that this is only part of the pay-off to the big cities of Sydney and Melbourne which voted for the Labor Party and put it on the treasury bench after 23 years. This is only one of the pay-offs. There have been many others - revaluation and other issues that I could mention. lt is quite obvious that honourable senators opposite will give all the assistance in the world to the big capital cities to the detriment of the remote country areas in Australia. The rural sector certainly has been copping a hiding ever since 2nd December. </para>

              <para>- Revaluation - is one matter, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> knows what effect that can have. There is also the question of rising costs. The rural sector, particularly the export industries, will have to face all the increases in costs which it will not be able to pass on. We see excuses now being made with the setting up of a prices tribunal and prices committee. The first group being attacked are the people in the rural sector - the meat producers and others. This is what we expected and obviously this is what will happen. I am pleased to know that the Opposition parties will vote against this Bill. I think that I would only be wasting the time of the Senate if I continued to speak. Most other speakers on the Opposition side have spelt out the hypocrisy of the Government in introducing this measure. I have much pleasure in opposing the Bill. </para>

            <para>-  I rise to make a fairly brief contribution to this debate. I think it could fairly be said that practically every argument that could be advanced in support of the Bill, and in opposition to the Bill, has been advanced. The central feature that we are dealing with is whether one person&#39;s vote in one part of the country is of the same value as that of another person living in another part of the country. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator, I</inline>have hardly started. If you are prepared to be a little more patient, you will find out. I dare say that the central thing when we talk about one value is that we have to try to determine what we mean by that expression. I suppose that right through the history of representative government and democracy there has always been at least an underlying assumption that one person&#39;s opinion is worth that of another person simply because there is no ultimate standard by which we can make these judgments. We can for example  -  I have just heard the word &#39;Quaker&#39; used - set a certain standard as individuals. We can believe that we are Christians or that we accept some other brand of religious or philosophical thinking, and we can say that the standard by which we make our assessments is the ultimate standard. But we know that there is no ultimate standard, and therefore the views of one person must be assumed to be equal to those of another. We could not say, for instance, that a professor of political science at the University of Sydney has a greater right to determine what should be the political colour of the Government of this country than has an agricultural worker in western New South Wales. I am sure that he has no right, no privilege, to claim that he is a better judge of what the government of the country should be. On the other hand, an agricultural worker in western New South Wales has no more right to have a greater say in what the government of the country should be than has a professor of political science at the University of Sydney. This is so because we have no standards by which we can make this assumption, lt is important and fundamental that we accept the fact that no matter who a person is, and irrespective of his occupation or where he lives - that surely is the basis of the whole democratic process - his right is as great as that of any other person. Once one breaks down that principle one breaks down the whole principle of democracy, and every person in this chamber knows that. For example, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> yesterday commented that the rural people of Australia deserve equality, not privilege. That is true. That is central to the whole debate. There should be equality but there should not be privilege to any section of the community. I suppose that if we accepted the principle that some people have greater rights than have others we would wind up with the almost horrendous conclusion that politicians have a greater right to determine who should be in power than have people who are not politicians. We would probably wind up in a more difficult situation than we are in now. So at the beginning of all this is the right of the individual. </para>

              <para>- That is correct. But these are the considerations that we must not lose sight of. Unfortunately during the debate it has been evident that many members of the Opposition have lost sight of it. What are we dealing with in this Bill? We are dealing with an amendment to the present electoral system which operates in this country, and fundamental to that system is the fact that it is an imperfect system. It has been demonstrated as being imperfect in this country, and it has been demonstrated as being imperfect in all the other countries which have so called representative government - the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland and other places that have been mentioned. It would be tiring of me to go through all the statistical evidence that has been quoted during this debate but it has been pointed out, and rightly so, that in all those countries there is a disproportionate representation of people living in certain areas. In the United States, I believe, it is as high as 6 to 1 in favour of rural areas, and in the United Kingdom a similar situation obtains. It is just not a reasonable proposition to suggest that those figures can be justified, and this Bill is an attempt to rectify as far as is practicable the inequalities which exist under the present law. It would be ridiculous to suggest that the Country Party particularly has not been guilty of abusing the present electoral system of single electorates. The prime example is Queensland, where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> is the Premier.  His  Party governs when in fact he has no mandate to govern. We are attempting in this legislation, not to deprive any person of his rights under the electoral laws but to correct the imbalance which now exists between certain areas of the Commonwealth. My main purpose in rising in this debate is to make clear that I am not prepared for one moment to accept the proposition that people living in rural areas have some prior right over people living in urban areas. </para>

If one accepts the first principle that every person in this country has the right of equality and not privilege, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster&#39;s</inline> Party Leader said last night, and if we accept that a rural dweller has the same rights as has an urban dweller, and vice versa, it is unfortunate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster&#39;s</inline> emotional attachment to his representation of the Country Party causes him to lose sight of the rationale of what elections are all about, and he adopts an emotional attitude that the people he represents should have a higher representation than do people in non-rural areas.

              <para>- If you read Hansard tomorrow you will see that I did not talk about one vote one value. I said that we are working under an imperfect system. I made that point at the beginning of my speech. Because it is an imperfect system it is necessary to build in some variation, but the variation should not be an overt variation, which is what the honourable senator and his friends want. What we want is a reasonable balance between the fact of equality of voting and the fact that a variation must be built into the system. That is why it is imperfect. I made that point at the beginning but you were not listening; you were more interested in interjecting in order to throw me, but you are wasting your time. If we accept the fact that it is an imperfect system - I do not wish this debate to degenerate into a battle of interjections between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> and myself - I want to make one point in the time that I have left. </para>

          <para>I think it is time that the Australian Parliament thought very seriously - I am not talking in Party political terms now - of the alternatives that are available to it. The rather peculiar race of people in the island called Tasmania to the south of Australia, who have been enlightened in many matters and have shown the way to their mainland friends on many occasions, many years ago introduced an electoral system known as the Hare-Clark system. The purpose of the Hare-Clark system is to give equality to everybody <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the electorate. It was designed in such a way that no Party or person could gerrymander the electorate as applies under the single electorate system. In all the years that the HareClark system has operated in Tasmania it has brought political stability. The fact that Tasmania is involved is not important. The point is that the principle operates there and it has been proved to be successful. But above all else it means that when a change of government has occurred there has been no opportunity on the part of the ruling Party to doctor the system as it has been doctored under the single electorate system. Also under the refinements which have been devised by various persons and in particular by the research worker, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Howatt,</inline> at the University of Tasmania on no occasion can a government be formed unless it has the support of the majority of the electors. Certainly in a House where there are comparatively small numbers there is the problem of a deadlock developing, not specifically in the numbers of the major parties but in that an individual, such as we saw happen 2 or 3 years ago, can hold the balance of power. It was an exceptional circumstance but under the system which applies now the majority Party rules that, State; it forms the Government. </para>

              <para>- I would have assumed that the honourable senator imagined that I did support it. I am talking now not in specific terms about the Bill but about what we, as a national Parliament, might consider as an alternative to the present system which as I said earlier in imperfect. Whether the Hare-Clark system is an answer to the problem is a debatable point. </para>

          <para>I make the observation that as a Parliament we ought seriously to consider the alternatives that are before us. All of us know that debates of this nature on electoral gerrymanders and injustices have occurred in this Parliament, I suppose, since Federation. They have occurred probably in every State Parliament with the exception of Tasmania over a great number of years. While we are dealing with an imperfect system we will continue to have these debates because there will be accusations and counter-accusations of doubledealing, of gerrymandering and of people being disenfranchised. If we want to overcome the problem it is inevitable that we have to look at some alternatives. It may not be that the Hare-Clark system, as it is known in Tasmania, is the answer on a Federal basis. But I believe that there is a great responsibility on all of us in this Parliament to consider very deeply whether we are prepared to go on with the system which exists now. If we are then obviously we go on with the risks of gerrymander right through the whole history of the Commonwealth. I do not think anybody really wants this because it is open to abuse. The Australian people - this is the important point - are entitled to know that every time they record a vote on the ballot paper their vote means as much, whether they are living in Sydney, Kalgoorlie, Hobart or Cairns. Under the present system that does not apply. What we are endeavouring to do under this legislation, which I support, is to remove some of the injustices which exist under the present legislation. I am sure that if the Senate is wise it will pass this Bill. I understand that there is another matter to be dealt with; so I ask for leave to continue my remarks upon the resumption of this debate. </para>

            <para>There were a number of factors involved in the introduction of revised Directory arrangements throughout the Commonwealth. Basically, the aim was to improve the utility value of directories by aligning the Directory coverage with trunk switching boundaries so that each book would contain an integrated alphabetical list of subscribers located within a community of interest who could call each other without the need for special dialling procedures. </para>
            <para>Nevertheless, these arrangements are currently under review. However, should it be decided to alter the present directory arrangement in Tasmania, there is not sufficient time to vary the 1973 books due for issue later this year. </para>

            <para>My approval or otherwise of treatment is justified on the principle of least harm. I would approve the use of cyproterone acetate for sex offenders only on responsible therapeutic and not penal grounds. The Australian Drug Evaluation Committee has yet to assess whether the safety of this drug is established sufficiently to allow clinical trials to be undertaken for determination of efficacy. Drugs, including stilbestrol, have been in use for decades to reduce sexual drive where this appears medically to be indicated, for example where uninhibited sexual activity in a mentally subnormal adolescent would result in depriving him of attendance at a school for the handicapped. Such drugs may well be preferred to jail by some sex offenders, but such alternatives should be offered only after careful assessment by and consultation among specialists in psychiatry and social rehabilitation. These opinions were made clear in my recent reply to a journalist. </para>
