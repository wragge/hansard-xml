            <para>- My question without notice is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Does the Minister confirm that there is to be a 40 per cent increase in contributions to Victorian medical benefits funds? Will he also confirm a reported Press statement by him that the reserves of the Victorian funds are practically depleted? If so. does not this contradict many statements made last year by the Prime Minister and members of the present Government that the reserves of the hospital and medical benefits funds in Australia are about S 1.40m and would be appropriate to provide needed hospital and nursing home facilities in Australia? What does the Government propose to do in view of the apparent error in the Government&#39;s assumptions about the extent of medical funds reserves? </para>

            <para>- It is true that the Minister for Social Security has approved increases of up to 40 per cent in the cost of contributions to the several medical benefits funds in Victoria. The Minister has expressed the point of view that the increases are regrettable but that they also are unavoidable, so I am told, if the funds are to remain financial and continue to operate to the benefit of the public under the old Government&#39;s medical benefits scheme. The Minister assures me that the proposed increases reveal the parlous financial position into which the funds had been allowed to drift by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government  which resorted to the discreditable tactic of concealing mounting cost pressures which affected its complicated, excessively expensive and most unsatisfactory system of health insurance. The Minister has had the proposals that have been submitted to him by the 4 largest funds examined by the Commonwealth Registrations Committee and, following recommendations by that Committee, has approved of increases for the funds. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In reply to the last portion of the honourable senator&#39;s question, may I say that the Government is examining the whole question of the maintenance of the present system of health insurance. It is being kept under review so that the interests of the public, first and foremost, are protected. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. I refer to the Minister&#39;s statements regarding revaluation. I ask: Is it a fact that what the Government is saying to primary industry is that where an industry was in trouble with adjustments before revaluation and where these troubles have been increased by revaluation, that industry can apply to the Government for help in carrying out those adjustments? If this is correct, does this mean that apart from fruit, no industry has any chance of qualifying for assistance? If this is the case, will the Minister say honestly that no other primary industry can qualify for exchange compensation? </para>

            <para>- Last week I attempted to explain adequately the Government&#39;s position concerning its devaluation of the Australian dollar last December. In doing so I pointed out that the former Government had established certain principles which were clearly enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> at the time of the devaluation of the American dollar in December 1971. When the pound sterling was devalued in 1 967  -  and I think that I should spend a moment or two to spell this out - the then government adopted a policy of outright compensation across the whole spectrum of rural industry and, by some simple mathematical process which would be very difficult for any economist to justify, it made a payment of approximately $11 lm to all rural industries. At the time of the American devaluation of the dollar in December 1971, the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon,</inline> said: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The changes in international exchange rates will adversely affect some of the rural industries already experiencing difficult times. The Government is therefore prepared to examine and consider the position of those rural industries which are seriously affected. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This was a complete change of policy from the decision that was made in 1967 and a complete departure from the principle that was then adopted. The principle enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> in December 1971 was almost exactly identical with the one enunciated by this Government in December 1972. </para>
          <para>I think it is perhaps to the credit of the previous administration that between 1967 and 1971 it woke up to the fact that in 1967 it had implemented a principle which was wrong. I might add for the benefit of honourable senators opposite that as a result of the principle adopted in 1971 not one cent of revaluation adjustment payment or compensation money - call it what you like - was paid from December 1971 until the change of government in December 1972. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security aware that a family with 4 children would receive child endowment of $5.75 a week and yet if, due to divorce, the family were divided into 2 groups with each parent, looking after 2 children, each group would receive only $1.50 a week - a total of $3?

            <para>- 1 am assured by the Minister for Social Security that the existing Social Services Act provides that where for any reasons any children, who would otherwise be living together as one family or as part of one family, are not living together the Director-General of Social Security may, if he thinks fit exercising his discretion, authorise payment of endowment in respect of any of those children- at the rate that would be payable if those children were in fact living together as one family, this rate being not less than the rate, that might otherwise be payable. This section, of the Act is interpreted to apply to families which are temporarily separated but not. to families which are permanently separated. Divorce is an example of permanent separation of parents. </para>

          <para>Therefore the position regarding the endowment payable in the circumstances outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> was correctly stated by him. The Minister for Social Security assures me that in the near future he will be undertaking a complete review of all aspects of social services and social security policies and procedures. I feel sure that once it is brought to his attention he will look at the situation referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley.</inline></para>

            <para>- 1 understand that Australian film producers are confronted by major difficulties in having their products distributed, not only in Australia but more particularly abroad. At present I am negotiating with the distributing companies that operate in Australia - most of them are foreign owned - to see whether I can get a better deal for Australian film producers. 1 am negotiating with American distributors also to see whether it is at all possible to obtain their co-operation in having films made in Australia, using predominantly Australian labour, placed on the export market. It is a fact that the Australian Film Development Corporation can play a part in the distribution of films, having regard to the charter given to it by the Act that established it in 1970. The Corporation, which the honourable senator will realise is a statutory corporation, also is looking at &#39;this aspect of the industry. </para>

            <para>- I think the strict constitutional position is that the Government is not obliged to take notice of the reports of committees. Nevertheless, one would hope that in the processes of government, notice, would be taken of the reports of Senate committees. The Senate may recall that last year and again this year I placed on the Senate notice paper a notice of motion dealing with this matter. It is marked No. 4 and states: </para>

Indeed, as Attorney-General I took prompt note of the report made by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional ana Legal Affairs which recommended the abolition of discretion statements from the divorce rules. That action was taken in accordance with the recommendation. As I recall, that was the only recommendation made by the Committee. </para>
          <para>As to what should happen in respect of other matters when a committee is investigating a subject, I suppose there will be differences of opinion. I anticipate, for example, that committees may be considering large areas of legislative policy, concerning territories or other areas of law. I think it would be absurd if the processes of legislation, both substantive, that is, by Act of Parliament, and by delegated legislation, should come to a halt merely because some committee was engaged in looking at the subject matter. I would think that in areas where many of the Senate committees have a broad coverage, all legislative activity would not cease because the committees were engaged in looking at those subjects. Since the honourable senator has mentioned divorce I should point out that the rules made touching divorce will prove, once they are examined carefully, to have been drawn in such a way as to show that close attention has been paid to the weight of opinion put before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. Perhaps some of those who have not been aware of the Senate Standing Committee&#39;s role or of the evidence put before it might profit from reading the evidence. They would see that many of the proposals, and the weight of opinion expressed, have been carried into many of the newly made rules. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator reminds me that he suggested that it would be a good idea for the Ministers concerned to appear before committees. I think it would be important for the Minister to appear before the committee concerned, particularly in cases where some action was taken in his area. Certainly in areas in which I am concerned I would want to appear before the particular standing committee - that is, when the committees are reconstituted - of the Senate and explain to it what I had in mind or what I had done and why I had done it. If the Senate would permit, I would do likewise with similar committees of the House of Representatives. </para>

Will the Attorney-General tell the Senate how a judge hearing a divorce case can determine whether adultery has been committed, having regard to the fact that the Attorney&#39;s amending statutory rules abolish discretion statements, while the provision in the Matrimonial Causes Act still remains requiring the court to exercise a discretion in connection with the petitioner&#39;s adultery and consequently to be told about it? Does he not consider it more undignified for a petitioner to have to make a statement in open court rather than to have it in a discretion statement which is seen by nobody but the judge? </para>

            <para>- As Attorney-General I have been asked to answer a question on a subject on which I noticed my predecessor often declined to answer questions on the basis that he was being asked questions of law; but I will endeavour to deal with the question. There was a provision in the rules for a discretion statement to be made, that is, for a person to write some confession of his or her own adultery. As far as I can gather, the unanimous view of those who gave evidence before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs and of those who have discussed this matter in any way publicly is that such discretion statements should be abolished; they are an abomination in the law and should not exist. I think that that community opinion ought to be given effect to. Let me correct my earlier statement that that was the unanimous opinion. It was unanimous except for the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> I had not realised until now that he would be in favour of the retention of such statements.. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In so far as the provisions of the Act affecting this matter are concerned, my understanding is that judges of the court act as judges exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth. If something is brought to their attention in a defended proceeding about adultery, no doubt they will observe the provisions of the Act and exercise their discretion as they think fit in conforming with the law. If in a defended proceeding no evidence of adultery is put before the judge, I do not understand it to be the function of those exercising the judicial power to turn themselves into inquisitors and start to cross-examine a person on whether some act of adultery has been committed. </para>

              <para>- I know. Let me answer the question. The present Government has great difficulty in meeting the downturn of shipbuilding capacity brought about by the long standing inability of the previous Government to provide additional orders to all the shipyards. There is a downturn - there is no question about this - and there are proposed retrenchments in the area of defence, which the Minster has refused to accept. I refer to both Cockatoo dock and Williamstown. That has been stopped. It is impossible to provide short order work to each shipyard which is becoming redundant at present, but 1 can assure the honourable senator that the Minister for Transport and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard</inline> are conscious of the need for Australian shipyards to have an increased workload and to be kept at full capacity. We shall do all we can to provide assistance where shipyards are becoming affected by the downturn. </para>

            <para>- Nevertheless, its intention is clear. The Government has announced that it proposes to make these allocations in this important area, and the wisdom of that policy has received universal acclaim. As I indicated previously, it obviously would not be right if, because a committee is inquiring into a matter, the Government and the Parliament should have to stay their hands entirely and not do what seems to them to be right, particularly in (he area of delegated legislation and especially where procedures are concerned. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am reverting now to the earlier question on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> based his question. Where procedural matters and rules are concerned the Government and the Attorney-General may be said to have a responsibility for the existing state of those rules. When faced with a mountain of evidence that the rules and the procedures are adding unnecessarily to cost and indignity I think there is a duty on the Attorney-General to move to deal with those rules, which were made by a predecessor and which were altered by other predecessors. He should alter them in the way that he thinks will bring them more into conformity with the dignity of citizens and the propriety of reducing expenses and removing other objectionable features. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is it true, as Press reports claim, that the Department of the Treasury has presented to the Cabinet a submission which claims that the economy is approaching boom conditions? Is it also true that the Treasury warns that the overriding threat to the nation&#39;s economic health is no longer unemployment but the serious danger of runaway inflation? In the interests of open government will the Minister see that this document is made available for public perusal? </para>

            <para>- I do not know of the disquiet to which the honourable senator has referred but I do know that the problem ot how to deal with drug trafficking and drug abuse is a very difficult one. An interdepartmental committee has been established consisting of representatives of the Departments of Health, Social Security, Customs and Excise, the Attorney-General, and Environment and Conservation to look into how, in effect, some total approach might be made to these questions. As the very valuable report of the Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse showed, it is not simply a problem of the criminal law; nor is it simply a problem of education, health or the other disciplines. It is a problem which affects so many aspects of our society. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The intention of that interdepartmental committee is to investigate the approaches being taken in the United States, where the stress hitherto has been mostly on the criminal law aspect and also the approaches being taken in the United Kingdom where the stress seems to have been rather on the health aspect and dealing with it as being a problem of sickness. The experience seems to show that the United Kingdom approach, without being perfect, has been more satisfactory than that of the United States. In any event, the Government is very much concerned about this problem. No-one would want to see a development of the crime in the streets that has been associated with the drug traffic in the United States of America. We all would want to have a solution to this problem. I can assure the honourable senator that the action to which I have referred is being taken and that the Government, conscious of the position, will take whatever other steps can be taken to deal with the problem. If it would be convenient for the honourable senator, I would present, in more precision, a statement to indicate what is happening in relation to this committee. </para>

            <para>- I think that the inquiry into the Post Office affairs is due to commence in the very near future. 1 assume that the Postmaster-General, charged with his ministerial responsibilities, will continue to make statements about the administration of his Department, especially in reply to questions asked of him at question time. So far as new telephone services are concerned, the simple fact is that in 1970-71 there were deliberate increases in charges intended to cover capital development but these were inadequate for the capital development. The works programme of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department could have been better organised, in that problems referred to recently appear to have arisen from inadequate capital development funds. Therefore, the policy of the Government at this stage, pending the inquiry into Post Office affairs, is to ensure that the needs of the community as a whole are taken into account by assessing whether telephone lines and telecommunications systems should be installed rather than provide for the needs of a minority section of the Australian community. </para>

            <para>- Has the Minister for Primary Industry read a report of the speech delivered yesterday in Brisbane by the Junior Vice-President of the Queensland Cane Growers Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr K.</inline> A. Day, at the opening of the annual conference of that Council in the presence of the Minister for Northern Development, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Patterson,</inline> who delivered an address? In his speech the Vice-President, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Day,</inline> expressed the very grave concern of the sugar industry in regard to the probable financial loss to the industry if Australia did not move its currency rate against the Ameri can dollar. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Day</inline> suggested that there would be a reduction in export income to the sugar industry of perhaps $30m a year after 1974 and something approaching that amount this year. Can the Minister indicate what steps the Government has in mind, whether by means of exchange variation or otherwise, to offset this immense financial loss? </para>

            <para>- It is a little irregular since this question is on the notice paper, but I think I can answer it all. The answer to the first part of the question is no, I am not aware of that. To explain what that means, I point out that I spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard,</inline> the then Acting Prime Minister, and as I understand what he said, it was to the effect that the Commonwealth Government had not decided to seek leave; the decision had not been made. That has somehow been translated into a decision not to seek leave to intervene. I had not had any consultation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard</inline> about the matter before the statement or indeed until the honourable senator asked me the question. I did not answer him then and there because other matters were involved and because, in the pressure of events, it was possible that some consultation might have occurred. However, I have checked and have learned that there was </para>

Can tse Minister explain why very little publicity, If any, has been given recently to the problem of inflation, which is still Australia&#39;s greatest problem? Is it not correct that prices, as measured by the consumer price index, have greatly increased since 2nd December last year? Did he note the Press report that in the last  12 months food prices in Sydney have risen, by 30 per cent? Is he aware that in Brisbane, more than 100 grocery and food items have increased in price recently? Has he heard &#39; about the uproar . in Brisbane over increases in the prices of bread and meat, and the announcement in today&#39;s Press that meat pies and pasties will rise in price to 20c? Why is: it that now when inflation is worse than it Was .prior to the election we do not hear much about it, whereas before the election Labor spokesmen were forecasting the collapse of the economy? </para>

Is the Government holding any hopes of substantial trade relations with China?

If this is so, would it not be extremely desirable in Australia&#39;s interests to maintain official trade links wilh Taiwan?

Australia, with Canada, the United Kingdom and several other nations, co-sponsored a resolution which would have had the <inline font-style="italic">effect of</inline> the International Law Commission&#39;s preparing a draft convention.&#39; This was voted against, mainly by the &#39;non-aligned countries, their reasoning being that it might impede genuine revolutionary movements throughout the world. They in turn passed a resolution&#39; which invited members to put forward their ideas on terrorism to a newly formed committee. Australia .voted against that, on the basis that it did not underline the urgency and seriousness of -terrorism : throughout the world. Australia made it clear. at the same time - this is in answer to the -honourable senator&#39;s last question - that it would work with&#39; the United Nations in its- efforts to do something about the: whole question of terrorism. On the subject -of aerial hijacking, we have ratified both the. Tokyo and the Hague, conventions. We have signed the Montreal Convention, and legislation will be brought down as soon as it can be. prepared to enable us to ratify it. </para>

That decision would have to be taken by the convention. I know lt is the desire of this Government that local government, be represented at the . convention. The Government has met the various representatives of local government, and heard them &#39;: express their wishes to be represented arid the &#39;.Government <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> agreed with those views. It has made its position clear that it considers that Ideal government is&#39; <inline font-style="italic">now,</inline> and perhaps tuts&#39;, been for some time;&#39;- so&#39; important to the conduct df our society that it ought to have a place in any constitutional convention and that it ought to have a greater role in the affairs of the  nation,  However, I cannot answer with any certainty the honourable senator&#39;s question as to whetherlocal government will be represented. If the Australian Government has its way  it  will be represented. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Primary Industry. In view of the rather general answer which the Minister gave to my specific questions, will the Minister now admit that the 1967 revaluation was a very much more serious cost to export industries than the minor adjustments which occurred in 1971? Was not the so-called new policy of 1971 justified by the minor nature of the adjustments? Does the Minister claim that the latest exchange adjustment of 7 per cent can be called minor? </para>

            <para>- It is not a question of whether the adjustment was minor or major. The important point is the distinction that I made in my earlier answer. The previous government adopted a different principle in its approach to the problem in 1971. I suggest that this is the essentia&#93; point that ought to be considered in any further revaluations or currency alignments as far as this country is concerned. It would be irresponsible and remiss of this Government  -  I think it is possible that the honourable senator or some of his colleagues would agree with me or any future government, . Labor or LiberalCountry Party, to revert to the principles that were set out in the 1967 revaluation. I think a proper course was adopted in 1971 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon.</inline> I also think a proper course has been adopted by this Government. </para>

            <para>-  I direct a question to the Minister for Primary Industry. Does the Minister concede that devaluation compensation is an entitlement of exporters, or is it in his conception a welfare payment to be given and bestowed at the discretion of a Minister? Does the Government&#39;s devaluation decision of December represent a loss of 60c on every case of apples priced at $6 in the sterling market? Does that mean that, to the ordinary grower of 10,000 cases of apples the lossis $6;000? Will the Minister honour the . promises made in applegrowing areas by his colleagues, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Rex.</inline> Patterson, that in the event of devaluation proper compensation would be paid? </para>

            <para>- Insofar as the statements by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Patterson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> are concerned, I think it would be as well for the honourable senator to be precise in quoting what they said. It is my understanding that they did not make the statement be alleges&#39; they made. What they did say was that the stabilisation scheme would be considered by this Government with a view to assisting the industry. I should add that the apple and pear industry is a very poor example for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> to choose because the previous Government went no closer to solving the problems of that industry than the present Government has gone to date, but we hope during the course of the present Administration to adopt a more positive approach. As to the other part of his question, I do not wish to alter in any way the principle which I have spelled out and which has been spelled out by the Government, but I make the point that I am sure the previous Government would not have expected, and the present Government&#39; does not expect, any rural industry or any other industry to -pay compensation to the Government in the case of the reverse situation occurring in a currency change, although exactly the same principle would be involved. That was not done previously and I am sure&#39; it will not be done in the future. </para>

            <para>- I think - 1 can deal with part of the question. It is true that there is a natural background of radiation. It is true also that the amount of radiation has been increased appreciably by the nuclear tests&#39;, which have been&#39; performed in various parts of the world, and also the explosions which took place over Japan. The amount of that increase may be regarded&#39; in- some ways as small.&#39; Nevertheless, it- is significant for several - reasons, - as I - understand it. There is no threshold whatever^- in other words .the view is that any- amount&#39; of radiation is harmful:&#39; There is a certain &#39; background radiation about which, wo cannot do anything. Wo expose ourselves to radiation by way of X-rays h... various other means. We do so on the basis that some kind of benefit is to be gained by having an X-ray or In some other way exposing ourselves to radiation. But to expose oneself to radiation unnecessarily without such a benefit is not advisable. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Certainly, advice has been obtained by the Government and 1 have obtained some myself. I do not propose to say from whom that advice was obtained because, as the honourable senator may be aware and as I mentioned in the Senate the other day, there has been an exchange of diplomatic notes between Australia .and France. A dialogue is going on. The. Prime Minister has indicated, that in certain events an approach will be made to the International Court of Justice. Matters may become the subject of evidence before that Court. It is not appropriate nor is it the practice in such circumstances for the Government of Australia to pinpoint the quarters . from which its scientific advice or, for that matter, its legal advice has come. </para>

            <para>- I preface a question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory by stating that, contrary to the general view, although the wearing of. seat belts in late model cars is now compulsory the accident rate on the roads of the Australian Capital Territory has not declined. I ask the Minister whether this is so because many motorists in the A.C.T. are able to exceed the speed limit by 10 to 15 miles an hour and apparently get away with it? Does the Minister consider that the only way to keep speeds down and reduce accidents is to have governors fitted to vehicles of continual offenders? Does he consider that inability to control cars at speeds is one of the major causes of accidents? Would it not help reduce the accident rate if penalties included suspension of the car registration, and driver&#39;s licence of second &#39; or third offenders charged with speeding? </para>

            <para>- 1 certainly shall consider this as a matter of urgency if a submission has been placed before the Government. I do not know whether or not this is so but I do not think it is my responsibility to invite every industry in Australia which may feel that it has been affected by revaluation to place a submission before the Government. The position has been spelt . out clearly enough to al&#93; industries concerned that if they feel they have a case to put before the government it is up to them to do so. But if the industry referred to by the honourable senator in fact has done that I shall have its submission looked at as a matter of urgency. </para>

He in turn ; is aware - that the Government took very quick action in respect of that industry - much quicker than action taken, by the previous- Government in either 1967 or 1971 because we recognised that the industry was deserving .of immediate assistance, which it received. There was nothing in the assistance which precluded ..that industry from any further assistance which the Government may feci it ought to receive. -I might say also for the benefit of the honourable senator that part of that payment was made up of the supplementary grants which .1 consider to have been a very important part of the fruit growers&#39; reconstruction scheme started by the honourable senator&#39;s own - administration last year and continued by this Government.

Is he aware also that the then Minister, in. accordance with his responsibilities, tabled the document in this Senate on 18th May 1972?

            <para>- The fund does not table the &#39; document. I am aware also that the Minister- is.&#39; required under the Act to tabic the document in the Parliament. I can well recall the honourable senator in his- role as Minister for Health- tabling the document sometime in the- autumn session, of last year. I assume that an annual report will be in the possession .of the present Minister. I assume that -once&#39; that .report has- been studied by his Department and by the. Minister he will table- the document. I want to remind the honourable senator that until, this Government is able to introduce amending, legislation to the existing Social Service Act and the National Health Act into the Parliament it will still be operating under an obsolescent, inadequate and hotchpotch scheme of the previous administration. It is inevitable that whilst that scheme continues, ho matter which political party is in government,&#39; - enormous difficulties will &#39; confront the Australian people. It is the -objective of- the present Labor Government to bring about&#39; &#39; a completely new scheme which will contain some equity for all sections of the&#39; Australian community. </para>

What happened between April and December of last year, at the time of the. general election, was that costs., in these funds were increasing considerably and the then Government, realising that an election was pending and not wanting to increase the medical and hospital fund contributions, did nut do so. Therefore, these hospital and medical benefit funds in Victoria are in their present situation. </para>

            <para>- It is a fact that the previous Government introduced amendments to the nursing homes legislation. The honourable senator who was formerly Minister for Health introduced that legislation and I on behalf of the then Opposition did not oppose it. Certainly it was a provision of the legislation that the funds would be required to give the additional home nursing benefit without an increase in the premium payable by the contributor, and it was intended that in that way some of the excessive reserves would be utilised. Since April last, costs have caught up particularly with the Victorian funds, and now the Minister for Social Security in another place has warned the Australian public that further rises in medical benefit contributions may be necessary to cover the increased medical fees which are likely to apply from 1st July this year. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator has the facts wrong. There was never a statement that this was the intention cf the Government. There was a statement that within my ministerial responsibility, I would take into consideration certain factors. I take the responsibility for that statement. There never was a statement made by me that preference would be given to firms which employed trade unionists or which had good relations with trade unions. To make the position very clear, I tabled in the House List week, the instruction to my Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> has not taken the trouble to read that statement to see what it says. The statement said that a number of things would be taken into consideration at the time of allocating contracts. One was the relationship of certain builders or contractors - tenderers - with trade unions; whether they employed union labour; whether they employed their ratio of apprentices, and whether they employed a day work system or a contract system. There was no indication that any such question would be the determining factor. Whereas previously the Director General of Works had full power in letting contracts, now the approval of contracts will be taken over by myself acting within my ministerial responsibility and, I hope, with :he advice of the Department. My Department is now working out schemes for how the directions can best be put into operation. They will be put into operation. Unless the tenders of firms which have a notoriously bad union record are very much lower than are others, and unless there are other considerations, those firms will have very little chance of getting a Department of Works contract while I am Minister. </para>

Is it contribution to its funds, ready acceptance of union demands, or active support of the trade union movement? Why has the Minister displaced the Director-General as the impartial, objective officer who, on a consideration of the technical matters relating to the contract, in my day gave the contract to the best tender?

            <para>- The honourable senator commenced his question by asking whether the document I tabled contained certain statements which he read out of the document. I do not know whether that part of the question necessitates an answer. It is obvious that the honourable senator did not require information about that; he had it. I am doing everything possible in my portfolio to create a harmonious relationship between employers and employees. I hope that during my period of office we do not have such disputations as occurred when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was a Minister. As to my intention to replace the Director-General as the approving authority for contracts, even under the previous Minister for Works, some contracts of a certain value had to be approved by the Minister. That remains the case. Contracts of a greater value will be approved with complete co-operation and agreement between my Director-General and myself. </para>

            <para>- It is not true that I have asked the licensees of commercial television stations, or indeed all of the networks, to reduce their purchases of overseas programs. In fact I have suggested to the 3 commercial networks in Australia and to the Australian Broadcasting Commission that rather than go to the United States in March to purchase programs 12 months in advance they should postpone their buying arrangements until the programs are telecast around September, October or November so that they can go over there and see the programs have been telecast. Of course, this would be of benefit to the Australian licensees, it certainly would be of great benefit to the Australian viewers and I believe it might have some impact in lowering the prices paid by Australians to foreigners for the purchase of programs. </para>

          <para>According to the broadcasting and television year book, Australia was paying a program cost of $179&#39; per 100,000 sets compared with $85 by Canada, $38 by France, $15 by Italy, $28 by Japan, $80 by New Zealand and $46 by the United Kingdom. Instead of the 4 networks in Australia going to America 12 months in advance of their program requirement and competing one against the other, I have suggested to them that it would be in their interests to postpone their buying arrangements until September, October or November when the programs have in fact been shown. </para>

It is now many weeks since the Minister announced that there would be a referendum to decide whether merino rams may be exported from Australia? Did the Minister announce that the result of such referendum would be available in June 1973? Has the Minister yet decided whether a written case for and against export will be sent to all persons who are to have a vote?

            <para>- I have made an approach to the 4 purchasing networks in Australia at this time because I understand that normally in March the networks - and I believe rather unwillingly in their circumstances - begin the process of selecting their purchases from abroad for transmission in Australia next year. It seemed to me that the Australian networks might welcome a situation where, by agreement, they did not buy programs abroad until they were assured after seeing a number of episodes that the programs would be suitable and successful on Australian television. I hope that my approach, relates not only to a considerable saving of money on the purchase of programs from abroad, which could then be devoted to the production of Australian programs, but also to improving the quality of programs that are purchased by the networks abroad. My suggestion seems preferable to the networks&#39; going abroad and purchasing on speculation. They would have the advantage of seeing 2 or 3 episodes of a production before they decided to purchase. That is why I made the approach. </para>

          <para>-  1 have pleasure in presenting to the Senate the report of the Joint Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee on Australia&#39;s foreign aid. The report arises from a series of meetings held between March and October 1972 of a sub-committee of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs. In response to advertisements published in the Press 39 submissions were presented to the sub-committee by members of the public. At the 22 meetings, 12 of which were public evidence was taken from 34 witnesses representing the academic world, voluntary aid agencies and Commonwealth government departments. </para>

        <para>Honourable senators will find a number of conclusions and recommendations in the report. I hope that honourable senators will read those recommendations in conjunction  with the  background analysis in the main text  with a  view  to  apprising themselves further of  the  many complex issues involved  iri the  area of foreign aid. Senators will need no reminding  that the  views of  the  Committee  &#171;re  not necessarily those of this Government. However, senators  may  be confident that  the  Government regards  the  report as a useful contribution to  the  general debate on aid and will consider seriously the valuable points arising from it. </para>

              <para>- The Government recently gave consideration to the question of rules for the use of Royal Australian Air Force VIP aircraft for VIPs and VIP party travel, following which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> stated that the rules would be tabled when Parliament sat. I now table these rules. There are some points which I should specifically mention. Essentially these rules are the same as those which were drawn up and applied under the previous Government. Those rules were the subject of a statement in the Senate on 30th September 1970 by the then Minister for Air, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman,</inline> in which he summarised their provisions. The rules which I have tabled amplify the previous rules in 2 respects. First it is made clear that a request is not to be made to an approving authority for VIP aircraft travel if alternative forms of transport are available. Second the previous rules said that passengers carried as members of a VIP&#39;s party would normally be limited to his wife, personal staff and departmental officials connected with the official party. The new rules add that if a request is made for travel by a member of a VIP&#39;s family other than his wife it will be referred to the Prime Minister for consideration. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There is a final point I should make to avoid possible misunderstanding. As has been made clear in the past, the rules provide guidelines. They are not intended to include specific references to all circumstances in which travel on VIP aircraft may be approved nor are they intended to be inflexible. There may be special circumstances in which approving authorities will need to exercise discretion and applications in those cases will be examined on individual merits. Such matters will be handled by the Minister for Defence in consultation with the Prime Minister. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- At the outset I Indicate that I strongly oppose the proposal which has been submitted to the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> that the Senate disapprove a number of Determinations  made under the Public Service Arbitration Act. The Senate&#39;s action in disapproving &#39; those Determinations of the Public Service Arbitrator would have the effect of denying an additional one week&#39;s annual leave to many thousands of members of the Public Service. Whilst I take  the debate on the proposal quite seriously, because of the implications of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> proposal, I find it very difficult to take seriously the honourable senator&#39;s motion, proposed on behalf of the Opposition, and also what has been said by the Opposition on it. 1 say that because my colleague, the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop),</inline> recited by chapter and verse something of the conduct and performance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> when he was Attorney-General in the former government. In the course of his tenure of that office <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> displayed an aversion to trade unions generally and to trade union officials in particular. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The granting of preference to unionists, which is what this is all about, is not an innovation. It is not a new thing. My colleague, the Minister for Repatriation, had incorporated in Hansard a schedule of awards making provision for preference to unionists. That schedule, which took up over 2 pages of Hansard in close type,, appears at pages 116, 117 and 118. 1 repeat that what we are projecting in the course of the proposal to grant 4 weeks annual leave to those who are members of claimant organisations is not an innovation. I took the opportunity of checking some of the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitration Reports, presented over the years, and I found something of interest in volume 36 of 1956 entitled Determinations made and interpretations given pursuant to the Public Service Arbitration Act 1920-1955&#39; over the signature of the then Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the Hon.</inline> N. O&#39;sullivan. I remind the Senate that this occurred in the course of the life of a government which was of the same political character as are the parties which we now see in opposition. Paragraph 35 on page 589 of volume 36. under the heading &#39;Application of Determination&#39;, states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Notwithstanding any other provision of this determination the Commissioner shall not be obliged to grant to an employee who is not a financial member of the claimant organisation covering his calling any of the benefits, prescribed by clauses 18, 19 and 20 of this determination.  1 was reliably informed by the source from which I obtained this information that the Public Service Arbitrator has consistently over the years drawn awards and determinations which have restricted the benefits which have been obtained by claimant organisations to the members of those organisations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>It was, to say the least, a novel experience last Thursday to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> who, as I have said, has in the past displayed such hostility towards unions, present himself as the champion of the workers cause. That is a little hard for honourable senators on this side of the House to accept. I regard the Opposition&#39;s proposal as, to say the least, political humbug. I am not sure whether, as a consequence of his Party&#39;s defeat in the last House of Representatives election, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> - I regret that he has left the chamber - has been chastened, which I doubt; but it is interesting to note that he now claims that he is concerned about personal freedom and freedom of the individual to make decisions. I direct the attention of honourable senators to page 111 of Hansard of 1st March 1973. Among other things, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is reported as having said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To say that  a  person shall receive  4  weeks leave only if he is a member of  a  union is to deny to a person an essential freedom. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There have to be over-riding considerations of public utility to break down the rule that a person should have a freedom to decide whether he shall join an organisation. The practical effect of what has been done is that if a person does not join he will be denied an extra week&#39;s leave. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I wonder what those young men who were subjected to the administration of the National Service Act by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> as Attorney-General, would have to say about that. As Attorney-General he pursued the Act with such zeal that he persecuted, prosecuted and jailed young men who had the temerity to exercise the freedom he now suggests ought to be available to all and sundry. We, of course, believe in this freedom, but we also say at the same time that we believe a person is entitled to make a contribution to an organisation which obtains benefits for him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> went on to use some rather extravagant language. At page 1 1 1 of Hansard he is also reported as having said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>What is being done is a form of economic blackmail and coercion. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those are strong words indeed. All we are talking about is preference to unionists, which is not a new thing. It is as old as the industrial movement itself and it has been accepted and acknowledged by responsible authorities and tribunals throughout the years. To compare <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> conduct in the former Government, particularly when he was Minister for Health, let me refer briefly to sections of the National Health Act. I do so because I believe that it will point up the double standards that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is adopting in pretending to be the champion of the workers cause. He has referred to the right of the individual to decide whether he will belong to an organisation. He has referred also to compulsion, blackmail and coercion. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was Minister for Health in the former Government he had the responsibility of administering the National Health Act. 1 refer to section 13 of Part III of the National Health Act which deals with medical benefits and relates to the interpretation of some of the terms used in the Act. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Commonwealth benefit&#39; means a benefit payable by the Commonwealth under this Fart in respect of a professional service rendered to a contributor and includes a payment under section 25 of this Act. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Contributor&#39; is defined as being a taxpayer who is obliged under the Act to belong to one of the fund organisations. It is true that a contributor could use his option and that he could either belong or not belong, but if he did not belong he did not enjoy the benefit of the contribution made by the Commonwealth Government. I refer again to the interpretation of &#39;contributor&#39; in the same section of the Act. The Act states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Contributor&#39; means a person who pays contributions, or on whose behalf contributions are paid, to the medical benefits fund conducted by a registered medical benefits organisation . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Fund benefit&#39; is defined as meaning:  the amount, other than in respect of Commonwealth benefit, paid or payable under the rules of a registered medical benefits organisation in respect of medical expenses incurred by a person who pays contributions to the medical benefits fund . . . </para>
          <para class="block">Section 13 then briefly interprets the meaning of &#39;medical benefits fund&#39;. It states: medical benefits fund&#39; means a fund conducted by an organisation under the rules of which benefits are provided to contributors to the fund, being benefits consisting of payments in respect of medical expenses incurred by those contributors or their dependants or consisting of the provision of &#34;professional services under a contract arrangement for those contributors or their dependants, or both. </para>
          <para class="block">Section 13 of the National Health Act simply says what we are saying in respect to the application of 4 weeks annual leave to public servants. The former Government, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> was the then Minister for Health, was saying that one was obliged it is true to say that it is voluntary to belong to a fund if, firstly, one wanted to derive the benefit of receiving the amount that is payable by the fund and secondly, the subsidy that is payable by the Commonwealth to the fund. But, first of all, one is compulsory obliged to belong to a fund organisation. I refer to a further section of the Act. It is Part III, section 14(2). Sub-section (2.) highlights in clear and unequivocal terms the point which I am making. It states: </para>

            <para>If, on the date on which the professional service was rendered, any contributions due and payable to the organisation in respect of the contributor had not been paid- in other words, if he were not financial at the time when he received the professional service - and, by reason of the non-payment, the organisation was entitled to refuse payment of fund benefits in respect of medical services rendered to the contributor, Commonwealth benefit is not payable in respect of the professional service unless - </para>
            <list type="loweralpha">
              <item label="(a)">
                <para>a fund benefit is paid by the organisation in respect of the professional service. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The sub-section makes it quite clear that not only must a person belong to a fund organisation to be entitled to the benefit of the Commonwealth subsidy but he must be financial as at the date on which the professional service was rendered to him. If he was not and if the fund organisation was entitled to refuse payment of a benefit, the Commonwealth automatically refuses to pay its subsidy. </para>
          <para>To a large extent, the same principle applies in respect of hospital benefits. That principle is contained in Part V of the Act. I will refer only briefly to it. It is Division 3, Part V, section 46 (1.). This section refers to hospital treatment. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Where a contributor receives hospital treatment in an approved hospital, there is payable, subject to this Part, Commonwealth benefit of $2 for each day on which the contributor is a qualified hospital patient. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That sub-section contains 2 qualifications. The first is that the person has to be a contributor and that he has to be financial as at the time he received the service. The second is that he has to be a patient in a qualified hospital. The section goes on briefly to deal with 2 different types of beneficiaries under the so-called voluntary, non-compulsory national health scheme. I refer to section 46 (2.) of Division 3. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Where hospital fund benefit is not payable in respect of a day on which a contributor is a qualified hospital patient - </para>

                <para>for a reason other than the reason specified in the last preceding paragraph, if payment of the benefit could have been refused for the reason so specified, the amount of Commonwealth benefit per day is 80c instead of  $2. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Under the hospital benefit scheme there was some modification of the stringent measures applicable to the entitlement of medical benefits inasmuch as if a person was not a member of an organisation or if his contributions were still outstanding at the time that he was hospitalised and if the benefit fund refused to pay him benefit because of those specified reasons, the Commonwealth Government, out of taxation which is payable by all workers, reduced the payment from $2 a day to 80c a day. </para>
          <para>I make a final reference to the Act because it fortifies what I have said. I refer to section 48 (1.). It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Where a contributor receives hospital treatment in an approved hospital before he became a contributor or in the period of 2 months commencing on the day on which he became a contributor and, under the rules of the registered hospital benefits organisation to the fund of which he is a contributor, no hospital fund benefit or an amount of hospital benefit of less than $1.65 per day is paid by the organisation in respect of the days in that period on which he is a qualified hospital patient, the amount of Commonwealth benefit per day is 80c instead of $2. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If a person were hospitalised in an approved hospital either before he joined the fund organisation or 2 months after joining it and if the registered rules of the fund benefit organisation prescribe that no fund benefit is payable or that the amount of hospital fund benefit of less than $1.65 per day is payable by the organisation, the Commonwealth grants the handsome amount of 80c a day. When one considers the objections that have been voiced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> to the proposal - which I support wholeheartedly - for a form of preference to people who make a contribution to an organisation which obtains benefit for them and when one compares what he, as the Minister for Health, said in relation to the National Health Act and what he said, as Attorney-General, in relation to the National Service Act one can see the point which I made earlier in my speech, that is, that it is very difficult to take seriously the Opposition&#39;s quest to present itself as the champion of the worker because it strikes me, as I said earlier, as being out and out humbug. </para>
          <para>I make a passing reference to another contribution that was made. I think it was one of the most crude and nauseating contributions that I have heard made by any senator. The honourable senator represents the section on my half right. That is the appropriate political orientation of the honourable senator and it is the position in which he is located in the chamber. Since 1955 he has consistently opposed worthwhile reforms which were suggested by the then Opposition, which is now the Government, and which would have enabled the trade union movement to breathe more freely and to obtain improved physical conditions of employment and improved standards of living for its members. He had the temerity, in my view, to lambast, in one of the crudest speeches I have heard in this chamber, trade union secretaries and officers of trade unions.  His  speech was nauseating to me. The only conclusion that I can draw is that perhaps the material that this gentleman displays on the shelves in his newsagency, which material he must peruse occasionally, has affected him. That is the way his speech came through to me. </para>
          <para>I have heard it said that some people claim that pornography tends to deprave the mind. I have an idea that that has happened to the gentleman on my half right. He was an erstwhile Labor man and a former officer of a trade union, but I have not heard him once attack the profession of the gentleman who moved the motion which the honourable senator supported so strongly. I have not heard the honourable senator attack that profession and gentlemen of that profession who are dealt with for embezzling clients funds, which are held in trust accounts. I have not heard him attack major employer organisations which have allowed their funds to be denuded  to  such an extent that the organisations have gone into bankruptcy, thus denying workers their just entitlements for work already done - annual leave, sick leave and long service leave entitlements. I have not heard him utter one word against such organisations. It is a poor show indeed for one who has served the Labor movement to engage in attacks on an organisation of which he knows better. I do not claim the organisation is any better or any worse than other sections of the community, but why should he be so selective and single it out as he does repeatedly? </para>
          <para>I think I have dealt sufficiently with what the honourable senator said, except  to  point out that his temerity and audacity  to  suggest that he would introduce a Bill which would give 4 weeks annual leave to public servants is nothing more than political humbug. The Democratic Labor Party supported the former government, which constantly and right up till the last general election, opposed every attempt to secure 4 weeks annual leave not only by public servants but also by all other organised workers in Australia before various tribunals. Let us get the record straight. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> cannot play a double game in this place. He has played it for too long. I am sure that people will see him and his Party for what they are. The DLP has lived like a parasite off a political party which is no longer in government. Now it has problems because it has to live with the changed fortunes of that party. </para>
          <para>I felt obliged to say that because there is nothing worse than seeing people act in the manner in which some people act in this chamber. All we are saying is that thousands upon thousands of public servants have contributed to their organisations. Down through the years they have expended time, energy and a great amount of money in endeavouring to improve the conditions - both physical and financial - of those employed in the Public Service. I do not think it is unreasonable to say that any decent person - I use that term deliberately - would object to paying for a service and a benefit which a union obtains. I understand that in recent weeks because of what has been decided by the Arbitrator and particularly since the instructions issued by the Public Service Board there has been quite a substantial increase in the membership of the various claimant organisations. That is good. I hope it continues to be so. In my view and in the Government&#39;s view it would be wrong for this chamber to deny a benefit to those persons who over the years have contributed to and assisted their organisations progressively to improve their standard of living and working conditions. I cannot see how the Opposition can justify this motion because some few people as employees have not recognised their responsibilities to their claimant organisations and paid their contributions. </para>
          <para>If this argument were carried to its illogical conclusion it would mean that although one received a service from the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works one should not have to pay one&#39;s rates each year. One pays one&#39;s rates because of the service one receives. I regret that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> is not in the chamber; he has exercised his option to stay or go. I presume that if he were to attend a social function with some friends one evening and it was necessary to use a taxi he would expect to pay his part of the fare because he has received a service in the use of that con veyance. There is nothing more or less to this proposition. I hope that those who are members of claimant organisations are entitled to receive a benefit which they achieve over and above their colleagues who are not of the same mind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> talks about economic blackmail and coercion. What greater coercion can there be than that which I read from the National Health Act, if it is a matter of comparing one with the other. Nobody acknowledges more than I the benefit of an additional week&#39;s annual leave for those employed in any industry, including of course the Public Service. But if it were a matter of selecting one or the other I am sure that everyone in this chamber would agree that access to assistance from the Commonwealth Government, to which all taxpayers pay, for hospital and medical costs would be paramount. It would be over and above even a week&#39;s annual leave in industry. Yet this Opposition, the former government, suggested that it was a voluntary health scheme. It has been shown for what it really was. It was a compulsory health scheme because if one did not make a contribution one did not derive a benefit. This is a simple proposition of ours and one for which we make no apology. I sincerely hope that the Senate will recast its thinking on this matter. It appears that some arrangement has been entered into between the various Opposition groupings. We have 3 or 4 now as distinct from what we used to have. I sincerely ask honourable senators opposite to reconsider the implications of what it is attempting to do because if a Bill is brought into this chamber and carried it still has to go back to the other House to be dealt with. </para>

The Government opposes very strongly any attempt to delay or deny this improved benefit to those persons who have made a contribution towards it over the years. Other people who are of a different mind have an option to exercise. This scheme of arrangement is as free and non-compulsory as the National Health Act was under the former government. </para>

            <para>-  This debate originates from a motion brought forward by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood).</inline> It seeks to disallow some 7 determinations under the Public Service Arbitration Act 1920-1972. In effect the determinations seek to provide 4 weeks annual leave or an additional week&#39;s annual leave with pay to public servants with the qualification that they must be unionists. The effect of disallowance is not in any way intended to alter or hinder the extension of the benefit of 4 weeks annual leave to public servants. It can be extended by legislation with the qualification removed and it can be done promptly. That is a matter for the Government. Indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> has shown a way. Why does the Opposition seek this disallowance? It does so for a number of reasons. The first is incontrovertible because the action taken under the Public Service determinations is in fact a dishonouring of the policy speech of the Whitlam Government. Of course the silence of Government senators underlines that statement. </para>

              <para>- I accept the offer made by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop)</inline> because I do not have a spare copy of the policy speech. I would like one. The policy speech says without qualification that there shall be 4 weeks annual leave. So did the statement made by the Minister for Labour <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> 3 days after the election. It was made without qualification. It is only subsequently when pressures from without are upon the Government that we find this situation. The number one reason why this should be disallowed is because it dishonours the policy speech. The second reason relates to something which the present Government, when in Opposition, was unanimous about. Let us hope that it is unanimous today. We had lecture after lecture, notably by the present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy),</inline> as to what a bad and rotten principle it was to seek to do by regulation and by backhand methods what should be done by law. Let nobody from the Government benches deny that, because we were lectured ad nauseam. I invite the Government to accept the principle of its then mentor. I say also that it should be rejected because it is fundamentally opposed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which provides that no-one may be compelled to belong to an association. </para>

I say unequivocally that those conventions would hold as nauseating the principle which the Government now seeks to introduce. In other words, I say that it is in breach of the conventions and I invite the Government to deny it. </para>

              <para>- I have stated that there are a number of reasons why this motion for the disallowance of these determinations should be supported. I have said that the Public Service determination has dishonoured the Australian Labor Party&#39;s policy; that it is a bad principle to do by regulation what thereby bypasses the Parliament; and that this action is opposed to the declaration of human rights. I have drawn attention to the InternationalLabour Organisation declarations and had them incorporated in the Hansard record. At that stage I was challenged by the Minister for Repatriation who asked me whether I had a copy of the ALP policy. He offeredme a copy. Since then I have availed myself of the facilities of the Parliamentary Library. </para>

          <para class="block">There is no qualification and any suggestion otherwise is distortion. I say that these determinations should be opposed for another reason. They frustrate the essential principle of equal pay for equal work value. That is the basis of all good Australian and all good trade union principles. I stated that what the ALP is trying to do is in defiance of that. What it is doing is un-Australian, divisive and loathsome. I. use those words advisedly. Under this device, it is trying by a backdoor method to establish a precedent and to establish, first in the Commonwealth Public Service, what the Labor Party sets out in its policy platform under the heading of &#39;Commonwealth Public Service&#39;. Let honourable senators deny it. It is stated that there will be shorter hours, 4 weeks annual leave, equal pay for the sexes, pro rata annual leave and maternity leave. All that is granted with one qualification: Public servants receive it only if they join a union. Let honourable senators opposite deny that they want to implement this platform. </para>
          <para>Last week a Minister said that this was not contained in the policy speech. He said that it was contained in the Party&#39;s platform. He said that that was the area from which the Party derived its strength. The Party platform aims, as a precedent, at bringing into Australia the most obnoxious, un-Australian and anti-trade union principle. It is a divisive and loathsome principle. I now come to another high principle that the ALP has used for years. Members of the Labor Party say - let them roll in this - &#39;you cannot legislate for morality&#39;. They say that you must not interfere with morality. Let those people who believe, as I do, that there are moral reasons for people who gain the benefits of trade unionism to join unions - I was in such a position and belonged proudly and voluntarily to a union - admit that they cannot hope to achieve their ends by legislating for morality. </para>
          <para>If you legislate for morality, you legislate for tyranny and that is silly and inefficient. The principle that such people espouse is that in order to receive the benefits of trade unions people should be forced to join those organisations. This thing called &#39;preference to unionists&#39; is a backdoor method of compulsory unionism because the end is the same. Those who say: &#39;We will force you to do it&#39;, are trying to legislate for morality. That is the ugliest and most stupid of attempts. The effect is to be this: In Australia on the trade union and industrial level there are henceforth to be 2 kinds of citizens. We will have the Whitlamite citizen class 1 - the Australian stakhanovite. Let there be no mistake about this. He will be the good person who receives a good conduct badge because, forced or voluntarily, he has joined a union. Then we will have the deprived, under-privileged citizen class 2 who has failed because that citizen has elected not to join a union. This is the Party that had the nerve to say in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech that we must unite Australia - that it has been divided. There is no more ugly or divisive principle than that which is enshrined in this ordinance. </para>
          <para>Why is the Labor Party doing it? Let us examine the position and look at a number of reasons. I can fully sympathise with those decent trade union leaders who want more people in their unions, who want more money for their unions and who, as one Government Minister said, need it because unionism is becoming more costly. But because something is becoming more costly they should not do a Ned Kelly and stick a gun at the head of members of the community. That is entirely a wrong tactic. I can sympathise with union officials. Let us reflect and remember this: Of all the men and women in Australia who are eligible to join a trade union, despite the abilities of the trade unions to bring their facilities to the attention of these people, approximately half of them at this moment have elected not to join. What are we to do? Are we to say that we will stand by and, by blackmail and industrial conscription, take that one-half of the eligible people and force them into a trade union? Perhaps it is not the fault of these people that they have not joined unions. Perhaps they should say: &#39;Physician, cure thyself. Look, trade union official, at yourself. What are you doing wrong that you cannot attract people to the union?&#39;. That is the real mote in the eye. </para>
          <para>Last year, the Australian Labor Party was successful in a move which is now becoming the trade union numbers game. It has pledged the whole of its weight to obtain amalgamations in trade unions. As in the case of its caucus, the ALP is to use the numbers game in trade unionism. Because they will do that the trade union leaders are out to gain more and more numbers in more and more trade unions, amalgamating unions left and right. This drive is making the ordinary worker in the community a puppet in the game of the trade union official and ALP and Communist Party politics. The unionist himself is merely a pawn.  His  welfare does not matter. In my view, this is odious. </para>
          <para>We must look at 2 aspects of this matter. The Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cavanagh)</inline> today exposed an interesting situation. He said, in effect, that the ALP is to implement that clause of its policy which states that all contracts made by the Commonwealth or its authorities shall provide preference for unionists. When pressed about Government policy, he said that this is to be a personal, ministerial responsibility. The fact is that this is inherent in Labor Party thinking because it is a 2-way squeeze. The Minister for Works should reflect on John Milton&#39;s famous poem, On  His  Blindness&#39;. He should remember one line and roll it around and around in his mind: </para>
          <para>Doth God exact day-labour, light denied . . . He should remember that the poem was aptly entitled for the Labor Party&#39;s benefit &#39;On His Blindness*. There can be nothing more stupid than to use another weapon of intimidation - the threat that the Government is to force day labour. If  1  may say so, when the Government does that it will be light denied. But the Government intends to do it in an interesting way. Firstly, there is a thrust on the trade unions particularly to get numbers up in those unions which by political levy give money to the Labor Party. Do not forget that the greater the numbers, the greater the levy. I sympathise with the Labor Party&#39;s dilemma because of its massive Bacchanalian over expenditure to honour promises made in the last election campaign, but I look at it with some envy. Of course the Labor Party is short of money, so it gets its funds by duress and blackmail. The Labor Party gets its funds by putting pressure on the trade unions to increase their numbers. Then it says to commerce and industry: &#39;Let us get this straight: By the most intangible terms which we will not define but which the Minister will know by virtue of his responsibility, unless you are on side with the unions and unless the shop stewards tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> &#34;This is a good shop; it played ball in all ways&#34;, you do not get a contract&#39;. This is the corruption of all moral values. What an extraordinary situation. If we apply this principle, do we take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> will say:  &#39;1  will give contracts only to those who, as employers, belong to the Building Industry Congress&#39;? Do not forget that the International Labour Organisation gives exactly the same privileges and exactly the same responsibilities to employer organisations as it does to employees. Are we to have that situation? Let honourable senators opposite answer this question: Is it for one group only? Are we to have the situation in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> in another place, when he negotiates a most common fee with the Australian Medical Association, will say to the General Practitioners Society: &#39;You are not a member of the AMA; you must charge a lower fee. There are  2  different kinds of rates - one for those who belong to the employers union which we recognise and the scabs&#39;. Are we to apply this principle throughout? </para>
          <para>When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> spoke in this debate he raised the fact that in  1963  a Liberal government brought in reforms for the stevedoring industry and, having done so, made it a closed shop. That was like looking at the back half of the moon, for what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> failed to say - this was agreed by honourable senators on both sides - was that a group of employees was facing massive retrenchment as a result of massive modernisation and massive mechanisation of their industry, and that the Act was designed specifically to protect them against others coming in and taking their jobs. The Act was a result of special circumstances. It was commended on all sides. It was a most enlightened piece of legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> somehow also took some credit for the fact that in  1947 :i  Commonwealth Public Service regulation impacted, and still does, upon Commonwealth Railways. I point out, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chifley</inline> was the Prime Minister in  1947  and this in fact was his kind of legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> asked why we on this side always talked about the Australian Labor Party platform, and why we do not talk about the Liberal Party platform. I am proud to talk about the Liberal Party platform. I hold a copy of the federal platform of the Liberal Party of Australia in my hand. I accept the challenge. He was much slower to give me a copy of the Labor Party platform; in fact, he is still the reluctant virgin. Perhaps that is an unwise choice of words. I am prepared to have incorporated in Hansard, if Government supporters and others so desire, that section of the federal platform of the Liberal Party of Australia which sets out the policy points on employment and industry. Have I permission to incorporate it in Hansard? </para>

              <para>- I accept that the Government when challenged ran away from it. There is no proof that Government members can read. Last week they were so high with noise, noise, noise, and they kept asking why we did not talk about it. We called their bluff on the International Labour Organisation, and we have called their bluff on the Liberal Party. They do not have the guts to give me permission to incorporate this document. I remind the Senate that contained in this platform of the Liberal Party are impeccable principles regarding effective trade unionism. the protection and development of healthy trade unions and the protection and development of high standards in Australia. I remind the Senate that those principles include incidentally, encouragement of industrial organisations of employers and employees; that membership is not to be compulsory, and acceptance of the principle that in return for good work employed persons merit the highest wages and best conditions that the national economy can sustain with regard to the situation in any particular industry. There are some 20 or 30 such premises on this. </para>

          <para>Let us look at the principles involved. This is not a piece of legislation aimed to improve unionism, to raise the standards of the Australian community or to help commercial and industrial working conditions. This is a regulation, an ordinance, designed to be divisive; designed to help the unionists and the Labor politicians; designed to be punitive; designed to divide the Australian community. It is designed to go further and to bring in the principle, firstly, in the Public Service and then into the rest of industry and commerce in Australia, that there shall be 2 kinds of citizens. Whether it has regard to hours, annual leave or equal pay, let us not forget that all women are equal with men except that some women, being unionists, are more equal than others. All pregnant women are equal, but pregnant women unionists are more equal than unpregnant women. Let us look at this aspect because this is what the Labor Party says in its platform. </para>
          <para>We come now to the nub of this matter. The birdbrains on the Government side are interjecting, but when pulled up they have nothing to say. Let me sum up by saying that there is no doubt in the world - the Opposition would be the first to concede - that everything that is possible to do should be done to achieve healthy, vigorous and voluntary trade unionism in this country. Trade unionism in itself has its strength in voluntary unionism; it has its weakness, its destruction, in compulsory unionism. Compulsion destroys it. </para>

              <para>- I need no go. It is they who need forgiveness. The whole of the ILO conventions are based not only on the fundamental acceptance of the Declaration of Human Rights but on the freedom of the right of people to organise, and the freedom of the right of people to organise means the freedom if they wish, not to organise. If there is no freedom not to organise, there is no freedom to organise. I stood in this place and in plain English opposed the amalgamation because I believe this country will live to regret it. The fact of the matter is that under the guise of claiming that they are helping decent Australian working people - men and women - and under the unqualified promises in the policy speech regarding extra leave, equal pay and extra maternity leave, there now emerges the proposition that you must read the policy speech together with the platform; that all these matters are qualified. The living wage is to be fixed in the wage case to be heard in a month&#39;s time. I understand that in that case the needs principle is to be pleaded. Presumably it will be pleaded on 2 levels - the needs of the Whitlamites and the needs of the deprived. Are we to have margins for skill for those who are unionists and lesser margins for those who are not unionists? This is completely anti-Australian. </para>

          <para>I sympathise with many honourable senators opposite who - and let me pay a tribute to them - in their day have been fine trade union officials and who understand the great difficulties involved in running great institutions and trade unions. I sympathise with their sense of frustration that their numbers are falling and that they need more money. I sympathise with that, and I will be very attentive to suggestions as to how they will get their numbers up. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I do not know whether you know about genetic sports and mutations, but an honourable senator who sits appropriately on my left is the very embodiment of sport. That is the only question he has ever raised. I think he is the. .only genetic mutation that the Labor Party has produced in my time here. </para>
          <para>Having said that, I conclude by putting to the people of Australia that it is morally wrong for the Government to attempt to legislate What it thinks is morality. Why is it right if it thinks there is  a  moral obligation on someone to join  a  union? What impertinence it is to decide that. I hold the same view, but it would be impertinent of me if I tried to enforce it. Let me make it quite clear that I believe that people have a moral obligation to join the organisation of their calling. I believe that, and I stand here and say it with all the emphasis that I can command. I believe that it is a corruption of morals and a corruption of the mind for people to get up and say: *We will do that by duress; we will do that by legislation&#39;. I use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> words - the words of one of your leaders: &#39;You cannot legislate for morality in unions or in anything else. When you do you corrupt your party and you do a grave disservice to society&#39;. I commend the motion for disallowance and I ask honourable senators to support it. </para>

            <para>- If the aftermath of that provocative speech that we have just heard has died down I will take a short time to try to bring the Senate back to a realisation of the problem that is before it. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop,</inline> that the Young Liberal trained lad from New South Wales is quite capable of making good speeches. It is unfortunate that on occasions when he gets on to industrial unionism we see all the military training come out and a display of the hatred of those who have built Australia. It is significant that tonight we have been denied all the logic, commonsense and the facts which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> sometimes advances in this chamber. He has denigrated himself as just a rabble rouser. He has forgotten the truth and the facts because he is in Opposition. He wants to make a name for himself.

              <para>- I do not know why I am subjected to this repeated mouthing of statements that are unrealistic. After discussion with the Minister today, I say that there is no concern that these determinations may be disallowed and that subsequent legislation may extend this provision to everyone in the Public Service. The Labor Party has  a  policy supporting preference to unionism and encouraging trade union membership. We put our policy into operation by making to the Public Service Arbitrator representations which have resulted in the determinations now under challenge. This was not done lightly. It was done mainly at the request of the right wing unions - unions which are not affiliated with the Labor Party and unions which are affiliated with the Australian Democratic Labor Party. No-one can tell me that the unions affiliated with the Labor Party, or the extreme left wing unions, have any difficulty in enrolling union membership. Noone can point to any number of employees in the engineering or metal trades industry who are not members of unions. No-one can point to a great number of builders labourers or building trades workers who are not members of unions. </para>

In practice, what is really in issue today is not the right to refuse to join a union but the effective right to join. The major growth area of employment and union potential is in the white collar field. There is substantial evidence available relating to overseas as well as Australia to demonstrate the determination of employers, particularly those in the multi-national corporation area, to ensure that their white collar employees do not join unions. It is the knowledge of the opportunity for victimisation of those who join or advocate joining unions in the white collar sphere which prevents large numbers from being the first to join. </para>

It is a case of the right of workers to join a union without being subject to victimisation. </para>

              <para>- That is the point, and I think it is well documented that overseas and even Australian interests introduce victimisation. They do not give their workers the right to join  a  union. In the last few weeks about 15,000 clerical officers in Commonwealth employment had the freedom to join a union because in doing so they could defy their chiefs of staff. On this issue I support the Minister for Urban and Regional Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren).</inline> I do not support compulsion in every field. If I am a wheat grower, in order to be allocated a quota I must join a wheat growers organisation. If I sell dried fruits or grow grapes I have to join an association. If I enter such an occupation that is one of the compulsory conditions. I have to pay a fee. for the purpose of working in that occupation, and that payment is justified by the benefits I receive in return. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline>I thought earlier tonight that you very logically related this issue to the health services. The previous Government boasted that it is a voluntary health insurance scheme. There is no compulsion to join a hospital and medical benefits fund, but if you do you are paid benefits. The purpose of the Cabinet decision in this case is to see that the people who have advocated and agitated for increased annual leave and have applied to join a union receive the benefit of the Arbitration Commission&#39;s award. There should be no compulsion to force that benefit on to those people who do not want it and who indicated that they do not want it by refusing to participate in the activities of a union. That is ail we are seeking to do. We are supporting the freedom of the individual. </para>
          <para>Having studied <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> motion for disallowance, one would have expected something better from the Attorney-General in the previous Government. He seeks to disallow a number of determinations which were made by the Public Service Arbitrator. I believe that one determination - I have not found it - of the number he seeks to disallow discriminates as to who is to receive the additional leave. That is because in that instance the Public Service Arbitrator had the power so to determine. The Public Service Arbitrator does not have the power to determine whether unionists or non-unionists get additional leave and in all determinations except one before us he has not done so. We are asked to disallow a number of determinations which do not give an extra week&#39;s annual leave to trade unionists but to respondents to the applications before the Arbitrator. </para>
          <para>The Arbitrator can make an award binding only on the parties to the application. He cannot inflict something on people who are not members of a union that makes an application to him. His determination is limited to those people who made, the application through their trade unions. I believe that in the past it has been the practice to issue regulations under regulation 74b to make the Arbitrator&#39;s decision apply to all employees of a particular undertaking. On this occasion, because of the Labor Party&#39;s policy, no such regulation will be issued and therefore the additional week&#39;s leave will be restricted to members of the applicant unions only. If there is something wrong it is a condemnation of the Government or the Minister or the Public Service Board for refusing the leave to all; it is not a condemnation of the determinations, which represent only an expression of the principle of 4 weeks leave for those who apply for it. </para>
          <para>I come now to the point that the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator has supreme power. I believe that power is subject to some appeal to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission but it is not subject to appeal in this Parliament. Section 12 of the Public Service Arbitration Act is important. This shows the enormity of what honourable senators opposite are seeking to do tonight. It is not of much concern if the Democratic Labor Party and the Liberal Party do not want to help the right wing of the trade union movement. That is all right; we will give it to everyone but at least we can say that we tried on behalf of affiliated unions. Let us look at section 12 of the Public Service Arbitration Act. While in government the present Opposition parties pleaded that we should keep wage fixing and conditions of employment outside politics and independent machinery was set up to do this through the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Arbitration Court was set up to deal with workers generally. The stevedoring industry was dealt with by another organisation and under the Public Service Arbitration Act machinery was set up to deal with wages and conditions of employment in the Public Service. I believe that that Act was amended last year. Section 12 of the Act states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Subject to this Act, the Arbitrator shall determine all matters submitted to him relating to conditions of employment of officers and employees of the Public Service. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Public Service Arbitrator is the deciding authority. He has decided that employees who applied for this benefit should receive 4 weeks annual leave. Now the Opposition is saying tonight that we should take this matter out of the field of the independent arbitrator who made the decision after a hearing and bring it back into the field of politics with all the dirt and filth that goes with it when dealing with wage fixation. Normally we would not have power to do this. We have no power to interfere with the decision of the Arbitrator unless that decision is contrary to an Act of Parliament. This represents the supremacy of the people&#39;s elected representatives over the Arbitrator. There may come a time when, for better industrial relations, power can be given to one man to make a decision although it may be contrary to the law of the land. That power is found in section 22 of the Act. </para>

              <para>- I am coming to that. The Arbitrator does so in this case. He could be definite about the question. I think that interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> is a good one. While the Arbitrator may be definite about the question, he need not be. He may think that perhaps the decision is contrary to the law of the land. We find that section 22 of the Act states:  (1.) The Arbitrator may make a determination which is not in accord with an award or order of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration or of the Commission, but, except as provided by this section, ls not empowered to make a determination which is not in accord with a law of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para class="block">And then some exemptions are set out. Stopping there, the Public Service Arbitrator considered this matter and he could make the determination only if he thought it was proper. He did so and therefore he must have considered that it was proper. Whether or not he thought it was in accordance with the law of the land, he thought the decision was proper and he made the order. The exemptions I referred to are the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act, the Commonwealth Employees Furlough Act and the Superannuation Act, &#39;or any other prescribed Act or the prescribed provisions of any other Act&#39;. My inquiries today have disclosed that the Public Service Act is not a prescribed Act. Other than in the case of those Acts, the Arbitrator can make a determination which is contrary to the law of the land if he thinks it proper to do so. In order to bring the question back to the people&#39;s representatives the Arbitrator has to send to the Prime Minister and to the Attorney-General a certified copy of the determination together with a statement of the laws of the Commonwealth with which, in his opinion, the determination is not or may not be, in accord. Section 22 (3.) then states: </para>

          <para class="block">Le us analyse what is stated in the Act. If, in the opinion of the Arbitrator, the determination is, or may be, in breach of the law of the Commonwealth, he has to give notice to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. The Prime Minister then has to place the determinations before the Senate, and this he has done. He also has to file the reasons given by the Public Service Arbitrator as to why he believes the determinations may not be in accordance with the law of the Commonwealth. If the Attorney-General submits that in his opinion they are not within the law of the Commonwealth, he has to submit a certificate accordingly. We have had tabled before the Senate the determinations and the correspondence from the Public Service Arbitrator to the Prime Minister but we have had no communication from the Attorney-General. The Public Service Arbitrator said that the determinations may be in breach of the law of the Commonwealth but he is not the legal adviser to this Parliament. The Attorney-General&#39;s Department is the legal adviser to this Parliament and to Ministers, who had knowledge that the Public Service Arbitrator held an opinion that the determination may be contrary to the law but the Attorney-General has not seen fit to notify us that in his opinion they may be in breach of the law.

That provides the opportunity for the motion of disallowance proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> to be made valid for discussion in this chamber. But the only reason he has this opportunity is because a section of the Act gives the representatives of the people the right to keep the power which, by statute, has been delegated to an Arbitrator. In this respect we have to consider the question whether to uphold the law or, for industrial harmony, give the Arbitrator power to regulate conditions and industrial relationships. The question involved is whether he should be permitted to have this say with respect to industrial relations. In his opinion the determinations may be in breach of the. law. I would say that it is reasonable to imply that in the opinion of our legal advisers they are not in breach of the law. Therefore, if there was no certificate from the Public Service Arbitrator, there would be no power for this chamber to discuss the question.

          <para class="block">It is apparent from that that on the first day of January a permanent officer who has been in a department for 12 months shall have credited to his recreation leave entitlement a period equivalent to the period of his ordinary hours of duty during a period of 3 weeks. Can anyone tell me where the determinations under challenge are in contradiction or in breach of that or seek to do something other than that? If 8 weeks leave a year were granted, subsection (4.) of section 68 would still apply and 3 weeks would be granted on the first day of January every year. One determination says that in addition to the period of recreation leave to which they may be entitled under section 68 of the Public Service Act - it acknowledges section 68 - and/or clause 8 or clause 8B of the determination, 7-day shift workers who are rostered to work regularly on Sundays and holidays shall be allowed 7 consecutive days leave, including non-working days. Perhaps 1 am confusing the issue. I am reading from Determination No. 23 of 1973 in which the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, the Commonwealth Public Service and others were the claimants, but I would point out that, in relation to recreation leave for permanent officers, clause 8B of that determination states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In addition to the period of recreation leave to which he may be entitled under the provisions, as at 1st January 1973, of the Public Service Act and Regulations, an officer shall, for each completed year of service, be allotted an additional period of leave equivalent to the period of his ordinary hours of duty for one week, such leave to be subject to the conditions specified in the Act and regulations for the grant of payment in lieu of recreation leave. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We see no interference with section 68 of the Public Service Act. It says that in addition to section 68 an officer will be granted an additional week&#39;s leave. There is no interference; no breach. Obviously the Arbitrator, who is not a legal adviser, was wrong in forming the opinion he formed. There can be no other alternative than that he was wrong in forming the opinion. But the letter to the Prime Minister gives us the only opportunity to disallow the determination. This can happen with respect to every application that goes before the Public Service Arbitrator if he is opposed to the agreement that has been reached between the parties before him. This gives an opportunity, especially as it is known that there is sufficient support in the Parliament so to do, to deprive those who have been offered increased annual leave of that leave. There has been public controversy over the disagreement between the Minister for Labour <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> and the Public Service Board on this matter. The forming of a wrong opinion and the sending of an incorrect letter to the Prime Minister is the only thing that has permitted us to take the question of arbitration outside of the jurisdiction of the person we appointed to deal with it impartially, and to place it in the hands of political parties. That is what has happened on this occasion. That raises the question I asked earlier tonight as to the extent to which the Opposition is prepared to go to block the efforts of the Government to give freedom to workers to join unions, including those unions which do not support the Australian Labor Patty. The Government is offering to those persons who are afraid of being victimised the opportunity of joining a union. The Opposition has adopted a different attitude on this matter for the sole purpose of gaining political advantage. It hopes to gain political advantage by taking this matter out of the hands of an independent tribunal and placing it in the political arena. That is the Opposition&#39;s prerogative. The Government is not concerned. If the Opposition wants to do it, it should do it; we are not concerned. I have stated the dangers. I have with me a copy of the Broadcasting and Television Act. One determination to which objection is taken is related to that Act. I think I have made my point. 1 will not go into it. </para>
          <para>I come now to the serious accusation which has been made against me. The accusation is that my intention is to give preference, in the letting of contracts, to those organisations which support compulsory unionism in their establishments. Nothing is further from the truth. I have had a lifetime association with the building industry and with the trade union movement. Few employers in the building industry in Australia would find any danger in the direction to my Department about the letting of contracts. The exception would be the isolated, notorious builder who is in the industry for the purpose of corruption. I have no time for such builders. Only last week I attended  a  luncheon given by the Master </para>
          <para class="block">Builders Association of Australia. I was well received. Among those present were 2 employers for whom I had worked. Also present were many others with whom I had negotiated. No builder of repute is concerned about the direction which 1 have given to my Department. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators opposite have been strong in their condemnation of the continual stoppages of work - I think all of us are desirous of avoiding those stoppages - because of the employment of non-union labour. The Northern Territory branch of the Electrical Trades Union has issued an ultimatum that its members shall refuse to work with non-unionists on any undertaking and shall refuse to supply electrical connections to buildings on which non-unionists have been employed. I made an appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dolan,</inline> the federal secretary of the union. 1 asked him whether he could get members of the union in the Territory to lift the ban, saying that in the week&#39;s recess I would go to the Territory to straighten out the position. No-one is doing more than 1 am to get trade union recognition in areas in which it is difficult to get it. I do not think I should have these accusations made against me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dolan</inline> has done his best. The Department of Works believes that there will be no trouble. The Department does not know who has been employed on the buildings. 1 believe that at present some shops and a motel do not have electricity connected because of the action of the union in Darwin. I am making a further appeal in connection with this matter. </para>
          <para>These problems of industrial relationship could be well done without in Australia. If it is a question of trying to get an amicable relationship between the trade union movement and the employers in industry, I am prepared to assist in every way that I can. Because I do I am continually under suspicion. I am questioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> It is foreign to his character to believe that I am doing my best. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the other place has stated publicly that my direction to the Department will lead to graft. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> when speaking to the Young Liberals in South Australia, said that I was encouraging graft in the industry. I have stated that nothing in the enforcement of trade unionism in industry would lead to anything like the graft which it was suggested by interjection tonight I might get from builders or that builders, by their method of operation in Australia, are getting from the Commonwealth. I have made a statement on television and I have been asked to justify it. </para>
          <para>The Department of Services and Property is renting accommodation, mostly from insurance companies, throughout Australia. The conditions of the leases include the provision that particular architects and particular builders must be used on any additions or renovations to the building. Under such a lease the Department rented from a company - I believe it was an insurance company, but I would not be sure of that fact - 11 floors of office space in a building at 162-166 Goulburn Street, Sydney, lt had to put in partitions so that the space could be used as office space. The conditions of the lease were that the Department had to employ the owner&#39;s contractor.  His  services were unsatisfactory, and complaints were made to the owner. The Department of Works had to get an appropriation from the Parliament for this work. Its estimate of the cost of the partitioning was 5152,251. The tender price accepted from Allen Constructions Pty Ltd was $.180,945. This price was considered to be excessive, but negotiations with the contractor failed to induce him to reduce it. As the terms of the lease provided for all work to be done by the owner&#39;s architect and contractor we had no alternative but to accept his price. Over $28,000 has been done cold just because the contractor had the right to do that work. </para>

              <para>- There was no alternative. The estimate of the Department of Works was considered to be a generous estimate. The Department could have let the job by contract for $152,000. Over $28,000 of Commonwealth money over and above the profit which another contractor could have made has been lost because the contractor had the right to do the job. </para>

              <para>- I am replying to the allegation that my direction about trade union membership will lead to racketeering or graft. What is this? The Department of Transport has office accommodation at North Sydney. Alterations and partitioning were carried out for the Department on floors 3 to 9 inclusive. The lease required the use of Max Cooper and Sons, who were the contrac tors nominated by the owners, the Mutual Life and Citizens Fire and General Insurance Co. One selected tender of $125,449 was obtained from this firm on 27th July 1971 for floors 3 to 8. The Department of Works tender estimate was $87,237. Negotiations with the contractor later reduced the price to $107,449. The contract was let on 16th August 1971, for completion on 5th December 1971. Occupation of the premises took place on 6th December 1971. </para>

              <para>- An estimate was made by the Department of Works, which had to get parliamentary approval for the expenditure. In addition to that estimate of cost, $40,000 was put on by a reputable company which was a member of the Master Builders Association of New South Wales. When the contractor was approached and told that the price was excessive he said: &#39;I will take off $20,000, and I will stick to the other $20,000 for good measure&#39;. That attitude is typical of what is occurring in the building industry today. </para>

          <para>The Government goes along with the proposal that we should have regulations for employers and employees in the industry. The Parliament should not be debating continually whether unions are good or bad. Unions are part of the Australian industrial system, the same as marketing boards are part of the Australian trading scene, and they have to be accepted. The more honourable senators opposite seek to impose restrictions the bigger the fight becomes. As I said in my opening remarks, those unions which do not support the Australian Labor Party are appealing to it for some assistance. An honourable senator of the Liberal Party asked a question about mis matter. The Young Liberals &#169;f South Australia and the Liberal Movement in South Australia, which is possibly the biggest section of the Liberal Party, support co-operation with trade unions. The only sections of the Australian community which do not support this are Liberal Party and Democratic Labor Party politicians who want to make political capital out of it and the exploiters of labour who are operating in Australia today. We have nothing to be afraid of and we have no apologies to make. Destroy the determinations, take away the right to organise the right wing unions and condemn the left wing unions if you want to. We shall give the benefit to everyone. We make no apologies for our attempt to assist those unions which find it difficult to get trade union membership today. </para>

              <para>- I very much regret that apparently the voices supporting the Minister are not prepared to allow him to make a declaration of Government policy on a matter which should be apparent. Therefore unfortunately I must proceed on the basis that the intensions of the Government are not known and that it has no clear mind to grant 4 weeks leave to the Public Service. I must proceed on the basis that the Government was not able to establish its proposition that it shall be only a contingent grant of leave and that it is not prepared to grant 4 weeks leave to the Commonwealth Public Service. If the Minister had given me the assurance that the Government would introduce legislation I was going to allow it to take the necessary steps. But in view of what has happened I must fall back on the assurance we gave the Government and that is that if this motion is determined in the Senate we will not move for 24 hours. The Government will then have 24 hours in which to bring down a Bill to provide 4 weeks leave without qualifications if it chooses to do so. If it does not do that within 24 hours we propose to present our own Bill to provide for 4 weeks leave. The Bill has been drafted and printed. It is in my hands. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> will be handling the motions which are necessary to introduce and present the Bill. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I have the Bill here. We are prepared to go ahead immediately. If the Minister had said: No, we are not prepared to do that,&#39; we would have proceeded immediately but the Minister has not been prepared to say that. Apparently he is asking for time. We have assured him that we will give the Government 24 hours. We abide by that undertaking. I present to the Minister a copy of the Bill which we propo.se to introduce. We hand that Bill to the Government and we ask it to consider introducing it either in this place or in the other place within the next 24 hours. Tomorrow, by which time I think we could say 24 hours have expired, the Labor Party meeting will have had an opportunity to consider this matter. We then propose to use the Standing Orders to introduce the Bill and, because it is important and urgent, to use the form&#39;s of the House to provide for the earliest possible passage of the legislation. I must express my disappointment that, in a matter where Ministers at the table have spoken with such heat and with some definiteness, still the attitude of the Government to this matter has not been disclosed. </para>
          <para>One must query the real attitude of the Government to the provision of 4 weeks leave for the Commonwealth Public Service. I leave the matter at that. I am indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> for enabling- me to intervene before he spoke so that the matter might be clarified at an early stage in the debate. It now rests with the Government. Within 24 hours we expect the Government to either bring in the Bill or indicate that it will not give leave across the board without qualifications. In that event, tomorrow we will introduce a Bill to do pre cisely that. Because of the expectation of the attitude of the Senate I anticipate that that Bill will be passed in this place. It then can go to the other place. There the Government can assess whether it is prepared to reject 4 weeks leave for the Commonwealth Public Service or support our Bill and grant 4 weeks leave in terms of the provisions in the proposed legislation. </para>

              <para>- The word in the Public Service Act is &#39;disapproval&#39;. The honourable senator should not be so fastidious. I intended to observe that it is a matter of credit to the Senate that for some 40 years now it has been conceded that it has a special role in the supervision of subordinate legislation. Usually it takes the form of the disallowance of regulations under the Acts Interpretation Act, but the instrument that is the subject of the motion before the Senate tonight is a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator. The appropriate exercise of the Senate in that case is a disapproval, and that has the same effect as the disallowance of regulations which is to render the Arbitrator&#39;s determination null and void. I do not recall in the long years that I have been in the Senate - and certainly I know of no instance in another place - an occasion on which a Public Service Arbitrator&#39;s determination has been called up for nullification. So today&#39;s proceedings, coupled with those of last week, are a special step in the Senate&#39;s assertion of its authority. </para>

          <para>At the present time it is particularly noteworthy &#34;that within 2 or 3 months of the election of 2nd December the Senate takes the stand that the subordinate legislation that is authorised by the various Acts of this Parliament shall be scrutinised and, according to our judgment, will stand or be cancelled. 1 think the Senate shows itself as a particular custodian of the laws of the Commonwealth against the erosion of parliamentary laws without scrutiny. Regulations under an Act which are passed by a Minister at his desk and which are passed through the Executive Council by 2 Ministers should not escape our scrutiny. Likewise the special provisions of section 22 of the Public Service Arbitration </para>
          <para class="block">Act - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> devoted much time to what was to him the novelty of its pro visions and I wish to advert to the provisions a little later on - have carefully prevented one-man rule in the Public Service by an Arbitrator who presumes to make a determination that is contrary to parliamentary law. Not only is that issue raised here but also the issue is raised as to the proper perspective of preference to unionists, not generally bin in the Public Service. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators on the Government benches are simply bemusing themselves when they say honourable senators on this side of the House would do anything to destroy or render inefficient the cause of trade unionism. Trade unionism has grown during this century into a real contributor to our community life. But the abuses of it are all too evident. I refer not only to the industrial abuses but also to the unfortunate predatory abuses of political parties, and this motion before the Senate tonight highlights that type of abuse. In private employment trade unionism grew against great difficulty and great hostility but in public employment we have the extraordinary picture tonight where a Labor Government in office, the creature in its own self of the trade union movement - the trade union movement is its heart and soul and the mainspring of its life - pits its reputation and pits its credit for impartial and equitable administration because it wants to promote trade unionism, it says, in the Public Service, that is to say, in the employment services of this Government. if the Government has goodwill towards the employees of its own service, one may be excused for querying what altruistic motive drives the Whitlam Government to increase the number of union members in that service. Let us remind ourselves that 50 years ago this Parliament was so solicitous for the fairness of conditions of employment in the Public Service that it passed an Act creating a board of great responsibility, experience and impartiality in the form of the Public Service Board. That Board has grown with a staff - I hope all equal in experience - administering what? It administers the terms and conditions of service in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, classifying its employees according to the criteria laid down by those who draw their salary in this Parliament for formulating the laws. The laws to be found in our own Act set out the criteria for promotion, the qualifying examinations and the principal officers who give certificates as to skill. We thought - God forgive us - that even under a conservative government the Public Service Board would be so mindful of sympathetic treatment of the Public Service that surely there would be no urgent need for rampant unionism against the government of the day in order to establish equitable treatment amongst individual public servants. But no - bless your heart - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> sits there, benign and complacent, representing a government which is so intent upon promoting unionism in the Public Service - a unionism to advocate the cause of the underdog, to see that public servants will get justice against the repressive demands of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> and his colleagues - that we need to have preference for unionism m the Public Service. </para>

              <para>- Yes, I heard johnny.comelately&#39;s statement but if the honourable senator would give me a little time I too could deliver a lecture on the history of trade unionism. But tonight I am just making a few contemporary comments on the asininity of the grounds on which the Government, represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> puts its case that there is need for rampant unionism and preference to unionists in the Public Service as a matter of equity and fair conditions. Of course, we have lived long enough in this place opposing these gentry to know that they are not motivated by altruism on. behalf of the public servants. They are motivated by the idea of promoting political strength. They want a few more members&#39; fees so that in the pool of public service union revenues there will be a greater scum or cream to come off into the political kitty for the next election. Just as the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union could afford a $25,000 cheque to promote the idea that on 2nd December it was time, it is hoped that the public service union wheat fields will be spread wide, that the Labor Party will garner the corn and the public servants will be left with the husks. That indicates the extent of the genuineness of the paranoic plea we heard from the Minister for Works who said that in this proposition the Government was insisting on the freedom of unionists to join a union. It is just that degree of perversion of truth that stalked through Germany in the 1930s, restricting the unionist and compelling him to become a member of a union. Government supporters say: &#39;We are giving you the freedom and all the benefits of Bishop government&#39;. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I suggest that the next thing we want to observe in this connection is the indignation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> the Minister for Works, when he came to his peroration. He said that in addition to claiming freedom for the Public Service he was insisting that the Public Service should have the benefit of an independent arbitrator. He said that for this Parliament to bring back these determinations into the political arena from the hallowed sanctum of the independent arbitrator was actually an evil drift in a reactionary direction. I must take a little time to bemuse myself with the happy coincidence that a government of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlands,</inline> Mt Barnard&#39;s and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron&#39;s ilk comes into office on 2nd December 1972 and by 18th December my independent hackles are up when I come down fairly and squarely in favour of the very idea of the government of the day - preference to unionists. Although it occurs in a few desultory other awards, it had not been the general rule in the Public Service until this stroke of divine elucidation came from the new era - the new crusade led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> - and was imparted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Taylor</inline> and the independent arbitrator came down dead straight on the line of the government mentors of the day. </para>
          <para>Therefore, it was wise, was it not, that the old hacks who had had a little experience when giving to the Public Service the benefit of arbitration wrote into the legislation the supremacy of Parliament and did not depute either to a 2-man government or a one-man arbitration the right to tear up all the legislation that this Parliament has provided from the point of view of terms and conditions of appointment, transfer, promotion, pay and leave in the Public Service? They simply expressed a proposition that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> I thought, needed the whole Department of Works to expound having regard to the ponderousness with which he pursued the matter for 20 minutes. The simple proposition written into section 22 of the Act is this: If an arbitrator makes an award that is contrary to the law of the Commonwealth he shall say so. Then the Prime Minister is in duty bound to put that statement on the table of each House of Parliament. Then with or without the confirmation of the Attorney-General, either House is seized of the authority and the duty which section 22 confers to consider whether the determination by the arbitrator contrary to the law of this country should be disapproved. That is the simple process in which we are engaged tonight. 1 would think that when we recall that the Prime Minister conducted the general election campaign with duplicity, taking into account this arbitration coupled with his electoral speeches, we should highlight the Senate&#39;s performance of a most useful role to ensure not only that unionists in the Public Service receive the benefit of the extra week&#39;s annual leave but also that those public servants who, for their own reasons refuse to join a union, should also receive it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> told members of the Public Service and the country that, if his Party were elected to government, all public servants would receive a fourth week&#39;s annua&#93; leave. I believe that the Senate, exercising its authority to which I adverted, stands in a role for which it can take proper credit by insisting that these determinations shall be cancelled to enable benefits to flow to all public servants from legislation which can be passed through the Parliament. The benefits will then flow, not merely to trade union members of the Public Service, but to all members of the Public Service. That is in accordance with tradition and in line with the Public Service Act and removes a new anomaly which it is almost impossible to imagine creeping into our system except for the fact that it is Government policy, not part of an arbitral determination, that suggests that we innovate in this way - by preference to trade unionists in our Public Service. Therefore. 1 have some pleasure and pride in supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> motion to disapprove the determinations. </para>

            <para>- The word &#39;asininity&#39; was singularly appropriate in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> mouth since he has treated the Senate to a typical performance of braying like a donkey. Whatever else we have learned from this debate we have certainly discovered thai the Opposition knows very little about the industrial laws which it has administered and. in many cases, introduced in the course of the near quarter of a century in which it held office. We have heard emotional language from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> in particular, phrases like &#39;economic blackmail&#39;, &#39;coercion&#39; and &#39;compulsory unionism through the back door&#39;. We even had the quaint experience of hearing that great libertarian <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> invoke the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I must admit that I rubbed my eyes when I heard this from him. However, this was what he offered us as a substitute for rational thought or some sort of genuine legal analysis on the subject we are debating tonight. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> of course, had to remind him that the Government of which he was a member and previous governments of his Party had not always been consistent to his cherished notion that compulsory unionism is a great evil to be fought tooth and nail, in particular in the case of the stevedoring and railway industries where there have been cases of compulsory unionism. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What I should like to point out to the Opposition is that there is nothing new in what the Public Service Arbitrator has done in this case. His determination was made in accordance with legislation that was either on the statute book throughout the period of the Liberal Government or was actually enacted by such governments. Let me look at the sections of the Public Service Arbitration Act under which the Arbitrator made these determinations. I refer, firstly, to section 12, and I invite the Senate to favour me with some attention to what is provided in this section. Section 1 2 (2.) reads as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>An organisation is entitled to submit to the Arbitrator by memorial any claim relating to the conditions of employment of members of the organisation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I ask honourable senators to pay particular attention to the last words of that sentence - of members of the organisation&#39;. In other words it is envisaged that an application by a claimant union to the Arbitrator should be confined to members of that union. In other words, there is jurisdiction in the Arbitrator to do just what is complained of in this case, that is, to give benefits limited to members of the union. True, further sections in the Act, in particular section 14 (e), empower the Arbitrator, if he so wishes, to do this: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To declare by any order that any term of a determination shall, subject to such conditions, exceptions, and limitations as are declared In the order, be a common rule of the Public Service or of any branch or part of the Public Service: </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In other words, the Arbitrator may, if he so decides, make an award or a determination which is not limited to the members of the claimant union. However, this merely under lines the point I am making. The fact that section 14 is there underlines the fact that the Arbitrator has jurisdiction unless this discretion is invoked to give benefits which are specifically limited to members of the claimant union. I would also draw the attention of honourable senators to the Public Service Regulations, and in particular regulation 74b which reads as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Where in any determination under the Arbitration (Public Service) Act 1920-1934- </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is how long it has been there - before 1934- </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. rates of pay or conditions of employment are prescribed in relation to any officer or class of officers, or employees or class of employees, those rates of pay or conditions of employment, or any of those rates or conditions, may be applied to any other officer or class of officers, or employee or class of employees, as the Board determines. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>This fills out the picture. In the first place the policy of the Act is that a claimant union may approach the Public Service Arbitrator for benefits confined to members of that union. </para>

              <para>- Listen and you will learn something. The primary policy of the Act is that the claimant union may make a claim for its members alone. Then comes section 14, then the regulation which complements section 12 by saying that in one case the Arbitrator may extend the benefits to other than union members. In another case the Board itself may extend the benefits of the determination to other than union members. But those provisions merely underline the fact that it was envisaged in the Act itself that benefits could be confined to members of a claimant union alone. Those who are clamouring so loudly against the outrage of what the Arbitrator has done have had the opportunity since 1920 to remove section 12 which, in a slightly different form. was in the Act in 1920 when the Act was introduced. In 1956 a Liberal government amended the Act but put in section 12 (2.) in the words which I have quoted. </para>

              <para>- I do not know, but in any event these people, who are so outraged that an Arbitrator could do this allegedly totally novel thing of conferring benefits only upon a claimant union&#39;s members, have had an opportunity since 1920 to take this section out of the Act. Yet in 1956 they put it back in the Act in a slightly amended form but in a form which preserves this right of the Arbitrator to do this highly discriminatory act. In case it should be thought that this is a power which is never availed of, let me recall a case in my own experience  -  1 think it occurred in 1966  -  when in fact the Public Service Arbitrator specifically limited the benefits of a determination to the members of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, and specifically excluded other people from the benefits of that determination. If these people were genuine, if they were outraged by the possibility that this sort of thing could happen, why did they not take section 12 (2.) out of the Act instead of confirming it in the Act in 1956? </para>

              <para>- Exactly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> in the course of saying many extraordinary, hyperbolic, emotional things, made this extraordinary statement: &#39;Preference to unionists is the same thing basically as compulsory unionism. It is a back door method of introducing compulsory unionism&#39;. I would again remind the honourable senator that preference to unionists has been enshrined in another Commonwealth Act since 1904. I refer to section 47 which, again, owes its present form to an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1956 by a government of the same persuasion as that which sits in opposition today and which contains these words which I shall quote. This is preference to unionists which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> says is the same thing as compulsory unionism. Section 47 reads as follows: </para>

            <para>The Commission&#39; may, by an award or by an order made on the application of an organisation or person bound by an award, direct that preference shall, in relation to such matters, in such manner and subject to such conditions as are specified In the award or order, be given to such organisations or members of organisations as are specified in the award or order. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Subsection (2.) of this section goes even further and states that in some cases the Commission shall&#39; insert a preference clause. That is stronger than &#39;may&#39;; it makes it mandatory in certain conditions for the Commission to put such a clause in an award. In this debate much has turned on whether this is in fact an attempt to introduce compulsory unionism by the back door. </para>

              <para>- I do not know what sort of quibble the honourable senator is taking, but I think that my point stands. I want to come now to this question of whether what we have in the case of the present determinations is in fact preference to unionists or is compulsory unionism. It so happens that we have the word of no less an authority than the High Court of Australia on this very question in a recent case that came before the Court early in 1972. It was in the matter of an application for a writ of prohibition against Holmes, a member of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and the Federated Clerks Union of Australia, ex parte Altona Petro-chemical Co. Ltd and others. In case <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> or the other lawyers in the chamber wish to study the matter - and I commend it to them - let me say that it appears in the March 1972 edition of the &#39;Australian Law Journal&#39;. The court in that case had to examine certain applications for preference in a wide variety of matters. One of the arguments that was put on behalf of the company which was resisting this application was just the point that the Opposition has attempted to make in this debate, that in other words the requests for preference were so wide in their scope and ambit that they really amounted to an attempt to introduce compulsory unionism by the back door.

            <para>It does seem to me that, if, what I do regard as claims for preference, were to be granted, the long term consequence would be that clerical employment in the industry would be restricted to unionists. More and more unionists would be engaged and more and more non-unionists would bc dismissed. Nevertheless, I do not regard this likely consequence as turning what arc prima facie claims for preference into claims for monopoly of employment for unionists. It is necessary to examine what is claimed rather than the long term consequences of the granting of what is claimed in order to determine whether the claims are in relation to an industrial matter. </para>

            <para>- I know that it is troubling <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop.</inline> It is a little difficult for him to follow this, but I ask him to bear with me. I know that he prefers emotional phrases, but I think some people in the Senate would like to know what the truth of the matter is as a matter of law, and what we  aTe  considering here is a matter of law. The High Court, which is the highest tribunal in this land, gave this judgment in regard to claims for preference. Listen to what the claims for preference were. They were in relation to the matter of engagement in any employment covered by the award; in relation to the matters of grading an employee hitherto on the incremental scale under the award; in relation to the matter of determining the times when employees employed under the award should take their annual leave, that is, whether unionists should be able to take their annual leave ahead of non-unionists in the case where there was some sort of conflict as to who should go on leave; and in relation to the matter of retention in employment covered by the award. </para>
          </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In all of these matters the High Court held that to grant preference to unionists over non-unionists did not amount to compulsory unionism but was preference permitted by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act within the jurisdiction of the Commission and unobjectionable constitutionally. Yet we are told by the Opposition that measures which do not compel anybody to join a union but which give preference in leave to unionists amount to compulsory unionism. Honourable senators opposite are in conflict with common sense and with the High Court. </para>

How often have we heard about the Australian Labor Party&#39;s belief in Parliament and how matters should always be carried out by Parliament? Its members have said that any substantive changes in the law ought to be carried out by Parliament and not by regulation - not even by ordinance. An ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory was disallowed on a motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> some months ago because he said it involved a matter of substantive law which should be changed by Parliament and not by subordinate legislation.

              <para>- In the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator and a regulation are indistinguishable. I leave it to the Senate to judge the legal acumen and the accuracy of analysis of members of the Opposition when they are capable of a confusion as blatant as that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> shakes his head sadly because, of course, he has been caught once more in a piece of asininity, if I may borrow his term. The most serious aspects of what the Opposition is trying to do in this case are that it is attempting to do what it has always told this Senate is a particularly outrageous thing - to interfere with the decision of the umpire. How often have we heard purple patches of indignation from men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and the other members of the Opposition whenever unionists went on strike, because they were disputing the umpire&#39;s decision. The decision of a commission, of an arbitration tribunal, up to now has been, according to honourable senators opposite, sacrosanct and beyond challenge. But now, because they think that they can score some cheap little political point, all of those noble principles go out the window. if we are talking about double standards, we see on the Opposition benches the firstrate practitioners of the double standard. I suggest that honourable senators should not be fooled for one moment by the emotional protestations, the high sounding principles to which honourable senators opposite have given voice in the course of this debate, but that they should treat this motion in the way it deserves to be treated - throw it out and allow the determinations of the Public Service Arbitrator to stand. The question of compulsory unionism does not arise in this case at all. It is a familiar exercise of the right of industrial tribunals to grant preference, to unionists. It is a right which has been enshrined in our industrial legislation throughout the period when the present Opposition was in office, and which it did not make any attempt to remove from the statute books. The motion is hypocritical, opportunist and unworthy of the support of the Senate. </para>

            <para>- It is often my lot to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland in debates. It is a disappointment that I have to do so as he almost always makes personal attacks in this chamber which are not very pleasant. I have great respect and regard for any comments made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in this place. I am probably more ready to accept them than I am to accept the statements of many others who consider themselves to be legal experts. The Whip has indicated to me that an honourable senator opposite from Queensland wishes to speak in this debate this evening so I will <inline font-style="italic">ti</inline> brief. We are debating a motion for the disapproval of certain determinations under the Public Ser vice Arbitration Act. As has been pointed out before, the Opposition parties do not deny the right of the Labor Government to implement its election promise that all Commonwealth employees would be granted 4 weeks annual leave. That is the stance that I take. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The general principle announced by the Government, that 4 weeks annual leave should be granted to public servants, gave me great concern. I suppose it was thought to be a very attractive policy which might win a few votes. The Opposition accepts that the present Government can claim that it has a mandate to introduce 4 weeks annual leave for the Commonwealth Public Service. However, I remind honourable senators opposite that this evening&#39;s Sydney newspapers carry details of 1,500 items on the consumer list which are now increasing in price. In that circumstance it would not be proper for the Labor Government to claim that all such increases were created by the former Government. The Labor Party must explain why it has judged it wise to grant 4 weeks annual leave to the Public Service at a cost to the Australian public of about $34m a year. </para>
          <para>If the Victorian Employers Federation is accepted as a body with a right to have a positive opinion on this matter, it should be noted that it has estimated an ongoing cost to private industry of at least $2m a day. That ongoing cost is not to commence in the future; it commenced as from 1st January of this year. It has to be provided immediately because employers are liable for the additional cost at the end of 1973. There is retrospectivity in what the Commonwealth Government has decided. I believe that all Commonwealth public servants taking leave after 1st January last will find that they ire due for 4 weeks annual leave. </para>
          <para>It is a problem of great significance to me because I believe that the moves by the Labor Government will do untold harm to the Australian economy within a year. This debate revolves around the granting of 4 weeks annual leave, supposedly to Commonwealth employees who belong to unions. I believe that most people, including most Government supporters, within their hearts would object to the fact that there is compulsion. Government supporters have argued that it is not really compulsion. They say: &#39;All we are saying is that if you do not join a union you will not get the benefit&#39;. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline>said in support of his demands that many companies in Melbourne would be blackballed if they did not support compulsory unionism. In fact the right of individuals to work would be taken away from them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr -Hawke</inline> would not enable individuals to work and offending companies would be closed down if their employees did not join a union. Honourable senators opposite say that it is not denying a right, that an individual may refuse to take the extra week&#39;s leave if he does not wish to join a union, and that he is completely free. This type of argument will appear in Labor&#39;s policies from now on. There will be compulsion. Benefits will be granted only to individuals who belong to a union and pay their union fees. I am quite certain that these benefits will escalate, as we have seen in many other instances. </para>
          <para>I do not think that the Labor Party generally has attempted to conceal its view. Not one honourable senator opposite has said that he disagrees with the proposition. Whilst my opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tom</inline> Uren, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, has not  i  been great, at least he has been bold enough to challenge the proposition. After it had been announced, his view was reported in the Australian&#39; of 27th February last under the heading &#39;Uren Hits at Forced Trade Unionism&#39;. Undoubtedly he believed that forced trade unionism was involved. I note again that not one honourable senator opposite has declared that he is opposed to what is being done. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Bishop)</inline> indicated that the whole of Labor&#39;s policy must be read in relation to this matter. As he led for the Government in this debate perhaps I should go a little further in considering his statement. I point out to him that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> said that he hoped that within the term of this Government&#39;s life Commonwealth public servants would be granted a 35-hour week. I hope that at some stage <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> will tell us whether a 35-hour week is to be granted only to members of unions. It is a very interesting question in the light of what he has said. </para>
          <para>The main argument in this debate is that whatever happens to be Labor&#39;s policy, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> will say that one must read the Prime Minister&#39;s pre-election policy speech as embracing the whole of the Labor Party&#39;s policy and that whatever is granted by this Government must be read in relation to every facet of it. It is most regrettable that one should have to do that. I doubt that it has ever been done before. However, the real criticism of the Opposition is that the statements that were made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> at no stage took into account that the 4 weeks annual leave would apply only to unionists. At page 26 of his policy speech before the election <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> stated: </para>

          <para>The main aim of the Labor Party in bringing this matter forward, surely, is bribery. I say that is what it is doing. I believe that the unions provide the basis of the funds for the Labor Party&#39;s political campaigns. It wants to force more people to join unions. Perhaps the next  speaker  in this debate can correct me but I am told that union subscriptions include some mandatory payment to the Labor Party. I do not know whether that is right. I want to refer to one or two of the unions associated with the Commonwealth Public Service. One of the largest appears to have about 45,000 members and at present the membership fee is $20.80. It is interesting to consider membership dues in the light of inflation. The increase in the consumer price index in the last 10 years has been of the order of 36.4 per cent but the dues payable to this union have increased by 73.3 per cent. The fee for another union with a substantial membership is $23.40. I mention those figures because I believe that to the average working man $23.40 is a pretty substantial fee. I am most anxious to learn from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> or from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner,</inline> who is the next  speaker  in this debate, what rake-off the Labor Party gets out of that fee. It was on that basis that I used the word bribery. </para>
          <para>There, has been a general escalation of the consumer price index in the last 10 years. H has gone up by 36.4 per cent. I hope that this Government will have something to say to that last union I mentioned because in the last 10 years it has increased its fees by 290 per cent. On going through this list of unions 1 find that one has a fee of $24. I do not doubt that people who wish to join that union feel that they get good service from it. Each one of us joins some association which gives us some benefit but as an Australian 1 believe that there should be. some freedom in Australia. When one uses the word freedom honourable senators on the Government side shut their eyes because they are ashamed of this proposition. 1 think that is a proper thing for them to do. </para>
          <para>Quite a lot of publicity has been given in the Press to the attitude of individuals to this proposition. I would be very pleased to read a number of letters which have appeared in newspapers. I noted a particular letter which referred to compulsory unionism. The writer commenced his letter by stating: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Being a long-time exponent of a change of government, I am highly delighted that the Labor Party has won office. With the injection of young intellectuals as advisers to the new Government, we will, I hope, see a more rational approach . . . However, one may be permitted to raise a questioning voice as to the Labor Party attitude on compulsory unionism. This is a principle with which I have little sympathy, because I feel it is a betrayal of the things for which the early Chartists fought so bitterly. </para>

          <para>Sentaor WEBSTER - I have entered into no arrangements, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne.</inline> The Government is attempting to force individuals to take a certain course. It is attempting to compel them to comply with its demands. It may force them to form a non-union, and what a ridiculous situation that would be. I imagine that all Australians consider the proposition put forward by the Labor Party to be completely abhorrent. Despite what other speakers had indicated, I think that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has to be considered. I feel that it has an application.

            <para>- I believe that the Senate tonight is indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> the Minister for Works, for trying to bring this debate back to its real purpose and that is whether the Public Service Arbitrator has the right to make a decision in relation to members of the Public Service. In effect the Arbitrator said that there shall be 4 weeks annual leave for workers who are in an appropriate union. The Opposition has criticised that decision no end. We have heard tonight that members of the Labor Party are untruthful and are deceitful. In fact some members of the Opposition went so far as to say that we should be bundled out of office because of our alleged deceitfulness. They say that there should be no compulsion, but I point out that the Arbitrator is not compelling anybody to belong to a union. </para>

            <para>No action has been initiated as yet by my department to re-introduce the parma and brushtailed rock wallaby into Australia in conjunction with State fauna authorities. </para>
            <para>I am informed that certain State fauna departments have been examining this situation and that a small number of brushtailed rock wallabies may be introduced into Victoria shortly. I am also advised that any re-introductions of native fauna into Australia will be closely examined by the relevant authorities with the view to possible re-establishment of the species. </para>
            <para>I may add that certain problems arise when such intoductions  are  sought. The possible interbreeding of the New Zealand race with any remaining Australian stock, resulting  in  possible genetic variations  is  one such problem and this  is an  important factor that must be considered by the authorities. </para>

            <para>No. There are obviously limits to the kind of material which can be publicly released in the interests of &#39;open Government&#39;. Communications relating to confidential negotiations between Australia and another Government fall outside those limits and would indeed be a breach of trust. </para>
            <para>The actual terms and conditions agreed to by Australia and China regarding mutual recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations were fully set out in my statement of 22nd December 1972, and in the joint communique released at the same time. It would appear from the honourable senator&#39;s question that he believes there to be some secret agreements between Australia and China not mentioned in the joint, communique. It may be that the honourable senator has formed this belief as a result of recent articles in the &#39;West Australian&#39; and other newspapers Which suggested that the Government was obliged to endorse Chinese positions on a number of international questions as the &#39;price&#39; for the establishment of diplomatic relations. This suggestion is absolutely without foundation. The author of the articles appears to have taken a number of the Government&#39;s recent foreign policy decisions and to have assumed that each of them was the result of concessions given to the Chinese during the negotiations in Paris. There is no basis in fact for this assumption. The negotiations with China were confined narrowly to the question of recognition and diplomatic relations and to related questions associated with the status of Taiwan. Broader questions of foreign policy were not raised by either side. </para>
