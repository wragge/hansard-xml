                    <para class="block">This is the usual <inline font-style="italic">interim</inline> Supply Bill for one month. The amount it appropriates is in excess of that which was asked for last month. It includes not only the ordinary supply for the month, but also one or two large items. One is a sum of ?20,000 for the government of New Guinea. Seeing that that is the total amount required for the year, and that it is wanted now in order to meet payments which have been made by the Queensland Government, it was not con- . sidered desirable to ask for a smaller vote. If, for instance, we were to ask for ?18,000 now, it would necessitate our asking for the balance within a short time. As we hope that the Appropriation Bill will be put through in the course of next month, it is not necessary, we think, to divide the sum. Then there is a sum of ?25,000 required to meet the payments in London for new magazine rifles which have been ordered. Under the head of Defence there are some larger items than" usual. These amounts are required for annual payments, which are due during next month. The Treasurer is endeavouring to clear off all these accounts before the end of the financial year, in order that in future there may be no arrears. </para>

                            <para>- It will be more convenient, perhaps, to take these items in committee, because they are scattered through the schedule. They are to be found under the headings of the different States, and also under the headings of the different arms of the service. For instance, there is a payment for capitation to volunteers. The pay for the militia, I think, is made yearly in some cases and half-yearly in others, but in most cases it is annual. The large payments for the whole of the year will have to be made during next month, and therefore they are included iu this Bill. I do not think that there are any other matters to which it is necessary for me to refer at this stage. In committee I think I shall be able to answer any inquiries which may be made. </para>

                        <para>-The Postmaster-General has pointed out a fact which must have struck us all, that the Bill appropriates an amount very much in excess of that deemed sufficient for the expenditure in previous months. He has recognised that some explanation was necessary. So far as I was able to follow him, he dealt with only a very small portion of the increased amount. The Bill appropriates a sum of £493,944, which represents an annual expenditure of over £6,000,000. Surely we have a right to know before we pass the Bill why this increased amount is necessary. The honorable and learned senator has referred to an item of £20,000 for New Guinea, and an item of £25,000 for payment for rifles in London, and he has mentioned that the Bill provides for some additional expenses in connexion with the defence force, which are really payments for the whole year. But even if we write down the amount we are asked to vote by £50,000 or £60,000, or even £1.00,000, it will be seen at once that it represents an annual expenditure far in excess of that which we have been led to believe is necessary, or which, indeed, the Commonwealth can stand. I gathered from the honorable and learned senator that in committee he will endeavour to explain some of the items, but I, at least, would like, and I feel certain that the Senate would like, to get some definite explanation as to the various items which make up this very excessive increased cost. </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General has pointed out certain matters relating to the expenditure in the Defence department, and I must own that there are some features of the Bill connected with that department which are eminently unsatisfactory. For instance, in division 69, there is an item of £50 for the salary of staff officer of volunteer forces. I beg to inform the Postmaster-General, in the language of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Prig,</inline> that "there's no such a person." I do not know why we should be required to vote this salary. Such an officer did exist once, but he has not existed for a long time. The gentleman who occupied that position is now Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General, and is, I suppose, provided for in that capacity somewhere else. Certainly £50 would not pay him for his services. In the case of each volunteer regiment there is a sum of £500 put down for salaries. I find on inquiry from the: officer representing the finance department here that these sums are not for salaries at all, but to pay for clothing,, rent, and lighting of orderly rooms, furniture, printing, stationery, and a long list of articles which have to be provided out of the capitation grant of £3 per head for every efficient member of the regiments. I do not know who is responsible for this error.. In Sydney they could not possibly have made such a blunder, because such a thing never happened before in connexion with New South Wales Estimates, and I suppose someone has blundered in Melbourne. Whether it is the Military department here, or the Treasury, I do not know, but I think it is rather too bad that such a mistake should be made, and that volunteers who give their services without the smallest remuneration, and at very considerable personal loss should, in one Supply Bill after another, be represented as receiving salaries. Apparently these regiments are pretty expensive toys if the people .are all getting paid in the manner indicated. These sums of £500 go for clothing, and it is outside the law that any part of the amount should be paid to the members of the regiments. I find that for head-quarters defence staff in Sydney there is a sum of £1,000 for salaries and £300 for contingencies. </para>

NEILD.</inline>- I do not know that there is any particular trouble, but still I think that the amounts, as far as possible, should be allocated to the right branch of the service. I shall take the case of one regiment referred to here. The salary of the adjutant is voted for services in New South Wales. He is employed in Melbourne, and the unpaid commanding officer has to do the work for nothing. I am doing the work myself, and I think that 1 have a fairly good knowledge of the subject. Of course, we have to vote these amounts, but I should like to see them submitted in a form in which they would be more capable of being understood. As a man in the. know, as the phrase goes, I own that I cannot make head or tail of the estimates in the manner in which they are made up. I have taken the different Supply Bills and tried to make some sense out of them, but it is absolutely impossible to do so. If a man who is concerned in the working of the Defence force cannot make them out for himself, they must be the most absolute Sanscrit to the majority of persons. We are practically voting these moneys blindfold. There is no earthly need to put the Commonwealth to the expense of printing page after page of such matter. Let the Government put down a lump sum and be done with the thing, because neither the Senate nor the other House can possibly form the faintest idea of what the expenditure is by studying the various Bills as they are presented. </para>

                        <para>- I take this opportunity of ventilating a grievance. Honorable senators will recollect that on various occasions during the last three months the question of the standing orders has been raised, and the Senate has been urged to deal with them because trouble may arise at some time or other between this Chamber and another place in regard to the Tariff. As yet we have done nothing in the matter. Repeatedly, when the Senate was about to adjourn for a week or a fortnight, I have brought up the question, and stated that the time would come when there would be difficulties with the other Chamber, and that it would be well to have some machinery to cope with those difficulties. We have made arrangements with regard to ordinary Bills so that everything would go on swimmingly in connexion with any disagreement; but in connexion with money Bills we have made no arrangement whatever. That is a great misfortune. The nearer we get to the time when a disagreement may arise, the more difficult it will be to arrive at an understanding in regard to our standing orders. I refer honorable senators to the <inline font-style="italic">Arrets</inline> of yesterday, which discusses this question in an article headed " Questions of Procedure : large Issues involved " - </para>

                        <para>The first Supply Bill presented was returned by the Senate to the House of Representatives, when the point in dispute was settled, and the measure went back again to the second Chamber. This is a precedent for one exchange between the two branches of the Legislature, but no more. If this course were followed, all would go well until the Senate had received the schedule a second time, but nobody would know what to do afterwards if the two Houses were still in conflict on particular items. There is, consequently, a proposal on foot to draw up joint standing orders specifying the procedure to be followed where money Bills are concerned. </para>
                        <para>There is, however, said to be a difference of opinion as to whether these should specify that a Bill could be returned from the Senate once, or three times, in the same manner as amendments on ordinary legislation. It is by no means certain either that, whatever the decision, the new joint rules would be accompanied by machinery fora " free conference " in case the two Houses failed to come to terms. If standing orders to this effect were provided, the possibility of a dead-lock would be considerably minimized. </para>
                        <para>It is rumoured that the Speaker of the House of Representatives inclines to the opinion that there should be only one exchange of the requests for changes in the Tariff, but the President of the Senate favours the adoption of the rules in regard to amendments, when messages could pass between the Houses three times before a free conference would become necessary. It is argued that both Chambers would be less inclined to come to some amicable arrangement speedily if they knew that they still had two more chances to hit upon a <inline font-style="italic">modus</inline><inline font-style="italic">virendi</inline> after the first submission of the Senate's suggestions to the House of Representatives. On the other hand, it is contended that the compromises effected in the first two exchanges would lead to peace, with honour, on the third and final message. </para>

                            <para>- I think this is a fitting time to urge upon the Government that they should set apart a portion of the Week for the discussion of our standing orders. I think the Senate would agree to allow honorable senators to give notice of any objections they had to particular portions of them. The draft standing orders have been prepared <inline font-style="italic">hy</inline> a standing orders committee composed of representatives of all parties in the Senate. That committee sat for several months, and I believe the Senate would be quite willing to accept the result of their work temporarily. If that were done, great loss of time might be prevented. Suppose the Senate sends to the other Chamber 100 motions suggesting amendments in the Tariff, and that the other Chamber rejects 50 and accepts 50. When the Bill comes back, ' according to our present machinery, it appears that we shall have either to hack down or to reject the Tariff Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Surely it would be better for the Senate, and for the House of Representatives, for us to come to an early decision, rather than leave the situation in a state of uncertainty? At the present rate we are likely to pass 60 or 70 resolutions requesting amendments in the Tariff. It is better that we should make some arrangements as to procedure than that we should wait till the time comes when we send our resolutions to the other place, and when there may be friction. Certainly there will be greater speed in arriving at a decision between the two </para>

It would be a public calamity if, through the want of standing orders to meet the case, the Senate should reject the whole Bill, whereas a free conference between the two Houses might bring about a compromise. A rejection of the Bill would bring untold loss upon the general community, . and cause the very greatest dissatisfaction. I therefore urge upon the Government that they should set apart a portion of our time for dealing with this question at an early date. </para></speech>

                        <para>- I wish to direct the attention of the Senate to the administration of the Postmaster-General's department in Western Australia, particular!}7 with regard to the action taken in respect to the telephone service. I do not know whether the blame rests with the Postmaster-General or with the Deputy Postmaster-General in Western Australia, but at any rate great irritation has been caused, particularly in the coastal districts of my State, and the revenue of the department is being very seriously injured. The particular matter to which I refer is that of connecting new subscribers with the telephone system. It seems to me that the Postal department has taken up the position that new subscribers cannot be connected, because the revenue derived from the department in Western Australia does not balance the expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- Not altogether. But there are statements in the papers which, to a certain extent, bear out the facts I have stated. There are admissions in the correspondence which prove that a new and efficient instrument was not given to this particular subscriber, and that only on account of his being a medical practitioner was he connected with the telephone system. A statement has been made in the Western Australian press that over 30 applications have been refused, on the ground that no funds will be available until a Loan Bill is passed. I hope that the Postmaster-General will be in a position either to explain whether that is so, or to give us a refutation of the statements made in Western Australia. They have not been contradicted by the Deputy Postmaster-General. Therefore, there seems to be some justification for them. The accounts of the expenditure of the postal department of Western Australia for 1901 show that £45,388 had to be made up out of the consolidated revenue. I believe that in every State, except South Australia, the position is that the Post and Telegraph department does not pay, and it is looked upon as a proper procedure to make up the deficit out of the consolidated revenue. It has not been the practice in the States to wait for a Loan Bill to make up a deficiency. I believe it has also been the practice, where there was a telephone system established, for extensions of connexions between subscribers and the exchange to be made out of the maintenance account ; and in the Estimates we find that there is a sum of £5,500 for the repair and maintenance of telephones and telegraphs, in Western Australia. In our State an attempt seems to have been made to save on this particular item, because in 1901 the sum of <inline font-style="italic">£6,004</inline> was voted for the purpose. In a growing State like Western Australia it is ridiculous to expect to limit this branch of the Post and Telegraph department. It must be expected in a progressive' State that repairs, maintenance, and the expenses of the service will increase rather than decrease ; and it seems to me that whether the Postmaster-General or the  Deputy  Postmaster-General is responsible for this attempt to save money, it is a bad stroke of policy altogether to attempt to save in this direction in a country where the population is growing, and where there is a continual increase in the number of subscribers to the telephone system. More than that, we have to bear in mind the fact that the telephone system, so far as Western Australia is concerned, is the best paying branch of the Post and Telegraph department, and that any starving of that branch hits at the particular portion of the service which pays best. Correspondence on this subject has passed between the Premier of Western Australia and the Postmaster-General, between the Chamber of Commerce and the Premier, between the Chamber of Commerce and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fowler,</inline> M.H.R., and between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Darbyshire</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fowler.</inline> There has also been correspondence between the Postmaster-General and the Deputy Postmaster-General, to which the Postmaster-General has been kind enough to give me access. This correspondence seems to indicate either that the Postmaster-General is laying it down as a rule that extensions of this particular branch of the service should be paid for out of loan money, or that the Deputy Postmaster-General of Western Australia is endeavouring to make the telephone branch of the service unpopular in that State. The Deputy Postmaster-General, in one of his telegrams to the Postmaster-General, points out that extensions of the telephone service in the past have been undertaken out of revenue, and that even when he was deficient in his revenue, and wished to extend the service, he was able to get a grant out of the consolidated revenue. Even when loan moneys were to be spent, but were not available, and certain work was required to be done, he was able to obtain a grant out of the consolidated revenue, and to refund the money afterwards when the loan money was available. If the Postmaster-General is going to continue the policy that existed in Western Australia previous to the transfer of the department to the Commonwealth, why should not the Deputy Postmaster-General still be able to get a grant out of the consolidated revenue to carry out these necessary connexions ? One case the Deputy Postmaster-General mentions, is that in which, at a town called Geraldton, some 200 or 300 miles from Perth, and which is the port for the Murchison gold-fields, a telephone fitter was taken ill. The system got out of order, and the postmaster at Geraldton wired for a telephone fitter to be sent up to take the place of the officer who was sick, so as to put the service in order. But the Deputy Postmaster-General made the statement that there were no funds available for sending up a substitute for the sick man. In the meantime the telephone service at Geraldton was disorganized, and people were put to great inconvenience and loss until the officer recovered from his sickness. There is nothing in the correspondence to show whether later on a man was sent up to take the place of the sick telephone fitter. These facts seem to show that the Deputy Postmaster-General of Western Australia is obliged to rely upon the revenue he is receiving from his department to enable him to carry on its administration. When I have stated that in 1901 a deficit of £45,000 in that department had to be made up out of the consolidated revenue, it will be seen that it is impossible for him to carry on the department from revenue, and he must be given grants out of the consolidated revenue fund. Our experience of the administration of the Deputy Postmaster-General of Western Australia is that it is by no means up to date. He is no doubt putting the best face upon his own case in this correspondence ; but I&gt; am raising the question, in order that the public may know who is to blame - the Deputy Postmaster-General of Western Australia, or the Federal authorities in Melbourne. The Deputy Postmaster- General of Western Australia has made a statement, which has appeared in the press, that, whereas under the State administration he could always get the funds necessary for the extension of the telephonic and telegraphic system, and its proper maintenance, he has now to wait until it suits the people in Melbourne to grant him the necessary supply. The inference to be drawn from that is that the dislocation of the service, and the complaints made by the people interested, are due to the removal of the department from State to Federal administration. I am sure we have no desire to. allow anything to exist which will bring the Federal administration into bad odour with the public. We have enough enemies of federation ul ready, and we can have no desire to create more by our administration. I must say that I consider the answers given to the questions put by me, are totally inadequate, and they do not state the facts of the case. The Postmaster-General will find from the correspondence, that a disused instrument was placed at the disposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Darbyshire,</inline> and on the ground that he was a medical practitioner, exceptional steps were taken to connect him. As to the statement that the telephone system of Western Australia is not to be extended until a loan fund is created, I contend that the extension of the existing telephone system should be carried on out of revenues. In this case, wires are already carried down the street, and all that was asked was that the houses should he connected with those wires. Surely a matter of that kind should not be allowed to stand over until this Parliament has discussed the advisability of entering upon a loan policy and until. a loan fund has been raised ? Though these are matters which I consider should be dealt with out of revenue, if Ministers decide that they should be paid for out of loan, I say, that rather than sacrifice departmental revenue and hamper the development of the States, these telephonic communications should be extended out of revenue, and a refund made out of loan when the loan money is available. I have brought these matters forward in the hope that the Postmaster-General may be able to clear up the questions involved, and may have an opportunity of defending himself against the attacks made upon his department in Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Last evening I called attention to the unsatisfactory position in which the Senate finds itself in regard to financial matters. I pointed out that these Supply Bills are brought forward with votes in the lump, which we are asked to agree to upon very short notice, and without proper information. The Postmaster-General mentioned that the whole of the necessary information has been at the disposal of members of the Senate for many months, in the Estimates. I questioned the statement, because I had no recollection of the Estimates ever having been laid upon the table of the Senate. I find I was quite correct. They never have been laid upon the table of the Senate, though they were circulated to honorable senators with papers printed and circulated in another place. Inasmuch as they have never been laid upon the table in the Senate honorable senators have not been able to deal, with them. </para>

                            <para>- The difference is that if they had been laid on the table of the Senate we could deal, with them. In this Supply Bill I find a total amount of £107,400 put down for contingencies without a single word of explanation. Honorable senators accustomed to consider Estimates might, upon hunting through them, be able to find out the particulars, but it would be an endless job, and I think it is due to the Senate that more information should be given. With regard to the mode of dealing with the Estimates, I should like again to call attention to the utter violation of all common sense and practical finance displayed by the way in which public expenditure is being managed. It is supposed that another place has the power of the purse, but what happened ? The Estimates were brought forward by the Treasurer who made his financial statement. , Naturally any one would suppose that when the financial statement was placed before honorable members, they would there and then proceed to examine them to discover whether the expenditure proposed was wise, and, if necessary, to make amendments. But nothing of the kind happened. Those Estimates, and all pertaining to them, have been laid aside for months. </para>

                            <para>- It may do so, but it gives Ministers plenty of time to spend money without any check. The Estimates were laid aside, and Supply Bills have been brought forward with schedules of lump items, and passed in a few minutes. They are sent on to the Senate, and passed here practically without any discussion. A few days before the end of the session, the Estimates will be taken in hand and rushed through, and if some young member in another place thinks to distinguish himself by calling attention to some special item, he will be coolly told "There is no use in your protesting, because the money has been spent." That is what is called exercising judicious control over public expenditure, and another place having the power of the purse. A greater farce cannot be conceived. The present Treasurer did, in connexion with the first Budget he delivered in the State Parliament of Victoria, endeavour to carry out a proper practice, and as soon as he had submitted his Estimates, the Legislative Assembly commenced discussing them department by department. But that practice did not suit the Treasurer or Ministers, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner vowed that he would never do it again, and he has never done it again. He has returned to the old objectionable plan of bringing in Supply Bills, and rushing the Estimates through at the end of the session. We have in the Commonwealth only a few public departments, and in starting our system of finance there should be some means devised to provide an absolute and proper control over expenditure, not by one House only, but by both Houses, because we are in a different position to that occupied by the second Chambers in the State Parliaments. It is due to the public that the Senate should endeavour to exercise a proper supervision over expenditure, and I think it might be well to appoint a committee to consider how this very desirable power of control could be best secured. Of course, I have not the slightest intention of objecting to the passing of this Supply Bill, but I do think it is due to honorable senators that we should have longer notice of these Bills. There are peculiar circumstances connected with this Bill, I admit. In consequence of an adjournment of another place for three weeks, it had to be brought on here as quickly as possible ; but that has not been the case with previous Supply Bills I do not see why we should not adopt the rule that we should have a, certain stated notice of Supply Bills. Honorable senators are probably aware that the House of Lords will -not deal with Bills which come up to them after a certain date. I think the public would be benefited by the Senate having, say, a week's notice of Supply Bills, in order that we might have an opportunity of comparing them -with the Estimates. </para>

I specially drew attention to the matter of contingencies, and the various headings or divisions into which expenditure was classified in the various States, showing that no uniform method was adopted. The honorable and learned senator at that time promised that the matter would be looked into and rectified in the future, but I am not aware that any alteration has been made. </para>

                            <para>- We have had Supply Bills since, and matters should be made reasonably clear in them. At page 19 of the schedule honorable senators will see contingencies for New South Wales stated at £7,000, Victoria £8,000. Queensland £S00, South Australia. £3,700, Western Australia £7,000 and Tasmania <inline font-style="italic">nil.</inline> The contingencies run from nothing up to 33 per cent, of the total amount. In the case of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland we have the total expenditure given under four headings, and in two of the States under only two headings. With regard to contingencies, the greatest absurdity in connexion with them is shown in division 1 1, where we have a total of £1*811 divided thus - "Salaries, £11 : contingencies, £1,800." No junior clerk in a mercantile establishment would make out a statement in. so ridiculous a manner as that. When attention has been called to the misleading character of these figures, and when some amendment has been promised, surely honorable senators ought not to have to ask a second time that these simple alterations, which are required for any common-sense understanding of these Estimates, should be made. There is another matter to which I desire to draw attention. At page 5 of the schedule in the Department of Home Affairs we have one lump sum put clown of £15,000 under the heading "Rent, repairs, maintenance, fittings, and furniture." Then another " Electric lighting and telephonic communication, £3,300." I notice that in most of the other departments the expenditure of the different States is separated, but here there is no division made. Those who know anything about the autocratic way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne is wont to conduct his affairs when allowed will not wonder at this arrangement. I point out that under the system which is adopted in his department we have no opportunity of discovering the States in which the expenditure is occurring. This is an objectionable method, and we should have some statement which will show the States in which expenditure is taking place. We ought not to be asked to vote these lump suras in this indiscriminate and uncertain way. If no alteration is made in the future in the way in which supply Bills are brought before us the Senate will have to take the bit between its teeth, and be more firm in the matter than it has been in the past. </para>

                        <para>- I, as well as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> have some complaints to make about the manner ill which questions are answered in the Senate. On the 11th April we had a debate on the Coronation vote, when an amount o£ £5,500 was voted by Parliament for the purpose of illuminations. I should have opposed that vote had it not been for a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> The honorable and learned senator volunteered the information that, taking about £900 as the expenditure in each capital, it had been estimated that the illuminations would cost so much. I then put the question to him whether he intended that there should be an expenditure of £900 in each State, because I thought he had made a slip, and he said - "Yes; irrespective of population." I should have opposed the vote if the intention had been to distribute the amount on a population basis, because on that basis Western Australia and Tasmania would receive so very little that it would practically be useless to make them any grant for the purpose. Understanding that the matter was going to be dealt with in a way which would secure to all the States a certain amount of flare-up and g&gt;is, I raised no objection. Subsequently, however, statements appeared in all the Melbourne papers that the amount was to be distributed in a certain way, and that Melbourne and Sydney would receive the major portion of the vote. Following upon that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> on the 21st May, put a question to the Vice-President of the Executive Council as to whether any allocation of the vote had been made. The reply was that no allocation had then been made, though the newspapers had made a statement to the contrary. I was obliged to accept the reply as being accurate, and desiring that the position should be brought before the Minister for Home Affairs, and that he should have no opportunity of evading the distinct pledge made by his honorable colleague in the Senate, I put the following questions to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> on the 23rd May : - </para>

                    <para class="block">The only reply I received was that no allocation had been made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> did not attempt to answer my questions, and parliamentary procedure gave me no opportunity of remonstrating with him on his want of courtesy. That is the complaint I wish to bring before the Senate. When an honorable senator puts a question to a Minister, he is entitled to get a definite answer. My experience is that he rarely gets a definite answer. Some Jesuitical phrase or expression is used which leaves the matter absolutely in abeyance. One knows no more than he did when he put the question. That procedure is treating the Senate with absolute contempt. I appeal to the Postmaster-General to give the Senate some definite information as to the position of that vote. It was passed on a distinct pledge given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> and we now understand that the pledge has been departed from by another Minister. I propose in committee to nsk <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> for some information a.s to the method by which the orders for the rifles were placed in London, and also as to the mode of distribution which the Government propose to adopt. I was assured when I was in Western Australia, that there are no rifles there fit for use. I trust that that State will receive its fair proportion of these 5,000 rifles, and that they will not be kept entirely for Victoria and New South Wales. It seems to me that £5 is an exorbitant price to pay for a rifle. The most important question I desire to raise relates to a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that when Parliament is not sitting, it is competent for a Minister to remove the headquarters of his department to the State in which he lives. That is an expression of opinion to which I take direct exception. Melbourne is at the present moment the seat of government, and I contend that the head of each department is required by the Constitution to conduct its business in Melbourne, and nowhere else. In committee, I propose to submit a motion in order to get a direct vote on the question. There is another point to which I wish to draw attention, but as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> is not here, I shall wait until we get into committee. </para>

                        <para>- The vote for a supply of rifles is a step in the right direction. For a long time we have realized that our defence forces are not armed with modern weapons. Whether on the eastern, the western, or the southern coast, the nien who are called upon to defend the country should be armed with the latest and best implements of warfare. I feel confident that no honorable senators will ever object to such a sensible course as that being adopted. The purchase of 5,000 rifles at the present time can only be regarded as the initiation of a scheme which intends, ultimately, and at an early date, too, to have all our men aimed with up-to-date weapons. Of course the allocation of the first supply must be left practically in the hands of the Commandant, who no doubt will, make the best possible use of them in the interests of Australia as a whole. I wish to ascertain under what power the regulations were recently made for the retirement of officers serving in the permanent branches of the defence force. I doubt very much whether, under the New South Wales Act, there is power to pass such a regulation. I am aware that in the Defence Bill, which was submitted to Parliament some time ago, provision was made for the retirement of officers at certain periods. While it may be very necessary and desirable to have such regulations made, at the same time we ought to be perfectly clear as to the lines on which we are going, and to remember that the conditions 0 service of colonial and Imperial officers are not the same. In the Imperial service, at certain ages, men are compelled to retire, to make room for younger men, but provision is made for retiring allowances or pensions. The ages of retirement are dependent on the rank a man holds. As he is promoted, so is raised the age at which he may be called upon to retire. Under our existing regulations, men are being called upon to retire who are still in the vigour of life, and quite capable of continuing to discharge their duties. A civil officer is not called upon to retire at so earl)' an age as is a military officer. He has the right to retire at 60 ; he ma)' be called on to retire at any time between 60 and 65, but his retirement at 65 is compulsory unless he is specially requested to remain. Under the existing regulations, military men who have reached the ages of 50, 55, 58, and so on, are being called on to retire when there is any amount of good work in them, and the question at once arises - what are we to do with those men who have efficiently served the public year after year? I presume that the </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Government naturally would endeavour to make provision to enable these men to take some other positions in the public service which they would be qualified to fill, but there is always this difficulty - that the clerical branch of the public service seem to regard the highest positions in that branch as positions to which they alone have the right to aspire. They do not like to see men coming from the military branch of the public service, and taking these positions over their heads. This question should be very carefully thought out, in order to see that no injustice is done to any member of the community. In whatever branch a man is serving, he is a servant of the Commonwealth ; and when he is doing his work efficiently, it is a mistake that he should be called upon to retire at an age while there is still plenty of work for him to do. Assuming that there is the fullest power under the State Acts to make these regulations for retirement, I think that some fair provision ought to be made, so that persons who have served the Commonwealth for very many years shall not be thrown out in the cold at last. No provision has been made for pensions or retiring allowances, and whatever may be said to the contrary, the salaries have never been very extravagant, and, no doubt, they have been absorbed by the men during the period of their service. My appeal is made on behalf of not only the commissioned officers, but also the warrant and non commissioned officers. </para>

                            <para>- In an important return which has been laid before the other House, it is stated that, in the department of Homo Affairs, one or two officers have been appointed who have, not been in a State service, that 450 extra persons have been appointed in a similar way in the Post and Telegraph departments, and that the bulk of them are operators and messengers. I desire to know whether the business of the department has increased during the last twelve months to such an extent as to justify the appointment of this seemingly large number of officers ; and if it has, what steps were taken by the Minister to ascertain whether any of the States had officials whom they desired to get rid of, or who might have to be retrenched, and whether any of these 450 posts were offered to State officers. There is a kind of unwritten rule that no appointment should be made to the Commonwealth service until it is seen that there is no State officer who is fitted to take the place, and whose services can be dispensed with by the State. Reform, retrenchment, and economy must be carried out to a reasonable extent, and never be lost sight of. But it is impossible to talk about reduction and retrenchment - and we know that Queensland and one or two other States will have to retire faithful officers - if at the same moment the Commonwealth is employing men by the score and the hundred without ever asking the States if they can supply the necessary officers. I noticed lately that 160 or180 men had been discharged from the railway service of Victoria. Although most of those men may not be fit to be operators, some of them may be eminently fitted to be messengers. It strikes me that all these men who had. been for any time in a State service ought to have been offered these positions before they were given to outsiders. If the Postmaster-General can show that 400 men have left the service of the department or have died, and that slightly over 400 men have been taken on, accounting for a moderate increase, that is all very well. But the report in the press rather startled me, and I think we shall all be glad to hear some explanation from the honorable and learned gentleman. With reference to the keeping of the Commonwealth accounts and the way they are presented in Supply Bills, I desire to confirm every word <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> has said, but I think that, to some extent, the reason for it lies in the peculiar circumstances of the case. It must stand to reason that when week after week new departments have been formed, notably the Public Works department, and the Public Service Commissioner's department, and when week after week fresh officers are found, any estimate framed some months ago will give no correct account of the position as it exists to-day. I quite agree with my honorable friend that from a perusal of this Supply Bill it is quite impossible to get any grip of how much our expenditure is or what it is going to be. I hope that in future the practice which has obtained in the States will be adopted - that the Estimates for the year will be presented when the Budget speech is delivered, and that shortly afterwards we shall have an opportunity of considering them. And if it becomes necessary to ask for supply for three months, six months, or even one month, we can easily ascertain what each department is costing and where the money is going. </para>

It is improper that in a Supply Bill which is appropriating £493,944 for the services of one month, a sum of £107,000 should be distributed under the heading of " contingencies." After twelve or fourteen months' administration it is not treating the Senate with fair respect to deal with so large an amount in that way. We talk much about economy, and I must raise my voice against the increasing expenditure of the Federal Government. </para>

                        <para>- They cost £1,750. In addition, there are three permanent messengers for the Senate at about £800, and there are also what are called sessional messengers. We have to pay £2,500 for doorkeepers and messengers. I only mention that by way of illustration, thinking that as we have been talking a good deal of economy we should begin at home. I hope that some details will be given to us with regard to contingencies. I am not satisfied that almost one-fourth of the expenditure should be put under that heading </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DRAKE</inline>(Queensland - Postmaster-General). - <inline font-style="italic">(In reply).</inline> I have rather a long string of criticisms to answer. In regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> remarks, I have totted up some amounts for ammunition, and for annual or half-yearly pay ; that is to say, representing votes not covering one month, but a number of months. They amount to nearly £90,000. In addition to that, there is the vote for the defence of Thursday Island and King George's Sound, and there is a large amount covering a considerable variety of expenditure. For instance, the electric lighting of Parliament House costs £900. That means eleven months of lighting. The money is clue, and has to be paid. These are the reasons why this Supply Bill is larger than the previous Supply Bills have been. In reference to the observations of my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> I would point out that we are adopting the form of Estimates which came to us from New South "Wales. If the honorable senator will look up the Estimates for the year, which have been laid upon the table, he will see that the particular payments referred to are put under the heading of salary. It may not be accurate, and perhaps it would be well in future to alter the practice ; but apparently this has been the practice in that State in the past, and it has- been carefully continued upon these Estimates. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- That would be too severe altogether. Just at this period of the history of the Commonwealth, we must expect things to be somewhat lacking in uniformity, but we hope in the future to get matters straightened out, and to secure uniformity. ' With regard to the officers appointed to the general staff, the honorable senator is aware that from the date of their appointments their salaries and other expenditure in connexion with them will be charged to the whole Commonwealth on a population basis. What I want to make clear is that the actual expenditure is "other" expenditure from the time of appointment, and will not be debited to the State, but the amounts will be contributed equally by the whole of the States upon a population basis. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has asked me a question about the temporary standing: orders. He thinks that the Senate would be willing to adopt the standing orders recommended by the Standing Orders Committee, so that they might be temporarily used. If that be so, the mind of the Senate on the subject has changed. I do not know whether the honorable senator is right as to the general feeling of the Senate, but at any rate some months ago I tabled a motion and moved it, for the temporary adoption of the standing orders, but I was informed by several honorable senators who appeared to me to have a considerable amount of influence, that it would be impossible to carry that motion, except after a very long discussion - that is to say, that the standing orders would not be accepted even temporarily without a discussion which might perhaps last for many days. I am not satisfied that the Government would be justified in asking the Senate at the present time, to lay aside the Tiu-ifF in order to discuss the standing orders; Indeed, if we were to make such a proposition I feel sure that it would not be agreed to. </para>

                            <para>- There may be, and that is a matter which will probably have to be discussed at some period - perhaps when the occasion arises. But it appears to me that there will be no saving in discussing it beforehand, because we might have a large amount of time taken up in debating some course of action to meet events that after all would not arise. Under the circumstances, seeing that time is very valuable, and that it is desirable in the interests of the Commonwealth that we should proceed with the Tariff as soon as possible, it is wise for us to push on with that work. I hope there will be no necessity for any special machinery. If there is, I trust that when the occasion arises we shall be able -to deal with it satisfactorily. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has raised a question in connexion, with the administration of the Post and Telegraph department in. Western Australia, especially in. regard to telephones. I can assure the honorable senator and the Senate generally, that I am not desirous of blocking business in regard to the Post and Telegraph, department, or of preventing new subscribers being connected with the telephone exchange. It is one of my troubles that difficulties have arisen, and I have been trying my utmost, the whole time I have occupied my position, to make arrangements so that there shall be no delay whatever. From the papers to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred, and from which he got his information, it will be seen that so long ago as November 9, 1901, the telegram which I will read was sent by the Secretary of the department to the Deputy Postmaster-General, Perth. What I want to show is that we have made every effort to cope with the difficulties that have arisen in consequence of the absence of available loan funds. The telephone work in Western Australia, as well as in most of the States, has previously been carried on out of loan money and we propose to follow that practice. But, as honorable senators know, up to the. present time no Loan Bill has been passed. Consequently there is no loan money available. We have under the circumstances, so far as we could, used ordinary revenue for the purpose, with the intention of recouping the revenue from loans when loan money is available. </para>

                            <para>- We cannot do that. We might have been able to do it under the State Government ; but at the present time every effort has been made in that way to the full extent, and the funds available for carrying on the work have been exhausted. Of course, if we had a larger vote, we should go on drawing on that revenue, with a view of making it up afterwards from loan money, but in consequence of the extraordinary circumstances of this session, we have been carrying on in the manner I have described for fourteen months, and we have had no loan money available. There is one other matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> referred to, and that is with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Darbyshire's</inline> telephone. The connexion in that case was made quickly, because <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Darbyshire</inline> was a medical man. But I am afraid that the honorable senator attributed a wrong meaning to the telegram of the Deputy Postmaster - General where he speaks of a " dead wire, " and a " discarded telephone." A"dead wire "does not mean a wire that is no good. What is professionally meant by a " dead wire " in the department, is a wire to which no telephone is attached. If a wire is taken to a building, and a telephone is attached to it, and then perhaps next week the owner gives up the telephone, the telephone is cut off and the wire to the building is called a " dead wire " until it is again connected with an instrument. Although I am not acquainted with the term " discarded telephone," and have not met with it before, I think that what is meant is a telephone which has been discarded by a subscriber who has declined to go on paying his rent and who is cut off. But a "discarded telephone " is not an out-of-date telephone. </para>

                            <para>- These terms have been adop'ted iri the professional branch of the service, and were, of course never intended for the public. They may seem misleading to a non-professional man, but I think it will be found on inquiry that what I have stated is their meaning. I know that what I have described is the meaning of the term " dead wire " and I believe that a "discarded telephone" simply means a telephone that is given up by a subscriber. As to the Geraldton matter, I think there must be some misunderstanding. I should hope that the Deputy-Postmaster-General did not send such a telegram as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has mentioned. Unless I saw it I could hardly believe such a thing, because there cannot be any possible excuse for neglecting to send a fitter to take the place of a sick officer, unless, of course, it was necessary for some fresh officer to be appointed, which I think is unlikely. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> has raised a question about the method in which Supply Bills are framed and brought up. The original Estimates for the year, laid upon the table of the House of Representatives in October last, were also laid upon the table of the Senate, and ordered to be printed. I mention that to show that the principle has been accepted that the Estimates shall be laid upon the table of the Senate, so that they may be officially before honorable senators, who can make use of them. I understand that the revised Estimates, laid upon the table of the House of Representatives in April last, were not laid upon the table of the Senate. I regret that. It was an oversight. When a Supply Bill is brought up, the Treasurer having made his statement, and laid his Estimates upon the table, every member of both Houses has an opportunity to criticise any proposed expenditure with regard to any item. </para>

                            <para>- Then I will tell the honorable senator, so far as I can, how matters stand. I am sure that the vote will not be distributed on an)' hard and fast lines, such as the honorable senator describes, and as he understood from' the answer of my colleague, the "VicePresident of the Executive Council. An expression of opinion like that in debate should not, I think, be looked upon as a pledge. It would not be reasonable to divide a sum voted for such a- . purpose in that way. I should say that the clear principle upon which the allocation of such a vote would be determined' would be to carry out in the best manner possible the illumination of the federal buildings in each of the capitals, and the allocation must depend, therefore, in a great measure, upon the character of the buildings. It would be quite unreasonable in a State in which there might be few and small federal buildings to spend the same amount of money in their illumination as would be spent in the illumination of very large buildings in another State. If the nature of the buildings to be illuminated is considered in the allocation of the vote, I think the result will not be found to be very different from its allocation on a population basis. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> asked me something about the retirement of officers. I believe there is a power in the Defence Acts of each of the States to make a regulation such as that which has been made. I quite agree with every word which the honorable and learned senator has said as to the desirability in cases of that kind of making some allowance, and that is a matter which is under the consideration of the Government. It is certainly very hard upon men whose profession and living it is, that they should lose their positions in this way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> referred to a return showing that 450 officers had been appointed to the Commonwealth service who had not previously been in any State service. I have not seen that return yet. But it appears to me that there cannot be anything very extraordinary about it, if it includes operatives and messengers in the Post and Telegraph department, which comprises so large a proportion of the transferred servants. So far as operatives are concerned, I may say that in nearly all the States they are so scarce that the department is always searching for expert operators, and we take them from anywhere, if they are sufficiently capable and are able to pass the examinations. I do not know how many we have been able to get during the past twelve months, but it is probably a very small number, and most of the officers referred to in the return must be messenger boys, who are simply the raw material, and have not been in any State or other service before, because they have probably only just left school. I have here figures and estimates from which it will be seen that the increase in the number of officers provided for on the Estimates of the departments cannot be considered excessive, considering that the service is one which is continually growing. In New South "Wales I find that on the previous year's Estimates 5,349 officers were provided for, and we are asking now for provision for 5,436. The figures for Victoria are 2,461 and 2,594, for Queensland 1,067 and 1,132, for South Australia 1,623 and 1,654, for Western Australia 1,304 and 1,399, and for Tasmania 609 and 690. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Macfarlane</inline> referred to the doorkeepers, but that is not, I think, a burning question, and the honorable senator will not delay the passage of the Bill on that account. </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General promised on the second reading of the Bill to refer to certain matters, more particularly in committee. Comparing this Supply Bill with the previous one I find that the amount set down for contingencies in division 1 of the vote for the Parliament has gone up from £100 to £172. In division 4 it has gone up from nothing to £180, and the same thing occurs in divisions 5, 6, and 7, where there are votes for contingencies which did not appear in previous Supply Bills. The same thing is shown also in division 9, and there the vote for contingencies has gone up to £384, while the amount previously appearing was £35. I have no doubt that some explanation of these matters can be given, but the committee is entitled to that explanation. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps I can give the explanation. The contingencies that are put on these Supplemental Estimates are for the amounts due, and not necessarily for the amount spent in the particular month. For instance, if we take the item for electricity and electric lighting, the vote is really for eleven months, and, as a matter of fact, we have not paid anything during this year, or since we took possession of these buildings, for electric lighting. Take the last item referred to as an illustration - an amount for £384set down for contingencies, under the heading of "miscellaneous." That includes gas, fuel, and a great many other items, and £384 is the amount which is now due in respect of those items, not necessarily for this month, last month, or the month before, because during some months nothing whatever has been paid in respect of them. So far as salaries are concerned we can divide by twelve and get at the amount, but sofar as contingencies are concerned it is a false assumption to suppose that the amount set down under that heading is for the particular month. It may be for several months, and some particular item may come in for some month which will not occur again. For instance, honorable senators asked for some accommodation in their club-room. That accommodation will be provided and paid for, and the amount comes out of contingencies, but, though it will not occur again this year, and perhaps not at all, it will appear in the vote for some particular month. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to bring a rather serious question before the committee. I find that amongst contingencies there is, in division 1, an item of £250 for office cleaners. I find different sums for lighting, fuel, and maintaining the gardens. I desire to bring before the committee the fact that certain Ministers of the Crown have for the last twelve months been enjoying something in the shape of an honorarium, beyond the sum stipulated as due to their offices. They have been, in my view, very seriously trenching upon sub-section 3 of section 45 of the Constitution, which specifies reasons for which members of either Chamber may be called upon to forfeit their seats. It is well known that certain Ministers have allotted themselves living accommodation in the Parliament buildings, where they are entirely free of hotel expenditure. Though the Governor-General is required to pay for light, fuel, and gardening, we find Ministers of the Crown living here with free light, fuel, and gardening, and apparently, also with free attendance, and entirely outside the emoluments provided for them by the Constitution. I will not quote the old phrase about " what is sauce," &amp;c, but if it is proper to charge the Governor-General for light, fuel, cleaning, and gardening, it is a proper charge to be made against these Ministers. It is rather a serious affair that certain Ministers of the Crown should be taking the right of providing themselves with free lodgings, in contravention of the Constitution Act ; because, if they can occupy a portion of these buildings, or any other buildings' in the charge or ownership of the Commonwealth, they may, on the same principle, occupy three-fourths or the whole of those buildings. Who cleans the rooms occupied by Ministers, and who maintains the garden which they have the right to use <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I think we should know something about these matters before we vote large sums for contingencies involving benefits to certain members of the Cabinet. Sub-section 3 of section 45 of the Constitution is very plain, and it provides that a member of either House of the Federal Parliament may lose his seat if he "directly or indirectly takes or agrees to take any fee or honorarium for services, rendered to the Commonwealth, or for- services 37 i 2 rendered in the Parliament to any person orState." There is no interpretation clause to tell us what an honorarium is, but it is usually assumed to be a monetary consideration. I submit, however, that it may be in kind as well as in money, and if it is possible to occupy a part of these buildings, it is equally possible to occupy the whole. </para>

                            <para>.- That is a convenience which all members may share alike. What I am submitting now is an entirely different thing, because it is for the separate benefit of certain persons. I point out that at the present time the Commonwealth Government occupy only a limited number of buildings for administrative purposes, but in the maintaining of buildings or the erection of others, if this plan is to be applied, why should not buildings with sufficient capacity be obtained either by lease or by construction to afford free quarters for every Minister to live in <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The matter may be regarded as of no importance at the present time, but it <inline font-style="italic">may</inline> become of very serious importance in putting the Commonwealth to the expense of premises, nominally for purposes of administration, but actually for purposes of ministerial residence. I point out that two or three members of the Cabinet obtain an actual monetary advantage in the shape of free quarters, light, fuel, and cleaning, which other members of the Legislature do not possess. </para>

                            <para>- The work which this Minister performs for the Commonwealth makes a very great demand on his finances. The remuneration he receives as a member of Parliament, does not in any way compensate him for his services as a Minister. It is a paltry thing to bring up a question of this kind in the Senate, and give the public a very wrong impression. The impression which is created by such speeches is that the members of this Parliament are really living on the taxpayers of the country, whereas such is not the case. The speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> would lead the public to believe that some members of the Ministry are receiving something which they should not receive at the hands of the taxpayers. I do not think that the people of Victoria, to whom this building belongs, would begrudge those Ministers the accommodation which some of these rooms afford. In the building there are many rooms which are absolutely empty, and which might very well be used. It strikes me that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> were a member of the Ministry he would not be loath to occupy a room in the building. I suppose it costs more to take his luggage to the station than it does to keep up the room which is occupied by a Minister. </para>

                        <para>- I understood that the question which is being discussed was definitely settled by an agreement between the Federal Government and the Victorian Government. I take it that, subject to the terms of that agreement being properly complied with, there should be no grievance of this kind to be ventilated here. I am told that considerable friction is on the point of being created between the Federal Parliament and the State Parliament with regard to certain apartments in which most important State documents have been kept. If I am rightly informed, an attempt is being made by the Ministry to interfere with some apartments which were reserved for the use of the State Parliament, in such a way as to create considerable annoyance. The old documents have lately been removed without the consent or the knowledge of the State Parliament and placed in other rooms in order that the reserved rooms might be occupied by somebody or other whom I do not know. My remarks are equally applicable whoever the person is. </para>

That reminds me of the story of the boy who was given a sovereign to spend on the condition that he kept an account of the items, and whose bill was made up thus - "Tramfares 6d., extras 19s. 6d." When the Government ask the committee to vote £11 as a fixed charge for salaries, and £1,800 for contingencies, which have risen from £50, they should offer an explanation. </para>

It is required to pay, amongst other things, a large account for printing and stationery on account of the Governor-General. Both these large amounts are accounted for, to a very great extent, by the payments which have to be made to the Government Printer of Victoria this month. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania). - I desire to obtain some information about the item of £20,000 for the administration of New Guinea. In his second-reading speech the Postmaster-General said that payments had been made by Queensland on behalf of New Guinea. In November last the chief reason adduced for our biking over the administration of this possession was the stress and urgency of financial matters. We were told that its administration was then in a most parlous condition, and that a bank had gone so far as to refuse a very small overdraft. It is strange that so many months have been allowed to elapse before asking Parliament to vote a single penny. I wish to know if the Queensland Government has been willingly or compulsorily financing the Commonwealth Government in respect of this fairly large item. </para>

                            <para>- Up to a short period before November last the Queensland Government had been administering the affairs of New Guinea and paying all the expenditure. Under an agreement between Queensland and Victoria and New South Wales the expenditure was borne in equal proportions. That arrangement only continued up to the 30th June, 1901, and since that time Queensland has been financing New Guinea under protest. An arrangement was made that if the Commonwealth took over the possession as a territory it would make good to Queensland all the expenditure it had incurred from the 1st July, 1901. Since that time the Queensland Government has continued to honour the drafts of New Guinea. </para>

It was hardly worth while asking for £18,000 on account of the £20,000. The bulk of the money will be required to meet the expenditure already incurred by the Queensland Government. </para>

                        <para>- The explanation of the Postmaster-General on this point seems to raise another matter. It indicates that the statements which have appeared in the press as to the rather shabby treatment of Queensland, are to some extent justified. If the Commonwealth has allowed Queensland to go on financing New Guinea until eleven months have passed, without making any payments, and only pays when pressed by the Queensland Government to do so, it indicates a lack of justice ; and Queensland has some show of right in complaining, as she has done on several occasions, of the slowness of the payments made by the Federal Government. I hope there are no other items in a similar position, and that there is no other ground of complaint on the part of Queensland, or the other States. </para>

I have not the details of expenditure. I believe that the Acting Prime Minister has a statement made out showing what the estimates are for the next year, but I have not the particulars available at the moment. The expenditure is, however, on the same lines as for some time past, the principal items being the expenses of the resident magistrate, and of the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Merrie England</inline> which plies between Queensland and New Guinea. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS</inline>(Queensland). - I should like to hear from the Postmaster-General something about the expenditure of the money in connexion with the New Hebrides. I saw some time ago that the Government were subsidizing Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. for the purpose of bringing about increased trade between Australia and the islands. If the Government wish to encourage land settlement we have several millions of acres in Queensland which we should like to see taken up by farmers. It is a very wrongful expenditure of public money to subsidize Burns, Philp, and Co. in order to bring about settlement in the New Hebrides. This policy takes people from Australia, where we shall have plenty of room for centuries to come, in order that Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co. may increase their trade with the islands. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is time that Australia commenced to feel satisfied with the immense territory she already has, without attempting to acquire islands which can be nothing but an expense to us for centuries to come. The French have been unable to settle the New Hebrides. A company has been granting land to settlers, but the settlement is very poor indeed, and the settlers have to be assisted, not only with land, but with money. But the Government have given way to Burns, Philp, and Co. in a manner I do not like, and which would not be approved of by the whole Commonwealth if the people knew of all the circumstances. I, for one, beg to make a protest against the expenditure of Commonwealth money in the New Hebrides in this way. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is a very good thing that we should endeavour to maintain and extend our influence over the islands of the Pacific. . An expenditure at this time may lead to a profitable connexion in the future. For some time past there has been a mail service between Australia and the New Hebrides, which has been maintained by New South Wales. That has now been taken over by the Commonwealth as a transferred service, and, of course, the expenditure is debited to New South Wales. What we have done, is to agree to an additional subsidy, first of all, of £400 per annum, on the condition, that in future nothing but white labour shall be employed in the service. That is to say, we have converted it from a coloured labour service to a white labour service.Weare paying in addition £2,000 as a consideration for a much better, and more frequent, mail service. </para>

                            <para>- I am not prepared to justify it as a mail service, and, in fact, many of our subsidized services are not in reality mail services. They are really services for the development of the trade and commerce of the country. At some future time I venture to hope that the practice will be adopted oof having a fund that can be drawn upon for the purpose of maintaining services required for other than postal reasons. At present we have not such a fund, and we are adopting the practice which has been followed through the whole of the States, of subsidizing mail services which are really for the purpose of developing territory. </para>

                        <para>- It is rather an unfair thing to object to the small amount to be devoted to the steamship line to the New Hebrides, inasmuch as the Commonwealth is undertaking new expenditure in regard to New Guinea. The New Guinea expenditure is of value to Queensland, whereas the other States will not profit by it. </para>

                            <para>- I know that it is an abstract advantage, but by these votes we shall tend to prevent antagonistic settlement, and that is a great thing for Australia. I quite agree that in regard to New Guinea the details of a large expenditure like £20,000 should be given. It is a considerable sum, and I doubt whether the money could not be better spent on the mainland. But we have committed ourselves to the expenditure, and I shall not take exception to it. I trust, nevertheless, that we shall not drift into a very large expenditure in this direction. </para>

                        <para>- Some reference has been made to the subsidized mail services, and to the New Hebrides. I, for one, congratulate the Government on the action they have taken in this respect, because I recognise that it will be to the advantage of Australia to open up trade and commerce with the islands of the Pacific. It is a recognition of the fact that we cannot be absolutely self-contained. We must assist trade and commerce so far as we can. It has been suggested that we do not want to have anything to do with the New Hebrides. But there was a general demand on the part of the people, especially in New South Wales and Victoria, some time ago, when there was a possibility of the New Hebrides falling into the hands of the French, that we should not allow the control of these islands to pass away from Great Britain. It is due to a large extent to the earnest and strenuous agitation then started that the present system of dual control over the New Hebrides has been commenced. We should do all we can to strengthen our position, not only in relation to the New Hebrides, but also as to the 'other islands in the Pacific. They should be led to regard Australia as the " country they are to trade with primarily. The trade of the islands must grow year by year, and if we secure it our position will be strengthened,, and large numbers of our own people will obtain employment. </para>

                            <para>- Defence is a most important element in the matter, but trade is also very important. We know perfectly well that to have various foreign nations settled near our shores is a menace to us ; and that is one of the reasons that led the British authorities to take control over as much of the territory of New Guinea as they could get. The representatives of Queensland recognise that it is to the advantage of the Commonwealth that we should retain New Guinea. I understand from the Postmaster-General that the administration of New Guinea is carried on by the Queensland Government. That being the case, we can very well vote this money, expecting the Government to give us details in future with regard to the administration of the* country, so that we may know in what direction the money is being spent - whether it is going in the right direction, or is being squandered in a way that would not meet with the approval of Parliament. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS</inline>(Queensland). - I again protest against what I consider to be a waste of money. We have sufficient natural resources in Australia to occupy all the energy we can expend. I look upon the desire of some honorable senators to annex the islands of the Pacific as merely due to a mistaken military ardour, which has been responsible for a great deal of expenditure and many evils that have already overtaken the Commonwealth. The trade that will be opened up with the islands - which are unfit' for many white people to live in - would be quite infinitesimal, and the money we are spending would be better laid out in inducing settlement in our own country. We have an immense territory, which will demand all our energy and capital for the next century at least. This desire for expansion is due to an earth hunger, and to a grabbing policy, which is not in the interests of the Commonwealth. I hope to see created in Australia a feeling that we should devote our energies to the development of our own territory. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales). - We have all heard of the term " Little Englander," and we shall be able now to speak of the " Little Australian." It appears to me that we have in our midst a number of gentlemen who have no great ambition concerning the future Australia, or - who, at least, do not desire that she should appear to great advantage outside our own borders. I do not think that is either a wise or a noble policy. On the contrary, I think we should follow the lines followed all along by the British Empire, and we should try legitimately, honestly, and honorably to extend our influence, our name, and our power. So long as we <inline font-style="italic">d'j</inline> it honorably in open and fair competition with the work!, we have nothing to fear. I protest against any small-minded policy which will not permit Australia to look big on the pages of future history. With regard to the trade with the Pacific Islands and New Guinea, I venture to say that the firms engaged in it have so far done .little but lose money, and we ought to look with gratification upon the efforts which trading firms in Australia have made in the past, and are making to-day, to extend the trade between Australia and the Pacific Islands. </para></speech>

                        <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has not grasped the full significance and importance of our trade in the Pacific. Our desire is not to maintain suzerainty over those islands, but to. see that other nations do not annex them. I have before said that the preponderance of trade with those islands will really decide the preponderance of influence there. It is really only a question of trade. We know that at the present time it is undecided whether the New Hebrides shall belong to Great Britain or to France, and that will be decided only by the preponderance of trade with those islands. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> that for hundreds of years to come we have plenty to do within the borders of Australia, but if we restrict our mental horizon to the shores of Australia, and permit the islands of the Pacific to come under the rule of foreign nations we shall be doing a very great injustice to Australia. Those islands may not only be used by foreign nations as coaling stations, and bases from which they they may attack Australia, but as places to which they may send their convicts. It is, in my opinion, our duty to secure sufficient influence in those islands to prevent their annexation by other nations. With regard to New Guinea, honorable senators will recollect that I opposed as premature the proposal that we should take over the Territory. In my opinion it would have been far better for the present to have allowed - British New Guinea to remain under the control of Great Britain, even though we had to pay a subsidy towards its administration. There are important questions to be considered with regard to the black population there, and with regard to trade and expenditure with the Territory. By taking over that territory, we have for the first time for 1,000 miles of our border been brought into contact with two foreign nations, whereas we were formerly surrounded  by the sea, and in that respect we have taken a very momentous step in the history of Australia. We have received no information from the Government as to their intentions with regard to New Guinea, and it is not possible for a Bill to be introduced this session dealing with the matter. I remind honorable senators that there is a movement throughout the world at the present time to devote an enormous amount of attention to naval defence. All the nations of the world are subsidizing steamers to secure a preponderance of trade and increase their mercantile marine for use in time of war. In view of the importance of a preponderance of trade in the New Hebrides and Pacific Islands the Government are justified in subsidizing mail steamers to carry on this trade so long as it is done upon proper lines. What I object to in connexion with the subsidy to Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co.'s steamers is that the matter has not been brought before the Senate or the other House, and Parliament has been given no explanation with regard to the subsidy. We have had to gather from the press some information as to the arrangements which have been made. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> desired some information with regard to New Guinea. I am sorry that I am not able to give him full details of the expenditure now. But I should like to add to what I have already said, that the position of affairs before federation was. that Queensland was administering the affairs of New Guinea, and the revenue amounted to about £40,000, which met the expenditure. That amount was made up of the revenue derived within the possession from Customs duties, and of a subsidy of £15,000 contributed by three of the colonies, and a subsidy of £7,000 from the Imperial Government for the upkeep of the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Merrie England.</inline> First of all, the Imperial Government absolutely declined to continue that subsidy of £7,000. The administration of the possession then went on under an agreement between Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria, the contributing colonies, until that agreement ran out on the 30th June last. Then Queensland declined to carry on any further alone, and that is what constituted the urgency for deciding whether the Commonwealth should step in, and with the consent of the Imperial Government assume control of the territory, or whether it should pass under the control of Great Britain in some other form. The general opinion was that it was desirable that the Commonwealth should have control over New Guinea. The amount previously contributed towards its administration was £22,000 per annum, £15,000 by the colonies, and £7,000 by the Imperial Government, and the first proposition was that the Commonwealth should guarantee that amount of £22,000. Ultimately it was agreed that the Commonwealth should provide £20,000, and endeavour to make that do with the revenue collected in New Guinea. Until the Commonwealth Parliament has time to consider a measure for the future government of New Guinea, the administration is being carried on on exactly the same lines as before it was transferred to the Commonwealth. The principal items of expenditure are, of course, for the Administrator, police, and the usual expenses in connexion with administration and the upkeep of the steamer <inline font-style="italic">Merrie England,</inline> which is necessary in order to maintain communication between New Guinea and the mainland. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales). - I trust the Government will not lose sight of the desirability, wherever an opportunity presents itself, of entering into negotiations to secure to the Commonwealth the control of the whole of New Guinea. I know it is not a matter to be pushed, but I desire that the Government should continually look for an opportunity, by means of negotiations between the Imperial authorities and the foreign powers interested, to see if it is not possible for the whole of New Guinea to be brought under the British flag, and under Australian control. For the very reason that I desire to see that brought about, I am extremely pleased that the Government have decided to try and develop the trade with the New Hebrides. I was inclined to regard their efforts in that direction as evidence of good statesmanship, but it has struck me that perhaps they have been due to the promptings of remorse, and that, having attempted to destroy the trade of Fiji, they are seeking to afford some compensation by developing trade with the New Hebrides. Without inquiring too closely into their motives, I am very glad they have don 3 so. We recognise that these islands must be developed, and the question is whether they shall be developed by trade with Australia, or whether we shall stand by while other, and possibly hostile, powers secure establishments in those places. As a matter of protection alone, I venture to say that the amount now being expended to develop trade with the New Hebrides is very much less than we might be called upon to expend if it were necessary that our defence force should be put upon an effective footing. With regard to those who contend that we should limit our efforts within the boundaries of our own Commonwealth, I might remind honorable senators who advocate that policy that if England had acted upon such a policy there would have been no such discovery as that of Australia; there would have been no British settlement here, no Federal Parliament, and no <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> ! I could multiply the list of catastrophies  which would have followed, but I shall only add that any one who attempts to confine the Britisher to the limits of his own particular country must first undermine the peculiar characteristics and genius of our race. </para>

The people of Great Britain did not begin exploring the world for other territories until they at least imagined they were being crowded out in their own country. What is our position in Australia? We have a territory as large as the United States of America, and we have barely 4,000,000 of people in it - not nearly a soul to the square mile. We have any amount of development work to do within our own borders if we only turn our attention to it. </para>

There are numbers of people who have not even a mail delivery once a week or once a month, and the greatest obstacles are placed in the way of their communication with the outer world. Nothing promotes settlement so much in the interior of Australia, and especially where the soil is good, as postal and educational facilities. Wherever we have a school and a post-office conveniently placed, people are willing to settle. We have in the Commonwealth a vast wilderness howling for population, and here it is proposed that we should embark upon a career of Imperialism and acquisition, as if people in Australia were swearing at each other to stand around for room. When Australia is filled with a population of 100,000,000 people, if I am alive, winch is not likely, I shall go hand in hand with our friends who call themselves " big Australians." I observe that natives of New Guinea are permitted to work as seamen on vessels in the ports of the Commonwealth.

                            <para>- In the Estimates they are lumped together, so that nobody can pick them out. When I came to look into the matter I found that the office was empty, with the exception of a caretaker and a messenger, whose salaries amount to £45 and £52 respectively. The point is that the Commonwealth has been put to this expense and this yearly rent, and the building remains empty. I asked my informant ' for what purpose the offices were used, and I must say that I discredited the reason which was given to me. I was told that it contains sleeping accommodation for the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs. I think that the statement should be contradicted by the Postmaster-General if it is a fact that there is no sleeping accommodation provided in the building. I believe that the building was taken, and the alterations made with the intention that, as as soon as the Parliament is prorogued, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs should transfer the greater portion of their office staffs from Melbourne to Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- What he said was that a Minister might transact his official business, when the House was not sitting, in the capital in which he lived, and have the head-quarters of his department there. I dissent from that contention ; and I say that no Minister has any right to remove either his head-quarters or any portion of his staff from Melbourne till the federal capital is established. The Commonwealth has already incurred a heavy expense in transporting to Melbourne the various officials and their wives and furniture who were transferred from other State services to the Commonwealth service ; but if during the recess the head-quarters of the various departments are removed to other cities, many of these clerks will have to be taken there, and the Commonwealth will have to bear the further heavy expense of their travelling and the cost of their living while away from Melbourne. If it is right that the Prime Minister should remove his head-quarters to Sydney, the Minister for Defence might equally well remove the head-quarters of the Defence department to Perth, and the Postmaster-General transport the head-quarters of the Postal department to Brisbane. It is already detrimental to the business of the Common wealth that Ministers like the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs should reside out of Melbourne. I maintain that the salary which has been provided for them by the Constitution is paid to them to enable them to reside at the capital. </para>

I find upon the Estimates for the year the sum of £1,900 for the furniture and fittings of the Sydney and Melbourne offices, and that is by no means the limit of the expenditure. Hitherto we have had to pass by these matters because it was almost impossible to discover how the money was being spent ; but now that attention has been drawn to the subject, I hope that honorable senators will join with me in suggesting to the House of Representatives a reduction of this vote. The office in Sydney has been empty since the 1st June last, because. Ministers and their officers have been here in Melbourne. I move - </para>

                            <para>- I have not had an opportunity to check the statements of the honorable senator, but, although it appears from the papers circulated by the Treasurer that money has been spent upon rent and the fittings and furniture of the Commonwealth offices in Sydney, the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth was conducted from Sydney for a considerable period before the opening of Parliament. It was therefore necessary to have offices there. The honorable senator, no doubt, contends that those offices should have been abandoned directly Parliament met, and he would not even allow Ministers who live in New South Wales, and go over to Sydney occasionally at the weekend, to have an office there in which they could transact Commonwealth business. Surely that is unreasonable. I am perfectly satisfied that the Vice-President of the Executive Council did not say that at the end of the session Ministers would remove their departmental staffs to other States. My honorable colleague said nothing that could be twisted into meaning that when the Minister for Defence went to Perth he would take with him the head-quarter's staff and every one connected with the administration of his department. If a Minister's home is in another State, surely honorable senators would not raise any objection to his spending some time there after the session had closed. Surely such a Minister should have an office in his own city in which to transact the business of his department. It does not follow that he would take his staff with him. I had to administer my department for several months without any staff whatever, and I travelled through the country receiving telegrams at one station and answering them from the next one. It is not absolutely necessary that a Minister should be located in the same building as his staff in order to carry out the work of administration. At the end of this. session, which has lasted for upwards of a year, I suppose that I shall be permitted to pay a visit to my own State, which I have not seen' for twelve months, and to administer my department from Brisbane. </para>

The consideration that must determine a question of this kind is the general public convenience, and that of the gentlemen called upon to administer the Government departments. It has been a very common practice for Ministers in the States to administer their departments for days, and even weeks, together without going near them. If a Minister of the Crown were always to be found in his office his .action would constitute a public grievance, because the people require that Ministers should move about amongst them, in order that they may make themselves acquainted with public requirements. Every reasonable latitude should be allowed Ministers in this respect. One honorable senator from Western Australia, whose view of this matter is of the same order as those associated with parish-pump politicians, remarked that I supported the Government because the offices referred to happen to be located in Sydney. I will now ask that honorable senator what he thinks about the appointment of a special Federal officer in Perth? Representations have been made regarding the necessity of appointing a Federal commissioner, or ambassador, or something of that kind, at Perth. </para>

                            <para>- -Any such proposition is absurd. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> has pointed out that £2,728 is to be expended in rent, repairs, and furniture in connexion with suites of offices in Sydney, quite irrespective of those which have been provided in Melbourne. These offices are to be maintained throughout the year because a Minister happens to go to Sydney now and again while Parliament is sitting, and because he desires to retire there during the recess, and to take his private secretary with him. I do not say that a Minister should not live in Sydney during the recess, but he should not require a magnificent suite of offices there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has got hold of some "cock-and-bull story" about the appointment of a special representative of the Commonwealth, who is to reside in Perth. I know nothing about any such proposal. </para>

I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> proposal should be supported, and that we should show our disapproval of Ministers' extravagant Oriental conceptions of expenditure. The sooner the seat of the federal capital site is fixed on, and the seat of government is removed there, the better.

                        <para>- The jealousy is all on the one side. Senator Millen, in common with other reformers, is very anxious to keep down expenditure, and yet we find him supporting a gross piece of extravagance. If the arguments now used in support of Ministers travelling about and administering their departments in all sorts of places have any force, they will also hold good by-and-by, when the seat of government is established in the federal capital, and expensive suites of offices will be maintained in a number of different places. I do not understand how it is that a prominent member of the Opposition should be in the confidence of the Government with regard to a suggested appointment in Western Australia, about which the representatives of that State know nothing. </para>

No one will deny that offices should be engaged for the accommodation of those officers who have to transact Commonwealth business in the various States ; but there is no reason why expensive buildings should be rented and be allowed to remain practically unoccupied during the whole of the time that Parliament is sitting. There are practically no Federal officers in Sydney who come under this heading, and it is manifest that this expensive building and furniture cannot be wanted there. In Western Australia and Tasmania there are no such Federal officers that I know of, though Western Australia is- the State most removed from the seat of government, and should, of all others, have this accommodation if it be found necessary elsewhere. </para>

I know very well that there are large federal offices, such as the post-offices and defence buildings in Western Australia, but there are no independent offices, apparently used for no specific purpose. These items represent a very large sum of money, but if the Postmaster-General can give an assurance that the offices are kept and used for the department, and are absolutely necessary to the conduct of Commonwealth business in New South Wales, I shall not vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson.</inline> But until I receive an assurance that these offices are both reasonable in extent and absolutely necessary, my intention is to vote for the suggested amendment. </para>

                        <para>- My sympathies are with the Postmaster-General, but my judgment is with the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, whom I am bound to protect. My sympathies are with the Postmaster-General, because he is here without his colleague. This is grievance day, and we have been here since half-past ten o'clock this morning. Each honorable senator has prepared his own particular shot, and it is quite impossible that the Minister can be fully informed on all the twenty or thirty items which have been hurled at his head. At the same time, I am in absolute accord with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> in the step he has taken, and unless I hear some good reason to the contrary, I shall support the suggested amendment, which I hope will be carried in order to show to the Cabinet that we will not tolerate extravagant allowance expenses. The question of expenses has been before the Commonwealth for some weeks or, indeed, some months, and Ministers have already been warned that they cannot be allowed. We all desire to treat our federal officers with the utmost fairness ; but are we to be always in a state of unsettlement, caused by this dodging about, in view of some capital to be erected five years or fifteen years hence? Are these officers, during all that time, to have no settled place, and, whenever they make a journey or want a meal, to have the expense paid by the Commonwealth? That is a most unsatisfactory way of doing business. It must be apparent to the most junior or thick-headed officer - though I hope we have none of the latter - that for the next five years Parliament must sit in Melbourne. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to be able to say twenty years. When an officer in Tasmania, New South Wales, or Queensland gets the offer of an appointment in the Federal service, the question he has to consider is whether it will suit him to take the increased salary and live for at least five years in Melbourne. If such an arrangement will not suit him, he has no right to take the appointment. The Federal public servants, most of whom are capable and efficient men, whom we are going to treat with every liberality, must not consider themselves "rolling stones" between Melbourne and Sydney, but must make up their minds to settle at the temporary seat of government. If we once give up control over allowances and expenses, we shall spend thousands of pounds of the taxpayers' money. We are told that these buildings in Sydney are necessary, in order that Ministers and their officials may have a place in which to sleep. </para>

                            <para>- If the Postmaster-General has not sufficient information to satisfy us as to the facts, the item had better be postponed. This is the thin end of the wedge - the beginning of extravagance to which we desire to put an end - and I hope the Postmaster-General will either ask. for a postponement, or furnish us with facts on which we can give a decision. I am a supporter of the Barton Government, but I regard my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, who is a brother Tasmanian, as a very extravagant Minister. The position he has won shows that he has been an efficient administrator in the mother State of New South Wales. At the same time, there are States in the Commonwealth which cannot and will not afford the extravagant expenditure to which the mother colony has been accustomed under <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne. and other Ministers. If the Government are to stand well in the opinion of the Commonwealth, and are to retain the confidence of a majority of honorable senators and representatives in another House, it is absolutely necessary that they should exercise economy, and that they should not give to themselves or their officials not only constitutional rights, but a lot of perquisites which are unfair to the citizens generally. I make no complaint whatever of Ministers receiving their salaries under the Constitution, and also the member's allowance of £400 per year. I regard the remuneration as little enough, but it is meant to cover the whole of the expenses to which they may be put in attending Parliament, whether for six or twelve months. Ministers have no right to bedrooms at places where they may take up temporary residence at the expense of the Commonwealth. It is the beginning of their getting something to which they are not entitled, and a Minister ought to be above that sort of thing. If they are not above taking those extra advantages, that very moment some of us begin to lose confidence in them. </para>

As usual, I do not agree with the honorable senator. I think the principle of making allowances to officers who came from distant States was a correct one. It was a principle truly federal, because it placed officers in the various States on something like equality, but Parliament disapproved of the payment of allowances, and no allowances are now granted. </para>

                            <para>- Members of Parliament get their allowances. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> inquired why £15,000 was asked for this month, and I have to say in reply that it is on account of a vote of £91,856. The reason why it is in excess of the twelfth portion is that a considerable amount of the money voted in the early Supply Bills was used for the payment of arrears, and, consequently, a larger amount is now required. But about £85,000 of this £91,000 will now have been voted, so that all that will be left will be only about an ordinary month'ssupply. It is for paying such accounts as rents, repairs, maintenance, fittings, furniture, and so on. </para>

The Home department attends to the repairs of all the other departments and has control of their buildings. With regard to the External and Home Affairs departments, provision is made for accommodation in Sydney, as well as in Melbourne. There lies the root of the trouble. But it is not unreasonable that there should be office accommodation in Sydney for the Ministers who reside in New South Wales, and who, I think, after a long session, have a right to administer their departments from their place of residence. As to my own department, it is not my intention to move any officer from Melbourne. I intend to stay here. I am not in a position to speak for any other Minister, but I certainly think that a Minister who resides in New South Wales has a right during the recess to live in his own State ; and in order to administer his department in his own State he may probably find it necessary to take over some officers. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STEWART</inline>(Queensland).-I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> intention is, but I hope he will not withdraw his motion. A desire has been shown by more than one Minister to transfer his department bodily to Sydney during the recess. When the Estimates come before us we shall probably be told that the money has been spent, and it is of no use talking about it. The sooner we " take the bull by the horns " the better, and the committee will only be doing its duty in expressing its disapproval of any action of the character complained of. Imagine the position if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne transfers himself with his entire retinue of officers to Sydney during the recess . ' There will be the cost of taking the officers to Sydney, the expense of the offices there, and all the allowances, in addition to the disturbance caused in the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth. Some honorable senators appear disposed to excuse this sort of thing. It would be just as reasonable if there were a Victorian Minister who lived in some remote part of this State, and who, during the recess, transferred the whole of his department to his residence in the Mallee, for instance ! So far as I can gather from the Constitution, Melbourne is the capital for the time being. Wherever the Parliament sits is the capital of the Commonwealth until the capital is definitely fixed by Act of Parliament. I shall not support any proposal to have a movable seat of government, and movable Ministers and officers, with their allowances and all their other paraphernalia heaped on the top of the Commonwealth. </para>

I ask the honorable and learned senator to make a note of that, and to consider the necessity of making some provision as soon as possible for paying them for that overtime. </para>

                    <para>I should now like to ask whether the Federal Government is not surrendering itself into the hands of the Eastern Extension Company, by agreeing to any compromise whatever. For twenty years past this company, which is one of the most powerful monopolies in the world, attempted to block the establishment of a State-owned cable. When. after repeated efforts, we have now succeeded in getting a State-owned cable, the Government appear to me to be playing into the hands of the Eastern Extension Company. The object of having a State-owned cable is to supply the people of the Commonwealth at the cheapest possible rate, but the proposal evidently on the boards is that the Government shall come to an agreement with the Eastern Extension Company as to .the prices to be charged to the public for the next twenty years or so. I submit that if the Prime Minister agrees with the company to fix any price that shall be charged, it will be a very great mistake. It has made so much money out of its monopoly that it has provided an immense reserve fund - no less than £800,000 - which its agents said would be spent in toying to block the State-owned cable. I believe that they are capable of adopting any means to retain the cable business of Australia for their lines. The company will have the chief advantage under any agreement that is entered into. It has made all its preparations ; it has probably secured a great part of the business, and, if the Government enter into an agreement to charge 3s. per word, the Commonwealth will be burdened with the expensive upkeep of a cable, while the company will enjoy a monopoly of the business. How is the Government to compete successfully with a company which will, adopt the methods it adopts ? Has the Government any reason to suppose that such an unscrupulous company will adopt fair methods in dealing with the Commonwealth ? Has the Postmaster-General any idea of the methods that will be adopted by the company to get hold of business ? Will there be any provision to -restrain the company from granting to cable-users concessions that our agreement will not interfere with in any -way <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I consider that the Government are making a great mistake in having anything to do with a company which fought the States for twenty years or more, and which I understand has money at its disposal to entertain people in very great style. It would appear that it has been able to bring influence to bear, by what means I know not, to get an agreement with the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I am rather sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has selected this time to raise this question, because it does not give him a fair opportunity to express his views, and it leaves me hardly sufficient time to reply as fully as I should like to do. I can assure him that we have made no concession to the Eastern Extension Company. It had made with four of the colonies - now States - an agreement under which, in consideration of certain concessions being made, it reduced its rates and the landing and terminal charges were correspondingly reduced. I was pressed by some portions of the community, especially the mercantile community, to consent to a similar agreement on behalf of Queensland and Victoria. Those States had always declined to make any such agreement, and the Commonwealth has not made an agreement on their behalf , or any agreement at all. The company has decided that from this time until a conference takes place in London it will charge to the non-contracting States the same rates as it charges to the contracting States, and, of course, the transit and terminal charges have been made uniform in the same way, so that now a telegram going from or coming to any of the States costs exactly the same amount. If no understanding is arrived at as the outcome of a conference in London, then the company will be at liberty to charge a lower rate to the contracting States than to the non-contracting States. </para>

                    <para>SenatorDRAKE. - I cannot say. I do not think it is an undesirable thing that a conference should take place, at which the Eastern Extension Company and the Pacific Cable Board will both be represented. The honorable senator has a very strong opinion in regard to the Eastern Extension Company, but I would remind him that in the Pacific Cable Board we have a very powerful and intelligent body, who are not likely in any negotiations to sacrifice the interests of the board or the interests of the States that are the proprietors of the Pacific cable. From what he knows of the past history of these negotiations he may be perfectly sure that the interests of Australia are quite safe in the hands of the present Government. </para>
