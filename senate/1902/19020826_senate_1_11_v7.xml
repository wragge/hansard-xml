It is simply submitted for the information of the Senate, in order that it may arrive at the best possible solution of the difficulties which have arisen in consequence of their being no standing orders, and no settled practice in reference to these money Bills. It will be observed that this opinion goes no further than the proceedings which are to be taken to-day - it is not necessary at the present juncture to go any further - and that the paper depends, and the procedure which ought to be adopted depends, on which of the two alternative propositions the Senate is prepared to affirm. The first proposition is that the Senate has already, by making a request, agreed to the item or the clause in case the request is adopted by the House of Representatives, and the amendment made. That is a proposition which the Standing Orders Committee think ought to be adopted as being the most convenient, and the most consistent with the wish of the Senate to treat these requests, as far as practicable, as analogous to amendments. I think that we should be very careful to adopt a procedure that may be ultimately embodied in standing orders, which is the best possible and the most convenient, which will create the most harmonious relations between the Houses, which will vindicate the power and the position of the Senate, and will not violate the principles of the Constitution. </para>

                    (Tasmania). - I do not think it conceivable that any honorable senator present is not fully aware of the very great importance of the position in which we now find ourselves as a Senate ; but if there were any doubt upon the subject, the very careful nature of the memorandum which the President has thought it necessary to put before us for our consideration, affords additional proof. Deviating for a moment from the original motion, I should like to offer this criticism with regard to the memorandum. I recognise, of course, that it is a memorandum offered by the Standing Orders Committee for the consideration of the Senate, and that there is no means whatever at the disposal of the Senate by which the suggestions made could now be adopted. At any rate, they could not be adopted to-day. In regard to the position taken up in the memorandum in the paragraph numbered (1), I should think the Senate would be unanimous in the expression of the desire that where any request has been made by the Senate to the House of Representatives, and such request has been agreed to, the matter should be regarded as ended. I do not think that upon that subject there can be any question whatever. Nor in fact do I think that there can be any doubt in regard to paragraph (2). But I. would offer this criticism : that while the memorandum states in paragraph (2), with regard to (A), that -

                    <para>When a request has been agreed to, with a modification, a motion ought to be made that the modification be agreed to or disagreed with, we are confronted with this position - and I recognise at once that no standing order can get over it - that there is no absolute onus thrown by the standing order suggested upon any person in the Senate, not even on the leader of the Senate himself, to move the motion. It is that difficulty that goes straight to the root of the matter which we shall have to confront presently. </para>

                        <para>- I am delighted to hear that, and nothing is further from my desire than to take the conduct of business out of the hands of the representative of the Government. I am glad to know that the leader of the Senate is prepared to supply what, I venture to say, is an ellipse that could not be filled up by a standing order. I am also delighted to hear from the Vice-President of the Executive Council, that he intends to follow that method. But, sir, of course these remarks deal both with paragraph (2) and paragraph (3) - that is to say, with the second class of requests to which an agreement with a modification has been consented to by the other House, and also with that third class of requests with which the other House has disagreed. Coming at once to paragraph (3), may I point out to the Senate the nature of the message which has been sent down to us by the House of Representatives&#39;? I do not wish - nothing is further from ray thought and desire - to offer any sort of unfriendly criticism as to the House of Representatives. I am not going to say that the other House has shown us any want of courtesy, nor am I going to indicate that such is my opinion by any devious method. But apart from any question of courtesy, which I do not raise, we are confronted with what seems to be the most serious difficulty in the whole of this question, owing to the nature and form of the message from the House of Representatives. The message that has been sent down to us deals, first of all, with those requests of ours to which the other House has given its consent, and which, as we are all agreed, are absolutely finished with. The message then goes on to deal with those requested amendments of ours with which the other House has agreed with certain modifications. Both of those sets of requests are numbered, and set out fully in the message itself. Then the next paragraph deals with the question of the date, which, of course, does not affect the Senate ; and, finally, a paragraph appears - a mere postscript, as it were - in which we read that the House of Representatives has not agreed to the remainder of the amendments requested by the Senate. Here we are at once confronted with this great and grave difficulty. When the message of the House of Representatives is properly before the committee, I do not see how it will be possible for the Chairman, having this message only before him, to allow us to deal individually - as, of course, we want to do - with all the various items to our requests as to which the House of Representatives has disagreed. That is the difficulty - and a very great difficulty it is - in which we find ourselves at the present time ; it raises the important question we have to solve now, and I must admit that I see no way out of it. The easiest way, I think, for the Senate to meet the present situation would be to go through the Tariff item by item. We should then find that, say, in regard to item 1, our request has been disagreed with. We could then deal with it, and so on right through. But the difficulty with which the Chairman of Committees has to contend in dealing with the message of the House of Representatives is, that he has to put before the committee those requests that the House of Representatives has agreed to, then to go on to the requests agreed to with modifications, and regardless of the order of the Tariff as we discussed it previously in committee, to take finally the requested amendments which have not been made, and in reference to which we have only a bald statement presented to us. Under those circumstances, what is the Chairman of Committees to do? What is the leader of the Senate to do ? What is there before the Chairman except the message as it stands &#39;( </para>

                        <para>- I have already indicated that I am not prepared to move in any particular direction with regard to procedure, but I do submit this with confidence, that before the Senate resolves itself into committee - and as I understand the position we shall <inline font-style="italic">ipso facto</inline> go into committee when the President leaves the Chair - we should first determine upon the procedure that will have to be followed. We should say clearly that such and such a procedure shall be adopted. No other course will be consistent with our own dignity. We have to consider now, not a matter that arises and gives occasion for party strife or faction, but a course of procedure that must be a precedent for all future procedure in this Senate. The gravity of the position cannot be overlooked ; and whatever we may do, I urge upon the Senate, and especially upon the representatives of the Government, that we should, before resolving ourselves into committee, settle in some clear and definite way, in accordance with the wishes of the majority, what our procedure shall be. Before I sit down I would call attention to another difficulty that must arise one way or the .other before we have settled this Tariff question. During the previous debates upon the Tariff, owing to that section of the Constitution which requires that where the voting is equal, the motion shall pass in the negative, a section of this Senate was frequently disappointed in regard to the results of divisions. Some of us might perhaps like to fence round the question or to shirk it, but I do not care to do that. The question will undoubtedly arise again, and without any feeling of party spirit I urge the Vice-President of the Executive Council to deal with motions upon the Tariff in&#39; a manner consistent with the dignity of the Senate and the respect that is due to it. That respect the leader of the Government has always shown. I admit that frankly, and rely upon it in the future. I hope he will accept the situation as he finds it, and that if the onus and obligation rests upon him of making a motion upon which some such result as I have suggested occurs, he will at once accept the situation. I do not know that I can say anything more now, except that I have risen in order to urge that we might adopt some proper procedure before going into committee. I shall loyally accept the decision of the majority of the Senate, but whatever that decision may be, I urge that the procedure to be adopted should be determined before we go into committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise at once to make a statement which I had intended to put before honorable senators upon the opening of the proceedings in committee. It is true that there can be no general discussion in committee, but I had intended - and I submit that I should have been in order - to make a statement for the information of the committee as to the procedure which the Government &#39;intend to follow in dealing with this message. I do not complain of the question being raised in the form in which it has been brought forward by the honorable and learned senator. There can be no doubt that it is a very important question, and I daresay <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> was quite right in raising it in order to obtain a statement from the Government as to their intentions. But I do not wholly see how the procedure can be&#39; settled now and upon this motion. It appears to me that the only way in which it can be settled is by dealing with it when we actually get to work in committee. As a question arises the form of the motion will have to be dealt with there. The Government will propose it in the form which I am going to indicate, and if that form does not commend itself to the majority of the committee it will be open to any honorable senator to move an amendment. I think that before I resume my seat I shall be I able to satisfy the Senate that the course which we propose is the only one which can be adopted, and I submit that it is a perfectly simple one. Before stating the details, perhaps I may be allowed to say that the Government are glad to have the assistance which the Senate will obtain from the principles laid down in the memorandum which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have read from the majority of the Standing Orders Committee. The position is this. We have sent our message to another place together with the Bill. The message contains certain requests which are numbered according to the order of the items with which we have dealt. The House of Representatives have amended the Bill in respect of the requests to which they have agreed. With regard to other requests with which they have not agreed they have referred in their message to the items and numbers in our message. The message has come back to us, and when we go into committee we shall take into consideration the items and the message from another place. That message refers directly to our own message, and to the numbers we have attached to our requests. It begins - </para>

                        <para>- Pardon me for one moment. Honorable senators will also have before them the Bill as amended by the House of Representatives. In these circumstances, it seems to me&#39; that the committee will take into consideration only the message and not the Bill. For example, they will take the first item in the Senate&#39;s own message. If it has been dealt with in any way - as it must have been - by the message of the House of Representatives; a motion will be submitted accordingly. Perhaps I had better take an illustration as I go along, following the order of the requests. Bequest No. 1 has not been agreed to, and I propose to move in regard to it - &#34; That the Senate does not press its request.&#34; My honorable and learned colleague and myself have considered very carefully the form of that motion. As suggested in the memorandum read by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> it might be put in different ways, but we thought it would not be advisable to put it in the form &#34; That the Senate withdraws its request.&#34; We do not think that necessary. We do not wish to put it in the form &#34; That the Senate does not insist upon its request,&#34; because the word &#34;insist,&#34; which is used in regard to amendments, is not applicable to suggestions. The form I have named will apply in regard to all the items which have not been dealt with as requested by the Senate. We come now to the second class of items; that is to say items in which a modification has been made. I propose to put the motions in regard to those in this form - &#34;That the Senate agrees to the modification of the Senate&#39;s request made by the House of Representatives.&#34; Those modifications have been made in the Bill, and it appears to me that a motion in the form I have indicated will put before the Senate the question that we desire to decide. In regard to all these questions, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> will see that there has been no intention on the part of the Government to shirk the position of having an affirmative thrown upon them. </para>

                        <para>- Why not be frank? In regard to these two classes, we propose to put the question in the form I have indicated. In regard to the third class, namely, items in regard to which the House of Representatives have agreed to our requests, I am entirely in accord with the opinion expressed in the memorandum read by you, Mr. . President, that it is unnecessary for us to do anything. The position, therefore, will be this : We shall deal with the requests in the way I have indicated, and it appears to me that until the two Houses are in accord we should not touch the Bill. &#34;When the two Houses are in accord, the Bill will be in committee in the form in which it is sent up to us by the House of Representatives, and in that form, and without any motion with regard to particular items, we shall report it finally from the committee. Then it will go on to the third reading stage. But until we come to the stage of absolute accord my view is - and I think it will commend itself to the majority of honorable senators - that we should not touch the Bill, but deal only with the messages. That is the procedure which I propose to adopt, and I see no difficulty in regard to it. It seems to me to be perfectly simple, and I hope that if honorable senators are satisfied with it, we shall be able to come at once to the real business of putting our procedure into motion, and dispose of the Tariff at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                    <para>- The procedure which the Vice-President of the Executive Council has outlined is one which, I venture to think, can give rise to no demur from any quarter of the Senate. There is one point to which I desire to direct renewed attention, for I am inclined to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has not grasped the seriousness of the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> when he dealt with the form of the message sent down to the Senate. Honorable senators must see that if only for the sake of convenience it would have been very much better if a different course had been pursued. It hardly seems to be a matter for which another place is responsible. I am satisfied that if the Government can see any value in the suggestion they will seek in future to give effect to it, if only to facilitate business. In their message the House of Representatives deal with three classes of amendments, but the schedule attached to it gives only one of the classes. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The message has divided the requests made by us into three classes ; those with which the House of Representatives has agreed, those to which they have agreed with modifications, and those to which they have disagreed. In the schedule, however, we have only the one class set out. The consequence is that in order to see exactly to what part of the Tariff any request relates, we have to turn to the original Customs Bill, and we have to refer to this message as well as to some other document. </para>

                        <para>- That statement would be convincing, if the weakness of it were not shown by the fact that the House of Representatives have inserted one schedule in their message. It would not have imposed any great additional work upon any one to have shown in one document the list of requested amendments and the way in which the House of Representatives have dealt with them. I put it that there ought to be only one document, just as there is in the case of an ordinary message dealing with amendments which can be made. I raise the point, not as a grievance against another place, and not as a matter which has any serious constitutional aspect underlying it, but as one of convenience. </para>

                    <para>- I am sure we must sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; Clemons</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in regard to their want of knowledge of the requests which have not been agreed to by another place. They are very much in the same position as I was when the debate on the Tariff commenced in the Senate. At that&#39; time I had no idea of the proposals which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> intended to make in regard to certain of the items. The contention which they have raised seems to be very much like one that was advanced in the Supreme Court of Queensland upon one occasion when it took three hours to prove according to law, that there was a certain institution known as the Queensland National Bank in existence, although every man, woman, and child in Brisbane knew that it did exist. Honorable senators who are objecting to the inadequacy of the message know very well what requests have been disregarded. If the Clerk, or whoever was responsible for the form adopted, had taken greater trouble, and put 50 different numbers into the message, honorable members would, all the same, have had to refer to the other printed documents. I have here a schedule showing the requested amendments which have been made by the House of Representatives, and I take it that every honorable member has received a copy. </para>

                    <para>- I am glad an opportunity has been afforded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> of explaining the course of action which the Government propose. But if honorable senators had taken the trouble to consider the constitutional position, they would realize that until the requests have been definitely dealt with one way or the other, it will be impossible to take the Bill a further stage. The Government are responsible for the Bill, and are obliged to take some action with regard to the course proposed by the other House. If honorable senators realize that fact, they will see that there can be no difficulty in regard to the way in which the matter should be dealt with by the Government. There is one point which has not yet been considered. So far, our requests have not been dealt with in the way in which ordinary amendments are dealt with. Had the Senate, in an ordinary Bill, made certain amendments, the other House in disagreeing with them would have given reasons for such disagreement. In this case, where the House of Representatives has declined to accede to our requests, the communication of that fact ought to have been accompanied by reasons. Standing </para>

                        <para>- That is so;, but I say that our requests are analogous with amendments, and if reasons were&#39; given in such cases, it would tend to the more harmonious working of the two Houses, with the further advantage that we should have the reasons before us when we were considering particular items or clauses. I am sorry that course has not been adopted, though I am prepared to believe that there was no desire on the part of the House of Representatives to flout the Senate by either a non-recognition or a non-realization of the position of affairs at this juncture. From what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has said I take it that the Government, as is absolutely necessary, will submit motions to either agree or disagree, or not to insist, on requests. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> shows clearly, that, until differences are reconciled between the two Houses, a Bill cannot become law. On page 479, <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> says that,- if such agreement cannot be secured, the Bill is lost for the session. It becomes absolutely necessary, therefore, on the part of the Government, in order to insure the Bill becoming law, to reconcile the differences between the two Houses. </para>

                    this afternoon, I shall venture to, perhaps, &#34; rub his fur the wrong way &#34; a second time. We ought not to allow this debate to conclude - or shall I say this difficulty to pass? - without a recognition of the fact that the position has been created by the Government, and by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline>
                    who has been made the subject of so much sympathetic compliment, for having devised a way of doing his simple duty as leader of the Senate.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline>
                    has, over and over again, refused to allow the Senate an opportunity of adopting, or, at any rate, of discussing, the standing orders which a committee of this Chamber have framed for our guidance in dealing with such difficult situations as that now before us. While we are quite willing to recognise that
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline>
                    as leader of the Senate, has done his plain duty this afternoon, and has taken up a dignified position, we also recognise that it is the one and only position he could take up. I am quite prepared to compliment the honorable senator on having done his duty, because every man does not do his duty in this world. That applies particularly to Ministers. We have had so many examples of the present Ministry not doing their duty that we absolutely go out of our way to compliment the Vice-President of the Executive Council on being virtuous. But the honorable gentleman, I find, is &#34;beating his own joss,&#34; as did the Chinaman when rain came not.

                    which, in a leader, told us this morning that we are a Chamber of revision and of no consequence. We are told in that leader that it is our duty to meekly swallow exactly and in every particular what the House of Representatives chooses to send us - that we must be silent and take no action that will indicate that the Senate has a soul of its own.

                        <para>.- Certainly, I do. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is a most interesting journal, and is rendered the more interesting by reason of the leader which appears in its columns this morning. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has had the advantage of the assistance of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> for a long time, but we find him now, as I said, &#34;flogging his joss,&#34; and proposing a course of procedure which I venture to say is both honorable and constitutional. After the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> and the promise he has given, I think the difficulties of dealing with the questions to be submitted to us have been reduced to a minimum. I do not understand, however, whether it is proposed to take the Senate&#39;s requests in order, no matter how they have been dealt with by the House of Representatives. The requests have been dealt with by the House of Representatives in three ways - by acceptance, partial acceptance, or rejection - and I do not quite understand whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> proposes to deal with them according to their number, or according to the method of treatment in the other Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will allow me, I will answer that question at once. I propose that the Chairman shall go through the schedule as presented in the message from the House of Representatives. The schedule contains all the requests in which there have been modifications. After that part of the message has been dealt with, we shall take those requests which have been disagreed to, referring to our own message, and dealing with them item by item. </para>

I am afraid, however, that if, in committee, we feel it our duty to refer to our constitutional rights, which, while admitted in the letter have been denied in the spirit by the other Chamber- </para>

                        <para>.- But I fear that when we get into committee it may be held by the Chairman that we can discuss absolutely nothing but the individual item then before us - that- we cannot make any reference to the future possibilities involved in the settlement for the first time of a very difficult and delicate matter. That is why I was making the reference I was, and, therefore, I think you will see that it involved the question of procedure. At the present stage, I can only express the hope that while the Chairman will limit discussion reasonably, he will not play the tyrant in the matter of discussing any constitutional question which may arise, and will not tie honorable senators down too closely to the mere point of whether milk shall be dutiable at a1d. or at 1/2d.. per pint, or whether it shall be free. If we are to be restricted in the manner I have indicated, I suppose that the larger matters to. -which I have made reference would be properly discussable in the Senate on the receipt of the report of the committee. Possibly that would be the more convenient time. I have only to add that the procedure laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> is one to which I suppose we can all  cordially agree. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be remembered that when the Tariff was introduced the duty on arrowroot was 1d. per lb. It was approved by the other House, but the Senate carried a request that the item be placed on the free list. The other House did not agree to that request, but has met the Senate half way by offering to reduce the duty to &#189;d. per lb. That, it seems to me, is a very fair compromise between two opinions. On the one hand the Government and their supporters believe that this is an industry which certainly ought to get the benefit of the protective duty of1d. per lb. It is a duty which principally affects Queensland. It concerns an industry which is of very considerable proportions, and which we all hope will become more extensive, and, therefore, we think that there ought to be a protective duty of a substantial character. On the other hand there are persons who hold the view that arrowroot is an article of food which ought to be made free. There is no doubt that a certain amount of protection is necessary in order to give this industry the encouragement for its expansion which it ought to have. We think it is a very fair compromise to agree to a duty of &#189;d. per lb., which will give a certain, although a very small protection, and which cannot prejudicially affect the cost of the article. As a matter of fact, the cost of Australian arrowroot is, and always has been less than that of most of the imported varieties. </para>

Very strong opinions have been expressed in the other House as to the necessity of retaining a duty of some kind or other, and we are willing to show that we are prepared, where a sufficient reason is given, to deal fairly with these questions. We realize that where the two Houses have almost co-equal power in dealing with the Tariff, unless there is a possibility of a little give and take occasionally it will be practically impossible to arrive at any definite conclusion. We, on this side of the Chamber, are just as anxious as honorable senators on the other side to see finality reached in connexion with the Tariff. But at the same time we are not prepared to give up our honest and strong convictions on some items which will be debated at a later stage in connexion with the message. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be remembered that there were originally three matters dealt with under item 15. First of all, there were candles, &#38;c, which, as the Tariff came to the Senate, had a duty of1d. per lb. placed upon them. With regard to the stearine itself, the duty was also1d. per lb., and the Senate made the suggestion to reduce the duty to&#189;d. This suggestion has been adopted by the House of Representatives, and the amendment accordingly made. With regard to paraffine wax, the Senate carried the suggestion that the duty should be reduced from1d. to&#188;d. The House of Representatives, being unable to accept that suggestion, have agreed to a modification that the duty shall be&#189;d. That is to say, that they propose to meet the Senate by doubling the duty as suggested, at the same time making it half what it was before. Under the circumstances, that is a very reasonable proposition. The duty on stearine has been fixed, at&#189;d. Stearine is one of the raw materials of the candle-making industry. It is proposed that paraffine wax shall be placed upon the same footing. Otherwise paraffine would come into competition with stearine. It is useless to impose a duty of&#189;d. per lb. upon stearine if there is a lower duty upon paraffine wax which comes into competition with it. With the exception of the making of the stearine, candle manufacturing is little more than a matter of moulding. It is the stearine-making that is the important industry. The industry is one that involves the consumption of our own products and the use of a most expensive plant, as well as the employment of a large number of men. Therefore, it seems to me that we should accept the compromise offered, and make the duty&#189;d. per lb. </para>

                    <para>- I must oppose the motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. In doing so, I wish to say, first of all, that if the duty on paraffine wax be made&#188;d. per lb. it will work out at about the same as the duty of&#189;d. on stearine. In each case, translated into percentages, the duty ranges between 12&#189; and 14 per cent. Because paraffine wax is the raw material in the manufacture of some kinds of candles, we think that it ought to be imported at as low rates as possible. I voted originally for the reduction of the duties on stearine and paraffine wax because I thought that the manufacture of candles ought not be allowed to become a monopoly, or at any rate ought not to be entirely in the hands of very large manufacturers. On the previous occasion the motion for the reduction of the duty was carried on the voices. It would have been carried by a very large majority if there had been a division. It was recognised that a reduction of the duty was fair to the small manufacturers. I consider that it is our duty to insist that the duty on paraffine wax shall not be more than&#188;d. per lb. One other consideration that touches the item is that whereas stearine is a necessary material in candle making for some climates, paraffine wax is almost an essential in other climates. In other words, the use of stearine in candle making is desirable in hot climates, and the use of paraffine wax in cold climates. These are excellent reasons for insisting upon uniformity in the rates imposed, and the duty we request with regard to paraffine wax is exactly the same <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> as a duty of&#189;d. per lb. on stearine. </para>

                    <para>- I have looked into this matter carefully from information supplied to me by the candle-makers of Victoria and the other States, and I find that the very existence of the smaller manufacturers would be in the hands of the large manufacturers of stearine if the duty on paraffine wax were fixed at&#189;d. per lb. The information supplied to me shows that the smaller manufacturers of South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania would certainly be squeezed out of existence, and they represented strongly to me that side of the question. The Senate on a previous occasion agreed to a reduction of the duty on stearine to&#189;d. per lb. That was done largely on the representations of the smaller candle- makers. It also has to be remembered that paraffine wax is a very important ingredient in the manufacture of a certain class of candles, and that the article produced from this material is quite as good for illuminating purposes, and often for some purposes better even than candles made from stearine. I find that a duty of &#189;d. per lb. on stearine would amount to 12&#189; per cent., whilst the importing charges would be another 12&#189; per cent., so that the duty would really amount to an impost of 25 per cent. A duty of&#189;d. on paraffine wax would just amount to double that of &#189;d. on stearine, because paraffine wax is just half the price of stearine. Consequently if the duty were fixed at&#189;d., the manufacturers who use paraffine wax could not exist. Since the last discussion I have interviewed the same parties, who assure me that if this&#189;d. is imposed on paraffine wax, it will have the effect of driving the trade of candle-making into the hands of the large manufacturers. That is not a result that the committee should be disposed to permit. I trust therefore that we shall adhere to our former decision, which is a fair one. </para>

                    (Queensland).- There is a good deal of force perhaps in the arguments advanced by those who are opposed to accepting the compromise suggested by the House of Representatives. They think it would be unreasonable to adopt that proposal in the interest of the smaller manufacturers of candles. But is there any likelihood of the other Chamber backing down and not adhering to their proposal % There should be no haggling about this matter, for, although I think the Senate might very well take up a strong stand in regard to several of its requests, this is not one in which we should be justified in doing so. I favoured the request when it was originally made because I thought it was fair, but the spirit of compromise should prevail. The House of Representatives have met us fairly in regard to some of the requests, and I do not think this a matter of sufficient importance to justify us in taking up a hostile attitude.

                    are unanswerable. They are logical and fair, and, as we can stand upon such firm ground, we are justified in asking another place to reconsider their decision.

                    <para>. - Reference has been made to the protectionist aspect of this duty, but we know that it is not a protective one, because there is no local manufacture of paraffine to be protected. The Government think the duty reasonable, for undoubtedly paraffine comes into competition with stearine, which is manufactured here. The duty of1d. per lb. has been reduced to&#189;d., so that the protection which the Government proposed to give to the manufacturers of stearine has been reduced by one half. As pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood,</inline> paraffine is a much lower-priced article than stearine ; and, therefore, if the duty is the same as that upon stearine, the percentage is much larger. The fact that it is a much cheaper article than stearine should afford some reason for checking its importation. If the local manufacturers of stearine are to have any protection we shall certainly help to secure that protection by imposing a duty upon an article which comes directly into competition with their produce. Tallow, a natural product, of which Australia will always have a superabundance, is used in the manufacture of stearine, and, where we can do so, it is desirable that we should encourage in every possible way the conversion of our own raw products into articles of a more valuable form. It is undesirable that we should, by fixing a very low duty, encourage the importation of an article which comes into direct competition with something which is manufactured from our own natural products. It was estimated that a duty of1d. per lb. on paraffine would yield &#163;10,652 for six months, so that at the same rate of importation the revenue obtained from the duty of&#189;d. would be over &#163;5,000, and the difference between the revenue from the duty suggested by the Senate and that from the duty proposed by the House of Representatives would be between &#163;2,000 and &#163;3,000 a year This is not a question upon which we should talk about &#34; backing down,&#34; and so forth. The general feeling throughout this Chamber, and, indeed, throughout the country, is that these matters should be compromised. There is a very general opinion in the country that, above all things, it is desirable that the Tariff should be settled as speedily as possible. </para>

The Government proposal in another place, that the request of the Senate be not made, was defeated by a majority of two, and the modification now before us was made. In view of that fact, what hope can there be of getting our original request carried <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The matter has been thoroughly debated in another place, and a majority have come to a certain decision there, which I am prepared to accept. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt I should be justified, from the protectionist stand-point, in urging that the original duty proposed by the Government should be adopted. I think honorable senators should make up their minds in regard to what they intend to do. They ought to be satisfied of the position which they propose ultimately to take. There should be no sham fighting. If honorable senators feel that the Tariff should be settled quickly, and the public mind satisfied as to the form it will take, we should dispose of it as speedily as possible. We can only dispose it by being reasonable, and when the House of Representatives has met us in a spirit of compromise, we should agree to the proposed compromise. If we had reached the requests with which the House of Representatives had disagreed, I could have understood the attitude taken up by certain honorable senators, but it is unreasonable for them to waste time in this way at the present stage. </para>

            <para class="block">Why should fruit growers not have the benefit of a reasonable amount of protection ? When the Senate is met half way, as it has been, by the House of Representatives, there ought to be a disposition to agree to the modification. We have many items of great importance to discuss, and if we begin rejecting small modifications of this character, what chance will there be of the two Houses coining to an agreement? Equally strong opinions are held by the members of both Houses, and we ought not to insist on our minor requests to the uttermost farthing. On the first occasion such items as these were discussed from the free-trade or from the protectionist point of view, but now another element enters, inasmuch as- in the interests of the community, the two Houses ought to come to a reasonable settlement. Speaking with the utmost possible respect of the Senate, I say that unless some disposition is shown to meet the other House half way in matters of this kind, we cannot expect progress to be made on more important items. . </para>

                    <para>- I think that we ought to insist on the reduction of duty which we requested. A penny per lb. on tinned meat is a quite sufficient tax to place upon those who can get no other kind of food on the gold-fields. It was decided by a substantial majority of the committee that the duty should be 1d., and we ought to adhere to our decision. </para>

                    <para>- To my mind, it is more than ever important that we should endeavour to get the duty on these articles reduced to1d. per lb. The price of meat is going up all over Australia. It is impossible to foretell to what height it may rise. Very soon it will be impossible for persons in many parts of Australia to get fresh meat. Whether they like tinned meat or not, it will be the only class of meat that they can. get. I am convinced that we shall not be doing our duty to Australia unless we do our best to get this duty reduced to1d. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> is a sound one that in framing the Tariff we should be influenced by the very exceptional circumstances of the country at the present time. We have reason to believe that the drought is not likely to be of long continuance. According to the indications we have received, we have reason to hope that it is about to break up, and then the scarcity of meat, which we all deplore so much, will be overcome, and prices will become normal. In the meantime, seeing that prices are abnormally high, it would be very unwise for us to be influenced by that consideration in framing a Tariff which we hope will stand for a great many years. A duty of1&#189;d. per lb. is a very fair compromise. A lower rate of duty would affect, to a certain extent, our meat preserving industries. We are quite able to tura out enough preserved meat to supply all the wants of Australia. It is not necessary to go outside Australia for a single tin of meat. </para>

                        <para>- It is very desirable that we should have a duty. What difference will&#189;d. per lb. make in the price of meat in outlying places? With a duty of l&#189;d. per lb., will the price of tinned meat be less than the price of fresh meat ? I do not think that a duty of Hd. per lb. can be found fault with by the consumers of preserved meat. It is quite right that the established industries should get some sort of protection. The duty will mainly fall on special articles which are imported in a preserved form, and not on the general article of preserved meat, which is consumed so largely by miners and others in outside districts. I hope that this will be accepted as a compromise. I can hardly imagine a fairer compromise. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - If meat, fish, poultry, and game are fresh, smoked, or preserved by cold process they are dutiable at1d., but if they happen to be placed in air-tight vessels, including the weight of. the tins, they are subject to a duty of 1&#189;d. The original proposal of the Government was to charge a duty of 2d. The Senate failed to see any reason why there should be a difference in the duty on the two classes. We made a very fair proposal when we asked the other House to put all these articles in exactly the same position. I hope that the committee will see its way to recognise that no distinction should be drawn.

Special classes of fish and game will be imported, and that food is only used by persons who have cultivated special tastes. I agree that the duty ought &#39;to be fixed at1d. per lb., but I do not think that the item is important enough to quarrel over. I hope that the time will come when, if labour is a little more experienced, we shall be able to preserve our own fish and game. We are very much behindhand in that respect.

                    <para>- I hope that the committee will not be led to think that these are articles of luxury simply because they are described as &#34; poultry and game.&#34; On the goldfields, I and others did not think that these were articles of luxury. When we got tired of one kind of &#34; tinned dog,&#34; as it was called, it was simply a question of getting a supply of tinned game or poultry. But one article was just as objectionable to the miner as the other. It is only necessity which compels the people in the inhospitable interior of the continent to use these articles. I shall be no party to increasing the cost of living to those persons in the deserts of Australia, who in their occupations derive no protection from the Tariff. They have no right to be called upon to bear a burden of this kind. On the sea-board the people can procure all the luxuries of civilization, especially fresh meats, without much trouble. I believe that the Western Australian duties on Inter: State goods will be removed before the end of the year. But in the meantime I hope that the committee will insist upon the articles contained in this item being made duty free. This Ls merely a revenue duty, and therefore I hope that the protectionists will see their way to insist upon these articles being placed in the list of .special exemptions. </para>

                    <para>- The wording of this item is calculated to mislead, and evidently it has misled <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> with reference to fish, which is provided for in two other parts of the Tariff. Smoked or preserved fish comes in at a &#39;duty of Id. per lb., while fish preserved in tins or air-tight vessels is also dutiable at Id. per lb. The word &#34; fish &#34; ought not to appear in this item, because apparently all fish is dutiable at Id. per lb. We are really left to consider whether the action of the other House is reasonable or unreasonable in respect o&#163; meats, poultry, and game. In my opinion, . the question really before the committee is the possibility of the introduction of tinned meat from New Zealand - an extremely unlikely possibility - and the introduction of a number of luxuries. Unquestionably, this item includes more largely luxuries than perhaps does any of the other food product line in the Tariff. It is intended to cover game, poultry, <inline font-style="italic">pate</inline><inline font-style="italic">de</inline><inline font-style="italic">foie</inline><inline font-style="italic">gras,</inline> and all sorts of extravagant articles. It covers boned pheasants, preserved grouse, and all the paraphernalia of the swell hotel, club, and household. I shall not assist to create a difficulty between the Houses over the question o&#163; imposing a duty of <inline font-style="italic">Id.</inline> per lb. on those articles. There may , be differences&#39; of opinion as to what constitutes a free-trader, but, at any rate, I have been regarded as a free-trader throughout the whole of my political life. But I do not consider that when the Tariff imposes heavy duties on many articles of absolute necessity there is any reason why, as a free-trader, I should desire to create trouble between the two Chambers over a question of id. per lb. upon what are eminently articles of luxury. I shall vote -for the proposal that the proposition submitted to us by the other Chamber be accepted. I was extremely disappointed that the last item was disposed of while I was absent from the Chamber, attending to some correspondence. When I returned I found that the item of vegetables and fruit had been allowed to go by the board. That having been done, I cannot be a party to insisting upon a lower rate of duty being imposed upon luxuries. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the committee will not agree to any course of action that will cause dissension between the two Houses of the Legislature with regard to this item. I urge that consideration to some extent for the reasons advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> It has been suggested by some of the representatives of Western Australia that this is a commodity which is very much, required in their State, and that by imposing the higher duty of l&#163;d. per lb., those who us&#39;e tinned fish in that State will be penalized. I do not pretend to speak about the requirements of that particular portion of Australia, but I can tell the committee that in regard to the particular portion: of the item embraced under the heading of fish, works have been established in the State which I represent, for &#39; the preserving and. canning of fish. The people interested in those works formerly considered that the market open to them was not sufficiently large, but in consequence of the establishment of federation and InterState free-trade . they have thought it desirable to extend their works. I refer particularly to the works established at St. Helens, on George&#39;s Bay, and to other works that have been established at. Hobart, since the introduction of the Federal Tariff, for the purpose of preserving a great deal of the fish that is to be found swarming round the coast of Tasmania. The products of the works at George&#39;s Bay have been reported upon most favorably by various persons who are capable of expressing an opinion on such matters, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morton,</inline> one of the fisheries commissioners of Tasmania, and by other authorities who do not belong to that State. With regard to meats, I have heard recently that since the introduction of the Federal Tariff, certain of the persons who have been interested in the New Zealand meat industry have transferred, or contemplate transferring, a portion of their capital to Queensland, for the purpose of endeavouring to supply the Australian home demand.. That information is supplied to me by a representative of one of the Queensland houses. I do not personally vouch for its accuracy, but probably honorable senators from Queensland may take the cue from what I have said, and, if the information is accurate, will support my statement. </para>

                        <para>- I must accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> statement. I can only leave him to reconcile his denial with <inline font-style="italic">Bansard</inline> when the report of his most intelligent utterances appears in print. I hope he will pay particular attention to his speech when he sees it to-morrow. Evidently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has never had occasion to eat tinned fish.. He has no knowledge of our necessities in other parts of Australia, and talks of tinned fish as a luxury which is only used in hotels. I deny that. It is preposterous for any honorable senator to make -a statement of that sort, when by inquiry he could find out that tinned meats are absolute necessaries in 50 percent of the households of Australia, in consequence of the drought. At present the drought shows no sign of breaking up. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> takes what I consider to be a sanguine view of the prospects when he says it is already breaking up. It is true that we have had rain&#39;, but it would take a great deal of rain to thoroughly break up the drought. For this reason I deprecate his appeal to the committee not to insist. I gather that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> takes exception to my remark that the duty imposed by the Tariff on tinned fish is only Id. Evidently the honorable and learned senator has not read far enough, and does -not see that the Tariff was amended as from the 3rd April, 1902. Tinned fish were left in this particular line up to the 3rd April, 1902, when the duty was fixed at Id. per lb. Item 36 sets forth that the duty on &#34; preserved fish in tins or other airtight vessels, including the weight of contents &#34; - and, I may add, the weight of the tins and the solder, is Id. per lb. </para>

                    <para>- I sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in regard to attacks made upon him by embryonic legislators. In regard to this item, I find, that another place agreed to our request that frozen meat should be free, and when they came to deal with another request relating to the same item, a compromise was agreed to on the voices. The free trade party in the House of Representatives, have agreed to the item as it now appears before us, . but honorable senators like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> who are anxious to have their potted ham and chicken imported and admitted at the lower rate of duty, wish to create further trouble. They take up the attitude that we ought to object to the whole of this Tariff, because we cannot get cheaper potted chicken for our tables all the year round. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> wishes to protect the pioneer. If he made inquiries, he would find that there are a number of meat-preserving establishments in Queensland which will be able, as soon as the Inter-State narrow, partisan, parochial duty is removed - a duty imposed by legislators of a similar type - to give the pioneers as much cheap tinned meat as they require. I hope that we shall not say that we are going to hang up the Tariff in the interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson&#39;s</inline> potted game. </para>

As a matter of administration, it has been deemed advisable to make the exclusion as an act of justice to the manufacturers of the bags.

                    <para>- Though the item cannot be described as very important, it does possess a certain amount of importance. This is a matter in which I know what I am talking about. So far as the substitution of 7 per cent, for 1 per cent, is concerned, the other House might just as well have said that it should be 17 per cent. In the Tariff as it reached the Senate there was no clear definition as to what was meant by manganese steel parts. The department had decided, as an act of administration, that the only manganese steel parts which could properly claim exemption from duty were those sent out by an English firm called Hadfield&#39;s. That is the only firm in the world which was getting the exemption while every other firm had to pay duty. The reason for that differentiation was that the department had accepted it as a fact that Hadfield&#39;s steel parts were manganese steel parts. That is a very wide and vague definition. The object of the Amendment I moved was to set the doubt at rest, and to say that any steel parts were manganese steel parts if they contained 1 per cent, of manganese. The result of that amendment would have been to enable battery owners to buy the necessary parts of a battery from some other firm besides Hadfield&#39;s. If we accept the amendment to substitute 7 for 1 per cent, we shall be continuing a monopoly, because, so far as foreign manufacturers are concerned, there are none except Hadfield&#39;s which would come in. These parts are used chiefly in gold batteries. If we wish to hand over purchasers to Hadfield&#39;s, a provision for 7 per cent, of manganese will accomplish that object. I do not know whether the Administration have had manganese steel parts broken up and analyzed, but they accept the statement from Hadfield&#39;s because they manufacture under a patent that their manganese steel parts do contain this percentage. They deny that any other manufacturer in </para>

If we wish to do right in small matters we ought not to agree to the insertion of the words &#34;7 per cent.&#34; If we wish to avoid any semblance of lrypocrisy we should adopt 10 per cent. When I moved my amendment I was advised, and I believe well advised, by expert authority that 1 per cent, of manganese was sufficient for the purpose, and it was agreed to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> who was then in charge of the Tariff. </para>

He persuaded the committee to agree to the request because the ordinary bushman uses some very precious kind of wood in his axe handle - hickory I believe he said. I suppose that what he was thinking of were the prize contests in Tasmania among the axemen, who, no doubt, use axes with hickory handles. We should not alter the Tariff to enable these competitors to get cheap axe handles. There is no reason why an ordinary axe handle should not be made here. I am informed that hundreds of them are made. It is quite absurd to suppose that the handles for other tools cannot be made here. There are not a great many ways in which&#39; we give protection to the man in the woods who works up timber in various forms. I think it is too liberal, to fix the duty at 15 per cent. But still, as it has been done by the other House, I think the concession of 5 per cent, might very well be accepted here. It was really under a misapprehension that the committee agreed to its request that these handles should be placed on the free list, and now that the matter is made clear, I hope it will see that justice is done to those who make these handles.

A good bushman will use one axe handle very often for - more than a week. If he is using his axe? every day perhaps his handle will last for two or three weeks.

                    (Tasmania).- While. I shall not insist upon a division on this, item, I am not disposed tacitly to adopt an attitude of compromise with, regard to.- all these proposals. Fortunately we are getting to the end of the list of suggestions which have been partly accepted, but there may be others of a similar kind in the future. I do not like compromises very much, and ana not going to accept such a proposal because it is made as a compromise, particularly when it has been framed by the party opposed to me. While I do not intend to call for a division, I would point out that by accepting what is proposed we shall be making composition belting pay a duty of 15 per cent., whilst other mining machinery pays 10 per cent. What I particularly object to is the use of the word &#34; compromise &#34; as an absolutely irresistible argument.

It also suggested a reduction of the duty on ale and porter in bulk, from1s. to10d. In regard to both duties, the House of Representatives has refused to accept the suggestion of the Senate. I urge the committee not to press the request, for the reason that, in the first place, it has been estimated that the loss of the revenue from the reduction would amount to something between &#163;20,000 and &#163;24,000 a year: We are not in a position in which we can afford to lose that amount of revenue. </para>

                        <para>- The loss will be very heavy upon those States which can ill afford it. It may be said that a reduction of the duty will lead to increased importations. It may be so to a certain extent, but what, would be the consequence ? In the first place, the increased importations would not be sufficient to make up the loss, and allowing for increased importations, there would yet be a loss of from &#163;20,000 to &#163;24,000 a year In addition to that, if there should be such an increased importation as to make good that loss, it would largely interfere with our own brewing industry . The position is clear that we must either lose this large amount of revenue or interfere very seriously with an industry giving employment to a large number of persons in the trade and in the different trades incidental to it. This is one of the articles which in all tariffs and in all circumstances have been held to be a proper subject for revenue, and above all things it is a proper subject for a duty in a Tariff such as this, under which we must secure revenue. I hope, therefore, that in the circumstances the committee will not press its request. </para>

                    <para>- I rise to ask the committee to insist upon the reduction which it has requested. I think I shall be able to give honorable senators information which will enable them&#39; to see that they should almost unanimously support the position which I take up. Some of the facts in relation to this item are rather startling in their significance. I do not understand the way in which the Government talk about the duty. It. almost appears to me that they must employ two sets of experts - one to supply them with information at the inauguration of the Tariff, and another set to supply them to-day with counter evidence. When the Tariff was originally introduced it was stated that the revenue anticipated from this big duty in New South Wales was &#163;50,000, notwithstanding the fact that at the lower rate of 6d. per gallon for beer in bulk, and 9d. per gallon for beer in bottle, New South Wales actually collected in 1900, &#163;53,470. Yet the Government anticipate that they will obtain only &#163;50,000 from these much higher duties. The Government gave us estimates at the inception of the Tariff discussion which were entirely different from those put forward by them to-day. They estimate that the duty on beer will yield &#163;150,000, and the committee will see that that amount, for every 3d., represents about &#163;25,000. Thus the Government seem to ask us to believe that if we take off 3d. per gallon we shall lose &#163;25,000. I suppose that if we were to take off two or three more threepences, the whole of the revenue would go <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> I propose to give the committee some information which will enable them to see at a glance that high duties on this article destroy the revenue obtained from it. I have always met the Government absolutely on the revenue side of their case. In New South Wales the duties were 6d. and 9d. per gallon on bulk and bottled beer respectively ; in Victoria they were10d. and1s. 3d. per gallon, and in New Zealand they were 2s. per gallon. In 1900, the consumption of imported beer in New South Wales was 1,651,600 gallons, in Victoria it was 553,474 gallons, and in New Zealand it was only 188,491 gallons. </para>

                        <para>- The revenue received during that year in the respective colonies was &#163;53,470, &#163;33,749, and&#163;18,849. To enable the committee to obtain a better grasp of this question I have cast out these figures on the basis of a population of 1,000,000. The result is extraordinary. On the basis of 1,000,000 in each case the consumption in New South Wales was equal to 1,215,000 gallons; in Victoria it was equal to 461,000 gallons, and in New Zealand it was equivalent to 231,000 gallons. The revenue collected was equal to &#163;39,000 per 1,000,000 people in New South Wales, &#163;28,000 in Victoria, and &#163;24,500 in New Zealand. </para>

                        <para>- Not absolutely, but I will supply the committee with some information which shows that it is due almost entirely to the difference in duty. It is clear from the figures I have just given that as rates are increased revenue is decreased. It is noteworthy that in every colony in which the duties on ale and beer were largely increased the result was to lower the consumption and reduce the revenue. In 1877 the consumption of imported beer in Victoria was 801,245 gallons. The duty was then only 9d. per gallon, and at that rate Victoria collected &#163;35,000 from the item. In 1888- and of course it must be remembered that that was a special boom year - Victoria consumed&#39; 1,403,771 gallons of imported beer, or three times the quantity consumed at the present day. In that year the duty was also 9d. per gallon, and the revenue was practically the same as that obtained in New South Wales. In 1892 the </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">Government, in order to obtain more revenue, raised the duty. The alteration was made in the middle of the year, a duty of1s. per gallon being fixed on beer in bulk, and1s. 6d. per gallon on bottled beer. The consumption for that year was only 985,381 gallons. For the next three years the rates remained the same, and the consumption dropped to 484,335 gallons in 1893, 483,786 in 1894, and 404,605 in 1895. In 1895 the Victorian Government found that they were losing revenue, and among other alterations then made in the Tariff was one affecting the duty on beer. With a view to bringing in more revenue, the Victorian Government deliberately proposed a reduction of the duty to the very rate which the Senate has suggested, namely, l0d. per gallon for beer in bulk, and1s. 3d. per gallon for beer in bottle. After 1895 the consumption of beer in Victoria gradually increased until in 1900 it amounted to 553,474 gallons, from which a revenue of &#163;33,749 was obtained. The fact is clear that tha enormous addition made to the old duty of 9d. per gallon destroyed the large importations into Victoria, and it is also clear that the small reduction of the duty made in 1896 brought back a small amount of that lost importation. If honorable senators refer to the report of the Victorian Tariff Board, which sat in 1894, they will find this paragraph - </para>
                <para>We think that a smaller duty will bring in a greater revenue, and in response to the general demand from both the wholesale and retail branches of the trade, we recommend a reduction. We do not think that imported beer enters into very close competition with Victorian beer, or that any injury will be done to the local industry. The decreased importation of the past year does not appear to have caused any increase of business in the breweries of the colony, and we do not think that the large importation which we believe will follow a decrease of the rates will cause any diminution of the output. </para>
                <para class="block">It was upon that report that the Victorian Government proposed the reduction I have named. The proposition that the reduction should be made was in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Best,</inline> now Chairman of Committees in the Senate, and I propose to give one or two brief extracts from the remarks which he made upon that occasion. Speaking of the increase in the duties, he said that - </para>
                <para>The result of this had been to cause a considerable decline in revenue. The increases of duty made in 1892 were not asked for by anybody, and since July, 1892, there had been a shrinkage of about 66 per cent, in the revenue from this source. </para>

                        <para>- The Government stated that, under their proposal, there would be a material reduction of revenue, and it is only reasonable to suppose that if the process were reversed, the revenue would be increased. In 1899 the various States collected on imported stimulants the sum of &#163;2,027,531, whereas the Federal Government estimate that in a normal year the revenue under this head will be only &#163;1,959,306. It is mainly in the matter of beer that there is a difference in the duties. For Victoria the Government estimated, when the Tariff was introduced, that the revenue would be &#163;33,500, notwithstanding the fact that with a lower duty in 1900 the revenue was &#163;33,749. While the Government propose . to raise the duty from1s. 3d. to1s.6d. per gallon, they do not expect to receive any more revenue. The rate has been doubled in New South Wales, and if importations are not effected, the revenue ought to be &#163;100,000, but all the Government contemplate receiving is &#163;50,000. If honorable members are in earnest in wishing to regard this matter from a revenue point of view, they will take note of these facts. </para>

                        <para>- I shall most decidedly proceed to a division. I have been supplied with some information from the Sydney agents for McEwan&#39;s ale, and I find that in 1899 the sales amounted to 541,000 gallons, in 1900 to 568,000 gallons, in 1901 to 526,000 gallons, and in the seven months which have expired of 1902, to only 148,000 gallons, showing, a falling off by more than one-half. That bears out the original estimate of the Government, that by doubling the duty one-half of the importations would be destroyed ; and, in the face of the declaration by the. head of the Government, that the object was &#34; revenue without destruction,&#34; this seems a strange state of affairs. If trade be destroyed by duties which are on the verge of being prohibitive, revenue must suffer, and my contention is that by sustaining the demand of the Senate, the revenue will be preserved. All that the Senate has asked is, that this duty may be placed at the high level of the Victorian duty, and the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> that a reduction of 3d. per gallon will mean a sacrifice of &#163;25,000 is altogether erroneous. </para>

                    <para>- I am always very dubious about figures, which can be employed to prove almost any fallacy. It is said that a reduction of the duty by 3d. per gallon in Victoria decreased the revenue, but it is quite forgotten that at that time Victoria was passing through a crisis, and the people had no money to spend on luxuries. After the duty had been lowered there was a revival in business, and more beer was drunk, thus making it appear that the reduction of the duty was the cause of the increased consumption. </para>

                        <para>- Considerably less imported beer may be consumed for the reason that the people are drinking more Australian wine and local beer. All the surrounding circumstances must be known before it can be said that a set of figures show that a certain result will follow certain conduct. Any reduction of duty which does not result in increased demand must cause a loss, and it cannot be pretended that a reduction equivalent to <inline font-style="italic">id.</inline> per bottle will increase consumption. I can understand a case in which the reduction of a duty may lower the price and benefit the consumer ; but, in the present instance, the only person who will benefit will be the importer, the manufacturer, or the publican. The poorer people drink bulk English ale, and any reduction such as that suggested cannot possibly make any difference in the price of a glass. A reduction can only result in a loss to the Treasury of an article which free-traders and protectionists alike have admitted is a fair subject for taxation. </para>

                        <para>- The excise is not the question at present. I can quite understand a duty being placed on a luxury to such an extent that consumption and revenue are killed. When Treasurer of South Australia, I fixed the duty on champagne at something like 12s. per gallon, and my successor, with the idea that he could raise more revenue, fixed the duty at 15s. The only result, however, was that he did not receive as much revenue as I had under the lower duty. The duty of1s. 6d. per gallon on bottled beer is fair, and, so far as I know, no one grumbles at it in South Australia. The reduction of the duty was one of the greatest mistakes ever made by the free- trade party. This was one of the first items on which that party elected to exercise their ingenuity ; and to show their power, they called a division, with the result that they decreased the revenue and inflicted an injury on the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- The consideration which weighed with the Senate on a previous occasion, and which, I believe, weighed with the other House, was whether more revenue would be obtained from the higher or lower duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has submitted some statistics which are strongly in favour of the contention that it would increase the revenue if we decreased the duty as we proposed. Is it a reasonable thing to say that we are going to throw away an amount of revenue from the duty on stimulants? Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has said that there is not very much relation between the local article and the imported article, nevertheless, there is some relation, and the excise duty was fixed at 2d. or 3d. per gallon the other day because the import duty had been reduced to ls. 3d. per gallon. That is a point which should be considered. My own idea is that we should get as much revenue as possible from this item. If I were convinced that the heavier duty would raise a larger revenue I should advise its acceptance. . So far as I can judge, our first proposition would be much better than that which is submitted by the Government. I regret that the Excise Tariff Bill has passed out of our control. Because if it were still before the Senate and an import duty of ls. 6d. per gallon on bottled ale and porter were imposed, I should have been prepared to support an increase of the excise duty. However, I am called upon to say whether ls. per gallon is not ample protection to the local manufacturers, and my inclination is to support the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline></para>

The public will not get the benefit of the difference between ls. 6d. and ls. 3d. per gallon. I am honest enough to admit that it will go into my pocket.

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    may be true in one State, it may not be true in others. The committee ought to grasp the full significance of the figures which I used, and which show that with a big rate of duty the consumption was 231,000 gallons in New Zealand, 460,000 gallons in Victoria, and 1,215,000 gallons in New South Wales, increasing as the rate was reduced. One after another, each State increased the duties, with the result that the consumption fell. It may be true that here and there the amount of the reduction of a duty may not be immediately distributed to the customers, but it must come to them eventually. I have heard it said that so much a gallon is only &#163;d. per bottle. I believe that the majority of the consumers buy imported beer by the dozen, so that it represents a charge of 6d. per dozen. I am quite certain that a duty cannot be reduced without the public ultimately getting the benefit of the reduction. I cannot understand honorable senators failing to see the full force and significance of the facts I have submitted. No one has ventured to contradict or try to upset the conclusions which were arrived at by the Victorian Parliament, when, some five years ago, if decided to lower the rates to the very amounts of which the Senate has approved, in order to increase the revenue. This statement was made by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline>
                    and it has not yet been contradicted. Nor has any attempt been made to upset the original estimates brought in by the Government. When the Tariff was brought down, a statement was tabled in which the Government showed that they expected that their increased duties would decrease the importation immensely, and lead to a very large decrease in the revenue. If an increase of the rate will lead to a decrease in the revenue the converse must be true - &#39; that a decrease in the rate will lead to an increase in the consumption. I hope that the committee, recognising the force of the figures I have used, will adopt my suggestion.

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - This question appeals to me from a somewhat different stand-point. I understand that we have arrived at a stage at which we are making some concession to the other House. We have made known our requests ; we have had a very large number of them refused, and now we are trying to discover some method by which we may hope eventually to arrive at a mutual agreement. This is, I think, one of those items on which the committee might reasonably give way. I should have preferred that offers of compromise should come from the other Chamber, but as the Senate has decided to hold out the olive branch to the House of Representatives, I conceive that this is one of those items upon which that offer might well be made. The brewing trade of the Commonwealth is undergoing developments. The figures
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline>
                    quoted were for the year 1900, and, consequently, are somewhat out of date. In New South Wales, for instance, there has very lately been a great improvement in the brewing of lager beers. I believe that the taste for colonial ale is acquired. I never acquired it myself, and cannot speak from personal experience. But I have certainly noticed that where formerly English ales used to be placed before people under certain circumstances, it is now quite common for English ale to be shouldered out by the colonial article. That process is likely to continue to extend, particularly in view of the larger opportunities that the great brewers will have under Commonwealth conditions. Therefore, however reliable
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline>
                    figures may be in regard to the past,, they may be an unreliable guide to the future. This is one of the items upon which we might wisely give way if we are going to give way on any. I should have preferred the whole list of our requests to be forwarded again to the House of Representatives, and to let the offers of compromise come from them. But as the committee has decided upon following the opposite course, and I have to select those items upon which I think it is wise to give way, this matter appeals to me as one with regard to which the committee might very well concede what is asked for by another place.

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has contended that if the decision previously arrived at by the Senate is adhered to it will be likely to increase the importation of beer, and thus increase the revenue. The honorable senator has given us a host of figures, which I am not going to say are incorrect, but he draws the most peculiar conclusions from them. What is going to cause increased importation ? What is to induce the larger consumption ? Is it to take place in consequence of the lessened price ? In what way is the price to be reduced to the consumer <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Does the honorable senator believe that the consumers will get their beer cheaper by so much per pint or per glass? Is it possible for the price to be reduced to such an extent as to increase consumption ? The -whole operation of the increased duty will be in the interests of the importer and of the publican. It is perfect nonsense .to argue that the consumer will benefit from reducing the duty on beer. It is of no use attempting to blind the eyes of the people by such plausible and superficial arguments as have been advanced by my honorable friend. The reduction of the duty as proposed would lessen the revenue of Queensland to the extent of &#163;S,000 or &#163;9,000 a year. The people of that State are considerable consumers of beer. They drink about 5,000,000 gallons of locally brewed beer per annum, besides a large quantity of imported beer and porter. But the reduction of the duty would not increase the importation of beer into Queensland to the extent of a gallon, though it would increase the profits of importers and of the publicans, who will take care that the extra profit goes into their own pocket. It is perfect moonshine to attempt to gull the public with the idea that they would benefit from such a proposal as that made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Pulsford. </para>

                    has favoured us. During the discussion on this subject, I have never once referred to any desire on the part of the local brewers of&#34; beer to make extra profits. It has been left for

                    to say that I have been acting solely in the interests of the importers. I draw attention to this gratuitous assertion and say, that . it is uncalled for.

                    should endeavour to insist upon his proposal, seeing that he regards himself as a revenue tariffist. The original request of the Senate was for the reduction of the duty from1s. 6d. to1s. 3d. per gallon for bottled beer, and from 1s. to10d. upon bulk beer. The difference to the importer would be nothing more nor less than the difference between from&#189;d. to&#188;d. per half-pint. During the course of a recent visit to Tasmania I had some conversations with persons interested in importing these commodities, and they told me that the difference in the duty would be pocketed by themselves, the importers. They admitted that the revenue would lose absolutely by the reduction. Even assuming that the duty upon imported bottled beer were reduced by&#189;d. per quart, is it likely that the hotel-keeper would charge the consumer so much less, and that the demand for imported beer would therefore be so much greater ? Certainly not.

I hope that, for the sake of the revenue, the committee will not insist upon maintaining its original attitude.

                        <para>- The difference would be so slight, that it is not worth considering. The point of view from which I think this matter should be regarded is the incidence of the duty. As honorable senators are aware, there is a vast difference between the prices of the different kinds of cigars - probably a larger difference than there is in regard to many articles which are a luxury. There is the difference between the 3d. cigars, which work out at something like 2s. id. to 4s. 6d. per lb., and the more expensive kind of cigar, which varies in price from something like 1 2s. to about 18s. per lb. It is obvious that the effect of the fixed duty of 6s. 3d., and the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 15 per cent., is to make the higher - priced cigar pay a great deal more than does the lower-priced one. On the other hand, the effect of the duty requested by the Senate would be to press much more heavily upon the lower quality, which is most generally purchased, and to press comparatively lightly upon the higher-classed article. So far as we have been able to lay down any principle in regard to these things, we should adjust the burden of taxation so that it will fall more heavily upon the more expensive article and less heavily upon the less expensive article. It may be asked, &#34; Why not have an ad valorem duty all round ? &#34; In the first place, the reason is that the revenue would fail, because the duty on the lower-class article would not return very much revenue, while there would also be difficulties about collecting it, and about declaring values which we do not wish to encounter to a greater extent than is necessary. The effect of the Senate&#39;s proposal, while not increasing the revenue, would be to place a comparatively heavier portion of the burden upon the lower class of cigar, and a comparatively lighter burden upon the higher-class article. That is not as it should be. </para>

                        <para>- It does not, for the reason that the prices of cigars vary very much. The Victorian statistics for 1900, which may be taken as a guide, show that there were 168,000 lbs. of Havana cigars imported into this State during that period. Of that quantity 51,000 lbs. were valued at &#163;47,000, or something like 18s. per lb., so that out of the 168,000 lbs., nearly one-third was of the value of about 18s. per lb. That shows that a large proportion of the cigars which are imported are of the higher quality. What reason is there why that large proportion should not pay a heavier duty ? If we impose the fixed duty of 7s.&#39; per lb. all round, we shall levy upon them exactly the same duty as we charge upon the remaining two-thirds - representing the cheaper kind of cigars - which are imported. Therefore, from the point of view of the proper incidence of this tax, the amendment suggested &#39;by the Senate should not be made. There is another consideration. The operation of the duty, if amended as requested, would certainly be to give the Australian cigar - what we have generally described as the 3d. cigar - a very much larger amount of protection than, perhaps, my honorable friends of the Opposition intend. It would give a protection of something like 4s. a pound upon the ordinary Australian 3d. cigar. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> who moved this request, and it was his intention that the excise should be increased. An attempt was made to do that when the Excise Bill was before us, but without success, with the result that the lower class of cigar would be left&#39; with certainty a very much higher rate of protection than it enjoyed before. Whether that was the intention or not, the whole question may be summed up in a nutshell. The revenue would not be affected by this alteration, but the incidence of the tax would be affected, and affected in a direction which, I submit, would violate the well-recognised rule that the more luxurious articles should pay the higher duty. For these reasons, I say, that, looking at the matter upon its merits, the request should not be pressed. There is another reason why the motion should be carried. We have now come to the position, that majorities in both Houses have fought strenuously about this duty. If each House holds to its own opinion, agreement will be impossible. One or the other must give way, and in the interests of the public it is our duty to come to an agreement of some kind. As there is nothing to be gained by the revenue, or by the consumer, is it worth while, merely for the sake of sweeping away this composite duty, to press this request. If honorable senators will analyze the reasons which actuated them in making this request, they will see that that which seemed to have the most prominence was that this was the last of the composite duties left in the Tariff, and that, therefore; it ought to be struck out. Now that we have reached .this position, and that there is another and bigger issue involved, which was not involved before, I would ask honorable senators to consider whether it is worth while to disturb the adjustment of taxation, to give more protection than was intended to be given, and to make this alteration, for no substantial reason except that it may be to deal a blow at the system of composite duties. In this case, a composite duty does no harm. </para>

                        <para>- In the United States composite duties were placed on cigars, and they killed the trade. I am in a position to know that that was the effect. The honorable and learned senator&#39;s argument based upon the inequality of a fixed duty upon articles of varying value, is no doubt very accurate in a general sense, but I would appeal to him to say whether it is not a fact that almost without exception the fixed duties in this Tariff will operate most unevenly in respect of the values of articles. For instance, we have the same duty on wine whether the wine is worth many shillings per quart or only many pence. I could apply the argument to a great many other items in the Tariff. What about sugar ? We have a uniform duty on sugar no matter what the value of it may be. </para>

                        <para>.- Perhaps the difference is not quite so great ; but there is another proposition which I should like honorable senators to consider. A composite duty on cigars amounts to so heavy a sum that it is practically impossible for importers to pay it and take the goods out of bond. In Sydney, and I presume the practice is the same in Melbourne, cigars are sold in bond more largely than is any other article. During the recent adjournment of the Senate, I had an opportunity in Sydney of seeing the ill -effects of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty on cigars. I was shown correspondence threatening legal proceedings, arising out of the fact that when an importer sells cigars in bond there is at once a great rumpus raised by the buyer about the difference between the declared value at the time of import and the value at the time of sale, the latter being necessarily much higher. The value of the goods as declared is the value at the place of export, plus 10 per cent, to cover charges. But that percentage does not by any means cover charges ; and, according to the papers shown to me, the total cost of importation amounted to something like 48 per cent. Fraud was alleged against the merchant who sold the cigars, but after much correspondence the solicitors for the buyer were finally satisfied and withdrew all allegations and apologized. But the unfortunate importer was compelled to disclose to the buyer every stage of the business, and it is very undesirable that, by introducing <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties on goods which can scarcely be dealt with out of bond, we should give rise to allegations of dishonesty and threatened law suits. One of the greatest troubles with which commerce can be inflicted is that of legal proceedings ; and to avoid litigation the importer is compelled to disclose all the details of his business, thus acquainting the buyer, without cost or trouble to the latter, with knowledge which has been gained by costly experience. </para>

                        <para>.- No ; the importer has to disclose his shipping charges, freights, and every detail of the transaction&#39; and that took place in the case which was brought under my notice. As showing the effect of this, the importer said to me - &#34; I have always been a bit of a free-trader, but if this is going to be the sort of thing I am to be subjected to, I am prepared, at the first general election, to write a cheque for &#163;100 in aid of the funds of the New South Wales free-trade party.&#34; It will be seen how much an importer is affected when he breaks out in that manner, not so much in defence of any particular principle as in defence of his rights as a trader. I am. not discussing whether or not such an attitude is reasonable, but it affords an instance of the importance of this question to a man who has not hitherto worried himself very much about fiscal matters. When the specific duty was introduced I had great doubts as to whether ! should vote for it, and I pointed out that it would fall more heavily on the cheaper article. I recognise this still, but I take it that under the excise laws we are enlarging the local output of cigars of the cheaper class, and according to the arguments we have heard used, the specific duty will not operate to the detriment of the consumer of those goods. I do not think that the quantity of the more costly, cigars is a serious matter, because we are told by the Government that the alteration in the method of paying the duty will practically make no difference in the amount of the revenue. For the reasons I have given, and for other reasons which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> without waiting for the attack, answered as well as circumstances permitted, I hope the Senate will abide by its previous decision. I voted with the Government in the last division, and if I am against them in the present instance, it is an evidence of my absolute fairness and freedom from party feeling. </para>

                        <para>- But why does it become necessary for this House to give way? Why should the other House not give way just as readily 1 The Senate has endeavoured to meet the Government proposal very fairly. According to some figures supplied me by a senator, it appears that the average value of cigars imported into Victoria in 1897-S-9 - and it may be taken as the average value in the other States - was 7s. 7d. per lb. In the first instance; the Government proposed a duty of 5s. 6d. per lb. and 15 per cent., but that was afterwards raised to 6s. 3d. per lb. and 15 per cent. Taking the average value of the cigars at 7s. &#39; 7d., and the Government proposal at 6s. 3d. per lb. and 15 per cent., it would raise the price of the duty on the cigars to about 7s. 1-Jfd. The committee, in dealing with this matter before, realized how&#39; close that would be, and proposed to increase the 6s. 3d. to 7s. per lb., without an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. Virtually there was an attempt made to give the Government the very revenue which they sought to obtain, and which they are now seeking. The Senate has already approached the House of Representatives with this modified proposal which might well have been accepted. </para>

                        <para>- I am nob theorizing. I am replying to the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> which was indorsed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> that with a fixed duty the lower grade of cigars will pay the higher duty. But the same argument might be used in regard to any other article of which there is more than one quality. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> pointed out, merchants average, and so I have averaged the value of the cigars imported during the years mentioned. The Senate has already met the House of Representatives, it is undesirable to have <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties, and, excepting in the present instance, specific duties have been preferred. If <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties were a disfigurement on the Tariff in regard to other articles, they are equally a disfigurement in regard bo this particular article. As it is admitted that it would involve no loss of revenue, we might very well get rid of this <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, even although the bax would press a little more heavily on the cheaper than on the dearer cigars. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to make a statement in reply to what has been put forward by Senators Neild and Gould. In the- first place I propose to put into figures an argument I used just now as to the difference in the incidence of the duty which is brought about by this suggestion. When the Bill came to the Senate all cigars were subject to a duty of 6s. 3d. per lb., and 15s. percent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> On the cheap cigars - what are commonly called the threepenny cigar - the duty amounted to 6s. Sd. per lb. On the expensive cigars, which rise in value to 18s. per lb., the duty amounted to 8s. 6d. per lb. Under the suggestion which is now made, an additional 4d. per lb. would be charged on the cheaper cigar, and ls. 6d. per lb. less on the dearer cigar. </para>

                        <para>- I. am dealing, not with the position of the retailer, but with the position of anybody who deals in cigars. It is impossible to say that, by any system, you can make any average between the lower and the higher priced cigar which will relieve the cause of that incidence. With regard to the clearer cigar, about a third of the imports into Victoria averaged in value 18s. per lb. Is it right to shift the entire incidence of the duty so that, instead of the bulk of the revenue being collected on the higher class of cigar, which may be described as a luxury, it should be collected on the lower-priced cigars ? There is no doubt that in every case when goods -are bought in bond there must be a certain disclosure of the value. I do not know the details of the case to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> referred, but I know what is the law, and I have ascertained what is the practice in the Customhouse. All that it is necessary for a bonded certificate to disclose are the marks on the packages, the lj umber of packages, the ship by which they came, and the invoice value, free on board. In a case where the Customs authorities are not satisfied that the importer <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> declaring the true value they have the right to make full inquiries, and then the importer may be bound to disclose the most secret matters of business, but that information does not appear on the bonded certificate. A sale of goods in bond is very frequently, and,&#34; I think, generally, carried out by a sale of the bonded certificate. What the purchaser from the original importer sees and knows anything about is the bonded certificate. All we have to deal with is the position in which a person who sells cigars in bond is placed. All he -needs to disclose is what appears on the bonded certificate, and, to describe its contents in a few words, all it discloses is the invoice value of the goods. A great many importers object to disclose that information because they wish to make as big a profit as they can. But is there any reason why, in the interests of the public, in the interests of a fair adjustment of this taxation, the invoice value should not be made known ? Is there any reason why, in cases of cigars, that rule should not be applied? When the arguments of my honorable friends come to be boiled down, it is found that they object to 0the importer who sells the cigars being obliged to disclose the invoice price. 1 Is that any reason why we should take up the position of disagreeing with the conclusion which has been arrived at in the other House by a majority of eight ? The grounds which have been given certainly do not justify the committee in insisting on this alteration in the incidence of the duty. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>
                    (New South Wales). - The central objection to this composite duty is that it unnecessarily clashes with a long-established custom of trade. I cannot conceive that it is necessary to disturb the ordinary course of a merchant&#39;s business if it does not do any good to the Government. This statement about the 15 per cent, duty being imposed with a view to differentiate between the poor man and the other is a mere subterfuge, because the poor man does not buy cigars. Tobacco which is the poor man&#39;s smoke is subject to an import duty of only 3s. 3d. per lb., whereas cigars, at the rate which we propose, would all be subject to a duty of 7s. per lb. Surely that is a very fair differentiation, and does impose a very much heavier duty on the smoking material of the wealthy man? I do not think that there is any other case in the Tariff in which such a clear and satisfactory differentiation&#39; is made between the article used by the poor man and the article used by the rich man. The main objection to this duty on the part of the persons in the trade is that it lets their customers know the cost price. I can imagine that the case referred to by Senator1 Neild arose in this way. The merchant sold a certain quantity of cigars, and said that they cost so much. He might count what the cigars cost him in his warehouse, and reckon that he sold them at a reasonable advance on that price. But when the buyer went to clear them at the Custom-house it was found that there was another valuation, and the difference was so considerable that there was a quarrel. But the difference all the time had been a true difference. The value given to the Customs had been the cost price at Manilla or Havannah, wherever the goods had been brought. I hold in my hand a letter from a gentleman in the trade, who says -

                <para class="block">I do not see any reason, why, for no good to the State and the -revenue, we should legislate against the long-established custom of the trade. Surely, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> very clearly and ably explained, if a man has spent long years in finding out good sources of supply and, has got together a good trade, that is his property. It ought not te be lessened in value to him, and he ought not to be interfered with, especially if the State is to derive no benefit from the interference. It is admitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston,</inline> that there is nothing in what is proposed from the point of view of revenue, and that the 7s. is substantially the equivalent of 6s. 3d. and 15 per cent. Why, then, should this exaction be imposed on the cigar trade <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We are apt to be misled by the existence of a tax at per lb., but the duty of 7s. per lb. would mean that any person importing one ton of cigars would be liable to pay the Customs &#163;784. The consequence of this system is that cigars are almost universally sold in quantities in bond. The shipping value must be given to the Customs, and when the buyer in the adjoining State takes a quantity of them he has to be given that information, and he knows the margin of profit on which his seller is dealing. There is another point. It is the merest subterfuge in the world to say that this 15 per cent, enables a very satisfactory differentiation to be made between the respective values of cigars, and the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has made in this connexion is rather ridiculous. It is admitted that 15 per cent, is practically the equivalent of about 9d. per lb. Consequently, 6s. 3d. per lb. is equivalent to about 125 per cent. Now, 125 per cent., plus 15 per cent., is 140 per cent. That means that the Government propose a duty on cigars which is equivalent to an all-round <inline font-style="italic">ad vtdorem</inline> rate of 140 per cent. Yet they come to us and say - &#34; We will secure a fair charge as between low class and high class cigars by charging 15 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> and we will convert the 125 per cent, duty into a specific duty.&#34; Is not that ridiculous? Yet the Government say that they are making the rich man pay and letting the poor man off. The poor man is not affected much by the duty on cigars, but the differentiation between high class cigars and low class cigars is ludicrous. </para>

I submit, therefore, that there is nothing in this differentiation between the cost of high and low class cigars, and that there is a very strong reason, on the ground of the ordinary customs of the trade, why we should again ask the House of Representatives to agree with our request. I cannot conceive that if the other House were to thoroughly understand the real ground of objection to this duty, they would persist in not agreeing to our request. I rather believe that when the ground on which our request is based is made quite clear to them, they will at once accede to it. </para>

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - I thought I had made myself quite clear a few minutes ago, but as my honorable and learned friend the Vice-President of the Executive Council evidently did not understand me, I will give, without names, in a few words, the actual facts of the transaction to which I referred. A cigar merchant undertook to import and supply a certain quantity of cigars to a retail house. The price of the cigars was settled. The goods were imported, the bond certificate was handed over to the buyer, and the account was rendered for the price agreed upon. When the buyer went to pay the duty, he found there was such a difference between the price charged him and the declared value at the time of importation - which was the value at the place of shipment, plus the 10 per cent, to cover costs of importation - that he made, through his solicitors, accusations of fraud against the merchant. A very sultry correspondence ensued, and eventually the merchant avoided legal proceedings and got out of the accusations of fraud - and, let it be remembered, that there is nothing more detrimental to any business man than to be made the subject of charges of that sort - by disclosing full particulars to the buyer. He was compelled to disclose the sums he had had to pay as shipping charges, and the amounts that had been paid on each item of charges from the place of shipment to the time of delivery.

                        <para>- There was no fraud, but there was an allegation of fraud, because the difference between the selling value and the value at the port of shipment, plus 10 per cent., was so great that the buyer&#39;s solicitor wrote the letters which I have mentioned. As I have already pointed out, the transaction of business with foreign countries and in foreign languages is very much more costly than the transaction of business in one&#39;s own language, and in accordance with business customs that are well known. In this case the unfortunate merchant, after years of trouble spent in gaining his experience in competition with other people who knew as much, was called upon to disclose the name of every wharfinger and shipping agent and the maker of the cigars with whom he had done business, and to give the whole &#34;show&#34; away, to use a colloquial phrase ; so that the next time the retail dealer wanted to import a case of cigars, having learnt the way it was done, he could import them himself. It may be said that this was in the interests of the buyer, but wholly against the merchant, and we ought so to draw our laws as not to destroy the value of the knowledge that is so essential to a man of business. Good-will of a business consists of the knowledge of facts connected with the business. Large sums of money are sometimes paid for the goodwill of a business. The good-will of a newspaper consists largely of knowledge and connexion of the staff of agents who conduct its sale. It is a costly thing to gain this knowledge. We often find it placed in the &#34;balance-sheets of companies as an asset. Sometimes such knowledge is valued at thousands of pounds. 1 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood. - I am only astonished at the merchant giving up that information. </para>

                        <para>.- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> pointed out, it really amounts only to a difference of 9d per lb. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> and the Minister in another place stated that a fixed duty of 6s. 3d. per lb., together with 15 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, would practically produce the same result as would a fixed duty of 7s. per lb., without any <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. Therefore, my honorable and learned friend will see that on his own statement, in a practical and broad way, the 15 per cent, amounts only to 9d. per lb. That is the sole difference at issue - whether there should be a fixed duty of 7s. per lb., or a fixed duty of 6s. 3d. and an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 15 per cent., the 15 per cent, being a penalty on traders. With all deference to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, I think that he has not given sufficiently good reasons to induce me to alter my vote. </para>

In the first place they admit that the revenue under the duty suggested by them would be the same as that received under the Government proposal. They have to admit on the other hand that men who smoke the cheaper class of cigars, and who, we presume, are not so rich as those who smoke the higher grade, will be penalized to a certain extent. They have also to make another admission, which comes very strangely from free-traders, namely, that their proposal would absolutely increase the protective incidence of the duty.

                        <para>- We are not wild and rabid protectionists. I imagine that we would be described as moderate protectionists. We are not protectionists who have run mad as the free-traders appear to have done in certain directions. The Government have imposed what we believe to be a fair protection for the cigar-makers of the country, and yet honorable senators opposite propose that the duty should be altered so as to increase the amount of protection. According to the principles which they profess, honorable senators opposite are seeking to do what they ought not to do. There is really nothing in the suggestion that the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty is objectionable to the importer. I can thoroughly understand that importers who have been dealing with foreign countries, and who in the past have had simply to pay a fixed duty, do not like the idea of an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty, because they have been in the habit of transacting their business in bonded warehouses. That is to say they have bonded their imported cigars, and not attempted to sell them until they have been able to find a customer who wanted to take them out of bond. Having found that customer, they have been in the. habit of giving him a certificate, which he has simply presented at the Customhouse. But with an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 15 per cent, the importers have to declare the value of the cigars, or at all events what they put down as the value, which may be a very different thing. In that way a little information is gained by customers, which makes them very suspicious that in the past they have been grossly deceived in regard to the statements made. If we can do anything in the Tariff to keep people straight and truthful in their dealings one with another we ought to do it. My experience as a Treasurer administering a State Tariff is that <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties help the customer as against the importer in cases like this. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> assumes that the customer will gain by this system, and that the importer is the man who will lose. The customer will see the enormous profits that the importers have been making. </para>

                        <para>- No. I never placed any tax upon reapers and binders, and I have admitted that we made a great mistake in failing to do so. I do not mean to suggest that the South Australian Tariff was absolutely perfect. If I had to frame a new State Tariff, I should probably make it considerably different from that which I framed in 1887, because my increased knowledge would enable me to look at matters from a different stand-point. I am able to see the improvements which could have been made in the celebrated South Australian Tariff which formed the model of that presented originally in the House of Representatives. </para>

The duty will reduce the protective incidence, and that certainly ought bo appeal bo honorable senators opposite. It will also produce a little more revenue, which is likewise an advantage.

            <para>No doubt this amendment was suggested with a view of subsequently increasing the excise in order to obtain more revenue, as it was said, and to reduce the protective incidence of the duty. As the excise was not altered, the Senate&#39;s request really is that a higher duty should be imposed, which in the circumstances would not bring in more revenue, while it would give a greater protection to the cigarette-makers than ever was intended. </para>

We proposed that the duty should be increased so as to place it on a level with the duty upon cigars, and in the distinct hope that we should be able to increase the excise duty. As we failed to increase the excise, we must concur in what

                has said. If, however, there were any means by which, instead of increasing the duty from 6s. 6d. to 7s., it could be reduced to 5s., I should like to see that course adopted.

We do not observe any of the enthusiasm which was displayed over the last item. The man who can afford to smoke shilling cigars will be able to buy them much cheaper than he would have been able to buy them with the composite duty. Certain honorable senators battle only for the bottled beer and high-priced cigars, taking no trouble whatever about the plain and humble cigarettes.

            <para>This is principally, though not altogether, a question of protective incidence. A certain quantity of expensive hams from England and America will always be imported no matter what duty may be imposed, and as pointed out by the Treasurer a little while ago, the revenue collected on the basis of 3d. per lb. during the last twelve months will be &#163;6,000. If the duty be reduced it will be necessary to import 50 per cent, more in order to make up the revenue, and if that were done the importations would be so large as to seriously interfere with the local industry. I take it that the first consideration of my friends opposite is the interests of the consumer, and I ask whether those interests can, under ordinary circumstances, be in any way affected by the difference between 2d. and 3d. in the duty. </para>

                    <para>- Under ordinary circumstances, it can make no difference. Only when there is an extraordinary drought or other conditions which shorten local production will any increase in the price be caused. The only effect of the duty is to preserve the market for the local producer, and protect him from the occasional shipments of special lines which come in and disturb prices. The duty makes the market steady, and enables the local producer to invest with the certainty of a return. </para>

                    <para>- Not when the public are hard up, but when for some reason or other the supply runs short. It is better to have continuous protection which will operate permanently, and will not damage the consumer, than, in a condition of panic, to make an alteration which will apply during years and years of good production, merely for the sake of obtaining something cheaper in an occasional period of scarcity. It would be most unfortunate for Australian industries, and for the future of the Commonwealth, if we were to be guided by the exceptional circumstances of the present season, and refuse the reasonable amount of protection now proposed. </para>

                    <para>- The duty of 2d. was imposed for about twenty years in New South Wales, for the sole purpose of raising revenue. If we are imposing these duties simply from the point of view of revenue, let us fix them at such rates as are necessary for that purpose. Do not let us delude the public with the belief that we are preserving existing industries, when we are imposing merely revenue duties, and leaving the industries to be hampered and endangered by importations. There is, perhaps, no industry which affects to a larger extent the people of the country than that of pig raising and ham curing. It is an industry which is not carried on in great establishments, but as a general rule by small farmers and their families all over Australia. There is hardly a farming community which, under conditions at all suitable, does not make the industry a means of income. This is a question which ought to receive our most careful consideration. We ought not to propose a duty which is entirely insufficient for protective purposes, simply because an occasion has arisen which may give rise to a wish for the cheapening of the product. </para>

                    <para>- If we place the dutv at 2d., which was the rate in Victoria, where the people professed to have a scientific system of protection, we shall be meeting our protectionist friends as far as they can expect to be met. The honorable and learned gentleman says that the present time of . scarcity is exceptional, and therefore it is severely felt. A time of scarcity is a time when the duties on articles of food should he decreased instead of increased. It reminds me of the old story of a man who has an article which he sees a chance to sell profitably. He does not care how many persons may be victimized so long as he is able to put a few shillings into his own pocket. The States are supposed to be federated for the purpose of helping one another. I submit that a duty of 2d. per lb. is more than ample for the purpose of both protection and revenue. I hope that the committee will reflect very carefully before it imposes heavy duties on articles which constitute the food of mankind. </para>

                NEILD (New South Wales). - This afternoon
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline>
                on behalf of the Government and the other House, asked the Committee to place a duty of l&#163;d. per lb. on articles of luxury, such as game and poultry. And now he insists that we shall place exactly double that rate of duty on such common articles of daily consumption as hams and bacon. It does not seem to rae that there is the smallest effort towards consistency between the two proposals. If boned pheasant, tinned peacock,, preserved grouse, and other luxuries are to come in at a duty of 1&#189;d. per lb. under the

                how can he reconcile it with his conscience - how dare he attempt to fold his eyes in slumber to-night when he knows that he has. been insisting upon the imposition of a duty of 3d. per lb. on ham and bacon. Is there any consistency of idea or principle there
                <inline font-style="italic">1</inline>
                I hope that he will not press his motion, because he admits that it is really a tax to operate only when people are &#34; hard up.&#34; It is not to apply when people are well off. The tax-gatherer is only to come round when the poor taxpayer has not the wherewithal to meet the ordinary needs of life. That would not apply to all the luxuries which come in at a duty of l&#163;d. per lb. These are cooked and prepared for the table in the majority of cases, and in regard to which there is nothing like the same loss of weight, as there is in the cooking of bacon. It should be remembered by honorable senators that the tax on bacon is increased very greatly by reason of the reduction in weight in the process of cooking. With every desire to conciliate honorable members in another place, I must press the request for a reduction of the duty in this case.

                (Queensland). - The senators for New South Wales seem to have come here to help that State at the expense of Queensland, in which farmers depend very largely on hams and bacon for a considerable portion of their monthly income. They are able to do well in the industry in districts which are not affected by the drought. Farmers who five years ago used to live in the poorest way are now doing fairly well owing to the operation of the State tariff, and owing, I suppose, to the prospect of a similar tariff being adopted by the Commonwealth.

                    <para>- The senators for New South Wales should show some consideration for the farmers in the northern State. What is the good of the honorable senators going round and seeking trouble <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> They are simply trading the senatorial coat before the other House. They will trip up the whole community by delaying the completion of the Tariff, as they apparently intend to do. Time after time, they have argued that the duty on an article was of no importance, because we produced enough to supply our own requirements. If the duty on these articles is of no service to the producers, its protectionist incidence disappears, and it becomes merely a revenue duty. Surely those gentlemen who want a York ham ought to be willing to pay a duty of 3d. per lb. The free-traders in this Chamber seem to have no regard for the interests of the farmers in the Commonwealth. Although the whole of the commercial community desire the Tariff to be settled in some way or other, these honorable senators are delaying its completion on account of a duty which they say has no protectionist incidence. I seriously urge honorable senators not to kick up a row about nothing - to take up a stand in relation to those items on which they feel strongly, and not to deal with trivial matters. If a compromise is offered by another place, and the Minister in charge of the Bill moves its acceptance, it shall have my support whether it is in the interests of free-trade or in the interests of protection, because I am anxious to get to the end of this long-drawn-out session, which is wearying us all, and will drive some of us to an early political grave. </para>
