                    <para>- I regret that I have to oppose the motion. I have every respect for the Government, and I am deeply indebted to them for the manner in which they have carried out their pledges with regard to a white Australia, adult suffrage, and other questions ; but on this occasion I cannot permit such a motion to be put, without offering some opposition. While the Ministry seem to &#39; be very anxious to carry out their democratic pledges, yet in military matters they appear to take the part of gentlemen who are afraid to have legitimate discussion. To my mind there is no urgency about this Bill, and if there is any urgency who is responsible for it? </para>

                        <para>- If the men must start by that day, why is it that the Government did not give the Members of both Houses an intimation that it was proposed to send a contingent? The invitation to send men, was received by the Ministry on the 18th March, and yet not a word was whispered until a day or so ago in another place, and we received no official intimation of its receipt until this morning. Do the Ministry deprecate discussion on this military expenditure <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Are they afraid that somebody may say something which will turn the tide against this blatant militarism which is growing in Australia? Inasmuch as, according to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> we shall have nothing to do next week, there is no occasion to suspend the standing orders this morning. We should be given every opportunity to consider this proposed expenditure, and be able to come to a decision next week. We should not consult our personal convenience, as I am afraid some of us may be inclined to do. Honorable senators may ask what is the use of our coming to the Chamber- next week to discuss a measure of this kind when by passing it to-day, we might have a week&#39;s holiday. Such an argument will appeal, no doubt, to those who have on all occasions voted in favour of adjourning for a week or a fortnight in order that they might get away to South Australia or New South &#34;Wales, but it does not appeal to those of us who come from places as far distant .-is Queensland, and who are compelled to remain here month after month. </para>

                    <para>- The Government are getting into the vicious habit of never bringing up Money Bills until the very last moment. On several occasions the standing orders have been suspended, and we have passed Money Bills through all their stages in one day. The last time it was done I registered a mental vow that I would not consent to its repetition, so that honorable senators need not jump to the conclusion that I am opposing this motion simply because I object to the expenditure. The control of expenditure is rapidly passing out of the hands of Parliament, and being vested in the Executive, and as I consider that the suspension of standing orders so often, and the consequent lack of intelligent and legitimate discussion, conduce very strongly to that end, I intend, so far as I am able, to insist that Money Bills shall always be treated in just the same fashion as other Bills. They should be brought in, read a first time, read a second time, passed through committee, and read a third time in the ordinary course, so that honorable senators may be able to equip themselves for the discussion, and have an opportunity of obtaining the necessary information with regard to the proposed items of expenditure. It appears to me that that is absolutely necessary in the existing circumstances of the Commonwealth. A cry for economy is rising from every portion of the continent. Australia is devastated by drought, and thousands of men are out of employment. Thousands more probably will be without work in the near future. In consequence,., our income is not as large as it otherwise would be, and our expenditure ought to be closely watched. We should examine minutely every item of proposed expenditure. If the standing orders are suspended, we cannot do that with regard to this Bill. We had no official intimation that this proposed expenditure was to be incurred, and if the Bill is rushed through, we shall not be able to make the necessary investigations. If the contingent has to be sent away by the 19th inst., the Government must hare known that fact for weeks past, and must have made up their mind some time ago what they were going to do. If there is any delay we are not to blame for it. We have our duty to perform, and I, for one, intend to carry it out by closely criticising every item of the expenditure that is submitted to Parliament. </para>

                <para>SenatorDAWSON (Queensland). - I hope there will be no serious opposition to the motion before the Senate. The arguments of my honorable friends Senators Higgs and Stewart are very good and weighty as applying to ordinary Money Bills, but this is a special Bill requiring special treatment. It is not a matter of surprise that the Bill should have been introduced, because it has- 1 been mooted for a considerable time past, and might have been expected at any moment. Consequently, we have not been precluded from obtaining information concerning the details. As the occasion is a. special one, I trust that special treatment will be accorded to the Bill, and that the motion will be carried. </para>

                    <para>- I trust that the Senate will look at the question from a sensible point of view. To a certain extent I agree with some of the condemnatory remarks that have been made by my fellow senators. The Government are blamable in that they did not give sufficient notice that this measure was to be introduced. But no great amount of inquiry, is necessary in order that we may make up our minds as to the items of expenditure proposed in the schedule. When we consider the Bill at a later stage, I shall ba prepared to say what I oppose and what I advocate on the subject. Under the circumstances, we might permit the standing orders to be suspended, and on a future occasion the &#39;Government might take the hint that has been thrown out, and give us a better opportunity of considering measures of this character. </para>

                    <para>- I am opposed to the standing orders being suspended, because this is the second request of the kind which has been made to the Senate. It is all very well to say that this is an urgent business, but there is no reason why it should not have been brought up next week. The Government have treated private members&#39; business rather unfairly. What reason is there why we should not go on with that business next week ? If we adjourn for a week that opportunity will be lost. I am opposed to the suspension of the standing orders in order to provide for another holiday when there is a quantity of useful work to be done. It has been said that we have been merely beating time until the Tariff comes before us. I think we have beaten time too quickly, and are doing so now in endeavouring to pass &#34;through a measure of this kind in one day. </para>

Had not that been done in the past I doubt whether any one would have suggested that this was an occasion on which it was desirable to dispute the proposal made. There is very little that is complicated in the Bill, very little demanding inquiry, and very little to find out that would enable us to carry the debate any further than we shall be able to do to-day. Under the circumstances, the Government had no other resource than to propose the motion they have made. I do not see that it is necessary to call the Senate together next week to consider so small a measure. </para>

                    <para>- I have raised my protest before, when Supply Bills have been brought before the Senate, against the hurried manner in which measures involving public expenditure are placed before us. I do so again on this occasion. There is no reason why this Bill should not have been introduced at the beginning of next week. It is idle for the Government to ask us to suspend the standing orders on the ground that this is a matter of urgency. The despatch laid upon the table last evening by the Postmaster-General shows that the Government have been apprised of what was to be done for a considerable time past. This Bill only comes into our hands this morning, and we are expected at once to pledge ourselves to the expenditure proposed by it. I wish to criticise the Bill, and to suggest other proposals in its place, but I have no opportunity of doing so, because there has been no time for inquiry. The Bill is not the same as that which was introduced into the House of Representatives, as some important alterations were made in it there. The Bill in volves an important principle apart altogether from the question of the expenditure of money, and the Senate should carefully consider whether the request for the suspension of the standing orders ought not to be refused. This matter can be dealt with next week, notwithstanding that the troops have to leave on the 19th inst. If the Bill be dealt with in this way, we shall be laying down the principle of making the expenditure et public money a matter for the Executive </para>

I think the Senate has been treated very cavalierly by the Government) who have failed to give any reason for the suspension of the standing orders. In submitting the motion, the Vice-President of the Executive Council did not give any reason. </para>

                        <para>- Without closing the debate, the Postmaster-General might have made a statement of the circumstances. The only information we have on the subject is that which appears in the press - which, in my opinion, is not very reliable - that a fortnight ago the Government received a communication from the Home authorities on which they are now proposing to rush the Bill through. Unless additional reasons can be given, I shall feel compelled to vote against the suspension of the standing orders. </para>

Even if their objection be successful we shall still have to deal with the Bill next week. I agree very largely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> that it is inadvisable that Money Bills should be rushed through the Senate, but I think we might regard this as an exceptional occasion. Perhaps I do not Agree with all the provisions of the Bill, but I do not think that should lead me to oppose the suspension of the standing orders. I trust that the Bill will be dealt with to-day. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that the charges which have been made against the Government are well founded. The invitation to the Commonwealth to take part in the celebrations was received on the 18th March. The Cabinet had then to consider the matter, the determination of what should be done resting largely on the question of expense, and an opportune time had to be sought for laying the measure before another place, where the Tariff - the most important work of the session - is still under discussion. We have been discussing this Bill in the clubroom, and I think most of us have made up our minds. I am in favour of the reduction which has been made in the proposed expenditure, for I think that 150 troops will be sufficient to send to the celebrations, and, as I have been considering the matter for the last 48 hours, I am prepared to vote without a word upon every item in the Bill. If the suspension of the standing orders is refused, we shall have to come back next week. I desire to make use of the proposed adjournment next week in order to go to Tasmania, where my presence&#39; is absolutely necessary, and I think it would be unfair for my honorable friends in the labour corner to prevent myself and others, who have never been absent for an hour during the sittings of the Senate, from taking advantage of an adjournment which we have earned in every respect, and which may well be allowed, having regard to the position of public business. The leader of the labour party expressed the hope last night that the Franchise Bill would be passed through all its stages. That really meant that he desired that the standing orders should be suspended, in order that a measure in which the labour party takes so much interest might be put through. I take more interest in the Empire than - in a paltry Woman&#39;s Franchise Bill, and that is why I support the request of the Government. </para>

                    <para>- I intend to support the suspension of the standing orders, because I think that. the matter is an urgent one. AVe were informed by the Vice. President of the Executive Council that if the troops are to be despatched to England to take part in the coronation celebrations they must leave on the 19th instant, or eight days hence, and most of us desire that at that great function the Commonwealth should be represented properly, in , the same way as Canada and New Zealand. At the same time I agree with Senators Higgs and Stewart in regard to the tendency shown by the Government to rush important Money Bills through the Senate without giving adequate notice. There is undoubtedly a tendency on the part of the Executive to take from Parliament the rights that they possess. There is a feeling throughout Australia that we should not lean to extravagance, and we have not had time to consider this Bill, which involves the question of the expenditure of some &#163;24,000. AVe might desire to make suggestions as to the way in which the Commonwealth should be represented at the coronation proceedings ; we might desire that it should be represented, not by a military parade, but by some phase of our industrial efforts, and that is another reason why we should have had time to carefully consider the Bill. The Government have had plenty of time to advise us of this proposition, in view of the fact that they were invited to send a contingent to the celebrations so far back as the I8th March. When, matters of this kind are brought forward on subsequent occasions, I intend to oppose any proposal for the suspension of the standing orders unless we have had sufficient time to consider the question of the expenditure of public money involved. </para>

                        <para>- I a I agree with everything that has been said as to the undesirability of suspending the standing orders without reason, but I absolutely deny that there has been any occasion on which that concession, when requested, has not been amply justified. The standing orders are to be applied, and applied strictly, but the business of legislation could not go on unless we had power to relax them when the necessity was apparent. That necessity is apparent. I presume that if a contingent is to represent the Commonwealth at the coronation celebrations, even my honorable friends in the labour corner will desire that it should go in such a way as to properly represent Australia. The contingent will have to start on the 19th instant, and it would be impossible, unless expenditure anticipated legislative authority, to get it ready in time if we were to postpone this discussion until next Wednesday. It is imperative that the proposal should receive legislative authority this week if it is to be carried out. It is said the Government are to blame for having failed to bring on the matter at an earlier date. That is a point different from the question of necessity. I deny that the Government have brought about any delay by their own act. The intimation from the Home authorities was received on the 18th March, and the Government were not to anticipate it, and volunteer to send a contingent to represent the Commonwealth. I should like to know what those honorable senators, who now object to the suspension of the standing orders, would have said if the Government had prepared to send away this contingent without receiving any official intimation that it was desired. It will be admitted that when a proposal of this kind is made, it is necessary in the first place to make inquiries as to the circumstances under which troops can be sent, the time it will take, the cost of equipment, the cost of passage money; and in regard to other matters which must be determined, before action can be taken. </para>

                        <para>- I - It is not a matter in regard to which inquiries have had to be made only in one State. If the troops are to be sent away, they will have to go in proportion to the population of the different States. Inquiries have had to be made in all the States. They were necessary also in South Africa, because it was our desire - and I think the Senate will approve of that desire - that the troops to represent the Commonwealth at the Coronation celebrations should be veteran soldiers who had served the Empire in South Africa. Not only had these inquiries to be made, but it was essential that this measure should be introduced in Parliament. It had to be introduced of necessity in another place, which was occupied with a very important phase of the Tariff, which it was not thought desirable to interrupt by bringing on fresh business. For these reasons, therefore, it was impossible to bring the matter before the House of Representatives as soon as it was ripe for discussion. It was brought forward at the earliest possible moment ; the House of Representatives suspended its standing orders, and the Senate is asked to do no more. No blame can be laid at the door of the Cabinet. What would be the result if the objection to the suspension of the standing orders were successful? The consideration of the Bill would have to be postponed until Wednesday next, with the result that it would be too late to effectively carry out the proposed representation of the Commonwealth at the celebration. There is no reason why this matter should not be discussed now. There are no involved considerations to be dealt with, and I submit that the Senate is really in no worse position than if it had had three or four days in which to consider the measure. Therefore I hope that it will be practically unanimous in suspending the standing orders, and enabling the Bill to be dealt with. </para>

The representation of the Commonwealth by a contingent of mounted troops is proposed to be undertaken in response to an invitation conveyed in a telegraphic despatch which was sent from London on the 17th March to the Governor-General, and which reads as follows : - </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>Majesty&#39;s Government hope to see colonies represented at the Coronation by local forces as at Jubilee, 1897. Should your Ministers concur, His Majesty&#39;s Government will be prepared to receive from the Commonwealth any number not exceeding 580 of all arms ; selection left to your Ministers. Quarters for officers, and quarters and free rations for non-commissioned officers and men provided for about one month from the date of landing. Passage and all other expenses to be defrayed by Commonwealth. Horses can be provided for 300. Officers must be strictly limited to one colonel, two majors, one adjutant for entire contingent ; all other officers in ratio of three per 100 men. There must be no unattached or supernumerary officers. I shall be glad to learn probable number and other details at your earliest convenience: </para>
                <para class="block">The first question for the consideration of the Government was whether that invitation should be accepted. I think a majority of the Senate will see that it is impossible, in face of the position of the Commonwealth and its relation to the Empire, to refuse an invitation of that kind. We have already shown in the most practical way out- adherence to the cause of the Empire, our pride to belong to the Empire; and when we remember that this great ceremonial of the Coronation of His Majesty the King, is one in which a demonstration will be made from every part of the Empire, surely it is right that the Commonwealth should be represented - this Commonwealth which so recently was brought into being with universal joy and congratulation from every part of His Majesty&#39;s dominions. It would be quite unfitting that this great ceremonial at the centre of the Empire should be carried out in the absence of some military representation of the Commonwealth. In 1897 the States of Australia sent 253 men for their representation at the Jubilee Celebrations. It was proposed at first that the Commonwealth should send 250 men. That proposal has been altered, and it is now proposed to send about 150 men at a cost of &#163;16,000. I submit that it would be impossible for a less number to be sent to represent the Commonwealth in any fitting way. We think it most fitting that the officers and men who are to take part in this display should be men who have served the Empire in South Africa, both as a proof of the part we have taken in serving the Empire, and as a reward for the men who have given, up their time and risked their lives in its service. The number will be supplied partly from South Africa and partly from the Commonwealth. Fifty, or perhaps more, will be supplied from South Africa and England, and the balance from the Commonwealth. Care will be taken to, as nearly as possible, have each State represented according to its population. This Appears to me to be as small a number as we can send consistently with the position which the Commonwealth ought to occupy. </para>

                    <para>- I - I would remind the honorable senator that, however great <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> qualifications may be for representing the Commonwealth - and I do not underrate the&#39; position which he occupies - we have made this choice of sending only veterans who have seen active service. There is no one who would be more willing than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> himself to admit the fitness of that selection. I do not wish to have the number fixed necessarily by an}- comparison with other States - we have to act on our own view of the matter - but it may interest honorable senators to know that Canada is sending 500 troops, and New Zealand 150 troops : and no doubt the States in South Africa will be proportionately represented. Without enlarging further on the subject, because I do not think it is necessary at the present time, I ask the Senate to say that the proposed appropriation of &#163;16,000 for this purpose is under all the circumstances not a penny less than we ought to expend. It will provide for a reasonable, and not an extravagant representation of the Commonwealth. The next item in the Bill is for the illumination of the Commonwealth buildings in the State capitals. A careful estimate has been made of the cost o&#163; a reasonable illumination. I think honorable senators will admit at once, that at a time when there will be general rejoicings and demonstrations of loyalty, it would be a thing impossible to contemplate that the Commonwealth buildings should be left aggressively dark. I do not think anything could be more significant of want of hearty sympathy with the feelings of the Empire on the occasion than any such action on the part of the Commonwealth. Taking about &#163;900 as the expenditure in each capital, which is a very moderate one, it has been estimated that the illuminations will cost &#163;5,500. </para>

                    <para>- Y - Yes. I think it will be recognised that the Minister who represents the Commonwealth should not be required to pay any portion of his expenses out of his own pocket, and that the Commonwealth, considering the important nature of the occasion, ought to freely and unhesitatingly grant this amount which is to cover, not <inline font-style="italic">only</inline> the expenses of the Prime Minister, but also all clerical and other expenses attendant on his visit. With this explanation, &#91; leave the measure in the hands of the Senate, hoping that there will be no effective opposition to the carrying of our very reasonable proposals. The representation of the Commonwealth at the coronation of his Majesty, and the taking of some steps to mark the gratification of its people on that occasion, are an absolute necessity of our position. If we are to recognise that position, let us recognise it freely and generously without any extravagance, but at the same time with a full sense of our own position in the Empire, the dignity of the Commonwealth, and the dignity of the occasion. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales). - I rise to second the motion. The occasion which has called for this Bill is a great one. I do not think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council has overrated its greatness. What we have to do is to be careful that, in the universal desire for economy, we do not descend to meanness. In India it is proposed to spend about &#163;250, 000 at .Delhi. Of course I need not tell honorable senators that the natives Qf India have no voice in the matter, but at the same time I may say without any doubt that there are scores of native princes who, single-handed, will be prepared to spend the entire sum named in this Bill on the occasion. &#163;23,000 is not a large sum for the Commonwealth to spend. In view of the fact that Canada will have several times as many men, and New Zealand the same number as we propose to send, I do not see how we could, without descending to what I describe as meanness, reduce the estimate. I think it has been brought down, by what has taken place elsewhere, to its lowest limit. Therefore, believing that the proposals of the Government in this matter are fair and reasonable, and that they do exhibit a due regard to the necessity for economy, and at the same time maintain the dignity of Australia and recognise the importance of the occasion, I have pleasure in supporting them. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline>(Western Australia). - I think that a member of the third party in the Senate must congratulate the Government that they have been able to bring forward a proposal on which they can effect a coalition with the senators who sit in opposition to them. I was glad, in listening to the speech of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to notice that he did not argue that it was necessary to incur this expenditure in order to exhibit our loyalty to the Empire. I am glad of that, because, at least, we can discuss the question without hearing it said that we must be in favour of what is proposed unless we are to be branded as disloyal. Every one will recognise now that even if we do not send troops to the coronation the loyalty of Australia to the Empire has already been amply demonstrated. That being so, the only question that is before the Senate is, I take it, whether this is the best method by which we can be represented at the coronation. Upon that I join issue with the Government. I do not think that the method proposed is the best </para>

It is that we should vote a sum of money for the erection of an arch in London on the route of the coronation procession. What is the pageant that is to take place going to be % Is it going to be merely a display of the power of the Empire in a military sense, or is it to be a display of the varied resources and the homogeneous character of the Empire ? If it is to be that, what, I ask, is the chief power of Australia in her connexion with the Empire <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not think it will be said that Australia is a military nation. In fact, honorable senators have at every opportunity disclaimed any love of the military fetish. They have discouraged the military idea, and expressed the hope that it will not grow in Australia in the same way as it has grown in European countries. The speeches delivered on the Address-in-Reply at the opening of this session contained expressions from almost every honorable senator to the effect that they hoped that Australia would be an agricultural, pastoral, and manufacturing nation, and would become great in the pursuit of the peaceful arts. </para>

If we wish to demonstrate to Europe and the world the part that Australia hopes to play, and is playing, in the Empire, we can best do that by erecting an arch symbolical of the resources and capabilities of the Commonwealth. We shall thus do more to convey to the&#39; minds of the people of Europe and the United Kingdom what Australia is and hopes to be, than we can do by sending 150 mounted men, who will be lost in the multitude of troops that will be there, will be seen but for a few moments by the persons who happen to view the great procession, and will be unknown to the great majority. </para>

                    <para>- I would rather have a man carrying a pumpkin than a sword. There is nothing contemptible in carrying a pumpkin if the man came by it honestly. I should prefer to have our people engaged in growing pumpkins than in using weapons of war. Seeing that the question is only one of how best we can be represented at the coronation, I think I am justified in bringing forward what I take to be a practical suggestion which would meet with a certain amount of favour in another place, and which is well worthy of consideration. I am surprised that honorable senators should be so led away by the military idea as to consider that the only way b)&#39; which Australia can be represented at the coronation is by a company of troops. What does the King, who will be the centre of the pageant, represent? Does he merely represent the army, or does he represent every branch of industry in all portions of the Empire? If the latter be the case, why should Australia merely be represented by the military aim, as though that were the only method of securing an effective representation, of our part of the Empire ! I am consistently opposed to the idea of militarism being carried to an extreme. If there is to be an Imperial demonstration, in which we are to take part, I maintain that we should show that which we consider to be most valuable as representing Australia. I do not consider that the military power of Australia is its most valuable characteristic. I will do nothing, so far as my vote is concerned, to give the people of the United Kingdom and of Europe the idea that we in this new country, intend to cultivate that militarism which has been the curse of older nations. What I have made is a practical suggestion, and one well worthy of consideration. </para>

                    <para>- I am not prepared to accept that view. We had at the Paris Exhibition a representation of the timber and other resources of Western Australia, and it was claimed as a result on the part of the Government, that many orders for timber and various other products of Western Australia were sent to that State. There is great ignorance on the part of the people of Europe as to the products of Australia, and the part that this Commonwealth really plays in the Empire. If we can remove that ignorance, we shall do a good thing, but we cannot do it by sending Home 150 mounted riflemen. We can do it far more effectively by erecting a structure representative of the productions of this part of the Empire. Therefore when the Bill gets into committee, I shall be prepared to move an amendment to strike out the first item, with the view of inserting the words &#34; Construction of an arch representative of the industries and resources of the Commonwealth.&#34; For that purpose a sum of &#163;5,000 would&#39; be ample, and we could save &#163;11,000. We cannot object to the vote for the visit of the Prime Minister, and I have no wish to do so. I recognise that Australia is part of the Empire, and that there are. Imperial questions which affect this country. It is necessary that a Minister in a responsible position in Australia should occasionally confer upon those questions with other statesmen. I am glad to learn this morning that the Prime Minister does not propose to bind this Parliament to any action which may have results affecting Australia in the future. It is an assurance that should have been given, and I welcome it. With regard to. the illuminations in the various capitals of Australia, the amount involved is only a small one, and hardly worth cavilling about. But it does seem to me that we are cultivating a Chinese love of crackers. One of the things that we laugh at in the Chinese is their affection for Catherine wheels, fireworks, and things of that sort.- We are cultivating the verv same fondness ourselves. We are becoming a nation which, on every important occasion, loves to play with fireworks. I do not know whether it is expected that the result will be to frighten away the evil spirits, as the Chinese fancy. But it is absurd that a Parliament of representative public men should seriously be considering whether we shall put a number of coloured lights on buildings, under the impression that that is going to demonstrate that we are more loyal than we should otherwise be. The item I refer to might very well have been omitted. </para>

            <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON</inline>(Tasmania).- This is going to be a morning of coalitions, for I find myself, a staunch Imperialist, to some extent coalescing with my honorable friend who has just sat down, and who may be taken as representing the labour party in the views he has expressed. We are a part of the British Empire. I am proud that we belong to it, and we must be worthily represented at the coronation of our King. With regard to the first item of the schedule, I do not think we can possibly reduce the number of men to be sent to London. Whatever the cost may be, we could not do less, and I would not have us do more, than send 150 troops to take part in the ceremony. A few minutes before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> rose, I expressed my intention of moving that the item for illuminations be struck out for the purpose of devoting the money to the erection of an arch such as my honorable friend has suggested. I regard the sum of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5,500</inline> to be spent upon illuminating the Commonwealth buildings in the capital cities as money wasted. All of us must recollect the magnificent illuminations which took place in Sydney at the inauguration of the Commonwealth on the 1st January last year, and there is still fresh in our memory the magnificent way in which the city of Melbourne was illuminated on the occasion of the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York last May. Bub simply to illuminate ; three or four buildings in each capital city on the day of the Coronation will mean an absolute waste of money. The public will be enjoying their holiday in the way that pleases them, and no doubt there will be great crowds in the streets. If the Government were to engage a few bands at &#163;10 each to play music at the corners of the streets, it would give more real enjoyment than the spending of a large sum of money on illuminations. I should much prefer seeing the money devoted to the erection of an arch. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> seems to think that an arch would be of little use. But the illuminations would-be of no use whatever. We want to be represented where the coronation is going on, in the very heart of the Empire. Canada is to erect an arch which will be viewed, certainly by a million of people, and I certainly think that we ought to spend &#163;5,000 on a structure which will be worthy of Australia, and emblematical of our industries, and which will tell the people of the Empire that there is such a place as Australia. I therefore propose, when we get into committee, to support the omission of the second item, with a view to provision being made for the erection of an arch in London. </para>

                        <para>- I should be perfectly satisfied if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> went to represent the Commonwealth with a few men accompanying him to show that he was not absolutely alone in such a large city, but I do not at all agree that 1 50 men are necessary. The object in making a military display on this occasion must surely be to impress the whole community with the &#34; pomp and circumstance &#34; of glorious war. If those in charge of the coronation celebrations in London desire to impress the people in that way let them also show the other side. I venture to say that they can impress the public of Great Britain in a very much stronger way by having some banners in the procession, on which shall be printed &#34;Thirty thousand dead, and some fifty thousand wounded, in the South African war.&#34; Let them also have a procession of widows and orphans and of the maimed and crippled who have lost their limbs in the war in South Africa.. I was very much disappointed when the Duke and Duchess were here with the military aspect of their appearance. Civilians were not permitted to take any part in the processions in connexion with their visit, and, I suppose, civilians will not be permitted to take part in the coronation processions in London. The on!)&#39; persons permitted to take part in the processions during the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York wore people in some way connected with the army. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator must know that no aldermen were allowed to take part in those processions, and neither members of the Federal Parliament nor the State Parliaments were allowed to take part in them, though they were permitted to stand on the steps and look on. Undoubtedly the affair was conducted in that way in order to keep the people attached to the military system. I consider the sum of &#163;16,000 too large to be expended in this way. Where are the economists of Victoria, and why have they not said a word about this expenditure ? We who come from the other States have lately been much impressed by the agitation for economy on the part of the great daily newspapers of this State, and on the part of some agitators who are anxious to take the places of certain men in the State Parliament, but not a word is said against this expenditure for the purpose of sending Home 150 men to take part in a procession. They will pass the eyes of those congregated very rapidly, and will, no doubt, elicit a cheer, but they will soon have gone from the recollection of the people, and as for any advantage to Australia and the Empire, that will not exist. </para>

                <para class="block">Let us bear in mind that these troops are only to go away to take part in a procession which will last for a few hours, and that we are being asked to spend &#163;16,000 for that purpose. Do not honorable senators who witnessed the demonstrations in Melbourne agree that a procession representing the arts of peace and industry would be more fitting? Whoever saw a better, a more attractive, or a more instructive display than the eight hours&#39; procession through the streets of Melbourne during the time the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall were here. It had to be admitted on all hands that that was a procession worth preparing for. The proposal to build an industrial arch in the streets of London is, to my mind, very much more to the point. Honorable senators, who remember the Commonwealth celebrations in Sydney and in Melbourne, will know that the most effective means adopted to show the rejoicing of the people were the arches built in the streets. What attracted more attention than the arches built en behalf of France, Germany, and the United States <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Yet there are certain people who tell us that France and Germany are only too anxious for some withdrawal of the protection of the mother country, that they may sweep down and seize Australia. If we wish to advertise Australia and the Commonwealth, the erection of an industrial arch would be the most effective means to adopt. &#34; </para>

Those honorable senators who take an interest in the primary productions of the country do not find anything embarrassing or derogatory in primary productions.

I have heard that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> was himself one of the most successful representatives of South Australia who ever made his appearance in the old country. But if the honorable senator could not have backed up the statements he made by solid facts in the exhibition of the products of South Australia, his efforts to advance that State would have been futile. </para>

                        <para>- If they were exhibited on an arch there are thousands of people who are not able to get an honest living throughout the United Kingdom and London who might see them and be induced to say - &#34;Australia is the place for us to go to. It is evidently a land of milk and honey, in which the good things of the. earth are easily produced, and we will go there.&#34; I must say that I think a military display on this occasion is a very great mistake. I think it would be better to adopt a suggestion which arose in my mind when I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest speaking last night about the industrial aspect of the South African war. The right honorable gentleman said that Australia was doing a roaring trade with South Africa. Would it not be well, instead of sending this military contingent, to send a contingent of the frozen-meat patriots who are crying out for the continuance of the war <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Let us get a contingent of the gentlemen who are at present making fortunes out of the South African war, and get them to take part in the procession, and to say how many thousands they have made out of the war, and to give the reason why they are anxious that the war should be continued until the subjugation of the Boers takes place. But no, we shall not have anything of that kind. All that is wanted is the shine and glitter of militarism. When the Bill gets into committee we may not be in a position to strike out certain items it contains, but we can suggest to the House of Representatives that they ought to be omitted. </para>

I think that his Ministry and himself are inclined to dispense Commonwealth money with too free a hand, but his services have been of such a character that I do not think there will be any opposition to the amount proposed to cover the expenses of his trip. A proposal was made in the Bill as originally introduced in another place to send away a rifle team to the old&#34; &#39; country, and I am glad that that proposal has been withdrawn, though I agree that it is a very wise thing to encourage rifle clubs by the expenditure of money for prizes to be won within the Common- - wealth. </para>

I am prepared to support a militarism which will train our own people to shoot, so that if at any time Australia is attacked by any power our people will be able to defend themselves. But that is a very different thing from training our people with a view to sending them away to a foreign country in the interests of mining speculators and shareholders who are not satisfied with the millions they have already. made out of their mines. </para>

He does not see that we are depleting Australia of some of her best citizens. I am in favour of the militarism of self-defence, but not of aggression, and if we could see into the honorable senator&#39;s mind we should find that he was of the same opinion. </para>

                    <para>- Perhaps one of the most satisfactory features of the debate has been the exhibition of the unanimous feeling that the Commonwealth should be represented at the .great coronation ceremony, first of all, in the person of the Prime Minister, and, secondly, by -some display on the part of the people. We recognise that the coronation ceremony will symbolize the unity of the Empire; and that as part and parcel of the Empire we should be represented. I suppose that one of the greatest assemblages which has ever taken place in the history of the Empire will be that which will gather at the coronation -ceremony at Westminster. As a British people we desire to show our rejoicings in connexion with what is taking place, and consequently the question resolves itself into one as to the form which the exhibition of our rejoicings should take. I am aware that incidentally the bringing together of the naval and military forces will in itself demonstrate the influence and strength of the Empire as a whole. That, however, is not the main object of the display. The desire is to have some picturesque pageant which will at the same time be indicative of our rejoicings. While I am not prepared to go the length which my honorable friends in the labour corner have gone in denouncing all militarism, I am by no means enamoured of it ; I realize that in a moderate and modest degree militarism is essential. I do not agree with them in the view that the mere sending of troops to England to take part in the coronation celebrations will constitute any exhibition of militarism on our part. They will be sent simply to make a picturesque display, and not for the purpose of generating any military ideas. I </para>

                        <para>- To make a show. We desire to adopt &#34;the best method of displaying our rejoicings, and could anything be more picturesque &#39;than that which is suggested in the Bill ? We have &#39;no reason to be ashamed of what has been done by our own military men within &#39;the limits of the &#39;Commonwealth. They &#34;have not only proved themselves to be really good solid citizens, but reliable men, and when it .has been necessary:they have done their duty abroad. I &#39;feel, therefore, that &#34;the charge that this is mere jingoism, with a tendency in the direction of militarism, is -not&#34; altogether justified. I urge the -sending of these troops on the ground that they will make a picturesque display, and are likely to be effective in that direction. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Senator Pearce</inline> and others have emphasized the view that an arch of Australian productions should be erected in London. T do not know that it would be specially picturesque, but the idea is that from a utilitarian stand-point it would be an excellent thing. In <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> opinion, there is not much to be gained in that direction. Such an arch &#39;would not &#39;be likely to impress upon those who saw it our importance in primary productions. It is not in that way that commercial and agricultural interests are to <inline font-style="italic">&#39;be</inline> promoted. We have our Agents-General and commercial agents in the old country who are constantly endeavouring to bring our primary productions under the notice of &#34;the British public. They find it a very difficult work, and it is utterly &#34;fallacious to say that any substantial advance in that direction is to be .gained by the mere erection in London of an arch indicating what we can produce. <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Senator De</inline> Largie. - -&#34;Will the presence of 150 troops in London help us? </para>

                        <para>- -!Nb ; only to a modest extent, as I have stated already. If there is any general belief that it is desirable that we should have an arch erected in London to illustrate our primary productions, and if we can satisfy ourselves that anything substantial will be gained <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> carrying out that proposal, we can suggest to another place that the appropriation should be increased to the extent of &#163;3,000 or &#163;4,000. In my opinion the proposals contained in the Bill for the picturesque display to which I have referred should not be in any way cut down. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and two or three others have taken exception to the amount set apart for the illumination of the Commonwealth offices. I was pleased to hear the Vice-President of the Executive Council say that the intention of the Government was to distribute the amount almost equally amongst the various States irrespective of their population. I admit that illuminations are of a most ephemeral character, but we have to remember that it is a recognised practice on the part of the British public to resort to that method of showing their feelings of joy. </para>

                        <para>- Incidentally that may be so. The mere fact that Chinese also resort to illuminations in time of rejoicing should not detract from our intention to continue the practice. Notwithstanding what we may do here, it is perfectly clear that the loyal citizens throughout the rest of the Empire will have illuminations and displays of that character, and I think it is a very reasonable thing to say that in these circumstances the Commonwealth offices should not present a severely funereal appearance. We should fall in with what will be the general spirit of this demonstration, and, consequently, I feel that the proposal contained in the Bill is a reasonable one, and should commend itself to all. </para>

                    <para>- To my mind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has put the true position. All of us are agreed that it is advisable that during the coronation ceremonies we should take a part in the demonstration of the solidarity and loyalty of the Empire. The only question is in regard to what form that demonstration should take. There are three methods suggested <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the Bill. One is the sending of troops to take part in the Commonwealth celebrations in England, another is the illumination of the Commonwealth buildings, and the third is that the Prime Minister should be present at the ceremony. With reference to the first proposal, I entirely agree with the last speaker, but I agree also with some observations that have fallen from honorable senators in the labour corner, that we ought to do all in our power to discourage the jingoism run mad which has arisen recently. If I thought that by sending Home troops on this occasion we should in any way foster that military spirit which is now so much abroad I should oppose it. But I look at the matter in an entirely different light. It may be that in this 20th century, which is characterized very much more by industrial and commercial progress than by military achievements, it would be more fitting and more welcome to our new King to make a display of those things which most symbolize the age and are most truly representative of the Empire over which he reigns. But unfortunately we are not the promoters of these celebrations. We are merely a small factor, and are asked to play a part in a display that has been decided upon in London, the heart of the Empire. The authorities there might have chosen to celebrate the coronation of the King by an industrial exhibition, but they have chosen to celebrate it by a military display. In so doing, they have followed the time-honoured traditions, not merely of Britain, but of every country. Whether that custom finds its origin in the savagery of men who recognised no prowess but the physical, or whether it arises from a desire for the <inline font-style="italic">picturesque,</inline> the fact remains that a military demonstration has been decided upon, and that it is recognised throughout the world that great public rejoicing on an occasion like the one. in view is best exhibited by a military display. We have been asked to send troops. Are we to make ourselves singular by lifting our little voice against the chorus from all parts of the Empire, and to stand out against the means of display proposed ? </para>

                        <para>- I merely put it to the Senate that as an act of courtesy and graciousness, and certainly of decorum, we should do what is suggested. It has been so chosen, and we should only make ourselves ridiculous by asserting our little opinion as to the way in which this rejoicing should be demonstrated, contrary to what has been decided in the heart of the Empire. So far as the amount is concerned, I do not know much. I have always believed that we cut down too much. I think that &#163;16,000 is little enough. With reference to the illuminations of our Commonwealth buildings, true, it may be said that by giving effect to this proposal, we shall not put one penny-piece into any one&#39;s pocket, but shall take it out ; but that is not the point. On many occasions we have pyrotechnic displays, banquets and flags gaily flying. Intrinsically they mean nothing, but they indicate a great deal, and they have been chosen by all people, and are now recognised, as the appropriate signs of a heartful welcome. Would it not be very curious if when London and all other parts of the Empire were ablaze with glorification, we gave a pat on the back to those who say that our recent demonstrations of loyalty, our willingness to send troops to fight the battles of the Empire were prompted not by love of the Empire, but by certain private and sordid considerations ? Would that not be an eloquent endorsement of the calumnies that are passed on the Empire? I think we are all agreed that the Prime Minister should represent the Commonwealth. I do not wish it to appear - and I think I mentioned it on a former occasion - that I in the slightest degree sympathize with the military spirit which is now becoming too rampant, and it is only because by adopting this method of illuminating the State capitals, and of sending Home soldiers that we fall in with the practice which has been recognised as appropriate to such an occasion that I support the Bill. I think it would be well if there were an arch or two, but the other House has rejected the idea. I do not think we should substitute an arch for the illuminations, or lessen the vote for the contingent for the purpose of erecting an arch, but I agree with the last speaker, that it would be a good thing if we could appropriate a few thousand pounds more to put up an arch. I do not know that it would produce very much benefit, but anything will do good which serves as a proclamation to London that we Australians, 13,000 miles away, are a people who are thinking of the old country, and therefore worthy of being thought of by the best people there. </para>

                    <para>- I rise more to complain than to do anything else. Whenever there is a demonstration to be made there is always a great hurry, but for carrying out the real business of the Commonwealth there is no such hurry displayed at most times. We have heard a great deal about the defence of the Empire ; I dare say we are all interested in its defence. We have also heard about the defence of Australia, but do we show the same interest in its defence ? Do the Government even at the present time show the same interest in the defence of Australia as in the defence of other portions ~~of the Empire? Some honorable senators talk about militarism as if they abhorred it. Yet they are doing everything they possibly can to show that their sympathies run in that direction. They say that they are anxious that the defence of Australia should be carried out by the encouragement of rifle clubs. The object of my remarks is to show the neglect in one direction and the hurry in another. For some time a movement has been on foot in Australia to get our young men into clubs for the purpose of being taught to use their weapons if ever a necessity should arise. I know of several instances where the members of these clubs have applied, to the Defence department for approved rifles. In one instance the applications were made six months ago, and the young men were prepared to pay for the rifles, but the department have not hurried. They do not care whether a force from Japan, China or Russia comes here. These young men are patriotic enough to desire to be taught to defend themselves ; and yet this department takes very little interest in them, or is moving very slowly in the direction of bringing about the improvement which ought to have taken place long ago. But when an affair of this kind is proposed, when they are whooping and howling all over the place, an}7 one who offers to criticise it is disloyal, or perhaps something worse. Something has been said about a proper display in connexion with the coronation ceremony, which would really illustrate to people in the old country not only the feelings, but the habits of the people of Australia. I think it could be done much more appropriately than by a military display. When the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York were in Melbourne, there was an item in the Eight Hours&#39; demonstration which I believe attracted more attention than any other, and which so far as the people of England are concerned would be more Australian than any other. It was a display of stock riders mounted on their own horses, wearing their own peculiar garb and cracking their stock whips. It was better than any military display I saw in Australia, and it was more in harmony with the tastes of the people. Instead of spending &#163;16,000 to send Home 1-50 military men, could we not with that money - and I do not believe it would take as much - send Home 150 stockmen? They are as much entitled to our consideration as is anybody else. They would be recognised much more readily in London as being Australian than 150 military men who would be lost in the crowd of soldiers. </para>

Does the honorable and learned senator think that they are going to kill anybody or to impress them with terror or with admiration? What I have been endeavouring to impress on the Senate is the neglect of the Government, particularly the Minister for Defence, to carry out the real intention of the people of Australia with respect to training our young men. Until such time as the Commonwealth Parliament has a habitation of its own which it can illuminate it is not desirable to incur any expenditure in this direction. If any capital city is to be illuminated it is the duty of the Government of the State, if it is so inclined, to provide for the illuminations. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that this money is being voted for the purpose of illuminating the buildings in the possession of the Commonwealth. The offices at the corner of Collins-street, the Post-office, and some military establishments - I do not know where they are, nor do a great man)&#39; of the people, or care either - these are all the buildings which fire to be illuminated in Melbourne. When this sum is distributed amongst the six States, it will provide a very poor show. It would be better not&#34; to have it done at all than to have it half done. If the Government of a State makes up its mind to illuminate the State capital, it has a perfect right to do so, and not afterwards complain about the extravagance of the Commonwealth : because, assuredly, if we spend money on illuminations it will be included in the Commonwealth expenditure, and held up to Federal members as portion of their work in representing the States. I entirely agree with Senators Dobson and Pearce that if this sum of &#163;5,500 is not sufficient to properly illuminate the Commonwealth buildings all over Australia, it will be quite sufficient for the purpose of erecting an arch, or even two arches, in London, to show the products of Australia. Notwithstanding the experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> I believe there is a great deal in erecting these arches. </para>

                        <para>- It is the first plank in the platform of a great many persons. I will support any movement to advertise Australia in London, by the erection of some arches in substitution for what I would call very inefficient illuminations. Why should any State Government throw the responsibility of illuminating the State capital on to the Commonwealth ? When the Commonwealth is provided with, a capital of its own, it will be perfectly justified in voting a sum of money to illuminate its public buildings when a coronation ceremonial takes place. We are all agreed, I think, that the last item is a proper one to vote. No representative of Australia should be allowed to go to London, or elsewhere, without sufficient funds to enable him to conduct himself in the same way as the representatives of any other parts&#39; of the world. Therefore, although not objecting to the second reading, I certainly shall support those who will endeavour to alter the Bill in committee in the direction which has been indicated. </para>

                <para class="block">If the people of Great Britain like to engage in the barbaric extravagance of a coronation - an unnecessary pageant, in my opinion - that is their affair. Apparently there is plenty of cash in Great Britain to be spent on this sort of thing. But we are a democratic community. We ought to practice simplicity in all our ceremonials, and be economical in our expenditure of money. If we can show an example to the older countries of the world we ought to do sopor that reason I am altogether opposed to sending a number of men to London to represent Australia. I am particularly opposed to the idea when military men are to be sent. The Government of Great Britain has issued an invitation to Australia to send soldiers. AVe have no soldiers to send, in the ordinary sense of the word. A soldier is a member of a standing, army. We have not a standing army, and I hope we never shall have. Therefore we have not the material at our disposal which the British Government desires we shall send. If we had an army it would be much more to the public advantage if we could, by not countenancing the idea of giving military men pre-eminence in these functions, do something. to dissipate the military spirit- which is so powerful in nearly every nation in the world. I object to sending these men to England for that reason. Another reason is that we cannot afford it. We have not the money to spend, in this. sort of thing. We are a poor community. The cry of&#39; the unemployed rises from every portion of the Commonwealth: Several of: the State Governments are crying out that the Commonwealth Parliament has ruined them by its action on the Tariff: We are told from every portion of Australia that Government employe&#39;s will have to be dismissed because there is no revenue: We know that the continent is devastated: by drought, and that tens of- thousands, of men do not know whereto turn for the means, of subsistence. Whilst that is the case the Government of the Commonwealth has- the audacity to ask us spend &#163;23j000 in taking, part in a useless ceremonial. I shall be no party to anything of the kind. The time has now arrived when the democratic people of Australia should set their foot down, firmly, and object to such extravagance. We hear a great deal about economy. We are told that our printing bill is too high, and that we are spending too much in other directions. Every effort is being made in certain, quarters to hamper the free action, of the men&#39; into whose power the government of: the Commonwealth has been placed, in their endeavours to canyon the administration of: the country efficiently and economically. But when expenditure of this character is. proposed the dogs that bark so loudly on other occasions suddenly become dumb. What is the reason <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Whyhas the watch-dog on the- tower become silent when he sees extravagance proposed in this way ? I suppose because a bit of Imperial hash is thrown to him- ! </para>

                        <para>- I did object : but I went on the tour as I considered it my duty to do so. The honorable senator neglected his duty, but I. performed mine, much against my wish. It appears to me that there is a party in Australia which-, while it insists upon the most rigid economy, almost verging upon meanness, so far as purely Australian expenditure is- concerned, wishes to be lavish in the expenditure of- the last shilling of somebody else, and the shedding of. the last drop of somebody else&#39;s blood. I am not an Australian of that character. I believe that charity begins at home, and good government ought to- begin at home. If; we have money to spend we ought to spend it to the advantage of the miserable poverty stricken, people- within our own. territory: .- The Prime Minister has asked for&#39; &#163;23,000. Does any one expect that that sum will cover the expenditure on this coronation business- so far as Australia is concerned ? Any one who believes that is a most credulous person. I do not. It is fresh in our. memories that a. certain gentleman who is again going to Great Britain, on one occasion- wired, to Australia, for a refresher. He had been so accustomed to refreshers in his profession, I suppose, that he could not do without one. On this occasion I expect that he will want a pick-me-up before he has been in England very long, and the expenditure on this expedition, instead, of being. &#163;23,350, will probably be &#163;.50,000. I record my protest here and now against it. With regard to the &#163;5,600 that it is proposed to spend in illuminations- in the State capitals, it appears to me that the people who have had the government, of these State capitals for so many years certainly want illumination ; but not of the kind now proposed. This is one of the moat ridiculous proposals that I have ever heard of, in a country which supposes itself to be civilized. Cannot we rejoice without burning something <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Surely we ought to be a degree in advance&#39; of. that. But we do not seem to&#34; be <inline font-style="italic">one whit</inline> removed from the condition&#39; of the savage people who lived 2,000 or 3,000&#39; years- ago, and who revelled in blood: and fire. Those were the only two deities the}&#39; worshipped. We appear nowadays- to worship three - blood, fire, and gold. If we have &#163;.5,500 to spend, we ought to follow the example which has been set by the illustrious monarch- who now occupies the British: throne. I refer to. Edward VH. He proposes to feed: half a. million, of; the poorest people in London. There- are actually half a million, people living. in&#62; the great capital of this- great Empire so poverty-stricken that they have not a. meal to- put into their stomachs. </para>

The-same is- the case in Brisbane. In Melbourne, in. the very, precincts of . Parliament - this boarding, house at the head, of Bourke-street - have been invaded by a hungry army of unemployed, but I did not hear, that they: were invited- up to the refreshment rooms. If: they cam here hungry, I believe they went away hungry. If we have any. money to* spend, in rejoicings would, it not- be- better to give- a few thousand poof people a. free meal,. in order to make, them realize that Edward, was being crowned,, and that they ought to rejoice? I suppose,, if: we did that, these-poor people would, wish, that a, coronation, might happen every day. In- regard to the Prime Minister, surely, that right honorable gentleman - I believe that he is- a right honorable member of the- Privy. Council of - the Empire - being the captain of this ship, ought not to desert it and, run away. to. London at. the present juncture. I really must protest against the, chief: executive officer of the Commonwealth being permitted to desert his post at present. If he- wishes to go to London he should resign his position before leaving Australia. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -</inline>STEWART. - It is not necessary that, he should go- as. Prime Minister. We have a number of- Agents-General in. London who,. I am sure, would be- ready to represent. Australia in this- matter. We have a representative of Queensland who* would do the tiling right royally. He is one of- the most regal persons! have ever heard of. The objection that it is- improper for the Prime- Minister of the Commonwealth to be absent during his term of office has special force if- he is. absent while Parliament is sitting, I have no doubt that even if he departed never to return, Australia could get on perfectly well without him, but we do not find Great Britain permitting, her Prime Ministers to leave the country in this fashion, and even if- it were allowed in Great Britain, I think it should not be permitted here. When we- place a gentleman in charge of the affairs of the country, we make him our first executive officer, and we expect him to stick to his post, because the Prime Minister is the centre round which the administration revolves. The Cabinet, I supposed could appoint a temporary occupant of the office, . but that is not desirable. There seems to be no necessity that the Prime Minister should go. We have a number of Agents-General in London who could effectively represent the Commonwealth. The1 objection may be raised that an Agent General could nob take part in the proceedings of the Imperial Conference which is to be held with- the same authority as the Prime Minister. I do not know that it would be wise to vest any Agent-General with power to deal with those matters. I think it is- highly objectionable even to vest the Prime Minister with such powers. I ha.vethe very gray est suspicion of these Imperial conferences. If- gatherings of this character are to take place, due notice of them should be given to the public, the matters to be discussed should, be intimated, and individuals should be chosen specially to represent the different portions of the Empire at- them. We send the Prime Minister to attend the- coronation and this conference practically with a blank, cheque. He can practically commit the Commonwealth to anything he pleases. The right honorable gentleman, will say, of- course, that he will nob do anything of the kind, but&#39; we know how these things are managed, and some measure or some policy may be initiated at such a conference which it may be very inconvenient subsequently for the Commonwealth to go back upon. We shall practically be committed to that policy, and there is very little chance that the Parliament of the Commonwealth will go back upon it. I do not believe in that sort of thing. There is another reason why I think the Prime Minister should not go. It is that when we send our public men to Great Britain we expose them to influences which invariably deteriorate their public character and impair their efficiency. We are here a democratic community, living in a kind of primeval simplicity. I trust we shall keep that simplicity, and that we shall never ape the garish splendour, the tinsel show, and the hollow magnificence which obtains -at the heart of the Empire. We have seen the apple beautifully red on the outside, but upon closer examination we have found that some insect has bored through the skin and eaten out the heart of it, and there is nothing left but the magnificence of the outside shell. I am afraid that at the heart this Empire is rapidly advancing to that condition, and I say it is unnecessarily exposing our public men to serious dangers to send them Home. There they come into contact with men who have no sympathy with our ideals in Australia, and who look upon the representation of working men by working men in Parliament as something of an exceedingly dangerous character. The principal gentleman with whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> will come into contact when he goes to England, is a certain person known as the Right Honorable Joseph Chamberlain. I know of no man who has such a capacity foi1 invective as that right honorable gentleman, and he declared very forcibly in the British House of Commons quite recently, that a working man&#39;s representative in the House of .Commons was &#34;like a fish out of water.&#34; He thus demonstrated his views in the most forcible fashion to the entire world, because that gentleman&#39;s auditorium is the whole earth, and all the&#39; newspapers in the world publish his utterances. The Right Honorable Edmund Barton, when he goes to Great Britain, will come into contact with that gentleman and will be contaminated. He will say - &#34; Why, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton,</inline><inline font-style="italic">yon</inline> are governed out there by the labour party. Why don&#39;t you kick against it, and rebel against this unholy and illegitimate dominance.&#34; He will inspire <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> probably with ideas that otherwise would never enter his mind, and it will be like the serpent invading the holy precincts of Eden. I do not know whether the ex-Premier of Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> has ever visited Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and a great deal more. I have not the slightest idea that this sum will suffice for the expenses of the Prime Minister and his retinue. We 1 know perfectly well that that right honorable gentleman is quite oriental in his ideas. If he had his way it would not be &#163;1,800 but &#163;18,000 probably, and when the bill comes in we shall very likely find that it is a very much bigger amount than is set down in the measure before us. For that reason I think we ought not to permit him to go. As I said at the beginning, I am opposed to the whole spirit of this Bill. If amendments are moved in the direction of having an arch erected in London, and providing that the &#163;5,000 odd mentioned for the expenses of the illuminations shall be spent in feeding our poor, I shall give such amendments my support. To the Bill as it stands I am most distinctly opposed. </para>

                    <para>- - I do not intend to take up the time of the Senate at any very great length, as I have no doubt that honorable senators desire to dispose of the Bill to-day. I was one of those who voted for the suspension of the standing orders to allow the Bill to be considered to-day, but at the same time I must enter my protest against some of its provisions with which I do not agree. I am one of those who do not think that the patriotism of Australians to Australia, or the loyalty of Australians to the British Empire, can be increased by the expenditure of &#163;16,000 in sending a contingent of our soldiers to take part in the coronation celebrations in England. I am entirely in accord with some of the sentiments expressed <inline font-style="italic">hy</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in the course of his excellent speech, as well as by some other honorable senators, and I agree that we might do more good to Australia, and at the same time make an equally effective display of our loyalty, by expending portion of this money in showing the industrial life rather than the militarism of Australia. I do not believe that the sending of 150 or even 250 troops from Australia would more greatly impress the people who are in London, on the occasion of the celebrations, with our loyalty than they would be in the absence of those troops. To the third item, providing for the sending of the Prime Minister to the ceremony, I do not think any one can take exception, notwithstanding the remarks which Ii a ve been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> I think we are all agreed that the Commonwealth of Australia, as an integral part of the Empire, should be represented at the ceremonial, and that the proper person to represent it is the Prime Minister. So far as the question of cost is concerned, I am not in the fortunate position of one who has gained any experience of the expenditure involved in attending a ceremonial of the kind. I do not know whether &#163;1,850 will be too much or too little ; but I am not going to cavil at the amount ; in fact, I welcome the proposal that the Prime Minister should attend. But we would show our sense of the importance of the function, and would not decrease the evidence of our loyalty if we stopped after making that provision. The sending of our soldiers to London will not cause <inline font-style="italic">any</inline> unit of the British Empire to recognise our loyalty to a greater extent than would the erection of an arch. </para>

Even although the majority may disagree with my opinion, I am satisfied that there is a very considerable minority in Australia, more especially at the present juncture, when there is so great an <inline font-style="italic">outcry</inline> against the expenses of the Federal Parliament, who object to the proposed expenditure of &#163;16,000 for the despatch of troops to London. If the people were called upon&#187; to-morrow to vote on the question, there would not be any substantial majority in favour of that expenditure. I certainly think that the proposal to expend &#163;5,500 in illuminations is absurd. If the citizens of any part of the Commonwealth wish to exhibit their extreme loyalty they will do so by illuminating their buildings or towns at their own expense. </para>

                        <para>- I - I do not- think, it is to any great degree. Those- who talk: about the extravagance o&#163; the Government are those who support the proposal now. before us&#187; who supported: the Bill as introduced in another place,, where a reduction of &#163;10,000 was made,, and who would have hailed it with delight even if it- had involved au expenditure of: &#163;50,000. They are the people who cry out if: any one, of the States is guilty of a little extravagance. In some of- the States even a vote of: &#163;.1.00-for a hospital is refused. Such things occur daily, but the federation, of - the States- is to set its seal of approval upon what, in my opinion, will be a worthless- expenditure. I think that the representation of: Australia, by the Prime Minister, is desirable, and. that if we had ended there we should have done very well indeed. I realize the hopelessness of entering a:, protest, against the proposals- contained- in the Bill, but that does not prevent me- from, doing, my duty according to my lights. I am not in full agreement with the- sentiment which has been expressed here that the sending, of these troops to England is likely to conduce to militarism. No. one hates militarism more than I do. I abhor war ; I love peace with honour, although I am heart and soul, with the growth of a military spirit, so far as it is necessary, for the defence of our own country. There is not very much, in the assertion that the despatch of these few troops to London will increase the growth of: a military spirit here. I oppose the proposal on entirely different grounds - on the ground that if carried out it will not enhance the opinion, of the rest of- the Empire as to the loyalty of Australia. In- my opinion&#39; it will not confer any benefit upon Australia.. The &#163;1.6,000 which it will involve might be spent in many other ways to greater, advantage, and if I have an opportunity of voting, on an amendment to strike out that item, as well as the proposed&#39; expenditure of &#163;.5,500 for useless illuminations, I shall do so. </para>

The position which I take up, in common with others- who have objected to the Bill, as it stands, is,, that I am not opposed to the amount of: money proposed to be expended in the- representation, of the Commonwealth in London,, but to the direction in which it is to be expended. We feel that it could be expended to much greater advantage, and in a way which would be far more profitable- to the Empire, while still showing our. fidelity and loyalty to the Empire. The Vice-president of the Executive&#39; Council would be very wise- if he were1 to adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> suggestion, and set apart- a portion of the amount, now proposed-: to- be expended in. a military pageant, for the purposes- of an industrial display, which would advertise Australia; and give-us the opportunity which we have long, sought of: opening, up a- market foi; our products in the- old- country. It has been said that it is- necessary to send this miserable handful of. men in khaki in order to prove our loyalty. </para>

Their visit will be of. no advantage- to Australia, and. no pleasure to thousands, perhaps millions, of: persons who may be looking, at the pageant. The money could be very well expended in some other way, proving, our loyalty to the Empire, and being profitable, to Australia. </para>

                    <para>- If I thought that tha money. which is asked for this display was to be spent in the best possible way; I should, not take up any time, but I hold that the- most useless way for its expenditure has been proposed. If there is anything, which the people in the old country, and I think the people in the Commonwealth, are heartily sick of, it is this constant display of militarism. Surely the display of militarism during, the last three years has been sufficient to satisfy the greatest gluttons for that sort of thing. The miserable display which 150 Australians can make in the streets- of London will not enhance- the opinion of British people as to. the greatness- of this- Commonwealth. It will be a very beggarly-display. It will do no good, but a great deal of- harm. It will be calculated to give the people in the old. country a- very- small opinion- of: the Commonwealth. Even if- a military- display were a new. thing, it would not be wise for us to send military men to the old country to represent a peaceful community such as Australia is* When it comes to the pinch I suppose we can fight a great deal better than- can. some of the people of some of: the- military countries who are preparing, for war all the time. But we have made no pretence to be a military people, and it is a lucky thing that we have not. Surely we can find some more fitting representation of - Australia than, a contingent of- 150 men ? The suggestion to erect in London- an arch typical of Australia&#39;s industries- is a very happy one. It would do this country a great deal more good than would a visit by 150 soldiers for a few days. A picture of the arch would be published in all the illustrated newspapers. The knowledge of its erection to celebrate the coronation of the King. would be spread over a greater distance than the length of- the streets of London. The illustrated papers would be distributed throughout the length and breadth of the old. country, and in that way the resources of: Australia would be made known to people- w-ho were unable to visit London to see the pageant. It- will be remembered that after- the Federal Parliament was opened-, many persons- came from all points to see the arches- which had been left standing, in the streets of Melbourne. If we are to have these celebrations, let them be carried out with the best taste. The Government are going about the matter in the. worst way. Instead of following, an old hackneyed course, let us have something, which is in touch with the spirit of the times. Various suggestions have been made to devote this sum of &#163;16,000 to a more useful purpose than a. military display. It has been suggested that by its- expenditure the poor might be given a holiday. </para>

                        <para>- At the time of the Diamond Jubilee, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Lipton, the Glasgow millionaire, gave &#163;20,000 to the poor of the old country, and I dare say it did more real good than did all the other money spent on that great celebration. Our &#163;16,000 would do a great deal more good if it were devoted to that purpose than to sending a contingent to London. Again, if it were spent on the families of those men who have fallen on the battlefield in South Africa, it would do a great deal more good than by providing a picnic for 150 men. There are many ways in which the money could be better spent. I am opposed to voting the money for a contingent, and I hope that a better means will be found for its expenditure. </para>

                    <para>- I am not in agreement with the members of the party with which I usually vote, and I wish to give some of the reasons why I take up a different attitude. It has been pointed out that it is not a party question. Of course, parties cannot be bound together except on broad principles. No party could be kept together on ordinary details, because on most questions we must be allowed to exercise our private judgment. The views I am about to express are, I believe, shared by the majority of the electors of this State, and if I have formed a wrong estimate of public feeling, I must accept the responsibility of my vote. Sometimes our judgment is obscured by the introduction of side-issues. This discussion has covered a good deal of ground. It seems to me that a lot of the matter which has been introduced might have been left out, because this Bill raises no question of loyalty. The fact that we are asked to follow a certain course - one which we may never be asked to take again in our lifetime - does not raise the question of showing our loyalty. We are asked by the British Government to. do a thing in a certain way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is consistent. He says straight out that he will have nothing to do with this business, and will vote against the Bill. But when we come to examine the divergence of opinion amongst its other opponents, what do we find We find that they cannot agree on any single thing. One suggests an arch, a second advocates illuminations, a third desires the Prime Minister to represent the Commonwealth, and a fourth suggests something else. If the proposals embodied in the Bill are wrong, I cannot see that it is right to allow the Prime Minister to go and represent the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That is a different matter. The proposal is not to spend &#163;100,000, and I do not suppose any one in his wildest moments would propose that &#163;100,000 should be spent in sending men from Australia or any of the British colonies. What is the difference between spending &#163;13,000 or &#163;15,000 on the erection of an arch, and spending it on the despatch of a contingent of 150 men1? </para>

                        <para>- The erection of an arch has been proposed, and I have heard honorable senators say that this appropriation of &#163;23,000 will not cover the total expenditure in connexion with the coronation ceremonial. We have been told that later on we shall receive a bill for something more than we are prepared to vote on this occasion. If that assumption is right - I am not saying that it is, because we have had the statement of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to the contrary - we can deal with the extra demand when it is made. As to the erection of an arch, it might cost &#163;5,000 or &#163;10,000, and, as far as I can see, there is no particular virtue in erecting such a structure in London. The resources of Australia have been advertised for many years past. The various States have maintained expensive establishments in London, and we have had permanent exhibitions which have enabled the people of Great Britain to know almost as well as we do what we can produce. Therefore, I see no merit in that proposal as an alternative to the proposals of the Bill. AVe ought to be consistent with regard to the matter. If we believe that it is wrong to be represented at the coronation, we should vote straight out against the Bill, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> proposes to do. But it would not be good form, or good taste, to set aside the wishes of the Imperial Government in this direction. </para>

Every one will admit that unless such an arch were erected in such a way as to exhibit the products of every part of Australia appropriately it would do more harm than good. It is doubtful whether there is sufficient time to carry out an idea of that kind in a proper manner. The subject will be taken into consideration by the Cabinet, and if they think anything can be done efficiently it will be mentioned again. But I certainly hope that no attempt will be made to introduce such a proposal in this Bill, because it would be foreign to the object of the measure, and it is very doubtful whether it would be beneficial, according to the information we have at present. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with some of the remarks that have been made to the effect that it is not necessary to send a contingent of troops to London for the purpose of showing our loyalty. That has been shown in a truer manner lately. We have manifested our willingness to sacrifice treasure and blood for the solidarity of the Empire. But I think we should be represented at the coronation festival. Our absence would be misunderstood and misrepresented in various parts of the world. It has always been the custom of people in any great festival to introduce the military element. It is hard to see why that is necessary. Certainly the military add to the pageantry. &#39; They produce a certain spectacular effect. They add the pomp, glitter, and circumstance of war. We have not yet freed ourselves from those barbaric tastes which make us enjoy demonstrations of that sort. But the presence of the military has another and deeper meaning, drawn from the past, and typical or emblematical of physical force and domination. I consider, however,, that it is not necessary to have a great military display on such an occasion as this. It would be more magnificent and more calculated to stimulate our pride in our Empire and our race if we had an exhibition of the varied resources of our world-wide possessions - if we showed our industrial power if we had a procession of industrial soldiers rather than military men, and a display of the triumphs of the arts and sciences rather than of the symbols of war. It would have been better if we had had an exhibition of the wonderful progress that has been made in the civilization of the world and the growth of the British Empire since the last coronation. </para>

                        <para>- Such a procession as I suggest would symbolize our progress, our prosperity, and our advance in the arts and sciences, and would have been&#39; infinitely better than the symbolising of mere brute force in a military display. It is not necessary for me to say that I dislike militarism, which has been the great curse of civilization. I sincerely trust that Australia will never have either a standing army or a citizen army. </para>

                        <para>- I am in favour of nothing but rifle clubs and artillery corps for the defence of our ports ; but &#34;that is a matter which can better be discussed when we are dealing with the Defence Bill. What is the condition -we are actually in1? We are invited as -guests to participate in the Coronation ceremony. It has been decided by other .portions of the British Empire - by Canada and New Zealand, &#34;for instance - to send military forces. We have been invited to join them. If we are represented at all, we must be represented by military forces. That is all we have been invited to send. We cannot go to a wedding without putting on a wedding garment. What number of troops shall we send ? Canada is sending 500, but Canada is 3,000 miles away from Great Britain, whilst we are 9,000 miles away. In my opinion, it would be quite sufficient if we-sent 100 troops, and if an amendment to that effect is proposed I shall support it. I remind honorable -senators that, when we were celebrating the birth of this young nation, Great Britain sent 1,000 troops to assist in our celebrations, and &#39;that is an additional reason why we should accept this invitation and send troops to Great Britain. It would have been better if the Government had proposed to send some &#39;Of the troops from South Africa. Many of them who have borne the heat and burden .of the day during the war are continually returning to Australia, and it is, I think, advisable that they should be given some recreation after the work they have .gone through. </para>

                    <para>- ! desire to take this opportunity of correcting a mistake which I made in speaking on the second reading of the Bill. I find that our <inline font-weight="bold">President, Sir Richard</inline> Baker, represented his &#34;State in Great Britain in 1SS4, and there was no bill afterwards presented in connexion with his visit. I am very pleased to be able to make that correction. I -.understand that there was a bill, but that it was presented, not to Parliament, but to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Baker himself. I think the common sense of .honorable senators must induce them to support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> This proposal to expend &#163;16,000 in sending a handful like 150 .men to represent the Commonwealth at the coronation celebrations is really the height of absurdity. If we intend to do a thing, we should do it thoroughly and well, .and if we desire to show the people of the old country, and those who may attend in London from other countries, the fighting power and military strength of Australia, we shall not do it with a miserable handful of 150 men. .Personalty, I think we should take no part in a military display, because we are not a fighting nation. We believe in defence, and not in aggression, and while we are prepared to defend ourselves, we have no desire to make any outward display of our power in order to intimidate others. I should imagine &#39;that when the Czar of Russia and the German Emperor see our 150 men they will be very careful what they say about us in the .&#34;future. Instead df having a lot of painted rags and powder, we should do something which will give the thousands of people who will line the streets of London on the day of the coronation some idea of what Australia really is, and what are its resources and possibilities. This is an opportunity in the lifetime of the nation -for the advertising of our goods and wares which we should not lose sight of. We have been striving for many years to get our products recognised and sought after in the markets of the old world, arid we have not succeeded. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has spoken as though the people of the old country know all about the products of Australia, but they do not. The number who come in contact with the Agents General of the different &#34;States, and who have seen the little exhibitions of Australian products at their offices, are very -few indeed. -But, if we built this arch which has been spoken of, we could show what Australia is capable of producing to the millions of people who will be in the streets of London upon that day, and pamphlets and other literature setting forth the resources of Australia could be distributed to the people at the same time. That -would be better than sending home troops at over &#163;100 a head for &#34;the celebration. I hope &#39;that &#34;this item will be omitted, and also the item providing for the illuminations. </para>

T do not think this is an occasion upon which we should arrange to advertise Australia. &#39;We have been invited to something like a banquet, and it is no occasion upon which to speak of the things which have here been spoken of. I think we are not treating the men who have been, and are now, in South Africa fighting on behalf of the Empire, and in our name, in quite a proper spirit. From the remarks made here to-day, I have been a good deal reminded of the charge which Rudyard Kipling makes against the &#34;British nation generally with regard to the soldier in times of peace, and his statement that a very different tone is adopted in the presence of danger. He says - </para>

The whole thing, however, is only a &#39;bald advertisement. The Minister for Defence-stated last night in, another place that Australia was doing a roaring business out of &#34;the war in South Africa, and the proposal to send 150&#39;troops to &#34;the coronation celebrations is only made in &#39;the interests of those &#34;people who have been described by <inline font-style="italic">Reynolds&#39; Newspaper</inline> as the &#34;frozen meat patriots,&#34; who are anxious that the war should be continued in order that they may put up the price of meat and other products, and reap the benefit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce;s</inline> suggestion that we should erect an arch in London is a sensible one : I think that an arch would be of far greater utility than a military display. Some honorable senators have said that 1 there would not be sufficient time to permit of its el&#39;ection, but those who were present at the Commonwealth celebrations must have seen the various arches which were erected, and some of &#39;which were completed only on the morning of the opening ceremonies.

                        <para>- I suppose our proposal would be .rejected because the British Government want a military display. They do not desire the arts of peace and industry to be &#39;represented ; &#34;they want a military display. There will be nothing but troops, the majority of whom have been bred and trained to kill their fellow men. .An industrial arch would demonstrate our loyalty - which some honorable senators are so anxious should be expressed, not to the British public, but to Joseph Chamberlain, Esquire - and the argument that it could not be erected in time has been refuted. The pageant in London will pass by millions of people, and the Australian military representatives will hardly be noticed. </para>

Honorable senators know that during the Commonwealth celebrations very little could be seen while the troops were passing through the streets. The greatest pleasure was derived by the people from parading the streets after the troops had passed, and inspecting the arches and decorations. I hope the amendment will be carried. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think honorable senators can be expected to vote for this proposal unless some reasons are advanced in its favour. If we read the reports of the various charitable institutions, we must recognise that a great deal of poverty exists in the chief cities of Australia. We need not go to the labour bureaus in order to ascertain the number of men unemployed in Mel bourne, Brisbane, and Sydney; we have merely to walk through the slums in order to satisfy ourselves that a number of our citizens have not enough to eat. King Edward himself has set us an example, as he proposes to give a dinner during the celebrations to half a million of loyal subjects. Should we not expend this &#163;5,500 in providing food for the poor instead of spending it upon fireworks, crackers, and other Chinese displays of rejoicing? The expenditure of that amount in gaudy and cheap red and yellow bunting, such as that with which the shops and houses of Melbourne were decorated during the Commonwealth celebrations, would be a great waste of money. We can do something far more substantial with it, and by carrying the amendment gladden for an hour at least the hearts of many people throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- This is a very plausible proposal, and doubtless it is meant to be very catching. I am determined that I shall not be caught napping or trapped by any little plausibility and cheap advertising. If honorable senators wish to show their benevolence to the poor of the various cities rather than to have these illuminations, there is a course open to them. I grant that there may be a better method of spending this money than by illuminating the Commonwealth buildings in the six capitals. But the money will not all be wasted, and it will be kept in the various States. Men will be employed in putting in gas-fittings and other means of illuminating buildings, so that tradesmen and others will get some benefit from the expenditure of the money. Each honorable senator who wishes to give some benefit to the poor of the cities should give one month&#39;s salary for that purpose, and if a blank is created I shall move an amendment to that effect. I have no hesitation in giving a written order to the Treasurer to stop one month&#39;s salary, provided that our good friends who are so liberal will do the same. The amendment is to some extent a piece of cheap advertising. I am not a very great lover of displays ; but ought we to quarrel over a slight expenditure in six cities at the time when the King is being crowned <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We might vote &#163;5,000 for the benefit of the poor on that occasion, and forego one month&#39;s salary. I should be only too glad to see the Government propose a grant of not merely &#163;5,000, but &#163;20,000 if need be, with a view of enabling the poor, not only in, the six capital cities, but in each centre of population throughout the Commonwealth, to take part in the rejoicings all over the Empire on the occasion of the coronation of the King. It is just as well for honorable senators to be unanimous at this particular time, and to agree that the expenditure of this money is not waste. I hope that the item will be passed in that rational and unanimous way in which I think it ought to be done. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH (Western Australia).I cannot agree with the remarks of the last speaker. If we look at the matter from a rational point of view we should accord our support to the amendment. It is proposed to spend the money purely for sentimental purposes. Which is the better way to spend the money - to bring joy into the lives of hundreds of people, or to put up certain emblems on our public buildings ? Which way would the King himself favour <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> What does he propose to do with his own money ? He has said that he will entertain 500,000 persons who are practically foodless. Surely that is an example which we might copy. I do not know of any better way of spending the money than to feed those who are hungry and starving. What could be better than to take the old people in the old colonists&#39; homes or immigrants&#39; homes, and make, at any rate, one day joyful to them - to give them even a supply of tobacco and creature comforts which perhaps they are denied. Certainly it would be better than to. spend the money on emblems and fireworks. </para>

I have been charged with wishing to advertise myself because I propose that this sum of &#163;5,500 shall be devoted to the entertainment of the poor in the capital cities. I had no desire to advertise myself. It is necessary for me to reply to the honorable senator who, in such an ungracious way, attacked the supporters of this amendment. I think he should not have been allowed to goon with his remarks, but since he was permitted to proceed it is only right that I should be allowed to reply to him. If I had received at the hands of my fellow-men the same testimonials as some other members have done, I might be in a position to afford to give &#163;33 for the entertainment of the poor. </para>

But I say again, that if I had received from my fellow-men, whose cause I had advocated so strenuously, such large sums as some honorable senators have done, I might be able to spend money as suggested.

                    <para>- May I call the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to the wording of an amendment passed last night at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> ? It reads : - &#34; No aboriginal native of Asia, Africa, or the islands of the Pacific but there is no definition of what is meant by the islands of the Pacfic. In the reply read by the Vice-President of the Executive Council to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> question, he stated that the Colonial office had, amongst other things, referred to the question of the relations of Australia and New Zealand with &#34; other islands of the Pacific,&#34; clearly showing that the Colonial-office considers that New Zealand is a portion of the islands of the Pacific. We ourselves have also recognised that already, because in the Pacific Island Labourers Bill which we passed recently the definition of a Pacific Island labourer is that the term includes &#34; all persons not of European extraction in the Pacific other than the islands of New Zealand.&#34; We specially exempted New Zealand from the definition of the islands of the Pacific ; and having done that in one case, I would draw attention to the fact that a similar exemption should be made in this Bill, because I certainly did not understand from the discussion that took place last night that there was any objection to Maories who may be in the Commonwealth receiving a vote. </para>

                <para>I understand that the Tariff will reach the Senate by that time. There really is no business except private members&#39; business to bo done, and I do not think I am justified in asking honorable senators who have to come, from distant States to attend next week for the purpose of discussing private members&#39; business. I may also mention a matter personal to myself and to my colleague, the Postmaster-General. We have a good deal of work to do in connexion with the Tariff before it is introduced in the Senate, and the adjournment will give us time that otherwise we should not have, because while the Senate is sitting the greater part of our time is fully occupied. </para>

                    <para>- I am very sorry to find myself in opposition to the Government. On the last occasion when it was proposed from the opposition side to adjourn the Senate, I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> saying that it was not in the interest of the dignity of this Chamber to have these repeated adjournments. I do not think that anything has happened since then to alter the position. The business-paper is full of motions to be proposed by private members. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has a most important measure to be considered. There is also the question of the standing orders. Do the Government propose to abandon private members&#39; business altogether, or to prevent them from discussing it? It is usual in all parliamentary assemblies to give private members an opportunity of bringing forward business, but in this case that course appears to have been abandoned. I venture to think that if the Senate adjourns for a week, private members will have no opportunity this session of bringing forward business. </para>
