At about . 12.30 o'clock to-day I met some honorable senators, and asked them whether they thought that the feeling of the Senate would be in favour of going on with the consideration of the Tariff to-day, and they all said that they thought it would not be convenient to do so. Clearly it would not have been wise for me, when I was asked- </para>

                            <para>- Originally I thought that we should be able to go on at once with the consideration of the Customs Tariff Bill, and I was prepared to do so if it was the wish of the Senate. But when I found that it was not the desire of a number of honorable senators to go on with its consideration to-day, I hoped that we should be able to consider the amendments of the other House in the Electoral Bill, and I arranged to do so. A few minutes ago, however, a message was sent to me that so many amendments had been made that a reprint of the Bill would not be ready for distribution to honorable senators to-day. Therefore, reluctantly, I have to forego this opportunity of asking the Senate to deal with the amendments in that Bill. What I propose to do is to ask the Senate to-morrow to deal with the amendments in that Bill, and a motion relative to the Governor-General's establishment, and if agreeable to postpone the consideration of the Tariff until Tuesday. </para>

                    <para>- I think that upon this motion it is proper to draw attention to the delay which is being created for some purpose or to suit somebody. The Senate adjourned for three weeks in order that the Tariff might be ready to bc gone on with when we resumed. Undoubtedly it was ready to go on with to-day. The message of the House of Representatives is here, but the Minister in charge of Government business has been making inquiries among certain senators - how many he has not told us - and lias come to the conclusion that the matter should be adjourned. Some honorable senators arrived in Melbourne by train only to-day, but without waiting to see how many members would be present, the Minister has shunted the business, and we are now told that this urgent matter is not to be dealt with until next week. Some senators have been brought over from Western Australia to attend to-day; some have come from Queensland ; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has come from attending to a very important duty of an urgent public character ; and the New South Wales senators have travelled a fairly long distance to attend to business which they expected would be transacted. Time after time, during the last month or two, it has been stated by Ministers that we on this side of the Senate were unduly delaying the whole business of the Commonwealth in order to propose amendments in the Tariff. It was charged against us, as a sort of political offence of which we were guilty, that we proposed amendments. But now, when all things have been arranged for the consummation of the business as far as possible, for some reason the matter is to be postponed. I have spoken, I think, to the majority of the members of the Senate who are in the chamber now, and, with one exception, I have not heard a whisper as to a desire to postpone the consideration of the Tariff. When there has been so much alleged delay in the past, to ask for fi whole week's delay at this stage is absolutely reprehensible. Of course, we know the reason why the adjournment is asked for. It is bad form to mention it, but I am not going to mince matters from considerations of good form or bad when the public interest is concerned. We know perfectly well that this matter is to be postponed to accommodate a Minister who is engaged elsewhere in the practice of his profession. </para>

It is preposterous that the whole business of the Commonwealth should be delayed in regard to so important a matter as the settlement of the Tariff for I a whole week to accommodate the professional exigencies of any member of the Senate or any member of the Government. I protest against the postponement of this matter for an entire week. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot allow the opportunity to go by without also protesting against the action j of the Government. We have frequently asked the Government to give us an additional day's adjournment, but when we | have done so we have been met with the assurance that the Government were deeply ! anxious to press on with the consideration of the Tariff and other important i matters as rapidly as possible. Now 1 we know that all the time they were making protestations of that character they were speaking with their tongue in their ! cheek. Whether or not it was possible for i the Government to proceed with the Tariff this week, it clearly was possible for them to favour us with notice of their intentions. We have been brought here to-day from all parts of the Commonwealth for the purpose of meeting for half-an-hour. This appears to me to be a scandalous way of treating the Senate, and it is all the more scandalous for the reason that the Government have not offered any reasonable excuse as to why they are not prepared to go on with the business. It is true that some sort of excuse is made by laying the responsibility on the Government Printer; but I do not know whether the Government intend to make that plea seriously. To say that because the Government Printer could not get the work through the business of the Senate should be delayed for 24 hours is ridiculous nonsense. </para>

                        <para>- If that be so, there lias been an attempt to mislead the Senate, and, therefore, the case is so much the worse. But, in any case, there was absolutely nothing in the nature of the work required to be done in the printing-office to prevent the Bill being here if the Government had been prepared to go on with it. With regard to the Tariff, I had anticipated that the Government would to-day have placed it before us with some announcement as to the course of action they proposed to follow. After that, an adjournment till tomorrow would have been reasonable to afford honorable senators time to give to the Tariff, as it comes back to us from the House of Representatives, the attention that it is entitled to receive. But to bring honorable senators here from distant States, and then to tell them that there is nothing to do, is treatment that is not only unworthy of the Government and discourteous to the Senate, but is absolutely contradictory of all the previous protestations made by the Government as to their desire to proceed with public business. We know now that those protestations were merely an empty sham. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps the honorable senator will allow me to state the position more fully. If the motion before the Senate had not been moved, we should have at once gone into committee on the Bill. I should have left the Chair, because the Senate has already resolved that on the receipt of a message from elsewhere the committee should have leave to sit again. Therefore, no motion would have been necessary if the Postmaster-General had not desired to postpone the consideration of the message. Consequently the matter before us is only that of the postponement of the consideration of the message. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the extreme importance of the matter, I think that it was the duty of the Government to make some statement, and that they ought to have informed us what "course of action they meant to follow, and what they meant to do in regard to any renewed request that might be made, or what they proposed to do in the other House. I think that on this occasion it might also have been a very proper thing for you, sir, as President of the Senate, to give expression to your views as to the course which it is possible for this Chamber to take in certain eventualities that might arise. It is not right for the Government to say, " Go at once into committee,'" and then for the Senate to proceed with committee work without knowing anything as to what the procedure will be in regard to the results of the committee work. It is the duty of the Government to make this clear, and I should like to have had under cover of the motion a statement as to the position between the two Houses. But as you have ruled that I cannot discuss that point, I suppose I must take my seat. </para>

                    <para>- I am very sorry to see the position in which the Senate is put, and I should like the Postmaster-General to give us an idea as to who were the senators who requested him to take the action which he proposes to take on this occasion. I knew nothing about it, and I am sure that the other honorable senators who came over from New South Wales this morning knew very little about it, except what they might have seen in the newspapers. If we are to be guided by the newspapers and not by the announcements we receive, and the motions that we carry here, it will be a very improper state of affairs. If I had imagined that we were not going on with the consideration of the Tariff today, I certainly should not have left Sydney, where I had important public work to do. I came back, because I thought the Tariff was to be brought forward to-day. I should like to ask whether, in the event of this motion that we go into committee next Tuesday being lost, the Senate will go into committee on the Tariff straight away? There seems to be some doubt in the minds of honorable senators, but it seems clear to me that on receipt of the message from another place, we should go straight into committee. If the motion submitted by the Postmaster-General is not carried, what is there to prevent us from going on with the Tariff? Everywhere I go, whether in Victoria, New South Wales, or South Australia - and those who have been recently in Queensland say the same thing - everybody wants the Tariff to be got through as soon as possible. Whatever the ultimate form of the Tariff may be, the people want it to be finished so that they may go on with their business. It was very unfair of the Government not to notify to honorable senators that they could not go on with business today, and not to give us an intimation of the time when they would be able to proceed with it. In that case, many honorable senators would not have returned to Melbourne. We have been unfairly treated, and have every right to complain. I hope that in future we shall not be treated in the same way. </para>

I feel confident that the Postmaster-General is just as anxious as is any honorable senator that we should proceed with it. It seems to me that there was no other course open to the Government. Even if it had been practicable to proceed with the consideration of the Electoral Bill to-day, the suspension of the standing orders would have been a necessary preliminary. I have grave doubts whether we should ever suspend the standing orders save in cases of extreme urgency, and if it had been proposed I do not think that I should have agreed to their suspension to-day to enable the Electoral Bill to be considered. I rejoice that we shall be able to proceed with it to-morrow, and no time will be wasted if we deal with it finally then or on Friday, when we shall be able to proceed with the Tariff on Tuesday. Complaints have been made by honorable senators from New South Wales that they have travelled something like 1,000 miles to attend here to-day, only to find that there is no business to engage their attention. I make no complaint because of the fact that I have had to travel from Tasmania under more disagreeable conditions, only to be faced with the same situation. I feel that it is the duty of every honorable senator to attend, when the Senate re-assembles from time to time, and to do his utmost to further the transaction of any business that may be brought forward. 1 therefore express no feeling of disappointment in regard to the present situation. </para>

                    <para>- It is amusing to find the honorable and learned senator for Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> supporting the Government. He is evidently sailing in the same boat as the Government. That is to say, the leader of the Government in this Chamber is absent, and the leader of the Opposition is also absent. My honorable and learned friend supports the Government because it suits his book to do so. I fail to see why we should not proceed to-day with the Tariff. As to the statement made by the two innocent honorable senators from New South Wales - Senators Pulsford and Millen - that they expected a statement from the Government, showing exactly what they proposed to do in regard to the Tariff, any man of common sense must see that there is only one way in which the Government can deal with what has been done in another place. The Government agreed, in the first instance, to the Tariff as introduced in this Chamber, and fought for every line in it. It stands to reason, therefore, that they will agree with what another place has done in regard to the amendments requested by us, and will fight every line in order to uphold the decision of the House of Representatives. That is the only straightforward course which they could adopt. </para>

                        <para>- They have hitherto adopted a fairly straightforward course, and they would hardly go back upon themselves on this occasion. If they did, they might possibly find that some of their supporters were not to be depended upon. It appears to me that there is not the slightest necessity for failing to proceed with the Tariff to-day. We came here fully prepared to deal with it, knowing exactly the position we should take up, and that we might try to fight our battles over again. The position that the Government will take up has been palpable from the first, and but for the fact that the leader of the Government in the Senate, and the leader of the Opposition, are away attending to their own private business, we should not have had this request for an adjournment. The fact of the matter is that the Federal Parliament and the Federal Government are ruled to far too great an extent by lawyers. There are many lawyers in the Ministry. The leader of the Opposition in another place is a lawyer, and the leader of the Opposition in the Senate is a lawyer. The legal members appear to consider that the)' should look after their own private business first, and attend o the work of the country subsequently. Many of us have travelled something like 1,000 miles in order to attend to-day to what, we believe to be the most important business of the session. We should not have done so except for the belief that the Tariff would be brought on, but we have come here only to find that our work cannot be carried on, and that the Tariff cannot be settled at the earliest possible moment, simply because there are rather too many lawyers in the House of Representatives on the one hand, and in the Senate on the other. </para>

                        <para>- We should get on a little better if those who are lawyers would, to a greater extent, sacrifice their own business to the requirements of the country. When they take upon them* selves the position of representatives of the people, they should attend to their public engagements, and allow their private work to stand over. That is what many of us have to do, and the)' should act in the same way as an ordinary honorable senator does. I have allowed my private affairs to be put aside in order that I may be here, and I know that many other honorable senators have done so. </para>

Lawyers are very necessary in their place, and sometimes they are exceedingly useful here. But it seems to me to be a pity that, because certain legal members occupy important positions here, we should have to delay our business. It should not be so, but the fact is that we are not in a position to proceed with business without the presence of these gentlemen. </para>

                        <para>- I do not. I think we all regret the absence of the leader of the Opposition, but he occupies an exceptional position. It is unfair that we should have only one paid Minister in this House. If, because of sickness or some other reason, the Postmaster-General could not attend, and necessity compelled the absence of the only other Minister in this Chamber, what would be our position ? The position is one which we should resent. I shall raise my objection to it on every possible occasion, and will not let it drop until it has been remedied.

                <para>Minister, the paid Ministers of the Crown should be a little more unselfish. I think the time has come for plain speaking. There is an undoubted manifestation of selfishness on the part of the paid members of the Ministry, which is certainly not very commendable. I do not think that their attitude in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> says much for their magnanimity. The time has come when the Senate should demand in language which cannot be misunderstood that there should be a second paid Minister in the Senate, in order that the business of the country may be transacted and our duties discharged in a proper way. </para>

                    <para>- I did not at first intend to speak to this motion, but I have felt constrained to rise owing to the interjection made just now by the Post master- General that the delay in dealing with the Tariff is not in any way due to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> absence. It was stated in the press this morning that an adjournment would be suggested to-day, and as the Postmaster-General has proposed that the consideration of the Tariff should be adjourned till Tuesday next, it is clear that the announcement in the press emanated from the Government. I desire to know why honorable senators were not informed in advance that this step would be taken? It is perfectly clear that for some days past the Government have been resolved to adopt the course now proposed. </para>

He expects us to be very confiding indeed when he requests us to accept that statement. Still, we are bound to accept it, and I presume that there is some explanation which the Minister cannot give to-day. Honorable senators on both sides are prepared to go on with the business, and I see 710 reason whatever for its postponement until next Tuesday. </para>

                    <para>- I am at one with those who deprecate the great waste of time involved in the postponement of the consideration of this matter until next week. I also deprecate the personal attacks made upon absent senators. My own opinion is that we shall get through the Tariff much more quickly if both Senators O'Connor and Symon remain out of the Chamber, because they take up more time than any other two members of the Senate. I am quite sure that in the absence of one of them, at least, we were getting on splendidly, and when the honorable and learned senator returned we got into the old way of taking up a great deal of time unnecessarily. Senator Pulsford is anxious to know what the Government propose to do, and in the interests of honorable senators who sit in the labour corner, I suggest that a bargain be made. The Government should say what attitude they propose to adopt, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> on behalf of the Opposition should say what was agreed to in the caucus this morning. </para>

Some honorable senators seem to think that the Tariff ought to be a permanent subject of debate in the Federal Parliament, and they are anxious to keep it going for ever. I, for one, deprecate that kind of tiling. I was in great hopes, owing to the handsome way in which the House of Representatives has met the requests of this Chamber, that we should be able to put it through finally here in a few days. </para>

I went from here at 1 2.30 o'clock, and devoted a great part of the time, which should have been given to my midday meal to getting ready to go on with the Electoral Bill this afternoon. I was preparing to do so until five or ten minutes before the time for the meeting of the Senate when I got information from the Government Printer that he would not be able to supply copies of the amendments for the convenience of honorable senators. That has also been doubted, but it is perfectly correct, because although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has said that he saw a copy of the Bill some time ago in which the amendments had been printed, some in black letter, and some in erased type, before the amendments had been made, it was necessary to send the message dealing with the amendments, and that message consists of twelve -sheets, and 196 amendments. </para>

                        <para>- I understood the honorable senator to invite the Senate to believe that the explanation that we could not go on with the Electoral Bill this afternoon because the necessary papers had not been received from the Government Printer, was not the true one. It is possible that if this discussion lasts much longer the Government Printer will have them printed and sent up, in which case there will be no obstacle to our going on. I desire to point out that what I stated previously is perfectly correct, and no delay taking place in connexion with the consideration of the Tariff this afternoon is due to the absence of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, the leader of the Opposition, or any one else. I should have carried out my intention to go on with the Tariff if it had not been that up till half-past twelve every honorable senator I consulted upon the subject seemed to think that the better course would be to postpone its consideration, and go on with the Electoral Bill this afternoon, and that Bill would have been considered if it had not been for the difficulty in supplying copies of the amendments. I know that some, honorable senators from other States feel that it is a hardship that after they are brought here there should be no work for them to do. But they must know, if they have considered the matter, that it is impossible for a representative of the Government to declare beforehand what the Senate is going to do. It is impossible for the Government to say that certain business will be proceeded with or be postponed, and that is a reason why the publication of a paragraph such as that to which I have referred is to be deprecated. Honorable senators seeing such a paragraph will consider, as one honorable senator has suggested, that it was inspired, and will look upon it as an invitation to them to stop away. I very much regret that such a paragraph should have appeared. I say again, and it is known to a great many honorable senators, that my intention was to go straight on with the Tariff until half-past twelve today, when it appeared to me to be the general wish of honorable senators to postpone its consideration to a future date and go on with the Electoral Bill. </para>
