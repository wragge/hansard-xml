He struck me then as being a man of singular brightness of character, conscientiousness, and determination to do right. &#39; I have  always had that in my mind ever since I met him. During his public career I have noticed particularly that that characteristic has always kept him to the front, and earned for him the respect of all who knew him. Those of his colleagues who knew him best are those who appreciated him most. In <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> we have one who assisted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse</inline> in his first step in life, and I am sure that he will bear testimony to his high character. &#34;We all condole with hiswidow and his relatives, and we must feel that not only the Commonwealth, but Tasmania also, has suffered a great loss. </para>

          <para>- I have seldom had a sadder duty to perform than to support this motion. I knew the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse</inline> for 35 or 40 years, and, as he reminded me a year ago, he commenced his career as a junior clerk to the firm of Giblin and Dobson, of which I was a member. He was in every way a self-made man. I think the great cause of his success was his sterling character. He was a man of true honour and fair-mindedness in everything he did. He seemed to grasp immediately the principles underlying conveyancing, and when he was managing clerk for Messrs. Roberts and Allport he was of the greatest use to that firm.&#39; The training which he got there, and which he gave himself, was of the utmost value to him in his career in the State Parliament, and in his short career in the Federal Parliament. There was no man to whom one went more readily to be helped out with an intricate subject. He had a great grasp of mathematics ; he was a good financier; he had a knowledge of detail, and an accuracy of fact about every subject with which he dealt, and it was a very great pleasure indeed to be associated with him in any public affair; He was  president  of our Federal League in Hobart, and did most excellent work in the cause of Australian unity. In many ways he was associated with the philanthropic and social life of Tasmania, and his death will bo an immense loss to Hobart and the people generally. I had the pleasure of joining <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piesse</inline> in part of my federal campaign, and I marvelled at the goodness and unselfishness of my comrade. With reference to his widow and children, words fail me to say what their sorrow must be. He was a splendid type of manhood, and the loss they have sustained is irreparable. </para>

          <para>- I shall state in a few words the opinion which I have formed since the adjournment, and after having an opportunity to more carefully consider this clause which, I think, was rushed on us last night. I object to any arbitrary enactment that the State shall be divided into as many districts as there are members to be returned to the other House. I do not object to a commission being appointed, to inquire and report to both Houses, as to whether it is expedient to treat each State as one electorate, or as to what districts it is expedient to divide the State into. We are not in a position to judge about the clause. Even if we think we are in a good enough position to decide that there shall be some districts, we are in no position to say that they shall be single districts, or what they shall be. From that point of view, I intend to oppose the clause, and, when we come to the next clause, to move an amendment, to provide for the appointment of a commission to inquire and report as to the expediency or otherwise of dividing the States into districts, and if expedient what districts they should be divided into. If we assent to the clause in its present form, we decide that the States shall be divided into single-member districts for the purpose of the House of Representatives. I think there is an overwhelming public feeling, throughout the greater portion of the Commonwealth, that the States should not be so divided. If my amendment is carried, the report of the commissioners to both Houses will afford us an opportunity of deciding whether or not we should alter the existing law. </para>

          <para>- It appears to me that my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> has got himself into a hole on this matter. He tells us that he does not believe in delegating our powers, so far as concerns deciding upon the electoral divisions, to the House of Representatives, but that he is quite willing to delegate them to commissioners. Honorable senators who have had any experience of commissions will &#39;know very well that if we have six commissions representing six different States to tell us how. we are to divide the Commonwealth into constituencies, the chances are that we shall have six different opinions. At all events we shall have more than one, and thus we shall make &#34;confusion worse confounded.&#34; I contend that it is the duty of Parliament to decide whether the divisions for the House of Representatives shall be single, double, or triple electorates. It is not for us to delegate to commissions the duty which devolves upon us. After the commissioners had brought up their report we should be in no better position for deciding whether the House of Representatives should be divided into single electorates or not, than we are now. I suppose 1 there is not an honorable senator who has not come to a conclusion as to the best mode of division. My reading, study, and experience  lead me to say that we cannot do better than have single electorates. All kinds of systems have been tried in all parts of the world where there is representative government, and I hardly know of a case where single electorates have not been returned to. In France, after repeated trials, it was found that single electorates were fairer in the interests of the minority as well as &#39;of the majority. At one time the whole city of Paris was taken as one electoral division. The result was that the socialists swept the polls from end to end and got practically the whole of the seats. But after Paris returned to single electorates the result was different. Some parts of Paris returned socialistic members, other parts returned members holding different views. </para>

            <para>- Undoubtedly the socialists have a majority, but the minority never got a show until Paris was divided into single electorates. Then we have the experience of the mother country. For some years they tried the system of three-member electorates, each voter having two votes. But they have practically returned to the system of single member electorates. The same has happened in &#34;Victoria and New South &#34;Wales. We also have the experience of Belgium, Germany,, and other parts of the world, in which various systems have been tried. They have universally returned to the adoption of single electorates. I believe that single electorates will be best for the House o&#163; Representatives. </para>

          <para>- I understood that the principle of single electorates meant one member for each electorate. That is why I interjected that Belgium has adopted the proportional system. Of course, the country must be divided into electorates for that system, but there are several members for each district. Since I spoke last evening, I have come to the conclusion that the best method we can adopt, seeing that there is a desire amongst honorable senators to apply the Hare system to both Houses, should the Government succeed in applying it to the Senate, would be to strike out of clause 13 all the words after the word &#34;divisions.&#34; The effect of that would be to leave a blank. We could then proceed with the Bill as we did with the Immigration Restriction Bill, after which, if we altered the principle of the measure, we could come back and fill up the blank according to the decision of the committee. I am extremely anxious that the- Hare system should be applied to both Houses, and not merely to one. I have already endeavoured to show how detrimental the single-electorate system -would be to the interests of all those who are desirous of introducing reforms in the Commonwealth. I am justified in saying, from opinions expressed in the South Australian Houses of Legislature, that single electorates are  condemned  in that State. </para>

        <para class="block">If there is any merit in the proposal for treating the Senate elections in the method proposed by the Bill, there must be equally good grounds for applying the same principle to elections for the House of Representatives. Surely the principle for which the Vice-President of the Executive Council fought last evening with so much zeal and ability is worthy of being applied to both Chambers. Why should there be any differentiation between the two Houses in regard to the method of election ? While I feel that it is extremely inconvenient to move an amendment at this stage - and I make no secret of the fact that I move it because I fear that the proportional voting system may be applied to the Senate, to which I am opposed - yet; if we are to have the system rammed down our throats, I propose to do a little bit of ramming on my own account in regard to the House of Representatives. We should not be selfish in this matter. If proportional representation is such a very splendid thing, we should not monopolize it for the Senate. The House of Representatives should be permitted to enjoy the same benefits and privileges as are to be given to us. There is no excuse for introducing, the proportional representation system, except that which is afforded by the unfortunate example of Tasmania. There the principle has been applied to both Houses. As we have to go to Tasmania for our example, and that example shows that the principle is applicable to both Houses, let us accept the proposition in its entirety, and not nibble at so splendid a reform. I cannot see how the VicePresident of the Executive Council can contend that the Senate should be elected under a totally different set of circumstances or by a totally different method from the House of Representatives. I join issue to some extent with my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> as to the eminent desirability of single-seat electorates. I have sat for a constituency returning three members which subsequently returned four, and when it was divided into single electorates, I represented one of the divisions for many years until I entered the Federal Parliament. I have tried both methods, and am not enamoured altogether of either one or the other. But if some opportunity for the representation of a minority is insisted upon, we must, at least, have constituencies returning two members each. I have had the experience of three, four, and singlemember constituencies ; I should like to try the experiment of a double electorate. I should prefer double to single electorates, provided that we are to have sections of the people represented in our Parliament rather than districts of some geographical area. The inconvenience caused by the failure of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> an assurance sufficiently satisfactory to enable this clause to be taken as read-- </para>

I do not think there can be any doubt as to what will be the opinion of the committee upon it. Something has been said about the opinion of Australia on the question.

            <para>- I am speaking of the latest expression of opinion in all the States, and it is undoubted that single electorates afford a method by which the best representation can be secured in the House of Representatives. That has been determined by New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia, and I think, to a large extent, by Queensland. In the case of South Australia and Tasmania, each State was polled as one electorate for the House of Representatives. During last session the Government of South Australia made a proposal in the local Parliament to divide the State into single electorates. That proposal was not proceeded with, at the request of the Federal Government, on the ground that we were undertaking the duty. At the request of this Government, and with a view to this legislation, the Government of South Australia held its hand. Therefore I may take it that practically throughout Australia there has been a general expression of opinion in favour of single electorates. First of all, as the opinion of Australia has been appealed to, I point out that it is all the one way. The next question is whether the decision is founded upon reason. I admit that if in some moment of temporary insanity all these States had decided to adopt a system which ought not to be applied, we should not adopt it here. But is it not altogether in accordance with the best interests of the different States that there should be single electorates for the House of Representatives? Undoubtedly there should be a division of electorates if we desire to obtain the best representation of the people. In the course of an interesting speech, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> gave us an illustration of the adoption of the principle in other countries. He put the matter in a true light when he showed that by the division of a country into single electorates, we get such a diversity of opinion expressed in the electorates, that in the result a very fair representation of the general opinion of the country is obtained. I will not say that in this way we secure the representation of a minority, because notwithstanding what my honorable friends opposite have said we have never contended that there should be representation of a minority as a minority. There is one reason in support of the division of the States into electorates that seems to stand out pre-eminently, namely, that we ought to have regard to local conditions - in the larger sense- in the representation in the House of Representatives. We cannot have it, I think, in accordance with the principles of the Constitution, in the Senate, but we ought to have it where the people are represented as a people in the House of Representatives. The reason for it is this : We have different interests dealt with in the Commonwealth Parliament which must in many instances have a local application. Take, for example, the incidence of customs duty. We may have a question as to whether our policy should be a revenue-producing or a protective one. The policy might have the effect of protecting the produce or trade of some particular portion of the Commonwealth, and it might affect one portion of the Commonwealth in a way altogether different from what would be its effect in another portion. I have given the illustration of Queensland, but illustrations may be derived from other States. There ought to be some means by which localities in the Commonwealth should be able to be represented when the interests of those localities come before the Commonwealth Parliament for discussion. I say that the division ofthe States into electorates is principally to secure adequate and true representation of the people of the Commonwealth in the House of Representatives, and that, in the second place, Australia has spoken in no uncertain voice in affirmation of the principle of single electorates. The Senate ought to adopt that view, and carry the clause as it is. Here the simple question is - &#34; Single electorates or not.&#34; There can be only one opinion on the point, and I hope that the committee will come to a decision as soon as possible. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales).I cannot help regretting that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> has seen fit to submit his amendment at this stage. The suggestion I threw out to the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and which he very promptly acceded to, was that we should postpone any debatable point raised by the amendment until we found out what honorable senators proposed to do in the matter of the application of proportional representation to the Senate. I point out the position in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> places those who take the view of the subject that I take. It is evident that he proposes to apply the Hare principle to the House of Representatives, and to have the States divided into subdivisions for that House. If the system of proportional representation is applied to the House of Representatives, each State for the purposes of that House, must remain as one division, because there must be uniformity. It would be absurd to divide the little State of Tasmania into five divisions for the House ofRepresentatives, and to have it polled as one electorate for six senators, and yet if that were not done the larger States must also be polled as one electorate for the House of Representatives. For that reason it will be impossible for me, even with every desire to make the practice with regard to both Houses uniform, to support the amendment. I suggest to the honorable senator that he should withdraw his amendment, and let usproceed with Part 3, when, having had our fight over the application of the principle of proportional representation to the Senate, we shall have an assurance, if we are successful in carrying our views, that there will be a further opportunity of reviewing Part 3. </para>

          <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> has been well advised to withdraw his amendment. The reason for the amendment is that the honorable senator is possibly more in love with proportional representation than are the Government. If it is his object to apply that system all round I must confess that the Vice-President of the Executive Council seems to have met the honorable senator with great fairness. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has said that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> wishes to apply proportional representation to the House of Representatives an opportunity will be afforded him to do so if that principle is adopted for the Senate. I point out that there are one or two reasons why this clause should not be hastily dismissed. It is a very debatable question whether this Federal Parliament should divide the States into electoral districts. It might, I think, be strongly contended that that is a duty which should be left to the States themselves. I remind honorable senators of the provision of the Constitution with regard to the division of States for the House of Representatives. It is distinctly different from the provision made with regard to the Senate. The Constitution, I admit, seems to imply that the desire of the framers of it was that for the Senate the States should vote as one electorate. But it also seems to imply that it was not so certain that another plan might not be adopted with regard to the House of Representatives. Section 29, dealing with the House of Representatives, provides - </para>

If that is so, I remind the honorable senator that we are not returning equal favour to the other House, because we are now distinctly attempting to legislate for the House of Representatives. </para>

            <para>- I am using it perfectly seriously. TheVice-President of the Executive Council says that we ought to have divisions made with reference to localities solely in order that the various discrepancies of the incidence of customs duties may be regulated, and yet the Constitution says that in dealing with taxation we must not discriminate between parts of the same State. I recognise that the honorable and learned senator has discovered a flaw in the Constitution. Another statement made by the honorable and learned senator astonished me. He was referring to the possibility of the States managing their own divisions, and he used the extraordinary phrase of &#34; temporary insanity &#34; on the part of the State Houses. It seems to me that if we pass this measure permanently the State Houses may reply that they are going to suffer from the perpetual insanity of the Commonwealth Parliament. It is extraordinary that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> should say that because the States have decided for themselves for the first federal election and for their own elections their method of division into electoral districts, they have been suffering from a kind of &#34; temporary insanity.&#34; </para>

            <para>- I am very glad to hear a repetition of what the honorable and learned senator said - it isjust what I thought he said. I remind the honorable senator that, so far as the accusation of temporary insanity is concerned, it applies not only to Tasmania but to that State about which in this committee we are not accustomed to speak in such terms. This is the first time that the model State, in the presence of Senators Playford, Downer, and McGregor, has been accused of temporary insanity in its legislation. In Tasmania we have not got single electorates for the House of Representatives, nor have they in South Australia. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> is inaccurate as to facts, and he has levelled against the State Legislatures an accusation which is utterly unwarranted. With regard to Tasmania, the conditions may distinctly differ. It sends only five members to the House of Representatives. It might be very seriously argued by its representatives that this is not so desirable a proposition for Tasmania as&#39; for &#39;Queensland or New South Wales. Our population is well known. The number of electors on our rolls for the House of Representatives would probably be not more than the number for a single electorate in a large State like New South Wales. That argument seems to me to have some force. We are running too far in our legislation in the direction of a desire for uniformity. Uniformity with regard to the division of the States, into electoral districts for the other House is not desirable. I do not believe that Tasmania would like to be split up into single electoral districts. Therefore we might very properly leave the whole question for the States to decide. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> says that all the States want single electorates for the other House I differ with him in regard to Tasmania, but I must admit that he- is very largely right.  His  own State, if it so desires, will have single electoral districts whether we legislate in that direction or not. It is not desirable that we should force this system upon Tasmania. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> desire is to be gained by legislation iri the various States, why not leave the settlement of the question to them <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Why, force on Tasmania a method which she may not like ? </para>

            <para>- When the State decided that it was essential to reduce the number of members in the Assembly, and their number was reduced from 54 to 42, an attempt was then made to divide the State into 42 districts. It was defeated by an overwhelming majority, and the State was divided into five, four, and threemember districts. The representation of the Northern Territory was left as it was, because they were hopeful that it would be taken over by the Common-wealth. In this Bill we are asked to inflict upon South Australia that which she has protested against every time the question has been raised. I feel strongly that we should do a very great injustice to. its electors by forcing upon them single electorates. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has urged that in the House of Representatives local interests should be represented. Under the Hare system that can be done. If we have a larger electorate, and there is one interest that predominates, what do we find <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We find that the member is returned according to the number of electors representing that interest, whatever it may be. The quota would give a representation of interests in a State. If New South Wales were divided into six districts returning four members each - and perhaps the metropolis returning five - then those interests of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> speaks could be conserved by the quota representation. Local interests will be conserved if we adopt the larger electorates and the Hare system. At first I thought that I would test the question On an amendment to insert the words &#34; and the House of Representatives &#34; in clause 146, but then it occurred to my mind that if clause 1 3 were passed as it is, my amendment would be ruled out of order, because it would be inconsistent with the decision of the committee on that clause. I am sure that nothing which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has said would justify the committee in following him, because everything he desires to accomplish by single electorates can be accomplished much more effectively under the Hare system. </para>

          <para>. - I rise to correct a slight misapprehension as regards the Queensland elections for the House of Representatives. The Vice-President of the Executive Council was pointing out that, in Queensland, we had the principle of single electorates for the House of Representatives, and an interjection was made to the effect that we had double electorates in that State. That is perfectly correct so far as concerns our electoral law for the State House of Assembly. We have 61 electorates, of which eleven are double. But for the purposes of electing the nine Queensland members to the House of Representatives, the Queensland Legislature passed a Bill dividing the State into nine single electorates. The principal point my honorable and learned friend, the VicePresident of the Executive Council, was making Was that Queensland had deliberately decided to be represented by nine representatives elected by nine single electorates. </para>

          <para>- It appears to me that the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> is one which might be of some assistance to those holding the views enunciated by him with regard to single electorates. If we pass the clause as it stands,- it is true that we shall have an opportunity of coming back to it in the event of its being decided to apply the principle of proportional representation to the House of Representatives, but if we do not adopt that principle, and if proportional representation be not determined upon for the Senate, and there is consequently no attempt to apply it to the House of Representatives, honorable senators, having passed this clause, will be in the position that they will have already affirmed the principle of single electorates, and will have no opportunity of getting back to the clause under the promise which has been given by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Therefore. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> is only urging what is reasonable from his point of view, namely, that he shall not be prejudiced in any way by the passing of a clause affirming the principle of single electorates in the event of our determining in favour of proportional representation. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> with regard to single electorates, because I am in favour of them for the election of the members of the House of Representatives, believing that single electorates would be better than the system under which three or four members are elected for each particular district. If honorable senators look at the matter from the stand-point adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> and other honorable senators who would like to see proportional representation applied to the House of Representatives, they will be inclined to adopt his proposal. By doing so we shall be given an opportunity of having fair play. It appears to me that it, would have been conducive to a saving of time to postpone the clause. The whole of the part of the Bill upon which we are engaged is based upon this clause. Clauses 1 3 to 24 aa-e entirely dependent upon clause 13 itself. But Parts IV. and V. of the Bill deal with subjects which are not dependent upon single, double, or treble electorates, nor upon the principle of proportional representation. The polling places will have to be proclaimed and the electoral rolls provided, whether we adopt proportional representation or not. We might have a debate now upon election expenses or voting by post, both of which questions would be equally applicable, whether we adopt the Hare system or the single-electorate system. </para>

            <para>- Because it involves a question to be hereafter determined, and we do not know what the committee will decide about it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> must recognise that there is a strong feeling amongst honorable senators that if we are to have proportional representation for the Senate, it should also be applied to the House of Representatives. It would facilitate discussion and save time and difficulty if the whole question were discussed later on. Suppose we fight the matter out today, next week it will be raised again upon a subsequent* clause. </para>

            <para>- I was under the impression that our object was to give the fullest opportunity to honorable senators to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion with regard to the whole clause. I urge honorable senators to remember that in the first place the State of Tasmania has not adhered to the principle of single electorates. That State has single, treble, and double electorates. The representatives of Tasmania may consider that it is undesirable to apply the single electorate system to that State. They may consider that it is better to have the five members elected by the State as at the present time. If we are going to adopt the clause and reject <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston&#39;s</inline> amendment we shall block the Tasmanians in that respect. Then we find that in South Australia the principle of single electorates has never been adopted. Are not honorable senators who hold to the South Australian view to have an opportunity of having the whole matter considered <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Why should we bind them down to either one or two systems <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The Postmaster-General has given us an explanation of the law passed by Queensland relative to the election of members to the House of Representatives, but their electoral law for the State Legislature provides for 61 divisions, eleven of which are double, and the balance single electorates. That does not show that Queensland has been so strongly in favour of such a system as is suggested. </para>

It is unreasonable, therefore, to attempt to tie a knot round the necks of the representatives of any State in the way contemplated by the clause as it stands. I say this as one who believes in the principle of single electorates, and who, when a fair opportunity arrives, will vote in favour of single electorates.

            <para>- There is a population of about 50,000 in the two cities, and about 120,000 in the rest of the State. The five representatives of Tasmania in the House of Representatives were returned, just as were the six senators, by the State polled as one electorate, the electors voting under the Hare - Clark system. The Government of Tasmania contemplated the division of the State into five districts for the House of Representatives, and thus to fall into line with&#39; the other States in  carry.ing  out what was conceived to be the spirit of the Constitution, that the States should vote as one for the return of their representatives in the Senate, and should be divided into single electorates for the House of Representatives. .The proposal was actually submitted, and a division of the State was made on the instruction of the Government of the day. But when the proposal came to be discussed it was openly stated that if it were carried out it would result in the return of a certain candidate for the House of Representatives who was not considered desirable by many people and by some members of the State Parliament. </para>

            <para>- There could be no misinterpretation. The matter was an open secret, and the proposed division was not carried out. It was thus owing to special circumstances that the scheme was not proceeded with. In campaigning throughout Tasmania in connexion with the Senate elections I expressed my intention of supporting a proposal for the division of the State into five separate districts for the return of five members at any subsequent election for the House of Representatives when the Government of the Commonwealth should have taken the matter in hand. </para>

            <para>- I- found when I put the principle forward that it was received by the people with apparent approval. As to the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> that the division or non-division of the States for the House of Representatives should be left to the States themselves, I should like to say that I consider such would be a very vicious system to adopt. Apart from the want of uniformity which would follow, I would-draw attention to the circumstances at present operating om the minds of the Government of one State. Let us take Queensland for example. We see day by day that, rightly or wrongly, the Government of that State feel aggrieved at the action of the Commonwealth Government and Parliament, and are indulging in many little pin pricks at the expense df the Federal Government. Could we reasonably expect that at the present time that Government, backed up as it might be by a majority in the local Parliament, would approach the task of dividing Queensland into electorates for the House of  Representatives with the calmness and judicial deliberation that ought to characterize the discharge of duties of that kind? We might take the case of any other State which feels aggrieved. When the State Parliaments divided the States into electorates for the House of Representatives, it was openly asserted in many public organs that the divisions in some cases were . marked out on lines to suit particular members of the State Legislature. </para>

I think that we can determine far better than could the State Parliaments what should be the electoral divisions. We can approach the task free and untrammelled, and complete it in the interests of the people of the whole of the Commonwealth, and not purely and solely in the interests of any State itself.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOHN</inline>DOWNER (South Australia). - I wish to deprecate any impatience on. the part of honorable senators in dealing with a question of vital importance such as we have before us at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons&#39;</inline> speech, so far from requiring any adverse comment, struck me as being a very valuable contribution to the debate. If there is one thing which was made clear when we framed the Constitution it was that we should be economical in interfering with the rights of the States. In every case in which we used the words &#34; until the Parliament otherwise provides,&#34; we said, in effect, that the existing law was a good law ; but that we were legislating for the present, and we could not tell what might crop up in the future to make it necessary to alter  that law. That fact, I am satisfied^ is not realized sufficiently by sections of this committee. If there was one view more strongly urged than another in the Conventions and submitted to the people, it was that there should be an economy of interference with the States, and that we should never interfere unless interference became very necessary. I absolutely deny <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford&#39;s</inline> statement that the feeling in South Australia is in favour of single electorates. The honorable senator has always been in favour of that principle, but he has never been able to carry&#39; it in South Australia. We had one little district in that State, the Northern Territory, which at one time only returned one member ; but insignificant as that district is compared with all the rest, so strong was the feeling there against single electorates that two members were given to the Northern Territory, and that district has them still. </para>

            <para>- The growth of public opinion in South Australia has been entirely different to that developed in the larger populations. I do not desire to go too much into the reasons for it, but we know that parties have advocated single electorates because they thought they would get more men in for their side by doing so. That was altogether the game in England, but it never represented any great principle. The great principle has always been better represented by the view that there should not be single electorates ; that there should be at least double electorates, so as not to disfranchise too many - the very thing which is always being complained about. We have gone a little better than the principle in South Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has already referred to the fact that we have one district returning as many as five members. But there is no district there returning only one member, and that is the whole point. We passed this Constitution intending to be economical of interference with the States. The other day we interfered with Tasmania in a way which would probably have prevented that State coming into the Federation if we had told her that we were going to adopt any such course. Ever since we have been here, it appears to me we have been trying, not to legislate for the purpose of filling up the Constitution so as to make it complete, but always to see how far we can go under the Constitution to gratify the fad of this man or that man. I am utterly against single electorates, &#39;but I do not desire to make any reflection upon others. In New South Wales they like the system, and for goodness sake let them keep it and elect their members in that way. In Victoria the system is liked, though not so much ; but in South Australia we do not like it, and why should we be interfered with? The object of all is to adopt. that method which will return members who will best represent the opinion of the States. Should we not let them judge for themselves what that method ought to be <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Are we as competent to decide as they are ? I would never dream of interfering with New South Wales on the subject I would say - &#34; You know best the physical environments and circumstances which require something to be done in your State different from what is done in other States. Deal with those circumstances accordingly. Adopt the best method you can conceive amongst yourselves for returning the men you want to represent you ; but leave us the same privilege. Because you happen to be a big State and we are only a small State, do not insist that we shall return members according to your method, when we have adopted a method which we think is better, and which has resulted in the return of the admirable representatives we see before us.&#34; Look at the history of America, Canada, Switzerland, and every other country that has given up its State government to some extent for federation, and we shall always find great unpopularity in the  first instance. Do not  let us unnecessarily accentuate it. Let us deal with matters that have to be dealt with in the interests of the whole people, and interfere with the States just as little as ever  Ave  can, instead of doing what I venture to think we are doing now - interfering on every opportunity, treading upon their corns, and making the term &#34;federation &#34; a reproach. </para>

          <para>- While I am in favour of single electorates, and think that they have acted better in this State than double electorates, I am entirely in accord with the view that we should not unnecessarily tread upon the corns of the States. We should endeavour to create as little strife as we can during the first few years of the Federation. That is our bounden duty, and I am sorry to confess that we have not adhered to that very wise policy. If this were merely a machinery Bill, about which the States would&#34; not contend, there could be no objection to it. There are vital principles in it to which I object very much indeed. So far as I can judge this clause 13 is all right, but the Constitution does not invite us to pass such clauses. It is plain enough, from section 29 of the Constitution, that, until the Federal Parliament otherwise provides, the State laws are to prevail, and we have not found fault with the State laws dealing with matters of this kind. Why, then, should we force a principle like this upon the States? I think we are making the States angry by our action, and while I have been, and will continue to be, in favour of federation, and while I think that the existing cloud of objections to it will pass away, I tell honorable senators plainly that, if a vote upon the Constitution were to be taken next week, it is certain that it would not be accepted, so strong is the feeling upon the subject. I urge the Government not to press unduly upon any State. </para>

            <para>- I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> and I will give a case in point. I have not been in favour of adult suffrage. I do not believe it would be for the benefit of the country, and in this particular I say that uniformity is not desirable. I pity the country whose manhood cannot manage its affairs without dragging in the unfortunate women. Uniformity is not desirable in many instances. If good results have been obtained by States that have adopted double, treble, and quadruple electorates, let us leave them alone for the present. If that principle is found to work well in the larger States, the smaller States that have nob yet adopted it will come round to that view. I agree to some extent with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> in what he has said in regard to the consideration due to local conditions, because I think the country districts should above all be given representation. The towns live by the country, and if the country is not prospering the towns must shrink up and shrivel. Country representatives are the real representatives of the people, because the country people bear the whole burden. In many States, as in Victoria, the country districts are given greater representation than the towns, on the very principle of which I am speaking, because the prosperity of a State rests entirely upon the farmers, miners, vignerons, wool-growers, and primary producers generally. While I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> in that, I still say that we ought not now to pass such a measure as this. There is no urgency for it. The other States may be opposed to the system, therefore do not do what will aggrieve them, &#39;especially when it is not necessary. I favour the view that the clause should be postponed until the other clauses have been dealt with. I do not say that I shall vote for double electorates. I could not take that course without voting against my conviction. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania).- So far as the other House is concerned, I have no objection to single electorates. But what we ought seriously to consider on this clause, is the question of imposing uniformity on the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> was, in my opinion, foolish enough to interject just now to the effect that the question of the franchise might be disposed of in the same way. It is imperative that the franchise should be uniform throughout the Commonwealth, but the method of using that franchise is a totally different question. While I may be disposed to vote for single electorates, I am unable to vote for a clause which deprives every State of the opportunity of doing what I think it ought to do - &#39; of settling this question for itself. I agree with Senators Downer and Fraser that in our legislation we have shown an undue desire to interfere with State legislation and State rights. I deprecate the sort of argument which is becoming common here, even if it were well based, that we are here to cure the evils which are perpetrated in State Parliaments. I object to hear our State Parliaments continually accused here of something like corruption, at any rate of incompetency. I do not suppose for a moment that the speakers expect their remarks to be believed, but I object to the Senate being used for the hurling of such accusations against the State Parliaments. The remark we heard that the Tasmanian Parliament cannot be trusted to look after its own interests in this matter is one which we ought not to hear. 30 t </para>

Granted that single electorates are desirable, surely he will recognise with me that there are conditions in which single electorates may not be desirable. In splitting up a State into single electorates you must have regard to its size and its population. Single electorates might be applicable to New South Wales and possibly to South Australia, but they might not be applicable to a little place like Tasmania. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> to consider that point, and if he can go so far as to agree with me on that bald proposition, I urge him to hesitate before he induces the committee to impose on some State what possibly it does not want. I do not say that I might not vote for single electorates, but I contend that we have no right to decide the. question. The Parliament of Tasmania, just as the Parliament of any other State, ought to decide the question for the State. Rightly or wrongly I think we must in loyalty always concede to the State Parliament that it can legislate properly in regard to its own affairs. If we start this system of interference with the State Parliaments, based on the statement that they act corruptly or badly, there is practically nothing &#39; which we could not take away from them. Surely honorable senators would hesitate to say that <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> In nine cases out of ten where a discussion has arisen some honorable senator has come here with a grievance from his own State. I believe that in Western Australia they have a grievance, but still they should not come here and attempt to interfere with what they call corruption or mismanagement ih&#39; the State Parliament. In Tasmania the Parliament is elected on the widest franchise - one man one vote - and when any honorable senator accuses that Parliament of managing things badly, or showing corruption, what is his accusation worth ? To accuse the Tasmanian Parliament of corruption is to challenge the whole basis of our legislation. </para>

          <para>- I have listened patiently to the arguments of honorable senators, and I am in a maze of difficulty in regard to some statements which have been made provided they are true. I am one of those who believe in uniformity, but according to the argument of honorable senators we ought not to touch our electoral system at all, but to allow things to go on in their own sweet way, and. the members of each House to be returned under a varying system which, I think, we utterly condemn. Did not the States federate in order to secure uniform legislation on all those subjects on which it is possible to obtain uniformity1! Why are we legislating for a uniform Tariff? It is simply because we believe that a uniform Tariff is good for the whole of Australia. I hold that a uniform electoral system is a&#39; good thing for the whole of Australia. I believe that it is a good thing to have single electorates. That has been our experience in this State. It is quite true that for the Legislative Assembly we have a few double constituencies, but I- think that the great preponderance of opinion is that it is the proper mode of representation of the people. If a uniform electoral system is a bad thing ; if the States are to be allowed to pick and choose, then good-bye to our federal system. I hold that the views of the majority of the States on this question should prevail. If the majority of the States or the majority of their senators consider that it is a good thing to have single electorates for each State, I see no reason why the principle should not be incorporated in this Bill. </para>

            <para>- I shall deal with the imaginary distinction between uniformity of a principle and uniformity of the method of its administration. Any one who considers the question at all knows perfectly well that by the administration of a principle, no matter how good it may be, it can be destroyed. We may desire to get the opinion of the people of Australia, but by humbugging electorates, and by the interference of State Parliaments, we may not get that true opinion from the various States. That is what we wish to prevent. We wish to get not only the opinions held by the various States under the same franchise, but to get those opinions expressed under the same conditions of administration. Honorable senators know perfectly well that if you poll a State as one electorate, and then poll that State as separate electorates, you will very often get a very different aggregate result. </para>

            <para>- I have nothing to do with the question of whether it is correct or not. The principle of division of States for the election of members of the other .House is affirmed by the Constitution Act ; therefore it . seems to me that there is no material difference between the principle and the method of its administration. If we have a right to say that there shall be single electorates, surely we have a right to say how they shall be divided. It fact, it cannot be denied that we have the right. The question is whether it is desirable to exercise it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> says we are depriving the States of the right to settle this question for .themselves.

            <para>- The intention of section 29 is that the Federal Parliament shall divide the electorates. The section only provides that the States shall be allowed to do it until the Federal Parliament sees fit, and finds it convenient to do it. Why were the divisions left to the State Parliaments until the Federal Parliament could make them ? Because, at that time, the State Parliaments were the only bodies that could make the divisions. No Federal Parliament existed ; and until the Federal Parliament existed, and could make a uniform system, the work necessarily had to be left to the State Parliaments. It could not be expected that a Federal Parliament that did not exist could define the limits of its own constituencies, but that work was left to the only machinery that -was available. That I believe to be the intention of section 29. </para>

          <para>- I wish to say a word or two as to the decision of the Tasmanian Parliament to adhere to single electorates. It will be within the memory of honorable members that for some years there were at least two doublebarrelled electorates on the northern coast of Tasmania. It is only a few years since the Tasmanian Parliament decided to divide them into single-member electorates. That decision was arrived at to suit the wish of the people, and it evidently met with the approval of the majority of the members of the Tasmanian Parliament. There has been a little misapprehension as to what occurred when it was decided that the whole of Tasmania should be polled as one electorate for the Federal House of Representatives. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> will probably remember that it was at first contemplated by the Tasmanian Government to divide Tasmania into five electorates. A Bill was introduced for that purpose. It went so far as to name the electorates. But a gentleman who is now a member of the House of Representatives, and who at that time was leader of the Opposition in Tasmania, moved that the Bill be read a second time that day six months. Speaking to his motion, he gave as one of his reasons that it would be a very dangerous thing to cut up the. country into five electorates, because a stranger might be able to come to the State, secure a large vote in a particular part of the country, and so capture an electorate. The term &#34;adventurer&#34; was used freely during the discussion. We all know perfectly well that the term was intended to apply to a gentleman who a few months before had contested a certain seat in Tasmania. 30 <inline font-style="italic">i 2</inline></para>

            <para>- A certain gentleman took this debate in Parliament as applying to himself, and many other people thought that he was not far wrong in  doing so  He issued a manifesto on the 23rd October, 1900, in which he made certain statements. Every opportunity was given to members in the Tasmanian Parliament to contradict those statements, but they did not do so. The natural assumption is that they could not contradict them. He stated emphatically in his manifesto that Tasmania was to be polled as one electorate, with the object of keeping him out of the Federal Parliament. The gentleman in question used what might be considered as extravagant language in the document te which I refer. </para>

            <para>- In support of clause &#93; 3, I urge that it is in accordance with the very spirit of the Constitution. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> has pointed out, one of the reasons for federation was to secure uniformity in the matter of the franchise as in other respects ; and as he has urged, though we may have a good uniform franchise law, if it is not uniformly administered it may be bad in operation. If we left it to the States such circumstances might occur again as I have mentioned as having occurred in Tasmania. Something might be done which would not be to the credit of the State that did it. There may be matters upon which State Parliaments will differ from the Federal Parliament. We already have a question of that kind in Tasmania. It is not in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution that it should be left to the States to arrange the boundaries of the federal electorates. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CHARLESTON</inline>(South Australia). - I think that as the  discussion advances greater and greater necessity is shown for striking out, as my amendment proposes, that portion of the clause which provides that the States shall be divided into single electorates for the House of Representatives. The clause would then fit in with section 29 of the Constitution, which provides - </para>
        <para>Until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the Parliament of any State may make laws for determining the divisions in -each State for which members of the House of Representatives may be chosen, and the number of members to be chosen for each division. </para>
        <para class="block">That section shows clearly that the framers of the Constitution thought at the time that it was quite possible that some of the States might prefer to have electorates returning four or five members each, so that the Have system or some similar method of voting might be applied; because the section clearly refers to the &#34; number of members &#34; to be chosen for each division. It has been shown that if we pass the clause as it stands, we shall force some of the States to  conduct their elections for the House of Representatives in a very different form from that which they have- chosen for electing members to their own popular Houses. That is not desirable. How many methods -of voting are we to have ? In South Australia we have five, four, and three member  electorates  for the House of Assembly, and four-member districts for the Legislative Council, while, if this proposal is carried, we shall have that State divided into single electorates for the House of Representatives, and possibly a method of voting introduced which is entirely new to the people there. The desirability of uniformity has been urged, and surely we ought not to impose upon the States methods that will destroy the uniformity of their own systems. The whole of the arguments in support of uniformity are in favour of allowing the States to deal with this matter as they think best. Are not the members of the popular branches of the State Legislatures elected by the people who return us <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Surely, therefore, the members ought to know what is most conducive to the political and social good of the people <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If, having passed this clause, we attempt to alter it subsequently, we shall be confronted with the fact that we have agreed upon this principle, and we shall not be allowed to refer to it again in this committee. If the Hare system of voting is to be applied to the Senate, those who favour single electorates will surely see the necessity for uniformity in the method of voting, instead of having one system for the House of Representatives and another for the Senate. All these are powerful reasons why honorable senators should not pledge themselves at this juncture to the principle of one man one district, and why they should deal first with other parts of the Bill. If it is found necessary to make any change, they will then be able to come back and deal with this clause. </para>

          <para>- I have not spoken hitherto upon this measure, first because it appears to me to be a well thought out and carefully drafted Bill, and secondly, because the speeches on the second reading were so admirable that they left little to be said. I am very much in favour of proportional representation, and I am satisfied that any defects which can be alleged . against it are not half as great as are the blots on the block system. Whether we should apply this system of proportional voting to a State Chamber like the Senate is a matter which raises very grave considerations. However, that is not before the Chair. The clause under discussion appears to take away for all time the opportunity of applying proportional representation to the House of Representatives. </para>

            <para>- I am so persuaded of the benefits to be derived from proportional voting that that to some extent is a criticism which I feel bound to offer to the clause as it stands. At the same time, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> argument that in dealing with the question of the representation of the citizens, as such, in the House of Representatives we must take local conditions into consideration, is a very strong one. That raises another point - whether the States themselves are not the best judges of how to apply any Act to their local conditions. A great deal more will have to be heard on that question, but believing this Bill to be a good one, &#39; and desiring to push on with the business, I propose to vote for the clause as it stands, because it appears to me to be the lesser of two evils. I think Tasmania will be in accord with the vote I am about to give. It is true that the Parliament of Tasmania took steps to map out that State into five electorates for the House of Representatives, and as Tasmania is in favour of single electorates for the one House, I do not think my vote can be- very much called into question. It appears to me that as that State must be polled as one electorate for the Senate - and it is desirable that it should be - it is well to consider local conditions  and to have single electorates for the House of Representatives! I can quite understand that some of the more populous States may object to this : that as the popularity of proportional representation grows - as I am sure it will - some will desire to apply the system to the House of Representatives, to which it is far more applicable than it is to the Senate. If they do, this clause will stand in the way, and will have to be repealed. One very important point has not yet been referred to, namely : What is the economic and financial aspect Of this Bill ? In other words, what is it going to cost us ? If we were to allow matters to stand for the present the whole cost of preparing the rolls would fall upon the States, and although I do not desire to delay the progress of the Bill I think that is a matter which we ought to consider. I shall be glad if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> will have a return prepared showing what the cost of this Bill will be. I intend on Tuesday next to give notice of motion for the preparation of such a return. The financial aspect of the question ought to be prominently before us. I am told that the preparation of the rolls will cost a very large sum. As Tasmania has gone back on proportional representation, and as I believe it is in favour of single electorates, I see no harm in voting for the clause as it stands. </para>

          <para>- I have said nothing upon this Bill so far, but I have listened to the debate attentively, and I have been amazed at the parochial sentiments given utterance to by some honorable senators. We are told that we should not pass this clause because the States should be the best judges as to how these affairs should be regulated. We should not pass something else because it may create in the minds of a number of persons some feeling of hostility to federation generally. Senators Dobson and Clemons are ardent federalists, but their whole plea has not been for federation, but for the isolation of the different States as they were before the accomplishment of federation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> admits that we should have a uniform franchise, but he does not  desire a  uniform mehtod  of exercising the franchise. He says we should leave that to the States. Where are we drifting % Are we to drift back to the old condition of things existing before the accomplishment of federation <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I have always been an ardent federalist, and I deny that anything has been done by the Federal Parliament to create hostility to federation. I think I know something of my own State, and a great deal more than some honorable senators who assume to know a great de.il about it. I know the public sentiment existing in that State, and the highly beneficial effect which the legislation passed by the Federal Parliament will have upon it. Notwithstanding the platitudes we haveheard concerning the hostility created by federal legislation, if  aplebiscite  on federation were taken in Queensland to-morrow an overwhelming majority would be found in favour of the action taken by the Federal Parliament. We want uniformity of franchise, uniformity in the method of conducting elections ; in legislation reserving this Commonwealth for people of the white race ; in defence ; in banking ; and in the establishment of an Inter-State Commission for directing the trade and commerce of the Commonwealth. Yet some strong federalists tell us that if a vote were taken to-morrow federation would not be carried in consequence of the action of the Federal Parliament. I have great respect for the opinions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Eraser,</inline> but I do not defer, to his opinion when he says that we must go slow. When in the name of heaven are we to move? We are told that we should not move now or next year. &#34; Don&#39;t move at all &#34; is the cry of the old conservative everywhere and every time. We are told that it is unwise to make a start now with this Bill. When are we to make a start ? The Vice-President of the Executive Council has explained that there must shortly be a federal election for the Senate, and is it not wise that we should take time by the forelock, and adopt measures which will secure the best results, not in the interests of one State alone, but in the interests of the whole of the Commonwealth ? I never was an enthusiastic admirer of the system of single electorates, but under all the circumstances I think it is the best system to adopt. In Queensland we adopted a temporary measure for the purposes of the last federal election, waiting the time when the Federal Parliament, as was intended by the Constitution, would deal with this subject, as well as with the subject of a uniform franchise. The very basis upon which the Federation rests is uniformity, so far as it can be carried out. In some States it is suggested that there should be no division for the House of Representatives, and that the members of that House should be elected  in- the same way as members of the Senate. </para>

            <para>- It would be no calamity, but it would certainly be a lopsided arrangement so far as Parliament itself is concerned. In other States it may be that large divisions will be adopted. In New South Wales they have had sufficient experience of the single-electorate system to convince them of the necessity of continuing that system. In Victoria no desire has been shown to abandon that system. So far as Queensland is concerned, we have already passed legislation dividing that State into nine divisions, with a single representative for each, for the House of Representatives ; and one of the planks in the platform of the present Queensland Government in the elections which are now being conducted in that State is the abolition of the double electorates which exist there to a limited extent. Following up the argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> I say that the whole trend of public opinion in Australia is in the direction of single electorates, and that being so, how can honorable senators say that if we pass this clause it is likely to arouse hostility to federation which should not exist ? I am more than astonished at the parochialism displayed during the discussion on this Bill. I hope we shall be true federalists, and as far as we can carry measures which will establish uniformity. </para>

          <para>- There cannot be verymuch doubt in the minds of honorable senators that the Constitution provides absolutely for carrying out what is proposed in this Bill - uniformity of procedure in connexion with elections. The provisions on the subject in the Constitution were not inserted without its being intended that at some time or other they should be given effect to. The first thing to decide is whether it is advisable to exercise now the power provided in the Constitution. I have listened attentively to the debate ; but I have not been able to arrive at a conclusion that there is any special advantage in delay. I am inclined to think that there is very little, if anything, to be gained by delay, and there is a good deal to be said in favour of dealing with this question while it is well before the public. It was discussed during the time of the Commonwealth elections, as it has been since ; the public mind is, I think, fairly made up upon the subject, and there is a general expectation that within a reasonable time the Commonwealth Parliament will deal with it. . So far as I can see, from my experience of Victoria, there is undoubtedly a strong opinion in favour of uniformity in this State. I am not personally a great believer in the wonderfully beneficial effects claimed for uniformity. I do not think its advantages will appear so very great if contrasted with its many disadvantages. Still, I think public opinion in the Commonwealth is in favour of this matter being dealt with promptly by the Federal Parliament, and on lines of uniformity. In clause 13 we come to deal for the first time with the method by which it is proposed that this shall be done, and the clause lays down the principle of single electorates for the House of Representatives. While I recognise that that is in accordance with the opinion held by the vast majority of the electors of Victoria for many years past, I am npt a particularly firm believer in the advantages of single electorates. I believe there is a great deal to be said in favour of double and treble electorates, and that probably the people would be better represented by double than by single electorates. At the same time, I frankly acknowledge that single electorates do secure to a large extent the representation of a number of divergent views. Ry cutting up the States into so many districts, we shall undoubtedly secure the return of men differing widely in their political views. So that while I think it is not by any means the most perfect system, and is not perhaps as good a system as double electorates, and certainly not by any means as good as the proportional system, I admit that great advantages may follow from the adoption of the system, and especially when the contingent vote is applied to it. Under these circumstances I feel that it is my duty to support the clause as it stands, with, of course, the distinct understanding given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> that in the event of proportional voting being recognised later on, the clause will be recommitted with the view of determining whether the principle should also be applied to the House of Representatives. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir JOHN</inline>DOWNER (South Australia). - I ask the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat whether, on consideration, he will not come to the conclusion that his remarks are utterly illogical ? He has said that he is in favour of proportional representation. He likes three-member districts better than one-member districts. Why? Because he thinks that the nearer you get to proportional representation the further you get from single electorates with members returned by absolute majorities. Although I agree with him that in that way members may be returned with very divergent views, still he says that he is for proportional representation, and he likes twomember districts better than one, and, probably, would like three-member districts better than two-member districts. Seeing that he is fo.r proportional representation, I ask him how he can support single electorates <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>NEILD (New South Wales.) - I cut my remarks short this morning in consequence of the assurance which was given by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and I did so in the belief that we were going to&#39; proceed with the clause without further discussion. So many speeches have been made, so many side-lights have been thrown on the question, that I find myself placed in an awkward position ; and I have to express my regret-though I still regard the assurance  of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> as absolutely binding - that I withdrew my amendment. I am now compelled to give a vote on the amendment- of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> which is indicative plainly of multi-seat electorates - probably two he has in his mind - as against the proposition which I had advanced earlier in the day of placing the elections for the House of Representatives on precisely the same basis as those of the Senate. I am still in favour of that contention, if the system of sectional representation, which is aimed at in the Bill, is to be the method governing elections to the Senate. If the rule is to affect one House it should affect both Houses. I hold that view on the strength of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> own expression of opinion here. He has been .an enthusiastic supporter of uniformity ; and many other senators have entertained his view. If uniformity is admirable in one direction, surely it is admirable in more than the one direction which immediately appeals to the mind of the  speaker.  If there is such a merit in uniformity it certainly should apply to the method of election to both Houses. In con-, tradistinction  to the proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Charleston, we have the Ministerial proposal for single electorates. Believing in one proposition I am called upon to vote for or against two others. By withdrawing my amendment I am placed in an awkward position, and I scarcely know what vote is the more appropriate for me to give. I hope that the clause, assuming that it is passed to-day, will not come before us again, because I trust that the idea of the Bill for governing senatorial elections will not be given effect to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> made some remarks which implied that the senators for New South Wales are opposed to the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> because that State has decided in favour of single electorates. I do not think there is any such feeling on the part of any senator from New South Wales. There is no such thought in my mind, and I am not aware of its existence in the mind of any colleague. I imagine that every member of the Senate is actuated by a desire to do his public duty in accordance with &#39;the pledges he gave to his constituents. It has never occurred to me that there is any one in the Senate who is seeking to follow up any particular line of action for any benefit which may accrue to himself. This subject has been discussed with very great fairness and very considerable ability. It is one to which 1 have not devoted so much time as many others have done, and my contribution to the discussion has been of an unimportant character. In New South Wales the question of proportional representation has not got beyond the nursery ground of politics. If there is so much merit in the idea of singleseat electorates for one House, I cannot possibly see the utility or the propriety of the later provisions in the Bill for a totally opposite state of affairs as applied to the Senate. For these reasons I am in a little doubt as to the vote I ought to give on this amendment. But as the matter is confused by the manner in which these diverse propositions have necessarily crossed one another in the course of the discussion, I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> will not think that if I sb.ould vote, as I probably shall, for the amendment, I cast the smallest shadow of doubt on the validity of the. pledge which he has given, and which I am sure he will stand by whatever may be the result of the division on the amendment. </para>

I have had an amendment prepared and circulated to put the matter beyond question, that in getting the basis of the quota under clause 17 you are to take the number who have the right to vote upon existing rolls, or to obtain your information in any other way. So that as far as concerns the machinery for carrying out this clause there will be no difficulty. </para>

          <para>- The wording of the clause seems to me to be unfortunate. I do not like the phrase &#34; Each shall be distributed into electoral divisions.&#34; As a rule you do not distribute a thing until you have divided it. Here we are to distribute before we have divided. Would it not be better to say - &#34; Each State shall be divided into electoral districts,&#34; or something of the sort. </para>

          <para>- The honorable senator will see at once that whoever is to carry out the work, it cannot be done except by the employment of Government officers. We must have surveyors, and persons who know the districts to mark out the limitations. The commissioners will be appointed for the particular purpose of carrying out the work. Of course they will, be paid for it, and perhaps the most convenient way will be to pay  them  for each sitting. I submit that the proposal to appoint three commissioners for each State, as provided here, not as perpetual public servants, but merely for the purpose of carrying out this work, is a good one. </para>

          <para>- I certainly think that the clause, as it stands, would involve great waste of money. It would be far better for the Government to instruct their  officials,  who will always be under their control, to do this work, and there is no&#39; occasion for this clause, which would involve the payment of eighteen commissioners. We are already over-burdened by Commonwealth expenditure, and there is no necessity &#39;for this proposal. The Government could compel their own servants to do the work or make arrangements for it to be carried out by officers of the various State services. If the latter were employed the States would be relieved of the expenditure involved in the payment of their salaries, and therefore the money would not be misspent. </para>

            <para>- If the suggestion of the honorable senator were adopted, and officers of the public service directed to carry out this work, their report would be the work of the Government, and it would come before the House as the work of the Government. It would not be reasonable to expect Parliament to accept without question boundaries prepared in that way. If we appoint commissioners to do this particular work they will be responsible to the public as well as to the Government, and will make independent recommendations in regard to the delimitations of the electorates. The public will have the assurance that the delimitations have been fairly made ; that the Government has not had a hand in the work, and there will not be any suspicion of twisting the divisions in order to suit Government interests. In other words, the clause proposes the creation of an impartial body which will make recommendations that are to come before Parliament. That is the difference. If the work is done by these commissioners I hope that they will be selected, as they have been in my own State, and be men in whom the public have confidence. They make their report, and even if Parliament think that errors or mistakes have been committed, they never doubt the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the report. It is obvious that in a procedure of this kind, in which Parliament is asked to say &#34;aye&#34; or &#34;nay&#34; to the boundaries selected, it is essential that the delimitations of the electorates should not be in the hands of the Government or of Government servants only, but in the hands of independent commissioners. That is why it is necessary to constitute commissions. </para>

First of all we have the bald statement that the Governor-General in Council &#34;may&#34; appoint three commissioners. There is no obligation. When the first distribution of the States into electoral divisions has been completed there will be practically no more work for the commissioners to do until the next census or some other contingency arises, making a further distribution necessary. That being so, are the appointments going to be permanent? </para>

          <para>- Perhaps it is well that we should see what is being done in New Zealand in connexion with this matter. Their Act has been in operation since 1887, and from inquiries made recently I find that it works admirably. During the fifteen years of its existence there has not been a breath of scandal in connexion with the administration of the Act. The commission there consists of five members. One is thecommissioner under the Property Assessment Act, and another is the Surveyor-General. These two gentlemen, we might say, are connected not so much with the Government of the day as they are with Parliament. The other three members of the commission are appointed by the House of Representatives, from time to time, as vacancies occur ; but as a matter of fact they are appointed permanently. There is a good deal to be said in favour of a permanent appointment, for while it is perfectly true that readjustment of the boundaries will only take place after each census, still it is very desirable that those who are called on to do the work should have been in close touch&#39; with the whole of the electorates during the previous ten years. That would greatly facilitate the proper adjustment of matters. I think it is just as well for us to take advantage of the experience of other States, and in the experience of New Zealand this plan has worked admirably. There the commission consists of five members, two of whom may be members of the public service ; but I mention in passing that the Act specially provides that three shall not be members of the public service. In that respect it is opposed to the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> which I think is very objectionable. </para>

            <para>- That is quite so ; but it is quite evident that before the Government are in a position to direct the commissioners to act, they must be in existence. The scheme of the Bill appears to me to contemplate permanent commissioners, as shown by clause 26. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> in condemnation of the proposal made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser.</inline> We have had experience of these commissioners in New South Wales, and they have given every satisfaction, because the gentlemen appointed there&#39; were men whose reputation commanded the confidence of the electors. But there is this vast difference between the scheme in operation in New South Wales and that proposed in this Bill : That in New South Wales the Act directs the commissioners what to do, and in this Bill it is proposed that the Government shall set them in motion. That is a difference so vital and far reaching in its possible consequences, that I shall ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council, at a later stage, to consider the expediency of bringing the provisions of this Bill more into conformity with the Act in operation in New South Wales. </para>

          <para>- I do not see any difference between appointing commissioners to hold office during the pleasure of the Government, and appointing them to carry out certain work. All that we are concerned about is, that the commissioners, when appointed, shall do their work properly, and shall be paid only for the work they do. I do not think the Bill contemplates anything else. They may continue to hold office, but when they are not doing any work they will not receive any remuneration. If necessary we can carry an amendment in clause 15 to secure that. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales).I propose here to submit an amendment which will limit the appointment of the commissioners. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has pointed out that they would not be paid if they were not at work. It is rather refreshing to have that assurance, but my experience of positions of this kind has been such that I have always hankered after such an appointment. If these commissioners are to be permanent as I think clause 26 contemplates, it is evident that a fixed annual amount will be made payable to them. As in the ordinary course of events they will only be called upon to work occasionally, it appears to me that there is no earthly reason why when they have completed the distribution for which they have been appointed they should not be disbanded. I put that forward as a business-like proposition on the score of economy. Now, I have a political objection to allowing the commissioners to continue in office, because if that-is done it becomes competent for the Government of the day to set them to work to redistribute a State for some reason or another at any time, and I think no Government should have such a power. </para>

I say that was distinctly contemplated by section 24 of the Constitution, which provides that the quota of electors and the number of members to represent each State shall be determined only after the census period, and I say that is the only time when a State should be divided. </para>

            <para>- Then I put the other proposal to the honorable member - the proposal adopted in New South Wales, where the commissioners are permanently appointed, and are directed by the Act to keep a continual eye upon the electorates. Whenever a change becomes necessary, it is their duty to submit a report to Parliament, but that scheme does not leave the initiative with the Government, which is my charge against this proposal. We may have a case where a Government, noticing a large accession of strength in an electorate held by one of its opponents, and seeing a possible chance, by a fresh distribution of seats, of so altering electoral boundaries as to gain a distinct advantage, may put the commissioners in motion to secure that advantage, I am not prepared to trust any Government with a power of that kind. Before I submit any amendment, I should like to hear the explanation promised by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. </para>

It is ascertained according to the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. The word &#34;census&#34; is not used in the section, but I presume that it would refer to the census. </para>

            <para>- Not necessarily &#34;if there are any other statistics by which the population of the Commonwealth can be ascertained from time to time. I suppose they may be used for the purpose of fixing a quota. No doubt, as a general rule, the quota will not be altered except by an alteration of the population when disclosed by the census. . But there is another way in which it might be altered. If, at any time, it should be thought necessary to increase the number of senators, then the number of members of the House of Representatives would have to be increased, and there would have to be a new quota fixed for the States. If a territory were admitted to the Commonwealth, or if a State were subdivided in any way, then a new quota would have to be made. I admit that the latter contingencies are not likely to occur very often, and probably what would settle the quota would be the number of the population at each census. Having got under the Constitution Act the quota which gives the number of members for each State to return, you have to settle its divisions so as to distribute those members over the State. That is where it becomes very difficult to see how you can. manage to keep that distribution fair without having some elastic system which enables a redistribution to be made when it is necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> by interjection, instanced the case of a goldfield. Ten years is a very long time in the history of all these new countries. From our experience of New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia, we know that the difference in the population of a locality now and ten years hence may be immense. A place which may be a desert at one time, may be a populous city at another, and in three or four years you may have ups and downs of population which may make the greatest difference in the right of a place to representation. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will admit that there ought to be some means by which contingencies of that- sort should be provided for. The only question is how should it be done. </para>

        <para class="block">It assumes that in the case of any strict anomalies or inconsistencies  arising by  reason of the floating nature of the population in any locality, the Government will have that fact brought before them, and will take all necessary action for the purpose of putting the commission to work to remedy the difficulty. What objection is there to that ? It may be said that the Government will not act unless they are called upon, unless they have some motive for action. After all it is only like any other case of administration. If it becomes necessary in the public interest to take a particular course, the Government can be forced to take that course.&#39; The Parliament will see that it is taken ; it is there for that purpose. If it is the case of a large population being under-represented, that population will take very good care that there is such a re-arrangement of boundaries made that it is properly represented. We may very well trust the Parliament, public opinion, and the persons interested to see that whenever it is necessary to make a delimitation of the boundaries, proper action will be taken, and the commission will be put in motion by the Government itself. What objection is there to that ? I cannot see what objection there can be. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that he would not trust to any Government the duty of fixing the time for ordering a redistribution.

            <para>- I do not think that that Act would be applicable. I have ascertained from the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth, who was formerly the Chief Electoral Officer of New South Wales,, that the cost in fees to the commissioners for re-distributing, for the first time, the 125 seats in New South Wales was &#163;200. Considering what the work was, the enormous amount of labour involved in the inquiry, and the qualities which the commissioners had to exercise, I do not think it can be said that the cost was excessive.

        <para class="block">I do not see very much difference between the appointment of a commission for five years and the appointment of a commission during the pleasure of a Government, which means either that you retain them while the work is being done, and then let them go about their business, or retain them for a considerable period, and in the carrying out of any subsequent distribution they have all the knowledge and advantage of the experience they have already gained.

            <para>- There is another Act which gives other power, but I do not think that it operates automatically. A period of ten years between one distribution and another is not adequate. This is not a matter in which I have any particular feeling for one method more than another. I quite recognise the difficulties of the position. Above all things the object you have to aim at is to see that the distribution is kept as fairly representative as possible. Considering the nature of the different electorates in Australia, the liability to change in population, you must have some elastic system, and it appears to me that the best form of elastic system you can have is one which will enable the commissioners to be put into operation at any time, when the Parliament or the public, or the Government, on its own motion, may think it should be done. I quite appreciate the difficulty which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has put, but I do not see a better way of getting over it than that provided in the Bill. If I did, I should be very glad to consider it. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales).I am under the impression, and shall remain under that impression until it is disproved, that in the electoral law of New South Wales there is some provision for a supplementary adjustment, that whenever an electorate obtains a number of electors over and above the quota the commissioners are empowered to adjust it, reporting to Parliament the adjustment, and the not taking place until Parliament approves. Whether that is so or not, I think we can draw from the New South Wales experience sufficient support for my contention that it is not safe to leave this power in the hands of the Government of the day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has pointed out that he simply looks upon the exercise of the power as an executive Act, and that if the Executive fails in its duty, the power of punishing it lies in the. hands of Parliament. That is true ; but the Government may fail to do something, and for party reasons Parliament may not be prepared to take the responsibility of punishing it. Some time ago, in New South Wales, the commissioners, in the exercise of the duty, imposed upon them by the Act in question, prepared a redistribution scheme and forwarded it to the Government. The Government neglected its duty, and took no action whatever upon it. The whole purpose of the Act was nullified. I can conceive that for many reasons a Government wishing to please certain supporters might lay aside the report of the commissioners, or might refrain from taking action upon it. Take the case mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> of a new mining township springing up. A Government holding a certain set of opinions might come to the conclusion that the voters in that township would send into Parliament a representative of the party opposed to itself. Consequently, they might not desire to have a redistribution. I appreciate all that is implied in theterm&#34; Ministerial responsibility,&#34; but it is dangerous to leave in the hands of any Government the power to fix electorates, or to refrain from having them fixed. For these reasons it will be desirable to direct in the Bill that action shall be taken quite apart from Ministerial control.

          <para>- The point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is one of great importance. Whatever our party views may be, we all recognise that if we want to insure the proper representation of the people in both Houses we must be very careful that the redistribution is properly attended to. The action of the commissioners should be automatic, quite apart from any instigation by the Government. They should keep their eye upon the statistics of the Commonwealth, and upon the changes of population from time to time, and should make reports to Parliament as they became necessary. I should prefer that the commissioners should communicate directly with Parliament and not with the Government. Whatever we do we should be perfectly clear that it is not possible for the Government on any occasion to intervene between the report of the commissioners and Parliament itself. I am sure that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is fully seized of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> desires.  His  sense of fairness and justice should induce him to see his way to support an amendment of this character. </para>

          <para>- I strongly object to the tone in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has spoken. He regards Tuesday sittings as a species of punishment inflicted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council upon the Opposition on account of their long speeches on the Electoral Bill. But the Senate came to the conclusion to meet on Tuesdays, and the resolution to that effect was carried on the voices. It was carried because honorable senators desire to pass the Electoral Bill before the Tariff is received. Necessity demands that we should meet on Tuesdays, if we intend to pass that measure. It is not possible for those who come from distant States to get to their own homes every week, and those who come from the nearer States should have some consideration for those who are tied to the oar as we are. At the rate of progress now being made by the House of Representatives, the Tariff will be received by the Senate before the end of this month, and if we do not make better progress with the </para>

We have to consider the matter from a practical point of view. Those senators who represent Victoria can attend here comfortably at any time.

          <para>- I hope that not only will the Senate meet on Tuesday, but that if proper progress is not made with the Electoral Bill we shall consider the advisability of extending rather than reducing the number of our sitting days. I cannot understand why some honorable senators who talk all dayare so anxious to. close the proceedings immediately a certain hour is reached. 1 desire that they shall have the fullest opportunity of expressing their views, but I expect some consideration to be extended by them to others. I protest against being kept here until an hour at which senators from New South Wales can catch  their trains  when the flow of eloquence is stopped and we are asked to adjourn to suit their wishes. I want to see fair progress made, but when we find that we have been discussing one clause from 10.30 a.m. to 4 p.m., I think it is reasonable to say that we are not  going to stop to suit the convenience  of  certain honorable senators. </para>

            <para>- If  the  honorable and learned senator insists upon the course proposed by him, those who are opposed to it must endeavour to have the Bill recommitted at a later stage, in order that further consideration may be given to clauses passed hurriedly, and which might have been amended if there had been a full House, instead of a bare quorum present at the time. I know that there are some honorable senators who are prepared to meet on Mondays and Tuesdays, as well as on the ordinary sitting days, because their attention is devoted entirely to public business. There are others  Who  cannot do so, and surely they are entitled to consideration? Proposals such as this will have a tendency to drive out of the Senate men who have other work to consider. </para>

If any justification were needed for, the course proposed, it would be supplied by the tactics which have been resorted to to-day by opponents of the Electoral Bill. They have not in any way cloaked their design. They have told us here that on every possible occasion they are going to block the Bill, and the Government would be very foolish, indeed, if they accepted the proposals made by those honorable senators in regard to this motion. We are justified, in the interests of the public business before the Senate, in insisting that we shall meet on Tuesdays, seeing that the Senate: arrived at that decision with the full knowledge that the additional sitting day was necessary for the purpose of enabling us to pass the Electoral Bill. </para>
