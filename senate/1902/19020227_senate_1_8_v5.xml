      <para class="block">Hitherto we have been able to do our business on three sitting days in the week, but there is a special urgency for sitting an extra day, and I appeal to honorable senators to aid the Government in their effort to carry out the business we have in hand. As I stated before the recent adjournment, the Government deem it imperative, as I think the Senate will, to deal with the Electoral Bill during this session. We ought to complete that Bill in good time before the Tariff comes up. It is impossible' to say with any certainty, at all events within a. couple of weeks, when we shall get the Tariff, but it may be that it will be sent up considerably before the end of next month. If so we shall want all the time at our disposal in order to get through with the Electoral Bill. If it is not necessary to use the extra Bitting day it will not be used, but if it is necessary to sit on Tuesday in order to insure the passing of that Bill, I shall ask honorable senators to do so. </para>

          <para>- I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> to state whether he intends to ask the Senate to sit next Tuesday. A great many honorable senators may have engagements that will detain them next Tuesday, and, probably, it would clear the way for future arrangements if it were stated whether the Senate is to sit on that day. As for my self, and I believe a majority of those who are associated with me, we are quite prepared to sit on Tuesday, and, if necessary, on Monday, to carry out the work before the Senate. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> will be supported by a majority, as we do not wish to prolong the session over the twelve months if it can be helped. </para>

            <para>- My honorable friend used the expression - of course it was a mere speculation-" considerably before the end of next month." If that is the case, what is the use of passing a motion with a view to give us two Tuesday sittings? The extra day is not asked for in view of the advent of the Tariff, but in view of the position of the Electoral Bill. We can deal with the Tariff when it comes up, and it may be advisable not only to Bit on Tuesdays for that purpose, but to extend our sittings. It is exceedingly inconvenient to have a proposal of this kind brought up now, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has put it, with regard to next Tuesday, some of us are under the necessity of making arrangements as to every Tuesday. We sympathise with those who come from States to which they cannot return at the week-end, but those of us who are in a position to return to our other duties at the end of the week ought also to be somewhat considered. It is really a satire on the proceedings of the Senate that we should be asked to give Tuesday, when the only business before us is the Electoral Bill, which cannot possibly be passed by the other House this session. </para>

            <para>- I shall have something to say about the Tariff later on. We have sat for about ten months, and the only subject holding us together for a prolongation of the session is the Tariff. Does any one suggest that if it were not for the Tariff, which we must deal with, we should be Bitting now? Of course we should not. None of us, however, devoted he may be to public affairs, would entertain fora moment the view that we should be sitting here if it were not for the Tariff. </para>

            <para>- It is better not to take notice of that, I shall not say irrelevant, but somewhat offensive interjection. It really has no bearing on the question, and it is offensive because the imputation of stonewalling is one which ought not to be made, and certainly ought not to be made, even by implication, against myself. There is really no justification for this motion at the present moment, and I shall oppose it. </para>

The leader of the Opposition has said that the motion is premature, but in my opinion it ought to have been made months ago. The honorable and learned senator who can go to his residence and his office every week end wants the business so arranged as to accommodate him. He professes to sympathize very deeply with those of us who come from distant States, and who have been in exile for months, but what is his sympathy worth ? He will not sympathize to the extent of a single sitting. He opposes the. motion while expressing sympathy with honorable senators. One other regret I have is that the capital is not somewhere in the back blocks of Australia. So long as it is on the highway between Sydney and Adelaide, we shall never have the business of this Parliament conducted as it ought to be. Honorable members will be continually on the go to their homes and their businesses, and they will give only an occasional look in at Parliament House. </para>

            <para>- They will stick to their work and get it done, and then they will have an opportunity to go to their homes and their businesses. I was also surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> come forward with the information that we had only one important item of business before us, namely, . the Tariff, and that we were merely marking time in waiting for it. I believe that I have as high an appreciation of the importance of the Tariff as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has, but I recognise that there is another measure of equal importance - I will say of much greater importance - before us than even the Tariff. Surely the honorable and learned senator does not place the political rights and privileges of the people before the mere question of taxation - and that is all the Tariff is? I can see plainly that there is a conspiracy in this Chamber - and probably somewhere else - to defeat the Electoral Bill. I am going to make no empty threat, but I will say this : that if we do not get the Electoral Bill this session it is very probable that we shall not get a Tariff. Some of us here are old hands at the game of stonewalling. I ask honorable senators to take notice of that. We are determined and pledged - some of us at any rate - to get an Electoral Bill, and we are going to use all the means in our power, and to avail ourselves of all the forms of Parliament to get such a measure passed. If honorable senators who think that the Tariff is the only question of importance before the Parliament are desirous of getting that Tariff passed speedily, they will have to come down from their high horse and compromise. It is desirable that we should all recognise the state of affairs now. It will probably save much trouble in the future if that is done, and we shall be able to get both the Tariff and the Electoral Bill passed this session. Then both sides in the Senate will be satisfied. </para>

            <para>- The honorable and learned senator did not raise a murmur of disapprobation when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> made his allusion to a conspiracy. It was only when I asked whether that conspiracy had any relation to this motion that he became so sensitive. I merely wish to direct attention to this position - that we have heard from an honorable senator an expression of a threat which he says was not an empty one. A threat of that kind must have some force behind it. He threatened that unless the Electoral Bill is passed this session, there will be no Tariff. I believe that all honorable senators desire to suit each other's convenience as far as possible. That being so, we can quite understand that honorable senators from distant States may not desire to remain in Melbourne longer than is necessary. But on the other hand I trust that they will give some little consideration to the position of those honorable senators who' are living in the nearer States. The alternative suggestion which I would make to the Vice-President of the Executive Council and to honorable senators generally is this: I am perfectly prepared to give all the time that is necessary to the transaction of the business of the Senate when the urgency is recognised. </para>

            <para>- And probably my judgment would be as sound upon the point as that of the honorable senator. At the present time, if Tuesdays are taken up as sitting days, it is quite evident that those honorable senators who live in South Australia and New South Wales will not be able to return to their respective homes between Friday and Monday. That would mean that we should remain here doing nothing every week-end. I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that he should forego his motion on the present occasion, and that a little later on in the month perhaps, he should ask the Senate to sit on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, , Thursdays, and Fridays. In that case those honorable senators who come from South Australia and New South "Wales would not attempt to go back to their States. On the other hand, we should not be idling in Melbourne. That arrangement would give the Government all the additional time they want. </para>

          <para>- I felt greatly surprised when I heard the Vice-President of the Executive Council yesterday afternoon give notice of this motion. I could see no reason for it. I looked at the notice-paper, and found that there was nothing there to justify such a motion. We have simply the Electoral Bill and the proposition for the adoption of the standing orders which have been prepared by the committee, and which can be discussed at some other time. So that there is really only the Electoral Bill before us, and so far as I can see there is no prospect of that measure being passed by the House of Representatives this session. I have made inquiries amongst members of that House, and not one man whom I have seen on the subject recognised that there was any possibility of the Electoral Bill being made law this session. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I shall do so, because I see no reason for continuing the sittings in order merely to mark time with a measure that cannot, in my opinion, become law this session. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> threat will not, so far as I am concerned, have any effect. When the Tariff is brought before us, there will be sufficient honorable senators to deal with it, and dispose of it as quickly as possible. But such a threat, coming, as it seemed to me to do, from the labour corner, is really answerable for this motion. It seems that the Government are anxious to obtain the extra sitting day in order to push through the Electoral Bill. What they expect to gain I cannot see. I certainly rather favour an adjournment than a continuation of the sittings at the present time. It is quite true that the senators from Western Australia and Queensland cannot return to their homes during a week end. But surely they cannot be desirous of keeping those of us who can return home, when there is really no work for us to do. In fact, if we had sat less than we have done, I believe more work would have been done. It is because we really had so little to do that there has been so much talk, in order that time might be killed. I shall strongly oppose the motion. </para>

I shall be prepared to help them to sit every day in the week when the occasion arises. But I cannot see that it is necessary at the present time. Certainly the notice-paper does not disclose any arrears in. work. The Senate has expeditiously got through the work which has been put before it, and we are only waiting, as is well recognised, for the Tariff to come up from another place. If the Tariff had been passed the Electoral Bill would not have been brought before us.

            <para>- I am sure it would be stopped if the Senate desired to stop it. The threat that the honorable senator has made carries great consequences with it. He says that if the Electoral Bill is not to pass this session, there is to be no Tariff. That statement is perfectly monstrous and absurd. The Tariff is of the utmost importance to the community throughout the whole length and breadth of the Commonwealth. Tilings in the commercial world are in such a state that business men do not know what they are doing. To put the Electoral Bill - which will be in time for the next election if it is passed next session - in the same category as the Tariff, and to say that it is of more importance than the Tariff, is simply absurd. I therefore trust that the Senate will not agree to the motion ; but if, later on, it can be shown that our business is getting into arrears, I shall be only too willing to vote for a motion to the same effect. </para>

          <para>- I think that too much importance has been attached to the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> He, of course, is strongly in favour of the Electoral Bill, as also are other honorable senators. They are anxious to see it passed. Personally, I .am very anxious to see it passed. When I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> notice of this motion on The business paper it struck me that it was rather premature, but after consideration I feel that the Government ought to be the best judges as to the necessity for an additional sitting day. I agree that the Government have acted wisely in consenting to exempt Tuesday next from this proposal. There should be no feeling or heat in regard to the motion. The matter is entirely in our own hands. If the motion is passed, and we find when next Tuesday week arrives that there is no business requiring that we should meet on that day, we need not do so. We pass this motion as a matter of form. I shall support it. In the Queensland </para>

        <para class="block">Parliament I always opposed unnecessary and late sittings. We should not sit late or meet on extra days if the time is only frittered away by useless talk. The Government are the best judges of the time required to carry out the Nation's work, and we ought to assist them in their efforts. Although I consider the Electoral Bill of great importance, I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that if w.e do not pass the Electoral Bill we can have no Tariff this session. The country is languishing for the settlement of the Tariff, and it should be our primary duty to pass it with all possible expedition. </para>

          <para>- As a member of the Senate for Victoria, I feel that I am placed in rather an awkward position in deciding whether or not I should vote for the motion. Honorable senators from three States find it impossible to return to their homes at the end of each week, but honor able senator's representing two other States are able to do so. The Victorian representatives of course are at home. Honorable senators from three States will be benefited by the passing of this motion, while it will be to the disadvantage of two. As the majority must rule it would seem, if that were the only consideration, that the motion should be carried. I am prepared to sit at all times ; I have the advantage of being at home, and I wish we were all in the same position.' Might I suggest that instead of meeting on Tuesdays, the Senate should meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 11 a.m. That would give the Government an additional two hours a day. </para>

            <para>- If we meet on Tuesdays and pass the Electoral Bill, no. doubt the Government will agree to adjourn until the Tariff reaches the Senate, provided that there is no ' other business of importance to be dealt with. While I sympathize with honorable senators from New South Wales and South Australia I feel that they will sympathize with honorable senators from other States who have been here for nearly twelve months, and with few exceptions have not been able to return to their homes. The adjournment which I suggest . would enable some of them to spend a few days in their homes. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> I am very much impressed with the importance of the Electoral Bill. ' There may be some who agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who interjected just now that the Bill, even if it is passed by us, has not the shadow of a chance of being passed by another place this session. It must not be forgotten, however, that early in the session, the Senate, on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett,</inline> passed a resolution providing that any measure not completed this session may be taken up, when we meet again, at the stage which it had reached when Parliament was prorogued. Therefore if we pass the Electoral Bill this session no time will be wasted, and upon the other House will rest the responsibility of leaving it until next session. </para>

            <para>- AVith regard to the proposal made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, it seems to me that there is now a clear-cut issue as to whether or not we are going to push on with the Electoral Bill. The opposition to this proposal comes from those who are either opposed to the Bill or think that it is unimportant, and should not be taken this session. If the latter view were correct, seeing that with the exception of the standing orders there is no other business for us to deal with, it would be more reasonable for us to say that we should adjourn until the Tariff is ready for us. If we are going to meet until the Tariff is ready for us, let us so arrange our sittings that our work will be effectual. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> proposal is a business-like one. It is that we shall use the time at our disposal before the Tariff reaches us in passing what we consider to be a very important measure. Holding the view that the Government do, that the Electoral Bill is a very important measure, and one that should be pressed forward, I fail to see how we could use our time better- than by going on with it. </para>

There is no doubt that we proceeded very slowly with some of our work. This is really what the proposal comes to - that the convenience of honorable senators is to be decided by the question of whether they are for or against the Electoral Bill. I protest against that entirely. We should discuss the convenience of each other, quite apart from any such consideration. This is not a party question. It is a question of our own convenience, and we should take care that no more inconvenience is inflicted upon us than can possibly be helped'. </para>

            <para>- I sympathize very much with' honorable senators who cannot get to their homes every week, but, after all, we must consider the balance of convenience, and we have to deal with everything connected with- Parliament is a working concern in such a. way as to make it work permanently and well. We are shortly to have the great Tariff question before us, and if in the consideration of that business we are asked to sit every day in the week, I shall be one to say " yes." Because I look upon the condition of things as so serious that I think we should reserve our' powers so as to be able to endure anything rather than delay the passing of that business, which is of such vital interest to the Commonwealth. We have not that business before us yet, and I do not see why we should enter upon unusual sittings to deal with <inline font-style="italic">fi</inline> measure that might have been introduced months ago, and which is rushed upon us now. I will never allow the- fact that I am for or against a BUI to interfere with my consideration for the convenience of honorable senators in conducting the ordinary business of Parliament. We 1]ave agreed to certain days of sitting, and let us adhere to them, unless there is some strong reason against it. In view of the important business which is to come before us, we need to take a breathing space, rather than to exhaust ourselves before the great labour of the session is undertaken. It is not right that, because the Government at a comparatively late stage of the .session chooses to introduce this Bill as a stop-gap, we should be asked to alter an arrangement which concerns the convenience of' the majority of honorable senators very much. There is no necessity to deal with this motion at 'the present time. If next week it is found to be necessary, let us have it brought on, but, in the meantime, I am opposed to it. </para>

I desire to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that there is no possible chance of the Electoral Bill becoming law this session. The honorable senator appears to have forgotten- that the moment the House of Representatives has finished the consideration of the Tariff it must tackle the Estimates ; and, as soon as it has dealt with the Estimates, it must tackle a number of most important amendments in the Public Service Bill, -which will require most serious consideration. After that, it must consider the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill. </para>

            <para>- Then it has to visit the federal sites, which will ' occupy two weeks and four days. It is, therefore, perfectly hopeless to think of the Electoral Bill becoming law this session. While I admit that it is an important measure, there cannot be the slightest urgency about it, because we all have our State electoral laws to work under ; and if this Bill should be passed this time next year that will be early enough. "What is troubling me is that the Senate is going to be placed in a most embarrassing position in connexion with the consideration 'of the Tariff! which is the most important measure this Parliament will have to consider. Two Ministers; several members of the Senate, and members of the House of Representatives are going home to the old country, and they must leave not later than the 12th of May next. If the Tariff does not come up to us almost immediately, and certainly within the next three weeks, we shall have to do in less than as many weeks what the House of Representatives has taken months to do. While I admit that that House is doing very good work in putting the Tariff into a workable shape in many ways, and so lessening the work which appeared before us in the first instance, I still think that too little time will be left to the Senate to properly consider it. </para>

            <para>- That is so, but when we come to the month of May next I have no doubt that it will strike those of us who have homes and' businesses to attend to that we have been in session for twelve months, and that we shall begrudge every additional hour that we are away from our homes and businesses. When a number of Members of Parliament are going away to the other, end of the world, will if not represent itself to each of us that in the middle of May we ought to close the session, and will we not be absolutely forced into hurrying the consideration of the Tariff? I say we shall be compelled by our anxiety to put an end to the longest session on record, and to get away to attend to our own businesses in order to keep the pot boiling, to hurry through with the Tariff. I think the Vice-President of the Executive Council might ask the Prime Minister to represent to another place - in the most respectful manner, of course - that we do hope to see the Tariff' within the next three weeks. If we do not receive it within th'at time we shall not be able to consider it properly. I shall vote for the motion. I have been in attendance in the Senate every hour since the session opened, but I may not be able to continue my attendance if we are asked to sit in June and July. </para>

          <para>- I think the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> that the motion should be deferred until next week is a very reasonable one. This is another of the surprise motions th'at have been sprung upon us, and about which many honorable senators "have known nothing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has agreed to except Tuesday in next week from the operation of the motion, if carried, and consequently it has . lost all its urgency. I do not think there is any member of the Senate, or any opponent of mine in New South Wales or elsewhere, who would ever think of charging me with a desire to shirk work. While the session has lasted I have done my best to take my full share of the work, but I feel that I am now quite justified in asking for some consideration. I have' no hesitation in saying that the Electoral Bill is one of the most portentious and complex pieces of legislation ever put before any Parliament in the world. The work its consideration will entail will be very severe, and the debates upon it must necessarily be very prolonged. It is as absolutely impossible for that Bill to be passed this session as it is for any of us to learn to fly. I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> will consider the desirability of deferring this motion 'fdr a week, when we may be able to see more clearly the advisability of it. </para>

            <para>- How much notice does the honorable senator require? It was really to suit the convenience of honorable senators that, when the suggestion was made to me, I decided, if this motion were carried, as I hope it will be, not to ask the House to sit on Tuesday next. I take it that will be sufficient notice 'to enable any honorable senator to make the necessary arrangements* I could not help being struck bv hearing so much" about the convenience of honorable senators, and nothing about the conduct of public business. I am as willing as any man, and always have been, to consult the convenience of honorable senators as much as possible in the conduct of. Government business; but that ought to be subordinate always to the one important consideration that we are here to do the public business. It is because I see no hope of effectually carrying on the public business in regard to this Electoral Bill unless we meet on extra sitting days, that I am asking the Senate to agree to this motion. The Postmaster-General has properly said that this is really a question between those who are in favour of the Electoral Bill and desire to carry it, and those who are not. Although my honorable and learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> deprecated any such issue being placed before the Senate, he immediately afterwards in the course of his speech showed that his principal reason for objecting to the motion is that he believes there is no necessity to pass this measure, and that. there is nothing for us to do. I protest altogether against the assumption that the business of the Electoral Bill is not of importance, and I also protest against the view that it is not urgent. During next year the senatorial elections must take place, and, it may be, other elections as well, because we never know what may happen. Before the end of the year the senatorial elections must take place, and when it is remembered that the necessary machinery must be put in motion if the Electoral Bill is passed, it will be seen that it will be none too soon if it is carried during the present session. I regret very much that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> thought it necessary .to make a threat about the business of the House. I do not think the honorable senator seriously meant what he said, because I am quite certain he knows enough of political life to be- aware that if a person desires to obtain his object the very worst course to pursue is to threaten men who 'have any self respect. I do- not' care from what side it comes, if there is any attempt to "stone-wall" </para>

Honorable senators must realize that while we are all quite willing to consult the convenience of those who can get away to their homes at the end of the week, there are a number of honorable senators from other States who cannot get away at all, and it is only by doing some completed work, such as we have before us, that their time can be profitably occupied. I undertake, if the motion is carried, that the Government will not make use of it unless it is necessary. I hope that such progress will be made with the Electoral Bill that we shall get through it before the Tariff comes up to the Senate. If we do there is no reason why the convenience of honorable senators, subject always to the consideration of private business on the paper, may not be fully considered. </para>

            <para>- I think that the Senate may fairly congratulate itself upon the debate on this measure. I hope we shall all help: - I shall try to do what I can - to maintain the level which has been reached. We have had speeches, earnest and direct, and I think I may say informing, from various honorable senators. I am indebted to those speeches for great assistance in dealing with these mathematical mystications, which are calculated to defy the wit of man, certainly the wit of the man in the street. Certain aspects of the question have been put before us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> who comes here, as other senators from Tasmania do, with experience of an election conducted under a system not exactly the same but corresponding with some modifications, to that proposed for our acceptance. We had a speech last evening from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> from the point cf view of one who takes, a parental interest in the question, because he, with the enthusiasm of a father, and with a natural pride, told us that he had introduced a similar measure into the Parliament of "Victoria. If I may say so, the weightiest portion of his earnest address was at the close, where he impressed on all of us the great importance of the new departures contained in the Bill, and also the fact that those new departures demanded the most careful and prolonged consideration on the part of the Senate. From that I think none of us can possibly dissent, and it is because I view the Bill from exactly the same stand-point, because I do not undervalue its importance in the slightest degree, because I consider it of the highest consequence, that I protest against its being brought before the Senate at the fag-end of a very long session. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> in a vigorous speech smote the Bill hip and thigh. My view of the Bill is certainly not a favorable one ; but if it were more favorable than it is I should still protest against a measure of this character being launched, not only at the fag-end of a session, but at a time when we are simply waiting from day to day for the really important and serious business we have to undertake. The importance of the Bill is manifest from various statements made by honorable senators on other occasions. Nothing can more intimately concern any self-governing community than the basis of its representation, and next, if not equal, in point of importance to the basis of its representation is the method by which that system of representation is to be carried into effect, and by which the control of the people over their own self-government is to be assured. Under these circumstances, and having regard to its importance, the question is, What are we to do with the BDI? Expressions have been used - I shall not say when and where, because it would be improper to allude to earlier proceedings in the Chamber - suggesting some conspiracy to put an end to this Bill or to stop its progress. I emphatically repudiate anything of that kind, but I am utterly and irrevocably opposed to' the Bill. I am utterly and irrevocably opposed to its being proceeded with this session, for reasons which I shall briefly enumerate in a moment, and I intend to take every means in my power to prevent its being passed into law, certainly with, the new-fangled proposals in relation to the system of voting which are for the first time sprung, not only upon us, but upon the Commonwealth. But the question is what course we should adopt. I do not think we should be called upon to, affirm or to disaffirm, in fairness to the measure or to those who believe in it, these numerous debatable principles which it contains. It seems to me that it ought to receive much more prolonged consideration than is possible now, and that in view' of the position of the session and of other circumstances which I shall mention, we should decline to proceed further with its consideration now. .In order to raise a distinct issue on which honorable senators who take a different view may have an opportunity of expressing their opinions and voting, I move - </para>

              <para>- My honorable and learned friend must forgive the honorable senator, because he really does not understand what he is talking about. It is undesirable that we should, vote on these principles. We should stay our hand. We should give ample time to ourselves, and to the constituencies we represent, to consider the important departures contained in the measure, and my amendment is moved in this form so that it may not interfere with any honorable senator who may desire to move an amendment on the subsequent words before they are struck out, as they would necessarily be if my amendment were carried. Let us consider for one moment, apart from the contents of the Bill, what .it is we are asked to do at this period of the session. It is admitted that we are waiting for the arrival of the Tariff. It is admitted, as has been pointed out this very afternoon, that if it were not that the Tariff has been so greatly delayed, we should never have heard a word about this Bill. </para>

          <para class="block">My honorable and learned friend appealed to us to deal kindly with these explanations, and if we were bamboozled by them, to remember the difficulty that the gentlemen stating these propositions have to face in order to put mathematical facts and processes into ordinary language. How very difficult must it be for the man in the street to understand them when the person who has to write them down, although he possesses a mathematical intellect of superlative power, finds a difficulty in expressing them in ordinary language ? A measure of 206 clauses proposing a fundamental change in the constitutional principles which have formed the electoral basis of the British system of self-government for centuries is what we are asked to deal with during the next two or three weeks. Why, sir, I say it is impossible. I have just as much capacity for work as most men, and with the feeble understanding which I possess, I should be glad to apply it every day and every night to this question ; but I say that it is impossible for us to deal fairly with the electoral rights of the people as established by the Constitution, so forcibly dealt with yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer,</inline> in the time at our disposal in connexion with this Bill. It is a Bill which ought to be introduced, not at the extreme end of a twelve months' session, but at the beginning of a new session. It is, moreover, a Bill consisting partly of machinery, but more largely of new departures and so-called principles. If this were purely a machinery . Bill, applicable simply to regulating the polling booths, the districts, and all that sort of thing, I should be the first to say - " Let us try to do what we can with it." If the Government had been in earnest - I do not say for a moment that they are deliberately, wanting in earnestness about it, or are introducing it merely as a stop gap, which I think it is - if they had wanted merely machinery, they could have brought in a Machinery Bill, with which we could have dealt, applicable to the existing 'system of voting which has prevailed ever since Australia, has had representative Government. During that time we have had very good Houses of Parliament elected under the old system, and it would not have hurt us a bit to have had another election for the House of Representatives under that system. Certainly it would not have hurt us to have had three senators from each State elected under the existing and well tried - system. At any rate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> this is not merely a machinery Bill. But, so far as it is machinery, let me. point out to honorable senators that it is machinery on the assumption that what is called the Franchise Bill is also to become law. </para>

              <para>- I take what my honorable and learned friend has said, and I urge that the machinery in this Bill is not applicable to the existing systems ; and if it is, as I shall show in a moment, it is one of the most costly bits of machinery, so far as regards the State of South Australia, that was ever invented. We ought not to be called upon to deal with this Bill, so far even as it is a machinery Bill, until we have the Franchise Bill either concurrently passing through the Chamber with it, or until we know that it will be passed into law. Then, again, I say that this Bill is not urgent. As has been pointed out this afternoon there will be ample time to introduce this measure during the next session of the present Parliament this year. Let us devote our first fresh energies when we meet again to the Electoral Bill. The Senate elections do not take place until towards the end of 1903; and if we pass the Franchise Bill establishing a uniform adult suffrage for the whole Commonwealth, then, the provisions with regard to getting people on the roll - assuming that they are applicable - can be carried out in a very simple way. Because there is no trouble about the qualifications. Every adult will be capable of being placed on the roll and the only questions that will have to be asked will be - Is the person an alien, and has that person resided within the Commonwealth for the prescribed time? So that if this Bill were passed into law before the end of this year it would be in ample time for the elections, which, as I have said, do not take place until towards the end of 1903, when the Bill would be in force. If so, there is time enough ; but if not, surely there is no great reason, when we have had one election under the existing system with a very fair result, why we should not have another. We may congratulate ourselves, I think, on the result so far. </para>

          <para>SenatorSir JOSIAH SYMON. - Exactly, and why should we not have another? What dreadful rushing haste is there for introducing this new-fangled system, when we have secured a very good representation under the system as it exists <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If there is time, as I submit there is, before the end of 1903, to pass this measure and make it applicable to that election, then let us adopt that course. If, on the other hand, there is not tune, there will be no great harm in having another election as we had the last one, under the old familiar system of voting which we have had for years past. I say, and it has been affirmed again and again by different honorable senators, that even if the Bill gets through this Chamber there is not the last chance of its becoming law. The Bill has not the least chance of passing through the House of Representatives this session, looking at the multiplicity of business we have had enumerated this afternoon which the other Chamber will have to undertake. I have heard no one pledge himself as to the attitude of the other Chamber with regard to this Bill. If there is no chance of passing it this session, and if there is no chance of passing the Franchise Bill this session, is there the slightest reason in the world why we should occupy ourselves in coming, perhaps, to a hasty and immature conclusion upon the many important matters we are asked to legislate upon by this measure'! If the intention merely is to bring into debate, the principle of proportional representation,- why did not the Government do that upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> motion, which has been upon the business paper ever since Parliament met? For eight or nine months that motion has been on the paper, and has never been considered. </para>

We cannot read the explanations of this Bill - and there are eight pages of them - without seeing that in certain instances the returning officer is to use his discretion as to the order in which he will deal with certain classes of these votes. The electors will not feel enamoured of a system which enables a manipulation of that kind to take place with regard to votes, although it may be a perfectly honest manipulation. </para>

              <para>- This is not a question of a casting vote. We shall hear what Miss Spence says about it .in a minute. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor's</inline> notice of motion, which appeared on the business paper some time ago, was with regard to the Hare-Spence system. Has he abandoned that System ? Has he deserted his friends, the advocates of the Hare - Spence system in South Australia? Is he going to adopt this system ? I am bound to confess that, although the Hare-Spence system has been under discussion, it has never been put to any electoral issue anywhere. It has had a small and highly esteemed band of very active adherents, but they themselves are still in a minority, and they disapprove of the system embodied in this Bill. I shall read presently Miss Spence's views upon the subject, and her great and most just complaint, not as to the accidental disfranchisement of electors, not as to the mere throwing away of a vote, as every elector is entitled <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> do if he chooses ; but as to the deliberate disfranchisement of a large body of electors simply in order that this mathematical toy of Professor Sanson's, with the Droop quota, Shall be brought into play. I desire - and I think the Senate will join with me in that desire - to be guided to some extent by the opinion of the people. I must say I prefer the collective judgment of the people, who have the right of self-government, to the eccentricities of all the mathematicians in the world. If the people of Australia tell me that they want a system which is admittedly complicated and confusing, a system which even Professor Nan son admits may possibly be misunderstood, except by a highly intelligent and highly educated body of people, then I shall support it ; but not until then. At any rate, I am standing by my amendment. I put it forward individually. There is no party question about this matter. Honorable senators on the other side of the House have spoken upon the Bill with great ability, and I am going to state my honest individual views upon it. I shall do so with the utmost friendliness to the Government and every one else, including honorable senators in the labour corner. </para>

              <para>- I was coming to it, but I was not allowed to do so. I say, with the utmost fairness, that we should suspend our judgment upon this measure until it has been before the country for a little longer than two or three weeks, and until we have had some opportunity of ascertaining whether the States who are vitally interested, so far as we are concerned, have been able adequately to consider it. In viewing these things we cannot shut our eyes to what I think are growing signs of disappointment with the. early progress of Commonwealth affairs. It is deeply to be regretted that there are these indications of disappointment, in, I will not say all, but certainly in some of the States. It is by rushing legislation of this sort, by attempting to put it through Parliament before the people have had an opportunity of fully considering it, that we intensify that feeling of disappointment and discontent ; and we are very apt, if not careful, to do mischief to the federal sentiment that we are all desirous of encouraging. Let us hast n slowly. Do not let us introduce all kinds of legislation in the first session of this Parliament. Some honorable senators seem to fear that this Parliament is not going to out-last its first session. We are having almost everything of the most vital and debatable kind thrust before us now. Let us exercise a little moderation; and I hope that, with regard to this Bill, that appeal will not be in vain. I have given these reasons in detail, apart from the Bill itself, because I think that without even considering the Bill we ought to pause before wo press it forward now with such haste. </para>

It is exceedingly controversial in its machinery provisions, quite apart from the vital departure contained in the principle to which I have alluded incidentally. I shall enumerate two or three of these points, so that honorable senators may have an opportunity of considering them. Would it not be better to have the Bill reconsidered before the Senate is asked practically to take in hand what will be the re-drafting of it <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> In the first place I join with other honorable senators in expressing astonishment that clauses 23 and 24 should ever have found a place in the Bill.

              <para>- It is one blot upon the measure. It is true that it is perfectly competent for the Senate, by legislation, to deprive itself of the high constitutional functions which devolve upon it ; but certainly it is amazing that the Government, by a Bill of this description, should invite the Senate to efface itself, and to delegate to the House of Representatives the final arbitrament of the basis of representation for the House of Representatives in each State, so far as electoral districts go. There is nothing more vital that we could possibly legislate about in respect of the power of the States. I shall not go into the matter in detail, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> argued it elaborately yesterday, and pointed out the facilities which this proposal would offer for a system of gerry-mandering  to which that which prevailed for so long, and shocked all publicists in America, would be a mere circumstance. The Ministry of the day are to appoint the commissioners ; the commissioners are to plan out these districts, 'and having done so, their proposals are to go before the House of Representatives. If those proposals are not  satisfacfactorv.  in the way they desire, the Ministerial majority there may hand them back, not for the good of the whole community, not for the good of the States whose interests we- are supposed specially to protect, but for the benefit of the Government, and. of the majority of the day in the other House, over whom we  would have  no control. If the Senate consented, by a measure of this kind, to strip itself of this power of control in a vital matter, it would not be worthy of the place it occupies under the Constitution, and very few of us would feel honoured by having a seat in it. There is another matter to which I should like to call the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and so far as I can see no consideration has been given to it. In what way is the representation of the States to be arrived at? I invite consideration of this matter before any further progress is made with the Bill. Under the Constitution the representation of each State depends upon the population, to be determined according to the latest statistics. Provision was also made in the Constitution that the first election should proceed upon a fixed basis, which is set forth. That, of course, was necessary in order to enable the first elections for the Commonwealth Parliament to take place. But we have had a census since the Constitution came into force. There is no provision in this Bill for the revision of that representation, as there must be, and .there can be no .division into districts, honorable senators will find, until we first establish the representation to which each State is entitled. That can be ascertained only upon the basis of the latest statistics, that is the census of the Commonwealth upon which it has to be founded. This is a matter which will involve reconsideration and the introduction of fresh clauses in the Bill.,  Before dealing, as I intend to do very shortly, with what I call the new-fangled departures in the Bill, I would also point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that Parts III. and V. are an absolute incurable muddle. In the first place, Part III. deals with the electoral divisions. The electoral divisions are to be ascertained under clause 17 by reference to the whole number of the electors in each State. How is the number of electors in each State to be ascertained until Part "V. has been carried out? It cannot be done. "Elector," according to the Bill, means " any person whose name appears on a roll as an elector." I am pointing out these matters in order to show how little consideration has been given to this measure, and with a view of assisting my honorable friends of the Government, if they are able to get their Bill into committee, to put it into some shape in which we shall be able to deal with it. An elector is a person whose name appears on the roll as an elector. Clause 3 provides that the divisions are to be fixed by means of the number of electors. But we cannot ascertain the number of electors until we have got the divisions. The fact of the matter is that the two things are absolutely contradictory. We cannot have the divisions until we have got the number of electors, and we, cannot have the number of electors until we have got the divisions. That is the position under this Bill. </para>

              <para>- I am obliged to the honorable senator for saying that. That just shows, as I have said before, that the provisions of this Bill are applicable, and are intended to be applicable, to the uniform franchise. We can take the existing roll in South Australia, for instance, because there we have adult suffrage ; but do we not want adult suffrage in the other States as well ? The suggestion .that we might take the existing roll is an obvious one, which would occur to anybody ; but we cannot take the existing roll, because the feature of this Bill is that it rests upon the establishment of adult suffrage. </para>

              <para>- My honorable and learned friend, I am sure, says that without sufficient consideration. If he will only read Parts III. and V. attentively, he will see that it does not matter ' two straws which system we take, the thing is absolutely unworkable. We cannot get the divisions until we get the number of electors, and we cannot get the number of electors until we get the divisions. That is the essence of those two parts. Honorable senators will find that that is made perfectly clear by clauses 31 and 32. I also wish to point out that all the provisions about the courts of revision ought to be reconsidered and recast. The courts of revision provided for in this measure will entail a degree of election expense which we little dream of. So far as South Australia is concerned, there is no necessity for them at all. Where we have got adult suffrage all that we need to ask is-" Is the adult an alien <inline font-style="italic">1"</inline> and- " Has the adult been resident <inline font-style="italic">1 "</inline> We need no elaborate courts of revision with all their attendant expenses, because if we have uniform suffrage, it will extend throughout the Commonwealth, and, as I have said, these courts of revision are unnecessary at the present moment in the case of South Australia. It has always been understood that .the elections for the Senate and House of Representatives should take place at the same time. I desire to know if that is still contemplated ; because, if it is, 'this Bill contains no provision on the subject. Not only is there no provision, but we ' wish to know whether all the papers are to be jumbled into one box, or if there are to be two boxes and two scrutineers,' which scrutiny is to take precedence - because they must be different - that for the Senate or that for the House of Representatives. Then again, the Bill contains no authority so far as I have been able to discover, for a returning officer to engage assistance. The returning officers will need an army of auditors at their elbows to enable them to carry out this system, and there is no provision in this Bill for them. </para>

              <para>- It is an. obvious fact that they will require an army of auditors, but it is not an obvious fact that they have authority to engage assistance, and' it must be put into the Bill somewhere or other. . , There is another point that has evidently been lost sight of. Clause 41 of the Constitution to which attention was called at some length yesterday afternoon, , deals, I venture to think, with the question <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> franchise alone. It provides that no voter for a State shall be deprived of his right of voting. Therefore, the Commonwealth voting must be guided by the laws of; the States, because if we provide by legislation in such a way as to enable the ' Commonwealth to deprive any one whose name is on a State roll of the right to vote, we shall be infringing that provision of the Constitution and 'taking away the right of voting from a voter who is clothed with it by the law of the State to which he belongs. In framing . these provisions it should be provided ' that the rolls of the States should be accepted, when we get uniform suffrage, and should be adopted as the Commonwealth rolls, as they have been already in the elections that have taken place, or else we must have some machinery by which any divergence between the two rolls may be investigated and adjusted. Again, there is another most important matter which is a new departure, and that is the voting by post. No one can say that that is not open to serious controversy, not only as to the principle, but also as to the method prescribed in this Bill. I take very grave exception to it. I have enumerated these only as samples of other matters of an exceedingly controversial character which are embodied in this Bill, quite apart from the new departures proposed in regard to the system of voting. These are only samples, but if honorable senators will examine the other provisions for themselves they will find that there is an endless extent of work before us in committee upon this Bill, and a task which we should not be asked to undertake until the Government have revised it with a view of having it put into some better shape. This is all apart from the main matters of principle. But there is a fatal blot, it seems to me, upon this Bill as a whole in respect to more serious matters. It adopts two different systems for the Senate and the House of Representatives. I say, without any hesitation, that that is a fatal blot upon the whole thing. The two are absolutely contradictory and self -destructive. If we adopt the one for the House of Representatives, it cuts the ground absolutely from under our feet with regard to the Senate. If, on the other hand, we say that the system we propose here for the Senate is the true system of representation, then away goes our single electorates for the House of Representatives, and to be just and true, we must apply the same system to that House. I say that no Bill ought to be entertained for a moment which embodies a contradiction of that kind, and no body of self-respecting legislators ought to be asked to take it into consideration. I am going to read one or two passages from the speech of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, which amazed me very much, though they filled me with admiration of the honorable and learned senator's skill in skating upon very thin ice. We all know what an accomplished advocate he is, and that he has the skill like other accomplished advocates, to sometimes make the worse appear the better reason. In this instance, he was not called upon to do that, and he did not do it. It was, perhaps, the boldness of it that carried us away, but the honorable and learned senator stated that he advocated this system of single electorates and a majority vote - which means practically the block vote - for the House of Representatives, because that was the fairest system of representation. Then, when he came to deal with the Senate, he said that the true system of representing the people was the proportional system. The only arguments I am going to use on this occasion are those which have been supplied to us by my honorable and learned friend, and which are stated as he always states his arguments, in language of the most lucid character, so that, unlike this system, he who runs may read.

              <para>- Of course you do ; but there is a better way to get an absolute majority, if my honorable friend will accept the suggestion, and that is to insert a little clause to the effect that only two candidates shall stand for one seat. Every voter would thoroughly understand that. It is astonishing to me that it should be necessary for all these electoral reformers to indulge in underhand and indirect ways of getting at these majorities. I cannot see why we should have the contingent vote at all, but I have no objection to single electorates ; without the contingent vote I think it is a very excellent thing, except for the Senate. I wish to guard against that, for a reason I shall mention presently. I must cull one or two other passages from this excellent summary of the arguments' delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> At page 9537 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> this passage occurs - </para>

          <para class="block">That is a general proposition; it is exactly what you get by single electorates for the House of Representatives. </para>
          <para>The only fair way to get a true representation of a community is to have a representation proportionate to the opinion of the community, and then, when the representatives have met together, the majority of those representatives must decide. </para>

The important constitutional question is not yet settled as to the degree of control which, under certain circumstances, the Senate may or may not exercise. But undoubtedly, subject to that problem, the Government is directly responsible to the House of Representatives, and that is the House of all others to which this proposal should be applied. Then, continues <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> - </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">And the truest way to do that, as pronounced over and over again by my honorable and learned friend, is by means of proportional representation. I ask, which policy do the Government ask us to adopt? Are we to be on both sides of the gutter, so to speak, or are we to devote our attention to one? Is it to be the policy of securing for the people of this country, who are the electors of both Houses, the truest system of representation ? The ideal representation, my honorable and learned friend says, is proportional representation, and the nearer any system approaches to that, the truer will your representation be. Is it to be that, or is it to be the other system, which he says is also the truest representation - single electorates, with what is a majority vote, but, with the device of the contingent vote, which is to secure the theoretical absolute majority ? We do not want the contingent vote, but if we do, and we are to have single electorates, what is good for the House, which of all others is to represent the opinions of the people as we represent, if you like, the solidarity of the States? There is no reason why the Senate should be used like an anatomist's subject for these electoral experiments ; and why, if these principles, so ably stated by my honorable and learned friend, are true and well founded, they should not be applied to people voting for one House, just as they are to people voting for the other. That of itself is a fatal blot on this measure, and no argument is wanted to explode it and its policy, beyond those which my honorable and learned friend used and which are mutually destructive. I am not indisposed to favour single electorates, but if I did, it should certainly not be with the contingent vote. I shall state in a minute the reason why I take that view. There always will be the same difficulty in regard to the contingent vote as there is in regard to many of these aspects of the system of proportional representation. If you have three men standing for one seat you will always have the element of difficulty on the part of the voter - an element of difficulty recognised by the advocates of proportional representation in stating their preferences. There is no system of bracketing and so on provided, but there will be always that difficulty. For instance, you may have A, a free-trader, B, a protectionist, and C, a representative of labour. You may find A voting for the free-trader, and saying - " To whom am I to give my second vote ? I do not like the labour candidate. I think his inclinations are towards free-trade, but there are other reasons why I think he may subordinate free-trade to other questions on which I differ with him. What am Ito do? The protectionist is a good fellow, and I shall give him my vote." You cannot eliminate the personal equation. In these systems the mathematicians have been too much in the habit of treating voters as though they were not human beings, but algebraic symbols. That is the difficulty we labour under. You cannot eliminate the personal equation ; and the probability is that if obliged to make a preference the elector would give his vote for a protectionist, although he was a freetrader, because he thought that the protectionist was a conscientious man who would, in spite of his fiscal views, be likely to agree with him on other more vital matters upon which he would disagree with his friend, the labour candidate. </para>

              <para>- There are scores of them. You cannot have a rigid iron-bound organization. My honorable and learned friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, acknowledges that the personal equation was a great element in his return - that is, not personal altogether in a limited sense, but that the electors took into account the federal services he had rendered, and other things which affected the vote of the solid freetraders of New South Wales. I also acknowledge with gratitude the help I myself had in attaining to the honorable position I occupied in South Australia, from my friends of the labour party as well as from many among the protectionists. You will always have such cases. You can never eliminate the personal element. The great mistake, in all these calculations is in assuming that every man who belongs to any particular party upon one subject will always be likely to vote solidly with that party, and that you can treat the whole thing as a mathematical problem. You cannot. The figures given by my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> last night, were exceedingly instructive; but they were altogether arbitrary. He took 120,000 voters, of whom, he said, the protectionists numbered 65,000, and the freetraders 55,000. He assumed that there were three seats, and, from that assumption, he proposed to unravel the whole problem Of representation and to say who would be returned. </para>

              <para>- The Droop system doe's away with the tie, and the result of it is to disfranchise one quota. That is the price we pay for this nice little arrangement. Miss Spence has shown that at the last election in South Australia 22,000 odd voters would have been disfranchised under the Droop combination. I say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that such a thing would be a scandal. </para>

              <para>- I put the figures I have mentioned to my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> and ask him to tell us, applying the quota system, who would get in, because there are only three seats, and each of the three members would have to get 30,000 votes. If it cannot be worked out by ordinary mathematical processes, perhaps the binomial theorem might enable some one to work it out? In considering this Bill, however, there is a much larger question that ought to be borne in mind. That is : What does our system of representation mean ? I think we may say that for some 600 years back - at least, as far as the annals of parliamentary government go - the British people have had, as the underlying principle of their system of parliamentary election, that the majority of voices upon any question should elect the representatives. That we may take as being the historical and solid parliamentary principle for all that time. Are we going to overthrow it? I admit that it is not perfect. </para>

              <para>- My honorable friend's interjection is an instructive one, because, as he says, as long ago as 1.867, the conservative party adopted the three-cornered constituency system, limiting the right of voting to two members. That system lasted until 1884, when it was swept away as a vicious excrescence. </para>

              <para>- That is so. How that came about is instructive in connexion with this question. It came about in this way. The conservatives introduced their Reform Bill in 1867. This proposal to introduce three-corner constituencies was made in the House of Commons. It was denounced by the leader of the conservatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Disraeli,</inline> in no measured terms. He said it was a system for introducing the representation of all kinds of crotchets. It was pronounced by probably the greatest liberal or radical then in Parliament, John Bright, to be utterly at variance with the traditional. a.nd time-honoured principle of majority rule. </para>

              <para>- I believe my honorable friend will find that I am right in what I have said. The Bill went to the House of Lords, where some of the conservatives favoured some system of proportional representation. The three-cornered constituency system was favoured by them, and an amendment to that effect was moved. It was resisted by Lord Derby, but it was carried against the Government ; and then, just as Ministers have to do in other Houses of Parliament, when the Bill came back to the House of Commons the Ministry had to swallow their convictions and retain the three-cornered - constituency system in the Bill. That is how it happened. It was not introduced by the conservatives. It to not introduced by those liberals, like John Bright, who favoured the widest possible representation of the people. It was introduced in their teeth, and it was to save the 1867 Reform Bill that the conservative Government voted for it, although they disliked it utterly. Subject to that, and subject to other efforts that were made, we have had the system of majority rule prevailing throughout British parliamentary history. I am in favour of majority rule. When we talk about representation, it does not mean that Parliament is a consultative and deliberative body only. If Parliament were merely a consultative and deliberative body there would, I think, be very strong reasons - at least there would be a strong argument for consideration - for some system of representing diverse and conflicting opinions. But Parliament is a legislative and governing body. And who is to govern, I should like to know, upon every principle of democracy? The majority ! </para>

              <para>- It is only very lately that the proportionalists have said that. "What's in a name?" They could not carry this system if they had called it minority representation. They changed its name, and called it proportional representation. But that was not good enough to conjure with. Now they even say that it is majority representation. Some of us dislike a thing that has so many aliases. I suspect it ; and whilst I am glad to have those cheers for the great principle of majority rule, I shall show my honorable friends that they are not going to - I use the expression with no imputation - sneak in this proportional representation, and expect us to believe that it is majority rule. </para>

              <para>- Another thing that has to be remembered is that majority rule does not mean that the absolute majority is to govern. There is a confusion of ideas on this subject. It never has been so. If the people or parties choose for some reason of their own to split themselves into three, and some party chooses, instead of allying itself with a main party - I do not say whether there should be two, or three, or twenty parties - seeks to hold the balance of power, I do not see why you should ask for what is unattainable - -an absolute majority. What governs is the dominant majority. If an issue is put to the country, you are not to destroy the effect of the block vote by cutting up, as my honorable and learned friend did the other day, the returns from New South Wales - I am instructed, by-the-way, that his figures are open to correction - and saying that if you take the whole lot the free-traders had not an absolute majority. But the free-traders are in the ascendant. It is the dominant majority. It is the same with the protectionists in Victoria. Are we to say that the protectionists are not to have their way, because they have not an absolute majority, not through any fault of their own,, but because there have been divisions? That is no excuse. Nan son admits that men may lose their votes; that a man who votes "1" for the excluded candidate under any of these computations throws his vote away. What do you do ? You determine whether the candidate is to have a place or not, you determine his rejection, by the number of his primary votes. Notwithstanding that he may have a great number of secondary votes you reject the candidate, you deprive him of the benefit of them - unless under certain conditions which arise - and practically destroy the effect of the whole of' the primary votes given to him. </para>

              <para>- I should have thought that he did. My honorable and learned friend can explain how he does not. Let us go a step further in this question of majority representation. The Cabinet stands in exactly the same relation to the Parliament as does the Parliament to the people. It is the majority of the people who govern. They control the Government of the country .by sending in a majority. The minority is represented always whether it is in one or two parties. There may be a majority of protectionists or free-traders in the Senate, but if there is a majority of one party, there is a minority of the other. The minority is always represented, and no one desires to exclude it from representation. But what is the object of this complicated system which rests, as I shall show, not upon the representation of majorities, but upon the representation of sections and fads - fractional representation, which will be destructive of anything like majority rule or responsible Government. I have pointed out that the relation the Ministry bears to Parliament is exactly that which Parliament bears to the people. What is the situation of a Ministry under any system of responsible Government? It represents the majority in Parliament ; it represents the dominant power. It does not matter whether there are three or four sections, all of whom may be competing with each other, it represents - whether it can obtain the support of any particular section or not - the dominant majority of the Parliament. What are we going to do if we introduce this system of proportional representation ? Are we going to apply it to the Ministry ? To be logical we must do so. If we have a Parliament which represents all shades and sections of opinion, we must have a Ministry which is based upon the same representation. </para>

              <para>- But that would not do unless we provided for elective Ministries on the Hare Nan son system. My honorable and learned friend is perfectly consistent, if he seeks to go the whole length of having a Ministry which will also represent every section and phase of opinion in a Parliament which has been returned under what I call the sectional representation of some of the proportional representation schemes. It would provide a very bad working Cabinet. I do not pretend that the system of the block vote, as it .is called, is perfect. It is like all others. It is human work, and it is subject to all the imperfections which are common to human effort, whether in politics or in any other department of life. It is true that sometimes, owing to the splitting of parties, we may have the minority returning more than its due proportion of members. I shall show that the advocates of this particular system admit that there are similar defects in it. So far as we are concerned, at any rate, we have had the, block .system in operation for a great many years, and I have' not heard any one point out any serious blot upon the representation that we have had, either in our State Parliament or in the Commonwealth Parliament, due to the existing system. Candidates who fear that they might not be successful under the present system would like a change, no doubt, while we have candidates who have been defeated under the Hare system who would like to go back to the block system. It is so with every system. We have had the present system applying, not only to the Parliament, but to the Convention, and I think that by the universal assent of the people of Australia, speaking generally, the Convention at all events was a very fair choice of men for the work which was undertaken. As opposed to that system,, the essential feature of this scheme of proportion al representation is the Hare principle. There is no getting away from that, although honorable senators may apply to it any phrase they please, such as " proportional representation," or " a system which will secure the representation of the majority," or anything else. The essential prin-- principle of the Hare system was to give effect to everybody's opinions so far as possible in. the Parliament to be elected. All the opinions - of the country to the extent of the 658 members of the Imperial Parliament were to have the opportunity of some kind of representation. The Vice-President of the Executive Council in his second-reading speech really put it in exactly the same way when he said - as reported at page- 9537 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard- .</inline></para>

          <para>If this representation was to be on ordinary principles nobody would dream of adopting it. What system would they adopt? Surely they, would adopt the system of every elector choosing a member to represent him ? </para>
          <para class="block">That is exactly the Hare principle ; to represent every one, all sections of opinion, to the extent of the number to be elected for the particular constituency - in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hare's</inline> system the 658 members of the House of Commons. My honorable and learned friend went on to say - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That is to say, there would be six members to be chosen, and every 6,000 electors would have a right to choose a member to represent them. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I interjected - " Suppose there were twelve sets of opinions. If so, then you would have six sets of opinions unrepresented, although they may be equally entitled, morally speaking, to be represented with those who can secure a quota." The hall-mark of the right of representation of opinion is the arbitrary quota which is imposed by an ingenious mathematician. That is the system. Hare was logical. He said - "Let the whole of Great Britain be one constituency. Let every elector vote for any candidate anywhere." There was no limitation. If the elector found a man standing for the Orkney Islands whose views pleased him better than those of the man who was offering himself for the representation of his own locality, he could vote for him. That was the Hare system, but, of course, it was a perfectly ludicrous absurdity. </para>

              <para>- It could not be practically worked. I do not want to say that Hare's successors had not the courage to stand by the principles of the author of the system, but they departed from it, and they acknowledge that it was ridiculous. They said - " Let . us divide up the people into districts, so as to increase the quota and diminish the number of opinions to be represented and then apply the system." Is that just <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If the theory is that all opinions throughout the country are to be represented, that method should be adopted which will as fairly and exhaustively as possible represent all those diverse opinions. Instead of that, you say - " We cannot work it." That is to sa}T, you admit that you cannot carry out your o own logical belief. You say - ' ' We will limit the districts so as to diminish the number of opinions, and then that diminished number of opinions shall be represented." It is complained that the majority of the electors may return all the members under the present system. But what right have the proportionalists to limit the representation of opinion to those who can make just the quota that they prescribe ? What right have they to shut out those who just fail short of arriving at that quota, and to give us a Parliament representing, not all opinions, but some, arrived at upon an arbitrary basis? We are told that this is to secure the representation of the majority. I have already pointed out the change in the name. What does the system do ? It is to take away the right, which the majority at present admittedly possess, of returning the whole number of members. </para>

              <para>- Yet it is said that that is majority representation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> is oblivious of the fact that if, as he complains, the majority can now return five or six members for the Senate, when by the method proposed in the Bill the minority would be able to return two or three also, this is nothing but a taking away of the right of the majority. What is it but the overriding of the principle of majority rule as it now exists? That is what we are talking about. Argument is hopeless if we are speaking of two different things. I am willing to believe that my honorable and . learned friend is in earnest when he says that this is a system . of majority rule. But it is a confusion of terms to speak of it as majority rule in the sense in which we have majority rule at present. That is the whole matter of our controversy. Not merely do we not give majority rule, but at the same time that we take away from the majority the right which they have at present, and the representation which they have at present, undoubtedly we encourage every group, every section - and using the words of Professor Nan son himself - every body of " faddists " to seek in some way or other to secure just the quota that may enable them to get representation in Parliament. These active propagandists, like my friends the small body of proportionalists, will move heaven and earth, and will split up the big parties to which they belong to get their own fads carried into effect. They will strive, and this system will encourage them, not to convert themselves into a majority, as they ought to do, but just to reach the necessary quota, by hook or by crook, of pledged people to get a member into Parliament to create chaos until they can bring about the results they desire. </para>

              <para>- No, no. I am using the term because Professor Nan son used it. I would not use an expression of that kind on any account. I will read the passage directly in which he condemns the Hare system - by-the-way, a most unkind and cruel thing to do, seeing that the principle is his own - for the very reason that it would promote and secure the introduction of " faddists," as he calls them, into the representation in Parliament. I say this system, if adopted, will do the same thing, but to a less extent. </para>

              <para>- Well, let him go on doing it to the end until he has got his majority in the country, and then let him put a majority into Parliament on this issue of foisting upon us, whether we like it or not, his particular system of election. I am putting my views of this question as I understand it, and I am not throwing any cold water upon faddists. With great deference to my honorable friends who take a different opinion, all I say is that this system will simply have the effect which Nan son condemns in the Hare system, but to a less extent. As surely as we are debating the subject in this Chamber it will produce the result emphasized yesterday, of bringing about minority representation in the long run in its most intense and worst form. I need not trouble the Senate by reading it, but my honorable friends will find what Professor Nan son said about the Hare system at page 19 of one of his last pamphlets upon the subject. There is another peculiar circumstance which must be borne in mind. I think there is no one who can be said to have advocated this system with greater persistence and power either in Australia or anywhere else than </para>

          <para class="block">Miss Spence, and I think we cannot do less, whether we oppose or support this particular system, than pay her that tribute. Miss Spence went to England, and there, as in America and other countries, she addressed meetings with a view of showing the immense advantages of the Hare Spence system, which rests upon the principle enunciated by Hare. And her great argument for its acceptance was not that it secures the representation of majorities, or of minorities even in the ordinary sense, but that it secures the representation - if I may use the expression - of individual sections of opinion. Her great illustration of the efficacy of this system was that during the " mock elections " - I think they were called -which were held in South Australia, with some 3,800 odd votes, the six candidates selected, six being presumably the number required, were - what do honorable senators think ? One labour man; one representative of capital ; one prohibitionist, that is, an ultra teetotaller ; one woman's suffrage man ; one single taxer ; and one Irish Catholic. What a delightful Parliament they would make ! </para>

              <para>- To get more of them ? The more the merrier. A sort of " many men many minds" Parliament. What should we have in such a state of things? How could we have any responsible Government? We should have these sections, if elected upon that basis, hidebound, as they must be if they were true representatives, with their hearts steeled and hardened against anything except what would carry out their own views. We should have them bartering with each other and bargaining, in order to secure support each for his own fad - I use the expression, with apologies, and because it is a convenient one - with a promise to support somebody else in return. </para>

              <para>- If we can have two parties upon great principles, subject to divergences of opinion upon minor subjects, it is as much as we can look for in this fallible and human age. I accept the position as Miss Spence puts it, and I say that if that is what we should get under her system, which is much superior to this complicated juggle, we should pause before we put it upon the statute - book. I used the expression juggle, and it is just like the trick of the juggler who pretends to pour from the same bottle port, champagne, castor oil, milk, and water at the same time. The pity of it all is that every one of these proportion a lists disagree, each with the other. . The Hare system has been commented upon and modified by Clark, Droop, Gregory, Nan son and others. Then there is a mathematical basis, too, in which we find about a dozen more authorities differing. There is Ware, two or three mathematicians, the Venetian algebraic system, and two or three other systems introduced. The singular thing is that there can be no possible harm in all this when dealing with a highly artificial system, which may, on paper and theoretically, produce certain results, but which in practical working is found to be a failure. We know what happens in Prance where a corresponding system has been introduced, and we know that there is in the French Parliament some six or eight different divisions - the extreme right, the right, the right centre, the left centre, the left, the extreme left, and I do not know how many others. So we should have under this system the introduction of these sections, which are hopelessly antagonistic to our system of responsible and representative government, and which would altogether paralyze responsible government modelled upon the British system. Then it has been said that under this system informal voting would be stopped. May I point out that the percentage of informal voting in Tasmania is about the same as in South Australia - some 2i per cent. It is all very well to draw attention to the extensive informal voting in New South Wales, where it seems to me they have a most absurd, confusing, and ridiculous system, condemned, I believe, by almost every one at the federal election, with a long list of fifty-odd candidates, and requiring the voters to strike out the names of all candidates of whom they do not approve. But in South Australia, where we have a simple system of voting for those we choose by placing a cross, which takes the place of the number proposed under this Bill, against the name of the candidate we vote for, we have only 2^- per cent, of informal votes, with a very much larger number of voters than there is in Tasmania. I say, therefore, that there is no. argument to be used against the present system on that account. </para>

              <para>- We shall see what is to be said about the com- plication. At any rate, it will be admitted that a system of voting should be so simple that he who runs may read. It is not the returning officers who will require to have this system explained to them, and it ought to be easily comprehended by the electors. It is no use your saying, as has been said, that the voter is merely told to put 1, 2, 3. It is admitted that that is a difficulty. Professor Nan son has thought it necessary, even in connexion with his system, to admit that it was hard to be understood ; that the objection that it could only be comprehended by educated and intelligent people was sufficiently well founded to call upon him to provide a remedy. What remedy did he provide? He provided this system of bracketing. Why? To meet the objection - and he would not have done so if it had not been well founded - that it would require a highly educated constituency to understand this system, and to act upon it. At page 40 of his pamphlet, of 1882, on Methods of Representation, which reads like a treatise on the differential calculus, he has this statement - </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">It so happens that that is just the one feature on which Miss Spence lays her finger as a blot on the Bill, and it is obviously so. Before I read what she says I point out what must be apparent to all of us, that it is not only a blot but an injustice. If the voter brackets three together he is absolutely disfranchised, his votes are thrown away, unless two out of the three are elected, because it is only when the bracket is made definite by the elimination by election, of two out of the three that the vote for the third man who is within the bracket is made efficient. Is that a right thing to do % It is an atrocity, and yet that is the provision which is made for unintelligent voters - men who cannot possibly trace through a long series of preferences. The thing is childish in the extreme. When a voter goes to the poll he knows that he votes for Jones, Smith, Brown, and Robinson,' and that he may be throwing away his vote for every man that does not get in. He knows that he has control of his own vote to this extent, that he throws his vote away if the man of his choice does not get in. But here you acknowledge that he is not skilled in making these preferences, and weighing differences to a nicety. You say, " Bracket your men equally, but we shall not allow your vote to tell for any of them unless all except one are got rid of by election." Miss Spence has written a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">South Australian Register.</inline> I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has a high opinion of the Hare-Spence system, but when we find that the Hare-Spence system is not adopted, and that its sponsor, Miss Spence, is criticizing adversely the system which is embodied in the Bill, the advocates of the Hare-Spence system may well pause before they give in their adhesion to it. From the <inline font-style="italic">South Australian, Register</inline> of the 4th of February, I shall read Miss Spence's criticism of the Bill, and the reason for her criticism was a statement in a correspondent's letter that the system embodied in the Bill was the Hare Spence system. She says - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This is not the case. It is the Hare Nan son system that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne has embodied, and this differs from the Tasmanian and from my methods in several important points. - 1. By the adoption of the quota. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">She objects, as I certainly very emphatically do, if there is a quota at all, to the arbitrary adoption of another quota to make seven different sets of opinions, and, at the same time deliberately declare that the seventh quota is not to be represented. </para>
          <para>The Hare quota is found by dividing the number of valid votes cast by the number of representatives to be elected. In the case of the three senators to bo chosen, by three. For instance, 90,000 votes polled in South Australia would give a quota of 30,000 for each. The Electoral Bill enjoins the Droop quota, which means dividing by one more than the number required, and adding one to the answer - 90,000 divided by four, 22,500, and one, making 22,501 the quota. This necessitates the waste of 22,497 votes, or nearly 25 per cent, of the whole. </para>
          <para>No system was ever invented which of malice aforethought deliberately wasted 25 per cent, of the voting power. The thing is intolerable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> showed yesterday that in Victoria with the present suffrage, without reference to the adult vote, 27,001 voters would be disfranchised. Is it not appalling that such a thing should be possible for the sake of securing this highly-artificial mathematical mystery in our system of representation? Miss Spence goes on to refer to the bracketing - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Tasmanian system laid down voting by figures, and allowed of nothing else. It insisted on the elector making distinct preferences for himself, and neither bracketing those equally preferred together or scoring those out he objected to. </para>

              <para>- I wish we had, but that is just where we failed. This bracketing, which is, if you please, a system to enable the man in the street to understand something about what is going to become of his vote, is open to the censure of Miss Spence, and certainly it is open to the criticism which I humbly venture to lay before the Senate. What is the remedy that is proposed in this Bill ? Of course, I do not dwell on the fact that the Government do not adopt he Queensland system of contingent voting for single electorates ; J pass that by. They admit that we cannot carry out this system in its integrity, and they say - " We give to every voter the privilege of voting for only one." Is not that plumping ? Is not that putting in the Bill a legislative invitation to plump ? "Why should we have the Hare Nan son system, to enable that to be done? Surely it can be done now. They adopt the bracket, too ; that is to say, they enable the voter to strike out or to bracket, but over and above all that, they say - " You need not even insert a single preference : you may simply abstain." </para>

All these things are not wanted unless you have the preferences to work upon, and you cannot logically carry out this proportional representation system unless it is compulsory that every voter shall exercise his preference, if not for the whole lot, at any rate as in Tasmania, which has recognised that it should be done for three out of the six. The thing is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> said, neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring. There is no system about it.

              <para>- That just shows that my view is right - that the contingent vote ought not to be adopted. This system is, in one sense, a system of dividing up the people of the Commonwealth into constituencies of opinions, but, at the same time, it is hampered with this condition, that one division of opinion is forbidden any representation. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> was addressing the Senate yesterday I interjected,"Why should you adopt seven, if you are going to reduce the quota so as to enable every man who is put in to get a quota ? Why not make it eight or nine ? " I was met with the statement that of course, if you divided it by eight or nine, you might get seven or eight candidates who had the quota. But what difficulty would that be ? Why should not that take place ? Suppose you had eight or nine, and wanted to reduce the quota so as to represent smaller sections of opinion, and found that two, three, or a dozen men more than the number you wanted to elect had the quota. Why should you not do what Professor Nansen himself does at one stage of his count, and go back, either to the preceding count at which the numbers were different, and take the highest man according to that count, and give him the seat, or give the seat to the man who has got the highest excess above the quota? Why should you not <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> That is exactly what he does. It is only necessary to compare these things as far as one can - it is very difficult to see through the mist altogether - to see why all these explanations are put into the schedule. What does the scheme do on the fourth count when there is a tie ? There is no casting vote. The explanation circulated with the Bill says - </para>

          </interjection>
          <para>There are still two seats to be filled, and there are no more surplus votes to be transferred. It is therefore necessary to exclude the candidate lowest on the poll as it now stands, and to transfer all his ballot-papers to the candidates marked 2 thereon. It is found that D and E are a tie for the lowest place, therefore the preceding counts are referred to. It is found that the last stage at which there was a difference between D and E was the first count, when, as between the two, E had the lesser number of votes. E, with 54 votes, is accordingly excluded. </para>
          <para class="block">And the other man is left in. I say there is neither rhyme nor reason in this quota. It is an arbitrary symbol - this seven plus one to the quotient. The fact is that it is so laughable that any elementary school boy would ridicule the whole thing. Then my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> said in the most solemn way that, when he introduced a similar measure into the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, he submitted the scheme to the mathematicians of the State, who worked it out, and said it was perfectly right.

              <para>- Give them an X quantity or a known quantity - I would not give them more, or God knows what would happen ! I think honorable senators will see from what I have said that this quota is altogether arbitrary and mathematical - that it is arbitrary in that you cannot trust in figures or in calculations that are based upon it, and in that you cannot trust them as to the results, and cannot trust them as to how electors, as human beings, will be affected by hazy mathematical calculations like this. I have said before that in my view the system would be destructive of party government absolutely. It is certainly destructive of honest party government. To that extent I adopt the word interjected by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> a few minutes ago. . I say, further, that it is destructive of the British system of responsible government. No Government could, with self-respect, face for a day any Parliament if a serious return were made such as Miss Spence put forward, as showing the acme of perfection in the system. How can any advocate of the referendum accept such a system <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The referendum is, of course, a sort of apotheosis of majority rule. It in itself, according to many authorities, is inconsistent with responsible government, and means offering facilities for shifting responsibility from the shoulders of </para>

But I do not mean a dissolution by effluxion of time, but upon some issue upon which the Ministry is defeated.. Take free-trade or protection. Take some big question in which an ecclesiastical or religious issue is raised. Take any question upon which there is a strong division of opinion, and upon which a penal dissolution takes place. Then I say the dissolution is in exactly the same position as a referendum ; and no Hare Nan son system could be tolerated, or would work for one moment in dealing with such a state of things. I ask my honorable friends who are favorable to the adoption of the proportional representation system to tell us how it will work in connexion with a penal dissolution upon some great leading issue? </para>

              <para>- No, freetrade was his absolute creed. My honorable and learned friend, who is a student, cannot have studied Mill thoroughly, or he would be aware that he lapsed slightly with regard to new countries and protection, though he afterwards withdrew what he had written in that respect. But John Stuart Mill advocated proportional representation logically. He was a logician, and he advocated the system with all the precision of a logician. But he intended to change the character and functions of Parliament - to make it merely a deliberative body, and not a legislative or governing, body. He did so because he recognised that under the system of minority representation, Parliament would be radically unfit for such functions. That was Mill's theory. He wished Parliament to occupy the position I have referred to, and for that reason he advocated the first step, which was to get all sections of opinion represented in the consultative body. But the mathematicians and everyone else supporting this system have their own nostrums. They all differ, as I have pointed out. I should be sorry to accept any of their views, in the face of the opinions of practical politicians: I find that in 1867 John Bright said that he was convinced that proportional voting was opposed to any devices to defeat the old-fashioned system of majority rule as we understand it. In 1883 his attention was again called to the principle as it had developed. He expressed himself with great strength upon the subject. He said - </para>

              <para>- I am not going to elaborate my views upon it. but I cannot say that I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer's</inline> construction of section 41. That is an important constitutional question, which was ably dealt with by him, and on which it is impossible for us perhaps to arrive at a final conclusion. But after listening with interest to what my honorable and learned friend had to say on the point last evening, and after examining, the section with great care, I am disposed to think that it deals simply with the franchise, or as it has been expressed to me, it defines the class which is to be entitled to vote under the Commonwealth, and which must be the same class - at all events not less - as is entitled to vote in the States. That is the view that occurs to me, and I think it would not be fair if I did not say so. I do not intend to elaborate the point. I feel that section 41 has not this effect which my honorable and learned friend contended for, but still it seems to me that the Senate is not the House to which the system of proportional representation should be applied. My reason for that belief is briefly this : The Senate was constituted the State House. It was differentiated, in two respects, and two only, from the House of Representatives.. It rests on the same franchise. The qualifications of its members are the same as those for the House of Representatives. In all respects it is identical in its constitution with the House of Representatives, save in regard to two points. One is its tenure, which, except in the case of a penal dissolution, is to be continuous, there being merely a retirement of three senators for each State every three years. The election was admittedly to take place, as it did take place, for the whole of a State as one constituency. I think. I am correct in saying that although the Constitution contains the words " until Parliament otherwise provides," it was intended that that should be maintained. That is the view I take. I think that unless some imperative or overwhelming reason arose we should not be justified in dividing the States into single or any other electorates. </para>

              <para>- I should not like to say. Whether it is constitutional or not, it is exceedingly inexpedient and inadvisable, and it seems to me mimical to the position and strength of the Senate that its right to speak with one solid voice should be taken away. It seems to me that that solid voice should be the expression of the dominant majority arrived at by every voter having the right to vote for the whole of the representatives Supposing a State consisted of one citizen he would have the right to vote for all the six members to be elected. A State consists of the aggregate of its citizens, and we cannot obtain State representation unless every citizen has a right to vote for the whole six men to be returned. The proposition is that we are to take away from every voter five-sixths of his voting power. What is the good of giving him a primary vote when we take it away if his candidate is excluded ? If his candidate is excluded, his other votes are to be on a sort of descending scale of value and importance. The system is the single vote with the condition of transferability in certain events. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; transferability in certain events. The whole system depends on the admission that it is one vote. That lies at the foundation of it - one single vote transferable. That is certainly given, but if we only give that, we take away all the others. Then as I have said we have wasted votes under this system. Let me enumerate them. A point has been made of the number of wasted votes under the present system. Under it, however, the voter knows what he is doing; if his vote is wasted it is his own doing. Under the system in the Bill, however, it is not his own doing ; it is done for him by an arbitrary rule which he does not understand. </para>

They might be a mob, but they do not want a mob Parliament, and therefore they say - " Let us have representation." The voters pass by a box, just as they might do here, and the head officer says to them - " How do you vote, so and so, and so and so ? " When a man obtains 1,001 votes, the voters are told - " You need not vote for him : he is in. Who is your next choice ? " That would be fair, because the voter would know what he was going to do.

              <para>- Exactly. How about the lowest quota, No. 7, 8, or 1 5, if we have more quotas so as to reduce the strength of the opinions to be represented ? How about that lowest quota ? Twenty thousand-odd votes would have been wasted at the last election in South Australia by tl] is system ; and in Victoria, something like 27,000 votes would have been lost. </para>

              <para>- That is a mere phrase, and phrases are the danger of this system. People are misled by such phrases as "proportional representation" and "effective voting." The effective voting which I like is that which takes place when I vote for a man, as I often do at an election of directors, and he is elected, and for another man whom I may not have the good fortune to see returned. Both my votes are effective, although both men for whom I vote do not get in. </para>

              <para>- No ; it often happens that a man does not secure the return of both his candidates. Then what about the votes of the excluded candidates <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The confusion is not in the number of votes, but that a candidate is rejected, is <inline font-style="italic">anathema,</inline> regardless of the overwhelming second or third votes that he may have. He does not get a show, because it is the number of primary votes that give him a right to the secondary votes, and in that way give him a place. If the primary votes are low you throw him out neck and crop, without regard to the fact that he may be the popular candidate with the great body of electors. I shall not dwell on the point which was referred to with so much force by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> - the intolerable injustice of throwing out the lowest candidate on the No. 1 votes. The injustice has been pointed out by Hare, but this inaccurate and intolerable system is adopted here because there is no other scheme for making his system symmetrical. </para>

              <para>- Their secondary votes may be effective, but as it is under this system they do not exercise them. Why should we eliminate the man ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> said we should eliminate him, because he has the fewest number of votes ; because he has the fewest friends. Another point that Professor Nan son admits is - and I ask honorable senators to mark this - that even with his quota, in which there is no particular virtue, he contemplates the same disastrous result of some of his candidates being returned with less than the quota. </para>

              <para>- Yes. It is scarcely to be credited. I see no objection to a man being returned by less than the quota- the true Hare-Spence quota - because if three can secure the quota, Surely there is no reason why the next three should not get in if they are close up? We know the men who are popular; we know the men who are the choice of the constituency or of the quota. Why should we not be content? But if it is an evil it is contemplated and guarded against by Nan son in his system, and I shall tell honorable senators where they will find it.

He provides against it by what he calls a supplementary process. </para>

              <para>- The voter does not ask that they should be renumbered. Then there is to be this readjustment, but upon what basis ? On the basis of the majority vote ! In order to finally round off this beautiful proportional representation system he is compelled in the final resort to have recourse to the majority vote. This is the thing which we are told is to beat the Hare-Clark system and all the other systems into the traditional "cocked-hat." Then again we are told that another objection to the present system is that there may be tod many candidates, and that causes a splitting of the votes. Does Nanson's system do away with that objection of too many candidates ? Will too many candidates be a difficulty in working out his system ? Undoubtedly, it will. Does he guard against it ? Undoubtedly he does. How ? By the very plan which we should like to adopt, and which is taken exception to by many people - a drastic deposit. It is essential to his system, as it is to the block-vote system, that there shall not be too many candidates ; and <inline font-style="italic">one</inline> element of Professor Nanson's system is to put that evil down by the same means - a drastic deposit. Honorable senators will find that referred to in the pamphlet from which I have already quoted, and which, though it is twenty years old, is still pretty good. At page 43 he says - </para>

              <para>- I suppose he has, but I am not aware of it. At any rate there is his proposal. Now for my last word, and I am greatly indebted to honorable senators for listening to me so long. It is a very interesting subject, and no one can exaggerate its importance. It is not because I minimize its importance that I move an amendment to delay the passage of the Bill. It is for the very reason that I entertain the highest estimate of the importance of this great question that I deprecate its being dealt with in a hurry. We have the example of Tasmania, where the Hare-Clark system, a better system I think than this has been tried, and has been found wanting. It has. been abandoned. It is a singular fact, and I make no comment upon it. There we have had experience of the absolute facts which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> quoted yesterday from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ashworth's</inline> book. If those facts and statements are true - as Tasmanian senators affirm they are - I say it would be a deplorable calamity if a system which would permit of such things should in the first session of this Commonwealth Parliament be fixed upon the States as a means of electing their representatives to the Senate. </para>

              <para>- This system was adopted for a municipal election in South Australia, as Professor Nan son himself quotes, in 1840, and in his pamphlet he remarks upon the extraordinary fact. He says - "The remarkable point is that in no case, saving that of South Australia, has the principle been abandoned after once being adopted." </para>

          <para class="block">Of course that was written before the abandonment of the system in Tasmania. So that in the two Australian examples of Tasmania and South Australia the principle, after being tried, was abandoned. The Tasmanian system - which some of us think better than this looking at the men whom it has sent here - is certainly one which I cannot say, so far as results are concerned, would be inferior to the system to which I adhere, the old-fashioned block system. No better representatives, if they will allow me to say so, could come from any State. But I say that that system which sent those men to this Chamber is condemned by Nan son, who, of course, works up his own so-called improvements upon it - improvements which I think I have shown are not improvements, and which do not shut the door, even to the mischief associated with the present system of voting. Finally a curious result is obtained from the experience of Tasmania, if honorable senators will look at the parliamentary paper before us - the report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davies</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnston.</inline> We find from that that exactly the same candidates would have been returned, and I think in exactly the same order, under a system of compulsory plumping. They were all returned on their primary votes in exactly the same order as when the quotas were made up. Is that not a marvellous thing ? It shows that after all this system is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator demons</inline> truly said-- </para>

              <para>- I will not say compulsory plumping, but a system of scientific plumping, only that it is done in a round-about way. There is also the curious, fact, and it is the last to which I will direct the attention of honorable senators, that the analysis made in that paper shows that with one exception substantially the same result would have been arrived at by single electorates with a majority vote. Is not that a singular thing ? If a system of single electorates with a majority vote could have done that, what is the use of going into all this complication and analysis? I have now gone over the ground - more of it than I intended, because of certain most useful interjections with which some honorable senators have favoured me. In submitting the views which I entertain on this subject, and to the consideration of which I have given much thought, I ask whether it is expedient for us to take this leap in the dark? One State did take the leap, and it leapt back again. I think that every one who examines these proposals, with all their explanations, must admit that they are beset with difficulties, and I will say confusion, like a thick, cloud. There are some of them which I confess I find it hard to penetrate. Upon these I have not ventured to dwell. I prefer to - ..... bear those ills we have, </para>

Parliament sacrificing the first principles of the well-tried system of parliamentary self-government, which we have enjoyed here for many years, and which we have inherited from the mother country, which has enjoyed it for centuries, merely for the attractions of an algebraic symbol, or a kind of quadratic equation. I do not believe in doing anything of the kind. The methods of the differential calculus do not fit in with practical politics, and I hope we shall not readily at least risk the self-government of the people, the truest. electoral rights which they possess, and the fullest powers of exercising those rights, in one word, their freedom, by adventuring into any new electoral system depending for its virtue on mathematical calculation. In any case my appeal to my honorable and learned friend the Vice-President of the Executive Council and to other honorable senators is that we shall pause a little before we enter upon the enterprise ; let us deliberate. We may act in haste, and we may have to repent at our leisure. If it were of paramount urgency, as the Tariff will be when it comes here, I would say let us apply our minds to it, and through ill or through good let us do the best we can. But that is not the situation, and therefore I say, let us not act in haste. The whole question may very well be postponed until next session, when we can bring to it minds fresh and judgments that are calm. It is well worthy of our best and most careful consideration. We shall then be able, I hope, to reach a conclusion that will be of credit to ourselves, and will be just to the political rights and freedom of the whole people of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- I listened with considerable attention to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> in opposing the second reading of this Bill, and in moving his amendment, and I think I am only voicing the opinion of other honorable senators when I say that although we have received from him a very drastic criticism of this Bill, it is one that is based on a considerable amount of research, and we are all deeply indebted to him. I was not surprised to find that honorable and learned senator taking up the attitude that he did, in telling the Senate that the Tariff is a matter of paramount importance, and that we are only marking time or beating the air in attempting to discuss proposed legislation of the character now submitted. I, in common with many others, have now come to recognise that this is the customary attitude of the leader of the Opposition when legislation outside the Tariff is submitted. This is not the first, or second, or third occasion when he has informed the Senate that a Bill of the Government was not urgently required, and that, therefore, we should not apply our serious attention to it. On previous occasions he has predicted that our efforts would not be crowned with any legislative result; but I venture to hope that on this occasion his prediction will be verified to no greater extent than were his former predictions. I believe that there are a sufficient number of honorable senators who recognise that legislation on the lines proposed in this Bill is a matter of extreme importance, and a matter of urgency, in the present circumstances. The leader of the Senate has stated those circumstances here on more than one occasion, and I feel sure that they will appeal to honorable senators when they come to record their votes on the amendment to the motion for the second reading of this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> pointed out that it contains a considerable number of 'clauses, and that we should not be asked, at this stage of the session, to enter into the serious consideration of them or to go into committee. But I think it may be pointed out with fairness that many of the clauses are not of a debatable character, but pure machinery in the sense that they have been adopted from existing legislation in the States, and are not likely to give rise to any very long or acrimonious debates. One other argument which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> put forward was that the franchise for the Common wealth has not been settled, and that, inasmuch as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> in his second reading speech referred to the franchise and this measure as going together to form one policy, we should not discuss the measure until we had the uniform franchise established. The honorable and learned senator, in answer to an interjection, indicated that it was his opinion that the provisions of this Bill would not be applicable to the present varying franchises in the States, and he intimated his intention to convince the Senate that his opinion was perfectly correct. I listened with the utmost care and attention to his speech, but I failed to hear anything which tended in the least to support that opinion which he put forward with so much emphasis, and which he apparently holds with such strong conviction. He made one remark to which I would like to take some exception, although, perhaps, it may not devolve upon me to do so. He insinuated that the Government, in introducing this measure at this stage, and including in it the provisions with respect to proportional voting, have been motived by the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> in some time previously putting on the paper a notice of motion with respect to the Hare-Spence system of voting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was a member of the </para>

In their speeches they each referred to the possibility and the great advisableness of the States legislating in the direction of providing a system of voting such as the Hare-Clark system which was then existing in Tasmania, for the return of their senators. They gave in, more or less, their personal adhesion to the principle of proportional representation for the return of the senators by the States voting as separate entities. </para>

          <para class="block">At the present time there is no uniformity throughout the States in the method of the exercise of the franchise. In New South Wales, and in Victoria, too, I believe it was obligatory on the elector to record his vote for six candidates, no more and no less. In the State of Queensland it was not obligatory upon the elector to vote for more than one. In Western Australia he could vote for six or less. In Tasmania the elector had to record his preferences under the Hare-Clark system, voting for at least three candidates. So that there was and is no uniformity. If, then, as contended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer,</inline> we must maintain the <inline font-style="italic">status quo,</inline> if we are tied to existing systems, obviously we can never establish that uniformity which the framers of the Constitution contemplated when they inserted section 9.

Why cannot that dominating majority .simply send a certain number of men into Parliament, to fill the whole of the seats and discharge their legislative and governing functions with perfect unanimity and without debate, in accordance with the opinions of that dominating majority ? Where is the need for consultation and deliberation? Why should it be commonly understood that it is desirable that the electors should send men into the Parliament who are capable of adequately giving voice to the views of those whom they represent - men who can come into intellectual conflict with others who entertain different views, with a resultant in the shape of what, is considered to be the best product of the right reason of the whole people through their representatives ? </para>

              <para>- We all know that the Constitution provides for it, but why <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> Because the framers of the Constitution wanted to have not merely one set of opinions in the community, but the various phases of political thought and feeling, represented in this, the States House. If a State, however, is simply to speak with one voice, and that the voice of "the dominating majority," I contend that the logical principle to follow would be to have one representative from each State and avoid any intra-state conflict whatever. We should then have no waste of time, and the decisions of the Senate would be arrived at much earlier than would otherwise be the case. Again, if a State is simply to speak with one voice, and if the various political considerations and opinions of the people,, are not to be represented here, why does the Constitution provide that the members of the Senate shall occupy their seats by virtue of an election of the people ? Why should they not be chosen by the State Legislature as in the United States, or why should they not be nominated, as in Canada? In Australia we have taken quite a different line. To some extent we indulged in experimental legislation in Constitution making, when the Convention framed the Commonwealth Bill, and the people accepted it, deciding that the members of the Senate, as well as the members of the House of Representatives, should be elected by the people, and that there should be six senators from each State. I submit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that the reason for taking this departure, for making the representation of each State numerically six, and for leaving their election to the people themselves, was to secure in this Chamber an expression of the political thoughts and aims of the electors of each of the several States. </para>

              <para>- I wish to come to that point a little later on, and I hope to convince the honorable senator that we can secure a more efficient representation of the different phases of political thought and aspiration by a method similar to that proposed in the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has asked, with very much force, why, if the Government recognise that proportional representation secures the advantages and benefits claimed for it, they have not adopted it for the House of Representatives. I take it that there is some need for differentiating between the two Houses of the Commonwealth Legislature. If the two Houses are merely to be elected by the same electors, on the same franchise, by a similar method, and under similar conditions - that is to say by similar groups - it means practically that there is not the slightest distinction between them, and no <inline font-style="italic">raison d'etre</inline> for the existence of two. The whole of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> argument in that respect - I mean the inferential argument arising from his question - to my mind, if pushed one step further to its logical conclusion, would absolutely abolish all necessity for a bi-cameral Legislature under our Commonwealth Constitution. If, then, there is some necessity, as I contend there is, for a differentiation between the bases of the two Chambers, in order to make something in the nature of a balance out of them, I think that in following out the line that the Government propose, with regard to the House of Representatives, they are following a well-established principle of having the members of that House returned by the electors geographically. But there is one principle in the Bill to which I would invite the attention of honorable senators. It is contained in clause 19. I invite attention to it in order to show that the Government are not limiting themselves absolutely to geographical lines of demarcation. The clause provides that - </para>

          <para>They are attempting by that clause to give expression to that differentiation which I contend should characterize the bases of the two Houses. The Senate is to be elected by each State as a separate entity, and in the other case each State is to be divided into separate electorates, and in the division regard is to be had first, to community or diversity of interest ; secondly, to the means of communication ; and thirdly, to physical features. With regard to the return of representatives to the other Chamber, provision is made for securing the effect of an absolute majority in any one of those geographical groups by the contingent vote. I was a little surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> in denouncing the contingent vote, say that it is impossible to eliminate the personal equation. I do not think that the most ardent admirer of the system of the contingent vote for one moment attempts to contend, that the establishment of such a system is going absolutely to direct the mind and the intelligence, and the consideration and the opinion, of the elector himself. However the elector exercises such faculties - wrongly or rightly - the contingent vote will give effect to such exercise. The system itself cannot enter into his mind and direct it into proper channels, but once the elector's mind is drawn to the consideration of the matter, and he has decided upon doing a certain thing, and endeavouring to return a certain candidate, whether for his political principles or on account of personal attachment to him - all that is claimed for the contingent vote as for proportional representation is that that system will work out towards the result which that elector deliberately determines and wishes to secure. A great deal of argument has been expended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> on what he has called the lost votes or waste votes - that is, the balance left over - which do not constitute a quota. During the course of his denunciations of the proposals of the Government on that score, an interjection came from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Eraser,</inline> that there was not the slightest warrant for the loss of the 26,000 votes, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> said might have been lost under this system in South Australia, according to the testimony of Miss Spence. Since then I have taken out the voting at the Senate elections for New South Wales. I find that the candidates returned scored a total, of 442,094 votes, while the candidates unreturned scored a total of 649,300 votes. Each elector had six votes, and if we divide these totals by six we find that 73,682 returned each of the successful candidates, while 108,200 people in the average returned no one. If the loss of votes that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has said might have occurred, according to Miss Spence, upon the application of the principle in this Bill to the last elections of South Australia, would be a misfortune, where could we find a greater misfortune than this ? I come now to the Senate elections in Victoria. The candidates returned received a total of 434,017 votes ; the candidates unreturned obtained slightly more, namely, 455,495 votes. A sixth of the votes for the candidates returned - and which would average about the number of electors who took part in the election - is 72,336, while a sixth of the number of votes for the unsuccessful candidates is 75,916. I merely refer to these figures, because in directing their attention to the provisions of the Bill several honorable senators, who have been very hostile in their treatment of it, have supplied nothing whatever in the nature of a criticism of the block system of voting. As an instance of the result of the working of the block system and the representation of minorities I shall quote for the information of the Senate some details as to an election of sixteen deputies for Brussels, which took place in 1888. I take this illustration because almost immediately after the election, and consequent upon its results, they adopted a totally different system there, and thus an opportunity is afforded of contrasting the operation of the two systems in elections which took place within a very short space of time. This is how the block vote operated in the election : The clerical party secured 8,131 votes, the independent liberals 6,933, the socialist liberals 3,723, labour 872, and the Flemings 504, The clericals had 8,131 votes out of a total of 20,163. </para>

          <para>The vote for Congressmen in Illinois in 1894 will serve as an illustration. The Republicans polled 448,075 votes ; the Democrats, 323,426 ; the Populists, 63,142 ; and the Prohibitionists, 16,053 ; making a total of 850,696 votes for Congressmen in the State. The State being entitled to 22 Congressmen, each 22nd part of the total vote should elect one Congressman . 850,696 divided by 22 gives as the electoral quota 38,668. Since 38,668 is the number of votes necessary to elect one Congressman, each party should have as many Congressmen as that number is contained times in its vote. The Republican vote of 448,075, divided by 38,668, gives eleven full quotas and a remainder of 22,727 votes. The Democratic vote, by the same process, gives eight full quotas and a remainder of 14,082 ; the Populist vote makes one full quota and a remainder of 24,474 ; and the Prohibitionists had an unfilled quota of 16,053 votes. As there are 22 Congressmen to be elected and only 20 full quotas, the remaining two Congressmen are taken from the two parties having the largest unfilled quotas - the Populist and the Republican. This makes the Illinois delegation twelve Republicans, eight Democrats, and two Populists, instead of twenty Republicans and two Democrats, as it actually was. </para>

              <para>- No. I do not support the American machine electoral system, and if the only argument in favour of any proposal of an electoral character put before the honorable and learned senator was that it had been adopted by either party in America, that would not, I am sure, be a very strong, recommendation to him. I contend that the system of block voting, leading to results such as that which I have just referred to, and offering the facilities that it does for people to put up candidates at an election with the express purpose of nullifying what would be the correct will of the people, is one which we ought to look into very carefully. We should remedy it as much as possible, in order that we may obtain proper representation. I do not think any one can deny that the system lends itself very much to what is known as ticket voting. It is quite possible for a dominant party in respect of some big issue before the people to obtain not merely the representation to which it is entitled in proportion to its size in the community, but to put out a ticket, and by proper organization to secure the return of every one whose name appears upon that ticket. In every case in which a number of candidates are to be elected, and the block-voting system is to be used, do we not find that the respective organizations submit their tickets to the people and ask them to vote <inline font-style="italic">en bloc</inline> for them % Do we not find "that the powerful newspapers put forward tickets, and urge their readers to vote <inline font-style="italic">en bloc</inline> for them <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> What is the result ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> knows as well as I do that many thousands of electors vote for men whom they do not know, and of whose political ability they are absolutely ignorant.. </para>

              <para>- That is more than open to question. A system which leads to the return of men simply because of the fact that the leaders of a party have included, the names of those men on their tickets, or because a powerful newspaper has placed them on its ticket, is one which does not produce results that we are entitled to accept for any proper scheme of election. The block system often results in the return of weak men absolutely incompetent for the discharge of legislative functions, but who are, so to speak, simply carried into the Legislature on the shoulders of stronger men with whom they are associated on a ticket. It is for 'this reason that many of the electors, do not choose to go to the poll. They know that the dominant party is so strong that it can carry all the seats that are being contested, and that if they go to the poll it will be simply to waste their votes. They give expression to their desire to select a. candidate who, they believe, would express their aspirations, but they vote uselessly for him. </para>

              <para>- It is a fact. I know that since the adoption of the Hare- . Clark system in Tasmania the interest taken in the elections there, and the actual attendance at the poll, have been much greater than under the block system - something nearly three times larger than when the representatives of Tasmania for the Federal Convention were chosen. With regard to the scheme that is submitted in this Bill to overcome these difficulties, and. to make the voting more effective, I would, simply point out that it is one of the many systems of proportional representation which, have engaged the attention of political, thinkers for very many years, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and others may refer to it jokingly as being the Hare-Clark-Spence Nan son - Droop - Gregory - O'Connorsystem, or something of the sort. The' very fact that so many modifications have been made and have been submitted to the thinking world by men, who, within their own sphere, rank so highly as some of these gentlemen do, is very strong evidence of the wide-spread recognition of the equity of the fundamental principles of proportional representation, and is also evidence of an honest and earnest attempt to give proper, logical,' and accurate expression to those principles the equity of which is so widely recognised. All the members of this Senate understand both the method of voting and the method that is adopted by the returning officer and his staff in counting the votes and in counting the preferences. </para>

              <para>- I understood from the honorable senator that he had read a large portion of the Bill, if not the whole of it, and that he had read the schedules, and I sincerely hope that if he does not now understand what the electoral officer has to do he will not be found recording his opposition to the principle until he is in a position to tell us that he understands it. The members of the Senate who have perused the provisions contained in this Bill, and the explanation of them given in the paper circulated with it, will see that the object is as far as possible to minimize the waste of votes. That is to say, instead of a man going to the poll, and simply recording his vote for a candidate who is hopelessly out of it, he will be able, at one and the same time, to indicate by marking his second, third, or fourth preference, how he would have voted in the event of his previously knowing that his first choice would be hopelessly out of it, and that his vote would, therefore, be ineffective if given for him alone. It has been contended that the provision with regard to the quota is not aimed at securing what is the true and the logical quota. I must confess that there are details in the provisions of this Bill with which I am not in entire accord with regard to proportional representation ; but on the principle of proportional representation itself, from what I have seen of its working in Tasmania in the past, and from a comparison of its effects with the results obtained from the working of the older system, I am disposed to support the principle of proportional Representation, and to have the details modified as much as I can to accord with my own views. </para>

              <para>- I will deal with that later on, and I hope the Senate will to-night know how it came to be rejected. Most of the arguments addressed against the principle of proportional representation, and against this Bill, have been simply an attempt to prove that the provisions for proportional representation are not absolutely perfect and accurate. They do not. go to any greater length than that. They are attempts to point out the anomalies, that result, overlooking at the same time - and I do not say deliberately, but probably unconsciously overlooking - the fact that every one of the defects that can be pointed out in respect to this system can be pointed out with far greater frequency, and can be shown to be of far greater dimensions in connexion with the system which at present exists, and which some honorable senators would like to see preserved. Senators Downer and Symon have asked, and I think it is probable other senators will also ask - "Whywillyou restrict the vote to only one effective vote when there are three or six seats to be filled?" The answer I give to that is this : I have already assumed that the object of elections to Parliament is to secure in the Parliament a mirror of the political aims and aspirations of the people outside. The reason why an elector is restricted to one vote in all these different and varying systems of proportional representation is that it has been found that by allowing to the elector the full number of votes for the seats that are vacant the anomalies occur to which I have already referred, and the resultant is not the return of those who represent the community, but of those who represent only a portion of the community. And it has been found that by restricting the elector to one vote and allowing him to record certain preferences in addition to it, so that his vote will not be lost, we do get a better reflex of the political aims and aspirations of the community outside. We have to consider the elector, not merely as an individual, but as an integral and component part of the community. If we consider him in that light, and give him simply a vote for a candidate with graduated preferences for others, the men who are returned under such a system of voting, are representative of the political forces outside, in proportion to their relative strength. It is because we do not consider the elector as an individual, but only as a unit in the mass of electors that go to makeup the community, that we give him one single transferable vote. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> said that if a scheme were proposed for compulsory plumping in the case of an electorate for which more than one member was to be returned, the proposal would be scouted, and he pointed out that the position of the elector to the elected would be that- he had only taken part in the return of one of a number of men who occupied seats in the Parliament. But precisely the same result occurs in the case of single electorates where the individual elector takes part only in the return of one man amongst the members of a whole Parliament, and his relation to that Parliament is that he has been responsible for securing the return of no one except the particular member who represents the constituency for which he is a voter. Still he is bound to obey the laws which not only that member, but other members of the Parliament pass, and he is also bound to obey laws which that member opposes, but which the others, by a majority, succeed in passing. So that if this is a vice in the system of giving a single transferable vote it is a vice which prevails to a far' greater extent in the existing single electorate system. The relation of the elector to a House consisting of members representing single electorates, is precisely the same as his relation to a House where six seats have to be filled for each constituency, and where he has an effective voice in the selection of one member only. Perhaps no argument has been brought forward with greater force than the argument that the process of elimination which takes place when the surplus votes, if there have been any, have been distributed is intolerable, and is unfair to the man who is cut out. Take the case of an election in connexion with which there are six seats to be filled. There are sixteen candidates, and the quota is, say, 5,000. Not o,ne of the candidates receives the quota, and the lowest man in the sixteen receives, say, 200 or 300 votes. Somebody has to be cut out, whatever system of election we adopt. </para>

              <para>- Then four were sacrificed, if that is the proper term to apply to such a result. Whatever the system, in such a case four had to be cut out. But when we come to the system of selecting men by graduated preferences, what better indication can we get as to our choice of the man who ought to be cut out, than that he has received the lowest number of primary votes, and is clearly least acceptable to the electors as a whole. It has been suggested that a man who has received very few primary votes may be marked No. 2 on the papers of all the other candidates. But what does that prove ? It only proves that he is wanted by a large number of electors, all of whom would sooner have some other man than him. </para>

That is a very extreme hypothesis, but assuming that such a tiling actually does occur it is clear that in this supposed community of 30,000 voters - sixteen candidates and a quota of 5,000 - only 300 prefer this man to anybody else. </para>

              <para>- No. With the exception of the 300, there is not a single man of the 30,000 who would sooner see him in than any of the others. The 29,700, no matter how they may differ among themselves as to who is their first choice, are all agreed that this man is not their first choice. </para>

          <para class="block">He is chosen after every one of the other fifteen candidates ; only a paltry 300 come up and say they will have this man before anybody else. Nobody else will choose him unless somebody else is in before him. They first desire to put somebody else in, probably to look after -him. and as to who that somebody else shall be the electors themselves vary in their opinions. If the elimination has to occur, what better indication can you get as to the person to eliminate than the one who receives the lowest number of votes ? Would you go to the one who receives the second lowest number of votes ? The whole principle of the system is to give one effective vote, and if you take into consideration the second preferences that are cast for a man who is low down on the list of primary votes you give to those second preferences a cumulative instead of an alternative value which is right against the radical principles of the system. A great deal has been made of the question of the simplicity of voting. In Tasmania no difficulty of any consequence is experienced by the electors in recording their votes. The system was never tried outside Hobart and Launceston before the last federal elections. To the people of the country districts it was an entire novelty, and yet only a little over 2 per cent, of all who went to the poll voted informally. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> said that the percentage of informal votes in Tasmania was about the same as in South Australia - a little over 2 per cent., but he then very disingenuously pointed out that South Australia has a larger population. What has the largeness of population- to do with the question when you are dealing with percentages? In the model State of South Australia, too, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> mentioned in his second reading speech, they have a ballot-paper which makes voting simplicity itself, inasmuch as they have squares for the elector to place the cross in, so that he cannot go wrong. In Tasmania we have not that system. Further, in South Australia they have been accustomed to their method of voting for years. It has been objected that the elector should know how his vote is to be applied. An elector can, if he chooses - it may be a matter of comparative difficulty to some electors - understand the method of counting the votes which the returning officer is compelled to follow. But the elector will trust, as he has trusted in Tasmania, to the skill of the returning officer and his assistants, just as under any system he has to trust to the integrity and the honesty of that officer and his assistants. If he be satisfied that the result of this system of voting is to secure the representation of the community in the way which he thinks is desirable, even if - he does not understand the method by which the votes are counted, he will have sufficient confidence in the skill of the returning officer and his deputies to carry out that count so that the result will be that desired by the people; and, of course, the scrutineers for the candidates will be there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has pointed out that one of the arbitrary characteristics of this provision is that if there are six seats to fill, and there can be only six quotas - there may be twelve distinctive sets of opinion, and only six of them will be represented. He must have made that slip, after having fallen into an error in conceiving what is "the object and the actual working of this system. Under the block system, if there were twelve distinctive sets of opinions, probably only one set of opinions would be represented by the six men. Under the proposed system, the six strongest sets of. opinions , provided that each one was sufficiently strong to secure the quota With the assistance of the preferences, would have their candidates returned. But it must be remembered that the six sets of opinions to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has referred as unrepresented, would be held by people without whose assistance the other six. could not have been represented. So that, in effect, although not one of them did succeed in getting in the particular man whom it favoured, it took part in securing the return of others who, to its mind, approximated sufficiently to its ideas on the matter which it considered of the greatest importance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> asks, " Why limit the representation to a quota? Why not, for six seats divide, not by seven and add one, but by eight <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> " If we take as a practical illustration of his proposal an electorate where 56,000 electors go to the poll, and there are six seats to be filled, the Droop quota would be one-seventh of that number plus one - 8,001. The proposal to divide that number by eight would give a quota of 7,000 plus one. If five succeeded in getting 7,001 votes each, 35,005 votes would be accounted for, leaving a balance of 20,995 votes still unaccounted for and unrepresented. These 20,995 voters would be taking part in the return of only one man, while 7,001 voters would in each of the other instances be returning one man. In other words, to divide by eight or any number larger than seven would leave a surplus after the six: men had been returned, which would be larger than the quota .itself. In that connexion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> used one remark which I think was a little devoid of the acumen that usually characterizes his criticism. He proceeded to point out that the establishment of a system which allowed the election of representatives by quotas, would result in there being no incentive to his friends in the corner to convert themselves into a majority by converting other members of the community to their political opinions, but that it would produce a desire on their part to simply get a quota in the community in order that they might get one representative. Surely he does not think for a moment that any party, if it feels strongly on any political matter, is going to be satisfied with simply one representative where it thinks it can get two, or with two where it thinks it can get three ? Surely he cannot think that any body in the community, which considers any political question of sufficient vital importance to them that they will vote solidly on it, will be satisfied with simply getting its opinions voiced in the Legislature by one man - when an opportunity is extended to it by extending its influence and increasing its number to get two or more <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Surely there is nothing in the contention that the provision for election by quotas will destroy incentive on the part of political parties. The honorable and learned senator has referred so often to majority rule, and the necessity for its preservation, that I think he has overlooked what is the absolute aim and object of proportional representation. It is not minority rule ; it is majority rule coupled with minority representation. It is contended that you cannot have majority rule properly carried out with a due regard to the interests of the people themselves, if the majority alone are to be represented, but that they must act in conjunction with the minority in accordance with the minority's strength, and that they must consult and deliberate with the minority so that the real wishes of the community may be ascertained, and the result of the ripe reasoning of the representatives of that community may receive legislative effect. </para>

I would ask the honorable and learned senator, or any other representative of that State, what issues were put before the electors, on which to determine their choice? What political opinions were professed to be entertained on different subjects by those who were elected, and by those who were not elected ? </para>

              <para>- I am not responsible for that. One argument adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> - and one that I think was to some extent his strongest - was that voting under the proportional representation system and the return of members under it would be destructive of party government. Now, what is party government ? If we are to take party government in its rigid sense - that men are to belong to one or other of but two great parties, and, irrespective of what their own individual judgment tells them is the right thing to do on certain occasions, are to vote absolutely in line with their party - I admit that to some extent his criticism is justified. But in face of the varying conditions of political and social life in Australia, of the advance in political thought, and of the extended ambit of legislative work, I think that party government as it prevails to-day cannot be carried out on precisely the same lines as obtained 40 or 50 years ago in the old country. There must be a far greater opportunity allowed to the individual member, let him belong to whatever party he may, to give expression to Iris views, to give his votes, and to exercise his own individual opinions on certain matters, than would ever have been conceded in the days when party government was at its height in the old country. Not so many years ago we were told that what was termed the intrusion of the labour party into the legislative halls of Australia was practically tantamount to ringing the death-knell of party government. We have had more than four parties in some legislative chambers in Australia. The individual member nowadays must- be allowed a certain area within which he is free to act irrespective of his party, and he does act accordingly. Honorable senators will hot find in any of the Legislatures of the Australian States to-day parties divided by such a broad straight line of demarcation, or held so closely and firmly together, as was the case in the old country in the past. It is precisely on that account that the need for something in the nature of the legislation now proposed arises, so that the various opinions of the people shall be given expression to, and their representatives shall come here representing the whole community in the true sense of the word. My honorable and learned friend has referred, for instance, to the possibility of a penal dissolution, and has asked what would be the condition of affairs if we had proportional representation under such circumstances. It might be that such a penal dissolution might take place when there was a large organized body of political, opinion in the country which held strongly that the dissolution should not have taken place, and that it was only something in the nature of a shuffling of the cards to see which of the party leaders should be up the tree that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has referred to as being shot at by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> the leader of the labour party. If that be so, is it likely that that large body of political opinion would give utterance to its views simply upon an issue which might be put before the people by the two parties? Is it not more likely that those persons would give utterance to their views in another way, by returning men to represent them who would "voice their opinions on particular matters which they felt to be of far greater import to them than issues raised for party purposes ? There is one other matter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> upon which I will touch. I allude to the reference he made to what he described as the wasted votes under the Droop quota. He has pointed out that by dividing the total number of votes by the number of seats plus one, and adding one to' the quotient, you' leave over a number of votes which are not quite equal to the quota, but which he, roughly speaking, referred to as another quota going unrepresented. But on all those occasions when he has been denouncing the system as productive of such a waste of a large number of votes, he has been assuming that that particular number of persons will in every case vote <inline font-style="italic">en bloc</inline> and solidly for some particular candidate ; whereas, as a matter of fact, the experience is that they do nothing of the kind, but that they, in common with others who have taken part in electing the successful candidates, have distributed their votes amongst various candidates. The whole of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> denunciation of this great waste of votes is based upon the assumption of what is, to my mind, the most extreme hypothesis which has been advanced by any one, who, up to the present, has criticised the system of proportional representation. I do not think there is anything else to which I wish to refer in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> speech, but before I conclude, I have a word or two to say on the Tasmanian experiment. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clark, than whom I think Australia has produced no greater democrat and federalist, introduced his system into the Legislature of Tasmania some years ago. The system was tried simply for the two composite electorates of Hobart and Launceston. Hobart was returning six members, and Launceston four. It was precisely because they were composite electorates, and the other electorates in the country were single, that the Hare-Clark system of proportional representation was applied to them. </para>

              <para>- Yes, they were considered capable of being made composite, and were made composite for. that purpose. The system was tried twice in connexion with the elections for those cities. When it came to making provision with regard to the elections for the Senate, the provisions with regard to the composite electorates in that State were applied to the return of the six senators, and also to the House of Representatives. That is to say the existing law in Tasmania at the time was applied, that in the case of composite or multiple electorates the principles of the Hare-Clark method should apply. What -was the result? After the elections had taken place, and we were fairly launched into federation the Government of Tasmania introduced legislation for the purpose of effecting economies in the State Legislature. They proposed to reduce the number of members in the Legislative Assembly from 38 to 35. Certainly that was nothing very astounding in the way of economical reform. Included amongst those 38 members, there were ten representing the two cities of Hobart and Launceston - six for Hobart and four for Launceston. The remainder were elected by single electorates throughout the rural districts. The proposal of the Government, was to cut up Tasmania into five electorates,, each one being, of course, larger than any they had previously had, and each returning; seven members. They were to be elected, under the Hare-Clark method. Naturally so soon as the proposal came before the Chamber, the trouble consequent upon the proposal to cut down the representation by three was intensified. Men who felt that they had safe seats in certain electorates were anxious that those constituencies should not be amalgamated with adjoining constituencies, under which system they might find themselves with a large number of candidates standing for the vacant seats,, and would have much larger electorates to travel over. They were very loth to adopt a system of that character. They suggested as an alternative that the old system should be continued, and that the two cities of Launceston and Hobart should still continue to be represented under the Hare-Clark system, whilst the country electorates should continue as single electorates. Hardly any of them were found to be strongly desirous of anything in the nature of political self-effacement, and they considered that the time had not come for a reduction in the number of the members of the Legislative Assembly at all. So far as the cities were concerned, some of the old members, who, under the Hare-Clark system, had not occupied a position on the poll which they considered they ought to have occupied, were opposed to the new system ; and, further than that, some of them opposed the application of the Hare-Clark system to any electorate which was as small as either Hobart or Launceston. I do not think that at the present time there are in Hobart many more than 4,000 votes. </para>

              <para>- I am not dealing with the merit of the suggestion. I am simply pointing out why, as some people say, Tasmania abandoned the Hare-Clark System. The country members were afraid to indulge in a scheme for large electorates and proportional representation, because many of them felt too secure in their own electorates. Those in the city were divided to a certain extent. Many of them opposed the continuance of the application of the Hare-Clark system to the restricted electorates of Hobart and Launceston, but they were in favour of its application to larger electorates. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> referred to a paper by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> M. Johnston, Government statistician of Tasmania, and pointed out that that gentleman had come to the conclusion that, if the federal elections had been conducted on a system of compulsory plumping, the same results would have taken place. I only refer to this paper by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Johnston</inline> in order to point out that it has peculiar reference to a particular proposal that was before the Parliament of Tasmania at that time, namely, the division of the State into five electorates. He suggested the divisions, and actually marked them out. He showed subsequently, that if those five divisions had been fixed upon as five separate electorates for the Senate and House of Representatives, the same men would have been returned, on the assumption that each of the successful candidates had offered himself for the constituency in which he was strongest, although he might not previously be aware of the fact. It goes to demonstrate that the proposal was to divide Tasmania into five electorates. The members of the local Parliament, like the members of nearly every State Parliament in Australia, were not, anxious to commit any political self-effacement. They opposed the proposal. The city members were in favour of the principle of the Hare-Clark system, as applied to Tasmania as one electorate, although they considered that Launceston and Hobart, with their small number of voters, were not large enough to allow of its application to them. The total number of electors in Hobart is, I now find, 5,600. </para>

There are 5,600 electors under manhood suffrage, but when the Hare-Clark system was applied to that electorate, we did not have manhood suffrage. We had, I think, something like 4,200 electors there some few years ago. </para>

              <para>- In Ashworth's <inline font-style="italic">Proportional</inline><inline font-style="italic">Representation</inline> reference is made to an election which was alluded to last night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer,</inline> and I think the quota was given as a little over 500. I have not the reference before me now, but it relates to the return of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miles.</inline> Thereturn of that gentleman showed, in effect, that the Hobart electorate was too small and too compact for the application of this system of voting, and that a certain section of it was considerably corrupt. </para>

              <para>- Decidedly not, and I do not think my honorable friend can be acquainted with the circumstances to which allusion was made last night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer.</inline> They were that one particular candidate practically purchased his return by securing a quota by corrupt practices. The electors resided very closely together, and the number requisite in order to obtain a quota was so small that he was able to do it. The Hare-Clark system, and any other system of proportional representation, aims at nothing else but to carry out, more effectually than does the block system, what the voter desires. It does not aim at affecting his intelligence, or at purifying the electorate. I think that, if honorable senators will consider carefully the principles provided in the Bill with regard to proportional representation, they will see that the object aimed at, and which is in effect achieved - although it may not be with absolute mathematical accuracy - is to secure the representation in this Chamber of the political aims and aspirations of the community as a whole. It does not aim at the representation of any particular dominating section, but at getting them here to go through their proper functions of consultation and deliberation before legislation, and, as a result of that consultation and deliberation, to put into the legislation of the community, as far as one branch of the Legislature can do, the ripe, reasoned, and mature judgment of the whole of the community. As to the principles surrounding the particular system proposed by the Government, I have only to say that they do not meet with my entire approval. If the second reading of the Bill is carried, as I hope it will be, and we get into committee, I shall do whatever I possibly can to secure the modification of that portion of the Bill which provides for the application of the principles of proportional representation to our elections, so as to bring it into accord with my own views, and to secure what I think will be proper representation by a better method than that provided in the details of the Bill. I am sorry that I have occupied the attention of the Senate at such length. My only justification for doing so is that to some extent we have had in Tasmania a practical working acquaintance with this system. I have spoken, I believe, from over 50 platforms in that State upon the Hare-Clark system, and although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> says that he was subjected to a great deal of catechizing, the questions that were submitted to me indicated a remarkably keen appreciation on the part of the electors of the basic principles of the system. They indicated an evident desire on the part of the electors to be informed of the practical working of the system before the elections took place, and I feel sure that as the newspapers published the actual results and the method of counting, and the voters themselves received considerable information, it will be of very great advantage to them in future. I hope the Senate will take this opportunity of giving effect to the principles of proportional representation, thus taking one forward step in our legislation - a movement which we ought to be ready to agree to. Proportional representation has already engaged the attention of the New Zealand Parliament more than once. On one occasion a motion for the adoption of the Hare Spence system was lost in one of the Houses of the Legislature by eight votes, and subsequently by seven. Therefore the matter is not the mere experiment and. novelty that some honorable senators would have us believe. It has been carefully thought out by leading minds in the world. The disagreement that occurs amongst the different persons who have been modifying the system evidences to my mind their inherently strong belief in the justice and equity of its fundamental principles, and their strong desire to give effect to them in the best manner possible. I have much pleasure in supporting the motion for the second reading of this Bill. </para>
