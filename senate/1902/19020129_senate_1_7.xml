          <para>- I am very glad that the PostmasterGeneral has made that alteration. It might be well if the Government would  Consider  the advisability of  fixing  Commonwealth Day at the earliest possible period. I do not think there can be any doubt as to the absolute unanimity of Australia on the desirability of having a day fixed independently of, as now, the 1st of January, or any other existing holiday. If the Government could insert in the clause a date which would be acceptable to the whole of Australia, it would be a distinct advantage. I think it ought to be the date of  Her  late Majesty&#39;s assent to the Commonwealth of Australia Bill - the 9th July. It would be an excellent time of the year, certainly much better than the 1st of January, for the commemoration of a great historical event. I shall be glad if the PostmasterGeneral will ascertain the views  of the Government on the point before this Bill leaves the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has misunderstood this proposal. When the Bill was drafted, it was supposed that Commonwealth Day would be celebrated on the 1st of January. It has been pointed out that the 1st of January is always a holiday - that a great number of persons desire on New Year&#39;s Day to go to sea-side resorts, and that it would not be a convenient day to adopt &#39; as Commonwealth Day. It would have no special significance. It would be celebrated, as it has been for years, as New Yearns Day. Taking that into consideration, it is probable that some other suitable day may be fixed upon, but I do not wish the Senate to commit itself to any day. The amendment which has been agreed to will leave the matter open. </para>

          <para>- I did not interpose when the Postmaster-General moved his amendment, not because I entirely approved of it, but merely with a view of hearing what he had to say as to the clay he would substitute. I entirely dissent from the proposal to alter the day. The 1st January is the day on which the proclamation was issued, and on which Ministers took office. It has an historical significance, and to substitute for it any other day would rob the celebration of its charm and effect in the minds of a great number of people. I do not believe in any alteration, not that I wish to deprive any one of an extra holiday, but because I think that the Federal Parliament should adhere to the day which possesses an historical significance. In Scotland great importance is attached to the 1st January, and as Scotland is the home of my fathers, I attach importance to it also as a holiday. But so far as Australia is concerned, the 1st January is the day which should be celebrated in connexion with the inauguration of the .Commonwealth. Before I sit down 1 wish to mention an amendment which I intend to move on this clause in the interests of a number of officers employed in country and suburban districts. It will be observed that under sub-clause (6) it is provided that the Minister or the permanent head of a department may require an office to be kept open iii the public interest, upon a holiday, and may require the attendance of officers. In that case, it is provided that the officers who are thus deprived of their holiday may be granted - if practicable in lieu thereof a holiday upon such other occasion as -shall not interfere with public business. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I entirely agree with that, but the PostmasterGeneral must be aware that in man y of the suburban offices, where, to meet the exigencies of business, officers have been required to work on holidays, there has been some difficulty about granting them holidays upon other occasions. In order that that may not occur in the future, I intend to move for the insertion of the following words at the end of sub-clause (6) : - or shall be entitled to an equivalent extension of leave of absence for recreation in the current year. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is merely indulging in a verbal quibble. The sub-clause simply provides that in a case where the law of the State fixes some other day to be the holiday that day shall be observed by Commonwealth officers. It is a very reasonable provision, because it is desirable that public holidays should be kept by Federal officers on the day upon which -they are kept in the State where the officers are serving. It is evidently undesirable that Federal officers should keep a holiday on one day and State officers on another day. Therefore all that this subclause provides is that where the State law fixes a certain day for the holiday, that holiday is to be kept on that day by the Federal officers employed in that State. </para>

The proper place in which to have made this provision is sub-clause (1). The object of this proposal is to prevent a conflict between officers of the Commonwealth and officers of the State in the observance of any of these holidays. That is very desirable. We legislate for our public service in sub-clause (1), and then we go on to say that instead of having a conflict between the holiday&#39;s of the State service and those of the Federal service, the State arrangements shall prevail.That could be done very much better by inserting after the word &#34; days &#34; in the first line of subclause (1) the words - &#34;or any days observed in lieu of them under the law of any State.&#34; That is all we want. To insert the word &#34;other &#34;in sub-clause (2), as proposed by the Postmaster-General, would not meet the case. </para>

I think that they ought to have days off in lieu of the public holidays upon which they work, and the days allowed them should be as near to the holidays upon which they work as possible. It should be recognised that they are substituted for the holidays upon which they work. The views of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> would be carried out to a considerable extent if we substituted the word &#34; shall &#34; for the word &#34;may,&#34; so as to make it clear that an officer working upon a public holiday was to get the extra time off. </para>

            <para>- I am not disposed to go as far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> proposes. I do not think it desirable that these days off should be added to the recreation leave, which is given for a different purpose. Recreation leave is given to an officer in order that he may recruit his health, but these public holidays are days of public rejoicing, when people desire to meet together and enjoy themselves. If the public service demands that an officer shall stop and work upon those days he should, as early as possible, get a holiday in lieu of them. I do not approve of the latter part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey&#39;s</inline> suggested amendment, which might lead to officers laying themselves out to work on all public holidays, with a view to increasing the amount of their recreation leave. I do not think it desirable to encourage that. Public servants who are required to work upon holidays should be satisfied if they get a holiday in the place of the one upon which they work. I am prepared to go so far as to substitute the word &#34;shall&#34; for the word &#34;may,&#34; and to substitute the word &#34; when &#34; for the word &#34;if&#34; before the word &#34;practicable.&#34; I move - </para>

Looking through the clause I think the difference is a matter of words only, and if amended as the Postmaster-General proposes the clause will give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> what he is aiming at. I understand that the honorable senator desires that an officer who has been deprived of one of these public holidays shall have the right to tack it on to his ordinary holiday. That can be done under this clause, because it is provided that the substituted holiday may be granted &#34;upon such other occasion as shall not interfere with public business.&#34; </para>

            <para>- It leaves it in the hands of the head of the department to say that the extra days due to a public officer may be taken at the time of his ordinary holiday if that does not interfere with public business. If it is inconvenient for the working of the departments for him to take the additional leave at that time, he must take it at some other time. However careful we must be in looking after the interest of its civil servants we have some regard for the proper conduct of business in these big State departments. With regard to the Postmaster-General&#39;s proposal to substitute the word &#34; when &#34; for the word &#34; if &#34; before the word &#34; practicable,&#34; I point out that the words &#34; if practicable &#34; are unnecessary in view of the provision that a half-holiday may be granted &#34; upon such other occasion as shall not interfere with public business.&#34; The words &#34; if practicable &#34; were a qualification of the word &#34;may,&#34; and as we have struck out the word &#34;may,&#34; the words &#34;if practicable &#34; may also be struck out. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline>is in error in some of the statements he has made, and I may mention a few cases to illustrate what I desire to impress upon the committee. I entirely agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the first consideration for Parliament is to see that the public requirements are met. The annual leave granted is a time for recreation, and the usual public holidays are days of rejoicing, but in scores of country offices, and in many suburban offices there is no time for the officers to rejoice, as they must be in their offices every day in the year to meet the requirements of the people. I remind the PostmasterGeneral of the conditions existing in places like Blackall, Tambo, Georgetown, Atherton or Mareeba. In such places the honorable and learned senator must know that before the officers in charge can get their ordinary leave ofabsence an officer must be sent from Brisbane, Rockhampton or Townsville to relieve him. In the same way I have no doubt in South Australia officers must be sent from the central officers to relieve officers in charge of outside stations, and the relieving officer has often to travel over hundreds of miles. Under these circumstances the honorable and learned senator must see that it is quite impracticable to carry out an arrangement to give these officers off days in lieu of the ordinary public holidays upon which they have to work. </para>

          <para>- After the very generous way in which the Postmaster-General has met us I think it is unnecessary to insert the words. The provision as it stands gives the head of a department an opportunity of meeting the wish of any officer should he desire a day off a week af ter the holiday was celebrated, and that day might suit him a great deal better than the other. It is mandatory that the officer shall have a holiday in lieu of the one on which he worked, but on such an occasion as shall not interfere with the course of public business. The clause ought to meet the requirements of every officer. </para>

          <para>- I think that nearly everything which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> desires is in the clause. For instance, &#39;what is the  objection to a place on the ground of its &#34;remoteness&#34;? So far as it means that it increases the cost of living to a man, that is provided for. If by remoteness is meant  that a man is deprived of certain society, it would be almost impossible by any means to frame a scheme of allowances which would  compensate a man for losing the advantages of society. With regard to climate, that evidently is dealt with in the reference to the tropics, and a man may have an extra allowance because he is living in or near the tropics. If we are to make an -allowance to one man because he is living in a place which is too hot, and to another because he is living in a place -which is too cold, it will be exceedingly difficult. We recognise in the clause that a man is untitled to some special consideration because he is living in or near the tropics or in a mountainous district, or in such a situation that the cost of living is necessarily high. I do not see how by regulation we could go very much further. </para>

          <para>- The suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has probably been induced by the use in the clause of words which are quite unnecessary. If we omit the words &#34; owing to their situation &#34; we leave the matter open. In any case where the cost of living is necessarily high it will be in the power of the Governor-General to proclaim a special allowance for that place, without any stipulation as to the cause why the cost of living is high. There is no reason for mentioning climate or any other cause. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> will be good enough to temporarily withdraw his amendment, I shall move for the omission of the words. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;KEEFE</inline>(Tasmania). - The omission of those words would destroy the effect of the amendment I wish the committee to make. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quite gathers the class of cases I mean. I have in my mind&#39;s eye several places which are not in the tropics or in entirely mountainous regions, but in which the conditions of life are inconvenient, uncomfortable, and costly, and in in man}&#39; instances very unhealthy. The amendment I propose to move would enable the Governor-General to meet such cases by regulation. I know some such places to which officers were sent many years ago. They have never received their transfers, as they ought to have done, or had a proper increase of salary, and are still living under great disadvantages. I cannot see any harm in taking power to meet such cases. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> will not press his amendment, because I believe he is just as anxious as I am not to act unfairly to an officer. </para>

            <para>- It is generally considered that these places are, though not altogether unhealthy, undesirable ; but the definition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has quoted is a geographical one. No doubt that can be done, but I do not think we can schedule certain places as being distinctly unhealthy. Very often these places are considered most undesirable from a health point of view, but are not really unhealthy. I have in mind such places as the western districts of Queensland, which, by reason of the dust and the flies, are uncomfortable, though the climate cannot be referred to as unhealthy. It is a most healthy climate. </para>

          <para>- The draftsman of this Bill evidently put in as many words as he possibly could, and did not attempt to boilit down in any way. He has used words that are quite unnecessary. For instance, in this sub-clause he uses the words &#34;mountainous localities,&#34; but such localities arehealthy, especially in the tropics. I cannot see any reason why, because a man lives in a mountainous locality, he should receive extra salary. If I were a public servant in South Australia, I should desire to be placed in the mountains, because of their healthiness. In the tropics, the higher one gets into the air the lower the temperature is, and the more comfortable. Going a little further, the sub-clause says - or in places where, owing to their situation, the cost of living is necessarily high. </para>

        <para class="block">There is nob the slightest necessity for the words &#34; owing to their situation.&#34;Very likely the situation affects the cost of living, but there is no necessity to put such words in an Act of Parliament. There is an unfortunate want of terseness in the drafting of this Bill, as well as a lack of distinctness and of knowledge of how to express exactly what is meant, It is quite right to leave in the provision with regard to the cost of living, because in all the States of the Commonwealth it has been recognised that a public servant should receive consideration when he is residing in parts where for some special reason the cost of living is particularly high. We ought to strike out the words &#34;mountainouslocalities&#34; and make the sub-clause simply read - or in places where the cost of living is high. </para>

What we want to do is to give something additional to officers who are compelled to live in a part of the country where, owing to the remoteness of the situation, the cost of living ishigh ; but there is no need for the word &#34; remote &#34; or the word &#34; situation.&#34; It is only the actual fact that the cost of living is high that needs to be provided for. If, in the first place, we struck out the words &#34; or in mountainous localities,&#34; and then omitted the words &#34; owing to their situation,&#34; the sub clause would read - for regulating and determining the scale or amount to be paid to officers for transfer or travelling allowances, or expenses, or for living in or near the tropics, or in places where the cost of living is high. </para>

I know of places in Australia, where through the dust, the flies, and other unpleasant conditions it is almost a misery to live at all. Many public servants have to live under those conditions. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that something might be done to make the clause much shorter, and even more intelligible, if instead of referring, to climate - that would lead a person to consider that either hot or cold, or wet or dry, was meant - the subclause simply said - &#34; Where the conditions of life are severe, or the cost of living is high.&#34; That would be comprehensive enough to include everything. We may be sure that the regulations would be framed by officers having a knowledge of the conditions and of places where the living is high. I would suggest to Senators Millen and O&#39;Keefe that instead of referring to climate only they should refer both to climate and cost of living. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator EWING</inline>(Western Australia).I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to reconsider his amendment in view of the representations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor.</inline> There are many places in Western Australia where the climatic conditions are not necessarily very severe, but where there is no water, and the conditions of life are very unpleasant indeed. Take, for instance, the Phillips River gold-fields - a place that is not specially hot and is far removed from the tropics. The conditions of life there are very unpleasant by reason of the absence of water and the newness of the locality. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that he should follow the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> leaving out the reference to the word climate, and saying &#34;localities where the conditions are severe.&#34; My point is that in some places in Western Australia it is not the climate, but the absence of water, which makes life unpleasant. </para>

          <para>- I think the construction of the word &#34; climate,&#34; as here used, would be hot or cold, wet or dry. The mere absence of water would not be considered climatic.

          <para>- The amendment as printed provides for the transfer of the persons referred to &#34; without examination,&#34; but at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> I have omitted those words. Under clause 33 we give this power of transfer to any officers&#39; in the State employ, but there is no power in the Bill by which our own employes in the military department, other than those in the civil branch, may be transferred. The civil branch is dealt with in the Bill, but the military branch of the defence forces will be dealt with under the Defence Bill. I believe that in that measure there is a clause which gives the right of transfer to these persons, but it requires that they shall retire on reaching the age of 50 years. This amendment applies particularly to sergeantsmajor and drill sergeants, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> informs me that under the provisions of the Defence Bill they would have to retire on reaching 50 years of age. We recognise in the Public Service Bill that a man of fifty has still fifteen years of life to run, and surely there can be no objection to giving officers in the military department a concession similar to that which employes in the railway services of the States enjoy, namely, the right of transfer, at a salary equal to that which they have been receiving, to some other employ in the general division. </para>

            <para>- If this means that a man of mature years, who has been serving in the defence force, is to come into the public service to the detriment of young fellows who are not above the age we have fixed, we should carefully consider whether it ought to be agreed to. We have already considered it desirable to fix a limit of age for entrance into the service, and I presume we had good reasons for doing that. We are now asked to upset that decision in order to benefit persons of mature age who have been serving in some other occupation or employment. I think, it would be better to leave it to the commissioner to give employment in different departments, wherever he finds he can, to those who have seen military service. </para>

          <para>- If this clause, as moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> is carried, it will give a great deal of trouble to the various services under the control of the Commonwealth. As I understand it, tho effect of it will be that, after a man has exhausted himself in the naval or military service, he can come along and claim to be taken into the Post-office or Customs department of the Commonwealth. He may come at 35 years of&#39; age, or may delay until he is 50. I ask honorable senators what earthly use to the Customs or Post-office is a man who has already spent 50 years of his life <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> People in Australia are not so cognisant of it, but it is well known in Great Britain, that nothing so unfits a man for every-day affairs as military service. A man who has spent a numberof years in the army is utterly useless in almost every other occupation. If this clause is carried, the Commonwealth Government will be loaded with a number of inefficient men. A military man, in the receipt of &#163;200 or &#163;300 a year, arrives at .-in age when he is compelled to retire. He approaches the Post-office for a position at the same salary. Will it be possible for the Post-office to give him such a position, or will he be fitted to fill it? In our anxiety to provide for the military and every other person, we are losing sight of the very important fact that what we need more than anything else is efficiency in the public service. If a clause of this character is passed it will aim a deadly blow at its efficiency. It will cause a body of incompetent men to go into the Post-office or the Custom-house^ It will provoke bitter antagonism from men who have been in the service for years. They will see a man who has been drilling soldiers for twenty years appointed to a position in the Post-office, although he cannot possibly know its duties. They will not take a position in the general division. </para>

            <para>- A man who had been trained to the sorting, and stamping of letters would lose a military man at the work. If you send a military man of 45 or 50 years of age to carry letters, his feet will be as heavy as lead compared with the nimble carriers we see in the streets of Melbourne. We should not place unnecessary obstruction in the way of the postal authorities obtaining what they require. I object to the whole clause* but particularly to the last few words, giving priority to these men. It is truckling to militarism, trying to set a soldier on a pedestal ; holding out to him the hope that if he spends the best years of his life shouldering a musket, practising the goosestep, shooting at a target, and displaying his finery to capture the hearts of the ladies, at the end of his career, when he is no longer fit for active service, he will be placed in some cosy billet, where he can spend the rest of his days in ease and comfort. AVe do not need military men in this country. We should not attempt by any  means, either directly or indirectly, to foster the military spirit. &#39; It has been the cause of a great deal of evil in other countries. I have no desire to see it introduced into our Eden, like the serpent. Anything I can do to scotch it will be done. If men enter the army let them take the consequences. I would put military men on an equal footing with other servants of the Commonwealth. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> will excise the words giving priority to military men. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania).- Probably owing to the fact that the new clause has not been sufficiently circulated, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> does not quite understand its contents. I was perfectly willing to accept the alterations which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> suggested, and that was a concession in a direction which, no doubt, pleased <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> I would point out, first, that the clause applies to only the- general division, and, secondly, that it prescribes even for the military and naval people, to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has so strong an objection, an examination, and they will have to comply with every requirement that an ordinary civil servant had to comply with before he entered the service. It maintains the same efficiency so far as we can do by legislation. Therefore there is no preference given in that way. The words to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> most strongly objected are these - which may occur therein in priority to any persons whatsoever except persons already in the service of the- Commonwealth. </para>
        <para class="block">The obvious meaning of -those words is that the appointment of a naval or military man is not to operate so as to interfere with the proper promotion of existing civil servants. I cannot accept &#39;the insertion of words which would make the clause perfectly, meaningless. The words which seem to have caused hostile comment only mean that a naval or military man shall not get into the public service to the detriment of .an existing civil servant. </para>

            <para>- I do not disguise the meaning of the new clause. Its object is to recognise naval and military men who have served five years. I find myself reluctantly unable to accept the amendment to add the words &#34;or State.&#34; I do not agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said about putting a naval or military man on the same footing as anyone else. I think he ought to have a preference* and that is the whole aim of the clause. Whatever the clause does* it will not operate disadvantageously to any existing civil servant at the time a naval or military man gets his entry. </para>

          <para>- I do not see anything particularly objectionable about this new clause. A similar provision is in force in Victoria. A mau who has been in the defence force is regarded as an exservant of the State. When the departments were short of hands here once some of these men had the first chance of employment. In one instance several of them entered the Income-Tax office, but before they could get there they had to show that they were fit to do the work. I apprehend that the same course would be taken under this &#39; clause if adopted. These men are already in the service of the Commonwealth, and it is merely a case of transferring them from one department to another. They should have a preference over State officers because they are Commonwealth officers. It seems to me a perfectly fair provision to make. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator EWING</inline>(Western Australia). - Under clause 33, State officers are given certain rights with regard to entry into the Commonwealth, service, and we are now asked to say that a person who has been in the defence force shall be entitled to priority over civil servants in the States. Supposing, that there are two competitors for a position in the general division - say, in the Railway department, as a telegraph line man, and that one has had experience of that work in a State and is well qualified to fill the position, whilst the other is a naval or military man. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> was perfectly right when he saidthat military men spend most of their lives walking about the streets doing nothing. The men hi the Defence department do absolutely nothing which qualifies them to fill a position in the public service. When the Commonwealth can get from a State an officer trained in the duties to be dis-  charged, is it to be compelled to take a man from the defence force? </para>

            <para>- But State officers are given the same right to transfer under clause 33. A man in a State service is just as eligible for employment under the Commonwealth as is a man in the Commonwealth service, but we are asked to say that merely because a man happens to be in the defence force he shall, be given priority over all other persons in the States as to employment. Why should a man who happens to be in the military service have greater rights than a man in the railway service, or than any other person in the employment of one of the States <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> I certainly think that the Commonwealth is much more likely to find men capable of filling Commonwealth positions from amongst those occupying similar positions in the States than from amongst men in the defence force. Again, may I ask the mover of this amendment what is the meaning of the term &#34; defence force&#34; ? Does it cover the volunteer service <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Does it include persons holding a commission in the volunteer forces? If that is so, the best way of getting into the Commonwealth service would be to join a volunteer corps or a rifle club, because by doing so a man would secure priority. I am at a loss to understand why this priority should be asked for, and am therefore of opinion that the words &#34;or State&#34; should be added to this clause, giving the civil servants of the States the same rights as those employed in the Defence department. </para>

          <para>- -I hav noticed during this discussion that there are two particular sets of persons mentioned as being those who ought to have priority. One set has been mentioned by the mover of this amendment - namely, those who have served in the military and naval f forces of the Commonwealth for a period of five j-ears. Hie others are the civil servants or those employed in the railway services of the States. But the Commonwealth Parliament is not elected to merely recognise the claims of one or two sets of people. It is chosen to legislate for the whole mass of the people of the Commonwealth. There are a large number of persons outside the sections mentioned whose claims for employment ought to be equal to those now set up, although they have not been mentioned. Take our mining population. They certainly run greater risks, and follow a far more dangerous occupation, than the persons who belong to the defence force, even including those who have been to the war in South Africa. Yet up to the present time, not a single plea has been put forth in behalf of any person outside the two sections to whom I have alluded. What is the difference between a man assisting in manning and sailing our warships round the coast of Australia and one employed in manning vessels upon the coastal trade ? Should not a man employed on vessels engaged in the trading business in Australian waters have an equal claim to enter the general division of the Commonwealth service with those who serve in the naval forces ? In exactly the same way, a man who works in a mine should have an equal claim with a man who serves in the volunteer forces. I strongly object to any priority being given to the persons who have been singled out by the supporters . of the amendment. Notwithstanding that, I value as much as any one the services of those who have gone to South Africa in a time of great difficulty, and have endured severe hardships and privations. What I hold is, however, that it is not our business to legislate for any one particular class to the detriment and at the expense of a vast number of persons who may desire to enter the service. That being so, I cannot vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> who I hope will see the wisdom of acting more in harmony with the spirit of the age, and with the equity and justice which ought to prevail in regard to the vast number of persons who are not included within the sections of the community whom it is desired specially to favour. As to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has said, I may remark that I happen to have entered the service of one of the States at the age of 40, and I venture to say that I could carry letters then and could cany them now - notwithstanding that fifteen or sixteen more years have elapsed since then - as nimbi}&#39;, as quickly, and as accurately as many younger members. I repudiate emphatically the assertion that a man of 40 is unfit to enter the service. I am nearer 60 than 50, but I venture to say that to-morrow I could go and carry letters, and discharge my duty and my share of work, in competition with any ordinary person of fewer years. It is preposterous to set up the claim that men who have gone through some drill in any part of the Commonwealth are, by Act of </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Parliament, to be made superior in regard to entering the service to ordinary men who have been doing the every-day work of the country, and have been taking their share in raising the taxation which maintains the Government. </para>

          <para>- -I really think that some honorable senators do not see the drift of the amendment which&#39; has been proposed, and which has been met by objections that do not properly apply to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> with all due respect to him, has not only misunderstood the question, but has been setting up a bog}&#39;, which he has pummelled in order to show that the amendment should not be carried. Let me repeat what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> - that the amendment does nob give preference to members of the naval and military forces in the <inline font-style="italic">ways</inline> that have been stated. They will simply be eligible for employment, just as any honorable senator would be eligible if he were not a member of the Senate ; and then the amendment says that they will be employed in preference to any one who is not a Commonwealth public servant. The amendment simply goes to the extent of recognising that men who are in the military service form part of the service of the Commonwealth, whilst men who are in the services of the States are not in the service of the Commonwealth, any more than are servants of a borough council. Would honorable senators say for a moment that a man in the service of a borough council stands in the same position as a man in the Commonwealth service? It would be an absurdity to say so. If there were a vacancy in the Treasury and a man in the Postmaster-General&#39;s department wanted to occupy the position, should he not be transferred before taking a man from outside, assuming that the officer wishing to be transferred was capable of performing the duties in the Treasury ? Similarly in regard to the military forces, a man who belongs to them is in the service of the Commonwealth. and should obtain a right which a man who is outside the service does not obtain, having earned that right by virtue of his service. If he has been dismissed he does not get the advantage that this amendment would give. The amendment enables a man to apply to be transferred from the military branch to the civil branch. All it gives him is a preference over a man who is outside the Commonwealth service altogether. Is that not a reasonable thing to do <inline font-style="italic">1</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> has spoken of miners and men following various pursuits who are nob in the Commonwealth service. No doubt such men meet with hardships and difficulties. Sometimes they are not as well paid as public servants and sometimes they are better paid. Such a man has a right to apply for a vacant post in the service, but he has no right over a man who is already in the service. A military man is in the service of the Commonwealth, and he should be given an advantage over a man who is outside. Suppose a man in a post-office wants to be transferred to the military department to do some particular work, would not honorable senators give him a preference to a man outside the service? </para>

            <para>- Then we ought to. If a man in the Post-office wants to be transferred to the Attorney General&#39;s department, should he not have a preference ? That preference is given to him by this Bill, and why take the same advantage away from the military branch of the service, simply because the members of it do not come within the four corners of this Bill ? It is an unfair thing to do so. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> talks of the hardships endured in another occupation, he is simply setting up a man of straw for the sake of pummelling it, and not for the sake of bringing to bear arguments against the amendment. Of course I know that in the opinion of some honorable senators a man who serves in the military forces should receive no advantage over others, but should be driven away, if possible, from all remunerative employment. </para>

            <para>- Men employed in the military service are working just as loyally and devotedly for the State as are those employed in the civil branches of our service. They are brought together for the defence of the State ; to defend the interests of the State and of the Commonwealth. They are entitled to all credit and honour for the positions they take up - positions which render them liable to all kinds of danger to which the ordinary citizen who goes to his office at nine o&#39;clock every morning, returns to his home at five o&#39;clock every evening, and sleeps in a comfortable bed at night, is never exposed. . I hope that honorable senators will realize that this proposal is designed to give a fair chance to those men who are already in the service, and to only allow them, when the authorities see fit, a preference over persons not already in the civil service. </para>

It certainly does seem to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould&#39;s</inline> arguments are merely plausible pretexts for the continuance of the old system.

            <para>- Then I wish to know why the persons referred to in the clause are entitled to a preference ? It has been said that they are entitled* to it because they are in the Commonwealth service ? But in what branch are they employed ? In the military branch. If they are good soldiers they ought to be bad clerks. The soldier&#39;s occupation is the negation of the stool. It calls upon a man to go forth to battle, and his duties are best fulfilled by those who develop the muscles of the body rather than the muscles of the mind. Therefore I see absolutely no sound logic whatever in the assertion that these persons ought to be given a preference over State civil servants, because they happen to be servants of the Commonwealth. True, they are the servants of. a department, the duties of which, if properly fulfilled, render them the more inefficient for the class of service for which they are to receive the preference. &#39; </para>

            <para>- I have really been induced to speak upon this amendment because in private conversation I have frequently expressed myself very strongly upon the unwarranted deification of the military and naval profession. I do not often refer to personal matters, but honorable senators may be satisfied that I am speaking impartially upon this &#39; question when I tell them that I have sisters married to officers in the Imperial army. The feelings I have expressed are not therefore dictated by any prejudice. If a man joins the army or navy he does so in the hope of receiving the rewards which his profession gives, or the honour which it sheds upon him. If he does not think that those rewards or that honour constitute sufficient remuneration for his services, he should not enter the profession. </para>

            <para>- I care not whether they are citizen soldiers or any other class. Looking at it fairly and justly I fail to see what a man in this service does to entitle him to a preference over his fellow who occupies his time in serving his country in the ranks of the army of workers, or what better he does than the man who, in the case put so aptly by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> serves his country, and serves it lucratively, by risking his life mining in the bowels of the earth. All of us I hope, who properly and honestly discharge our duties, not only serve ourselves but to some extent serve our country. Most men by joining the army obtain not only a return to their pockets, but in addition an &#34;highfalutin&#39;,&#34; unjustifiable, and unmeritorious return of kudos and glory. It is not because of the glamour which hangs around these persons that the Commonwealth and the States are to stoop down and say to these men, &#34; My brave sons, you are more worthy, more honorable members of the State than others&#34; - others who serve it just as faithfully and far more efficiently in less notable callings which have shed around them less of the halo which attaches to the military profession. It is not often that I express sentiments which place me so much in accord with my honorable friends of the labour party, but every honorable . senator will acknowledge that,whetherwisely or unwisely, I generally speak out exactly what I feel. While I think that a good deal of credit is due to many members of the service who have left Australia to serve the Empire in the Boer war; while I think that as a nation we ought to be very proud of their achievements there ; while I think further that whether the Boer war in its inception was right or wrong- </para>

Having expressed these views, I find myself almost in the position occupied some months ago by my honorable and learned friend SenatorSymon, who, after adducing very forcible arguments in favour of a certain conclusion, found it expedient to vote the other way.

            <para>- Because it would not be sensible or reasonable to do so. If honorable senators will refer to clause 33, they will see that persons who were in the service of any State at the establishment of the Commonwealth are eligible for appointment to positions in the corresponding divisions of the public service of the Commonwealth. As it is manifest that that clause places persons in the service of the States and those in the employ of the Commonwealth upon exactly the same footing, the distinction which honorable senators have endeavoured to draw between the two is absolutely without meaning. I would submit that we ought to agree to the proposed new clause, and if we do that we should add words that will make our action consistent, and keep this provision in line with clause 33. We are transferring persons from the State to the Commonwealth service to-day, and may be doing so for years to come. For these reasons I protest with all seriousness against members of riflecorps or members of volunteer corps, and members of the permanent forces being given a preference over their brothers in the civil service. All that a man in the State service would have to do in order to gain a preference over his brother civil servant, would be to join a rifle corps, and remain in it for five years. That should not be the intention of the Legislature. The express intention of the Legislature, as shown in clause 33, is to give these civil servants rights similar to those enjoyed by persons employed by the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- The first part of the clause makes them eligible. It provides that if a man in the defence force gets beyond a certain age, he shall be eligible for employment in some other branch. That is to say, we provide that he may be employed in priority to persons who are not already in the Commonwealth service. Every one who is in the Commonwealth; service is to have priority over members of the defence force, but members of the defence force may be chosen in priority to those who are not at the time and have not been in the service. That, it appears to me, is not unreasonable. We have been endeavouring to find employment in the various departments for members of the defence force who have been awayto the war and have returned, andI do not believe that one word has been said in disapproval of that course. </para>

            <para>-No, we are not making a single appointment that is not required. Supposing, for example, we required half-a-dozen men in the Postal department, this clause would enable us to give men who had served for five years in the defence force of the Commonwealth priority of appointment. Surely that is reasonable. To provide, as now proposed, that a man who has been serving in the defence force is notto haveany priority over any man who has been serving under any State Government would be to whittle the concession down to nothing. </para>

            <para>- No, because it applies to any men who have been five years in the military or naval service of the Commonwealth or of a State. At the time of the transfer they came into the service of the Commonwealth. I think it is not an unreasonable thing to give this concession. It is merely permissive, and priority may not be given to any man unless he shows that he is equallyefficient with any other applicant for the position. If oneof thesemen is thoroughlyfitted to fill the position he is applying for, this clause will give the commissioner an opportunity of giving preference to him on the ground that he has served his country in the defence force. </para>

          <para>- I am sorry so much time should have beenwasted in a discussion which can be fruitful of no good. I cannot understand how any benefit is going to be derived from the clause even if it is carried. If what the advocates of the clause say of it is true it is practically meaningless. If we are to have in the future a citizen army I take it that every able-bodied man in the country will be a member of the defence force, and will come under the operation of this clause; sothat it will be fruitful of no good, whatever the intention of the mover may be. In my opinion it is very unfair to give those who go in for militarism as a profession or a pastime any advantage over those following any other calling in the Commonwealth. If there is any thing in militarism of the kind suggested it should be its own reward. I hope the clause will not be carried. </para>

          <para>- Honorable senators have asked what reason there is for giving our naval and military people a preference over outsiders in regard to employment in the Commonwealth public service. Soldiers and sailors have always had this preference given them, and I believe it is based upon the principle that they render services to their country as soldiers or sailors, which are worth considerably more in most cases than the pay which they receive. The bulk of the soldiers of the Commonwealth, whether militiamen or volunteers - I except paid defence force men - render hours and hours of service to the State for which the pay they receive does not remunerate them. Honorable senators should remember that every soldier of the British army for years past has received a pension on retirement. That is why it is suggested at Home by the most thoughtful men on both sides in the House of Commons - and I have read twenty letters on the subject in the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> if I have read one - that in any scheme of old - age pensSws that is passed, and I hope that if any scheme is agreed to it will be based to some extent on considerations of thrift and individual contribution, every man who has served his country for five years should be entitled as a matter of right to a pension. </para>

            <para>- I am pointing out now why there has always been a preference in favour of naval and military men. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DeLargiehas</inline> pointedout, if we pass a proper Defence Act - and we shall not pass a proper Defence Act unless we remember that militarism is just as necessary, though it may not be so important, as industrialism - we shall provide that every man in the Commonwealth shall be bound to drill 30 or 40 times a year whether we pay him or not. I agree that if that course is adopted this clause will then have very little effect, but in the meantime, and in case we do not pass such a compulsory defence measure, I agree with SenatorClemons that we should continue the slight preference hitherto given to naval and military men. It is said that these men will be uneducated, unfit, and inefficient, but honorable senators who have made that statement have forgotten that many of the men who have gone to South Africa from Australia were in the position of clerks in the Post and </para>

They taught themselves the telegraph operating business, and one of them, is now in a splendid situation in the Telegraph department in South Africa. Scores of the men who have gone away are absolutely fit to take many situations under the Commonwealth, and I am in favour of giving them the slight preference in the matter of employment which would be given them by this clause. </para>

            <para>- I was going to emphasize the point to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> has referred. Under clause 33 we practically put the civil servants of a State on an equal footing with those of the Commonwealth, and recognise that they have equal rights in the matter of transfers to positions corresponding to those which they hold in the State service. By this clause we are going to interpose the military man between them and their rights. We are going to say - &#34; We will give you a certain right of transfer to a position corresponding to that which you hold in the service of the State, but if a member of a rifle club applies to be appointed to the same position we shall give him preference in the appointment.&#34; That is inconsistent with clause 33, and no reason has been shown why we should give a preference to these people over others who, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> has properly said, have in various ways served the State in an equally efficient and valuable manner. </para>

        <para>The power of- the Governor-General to appoint the Public Service Commissioner and the inspectors shall be suspended until the adoption of the report. </para>
        <para class="block">The amendment opens up a very important subject, and that is the first classification of the three great departments - Customs, Post-office, and Defence - into one. My opinion always has been that one solitary commissioner, no matter how ably he is. aided by his six inspectors and the heads of departments, cannot undertake that work, at any time with anything like efficiency, justice, and fair play to the civil servants. When he does do the classification the whole of the evidence that will guide him will be evidence of a hearsay character. He will practically have no knowledge, and will have to depend on what he is told in the reports of inferior officers. Moreover, it is impossible that he can do this work for the first year or two. I take it that all honorable senators desire to see this classification take place at the earliest possible moment. I am sure we all desire to see the salaries of those civil servants who are being underpaid in some of the States raised at once to the Commonwealth rate. Honorable senators will see that here is to some extent a question of a State right. Every State has the right to see that civil servants of the Commonwealth in that State are placed in as fair a position, as regards grade and salaries, as civil servants in other States. I should like to know how this delicate and important work is to be undertaken by one man. Will honorable senators just grasp the fact for one moment ? The whole of this service is to be classified into one ; the six States are to be represented by one unknown man, and in this important matter, dealing with 11,000 officers, a State is not to have a member on the board to represent the officers in that State. This is a most peculiar way of trying to do a most important work. I do not see how it is possible for the plan to operate satisfactorily. My proposal is that, instead of having this one commissioner, strange to all civil servants, you should have the head of the department or the chief officer - a man who is in touch with the officers - who can speak of the officers of his own State, and confer with the representative from each other State, and thus, in the most delicate way, each will deal honorably and fairly with the other. They will have every now and then verv difficult questions to determine, such questions as whether clerk A in one State, with the same length of service and getting the same salary, ought to go above clerk B in another State, who is on exactly the same footing. How it is to be done I know not. I prefer my way of doing it, because it is more likely to secure an efficient grading, and to do justice to civil servants, than the rule-of-thumb method which is set forth in the Bill. The commissioner, I suppose, will have his headquarters at the capital, and will not travel about. All that duty will be done by his inspectors. He will get reports from the heads of the departments and inspectors, but just let honorable senators think for a moment how he must commence to classify the service. What has he to do ? He has to read all the reports of the inspectors, and the reports of the permanent heads ; but how much further forward has he got ? Does any one mean to say that the permanent head, who sees that while. he is responsible under the Act for the working discipline and control Of his department, the whole power of removing a clerk, of grading a clerk, of fixing a salary, is taken out of his hands, will take up the work of classification, and make a long report to satisfy the commissioner? I do not think he will take upon himself the responsibility, for this reason : that if we were to say that clerk A ought to go above clerk B, or that clerk D ought to go above both of them, and his report were not adopted, it would probably leak out, as some of the reports have to be tabled, that he had recommended one thing, and the commissioner had adopted another. I take it that the permanent head will not think of going into detail about the classification of the officers in his department. I ask honorable senators to tell me, if they can in a few words, how this classification is to &#34;be done by a perfect stranger. How is he going to set about the work ? It appears to me that Ministers are solely influenced in favour of centralizing everything. A few weeks ago, I had to ask the head of the defence force in Tasmania for the loan of a big marquee in which I wished to entertain some guests who were partly guests of the Government. Of course, if they had not been partly guests of the Government, I should not have made the request. I had the loan of a tent in 1892, when I was doing a similar thing. I got back a telephone message - &#34;We must telegraph to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest to ask if we can lend the tent.&#34; Again, I had to ask for two boilers in which to boil some tea, and I got a similar reply. That is an illustration of what I call overcentralization. What I ask the committee to do is to insist upon decentralization. When we come to deal with the position of each one of these 11,000 officers, we have no right to hand over their prospects in life to an ignorant commissioner - a man who never will know from the reports of 50 inspectors how each officer should be graded. </para>

            <para>- He would necessarily be an outside commissioner for every State but his o wn . I have already expressed the hope that every one of the officers appointed to the head of the civil service will be chosen from within the service, and that we shall have as few new appointments as possible. The day will come when there will arise a question of retrenchment against extravagance, and I shall vote for retrenchment. But if we pick out an inspector from the service of one of the States he will be a complete outsider as regards the other States, whereas the man I want to preside over the board will be a man - say a county court Judge - accustomed to weigh evidence and to come to sound conclusions. My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> will see that if a commissioner be appointed from the service of one of the States - and I hope that will be the case - he must be an outsider in respect to all the States but his own, and must be absolutely ignorant of the civil services of the States where he has not worked. This is one of the most important matters affecting the officers of the Commonwealth with which we have to deal, and Iwant to have all the States represented on such a board as I propose, and not have centralization. The man who is appointed to represent each State will be responsible for seeing that the service in his State and in the other States is placed in a proper position, and if the six representatives of the States cannot agree about any particular officer, then the outside man will enter in a kind of judicial capacity and decide the matter. I do not wish to take up any great length of time, but I should like to hear this matter discussed and ventilated ; and if honorable senators will show me what are the advantages to be derived from appointing a single commissioner, and how such an officer is to commenceto do the work of classifying the service, I shall only be too glad to withdraw my amendment and bow to the inevitable. But I contend that mine is a better way of classifying the service than the method proposed by this Bill. I would point out that my amendment proposes a temporary classification board, because the moment the board has classified the service into one, the work will, to a large extent, go on automatically. Possibly then one commissioner may be able to control the service. But he cannot, to start with, do it either efficiently or justly. </para>

          <para>- The honorable and learned senator who has just sat down has proposed a scheme of classification which he is asking the Senate to accept in place of the scheme embodied in the Government Bill. In reality it is not something to be engrafted upon the Bill, but something to take the place of the system proposed by the Government. He proposes that the power of the Governor-General to appoint a public service commissioner and inspectors shall be suspended until the adoption of the report of a board to be appointed under his amendment. Indeed, his proposal is that the whole of the work we have been doing shall be put on one side, and that the operation of the measure shall be suspended until the scheme which he now proposes has been tried - that is, the appointment of a board for the purpose of classifying the service. Nothing whatever is to be done under the Public Service Bill until the report of that board is adopted. Therefore <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> asks us to begin again with our work in a different way. He practically proposes the destruction of the Bill. In what respect is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> proposal with regard to classification better than the proposal of the Bill? He does not like the idea of a commissioner and of inspectors. Therefore he proposes that there shall be one person appointed from each Sta&#39;:e, with an additional person to act as  chairman,  these persons to form a classification board. The additional person he suggests should be a county court Judge. He gave us two hints as to the class of persons whom lie would like to see appointed from each of the States. He mentioned first the permanent head of the Post-office, who is a federal officer, whose duty it is impartially to look after the interests of the officers in his department, and of the public throughout the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> does not propose that this should be a permanent appointment. The head of the Postal Department is to be asked to sit upon the Classification Board, but is to . cease to occupy that position when the report of the board has been furnished. It is only to be a temporary appointment. Consequently we are to take a federal officer who belongs to the whole Commonwealth and put him on the board to grade the officers in the various States. </para>

            <para>- Yes ; and after having dealt with the officers of each particular State he is <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> step back again into his position at the head of the Postal Department. In fact he is only to leave that position for a time, and is then to become once more the permanent head of his department, exercising the duty of impartially overlooking the interests of the officers and public of the Commonwealth. The second person mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> is another federal officer, who is stationed in Tasmania, namely, the sub-collector of Customs there. He, while being a federal officer stationed in Tasmania, is to sit upon this Classification Board with the express power of furnishing information with regard to officers in each particular State. I think that such a thing would be most undesirable. On the other hand, the Government are asking, first of all, for the appointment of a commissioner who shall have no special interest in connexion with any particular State, and also for the appointment of inspectors, who are to be officers of the Commonwealth public service, and who will be at the service of the commissioner, to travel about to any State, and to discharge their duties impartially. That is the way in which we hope that the public service commissioner will be able to get a full and unbiassed knowledge of the officers in the different departments. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has done nothing at all to show that his scheme is preferable to the scheme of the Bill ; but, apart from that, we have discussed the matter over and over again, and have passed the clause providing for the appointment of the commissioner and of the inspectors. I do not think it is desirable that, by a side wind like this, the work we have already done should be undone. I follow the example of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in not speaking at any length upon the matter, and I hope that it will be discussed briefly by the committee. &#39; </para>

          <para>- The last words of the Postmaster-General astonish me. I quite agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> that there has been no amendment and no new clause proposed, during the whole discussion on this Bill, that has been onehalf so important to the civil servants of the smaller States as this one. I remember that when this Bill was before the Senate on the motion for the second reading, I interjected while the Postmaster-General was speaking, and endeavoured to ascertain the method by which the proposed first classification of the civil service was to be conducted. I could get very little information then ; the honorable and learned senator replied to my interjection by telling me that the commissioner would do it. One of the things that nearly all of us said, when we were offering ourselves &#39;as candidates for the Federal Parliament, was that we were all desirous of obtaining throughout the States uniformity with regard to the civil service. We said that we wanted to see equality of treatment throughout all grades of the service. But if we adhere to the provisions of this Bill, we are going to leave the question of the original grading of the many civil servants in the transferred departments, to one man, whom we do not know. My only objection to the commissioner - and we fought that question out some time ago - i3 that we are going to hand over to that one man the destinies and the interests of a very large number of civil servants. It does not surprise me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has moved this amendment. He and I come from the same State, and he knows as well as I do that the civil servants of Tasmania, at the present time, are very far from being on an equality with those in the other States. In saying this I am making no plea for my own State, because I believe that the officers of all the smaller States suffer in a similar way, and that there is gross unfairness towards them in comparison with the treatment accorded to the civil servants of the larger States. It occurs to me as a reason why we should adopt some such scheme as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> suggests, that if we have upon this classification board a representative of Tasmania, just as the other States will have their representatives upon the board, we may expect that a better knowledge of the conditions which exist will be brought out, and that some explanation will have to be given as to why so many of the civil servants of Tasmania are so badly paid. If Tasmania is represented it will be explained that the officers of the clerical division are largely underpaid, chiefly because Tasmania has for years been struggling against bankruptcy, and has been unable to pay its public servants what they ought to get, in comparison with the salaries paid in the larger States. There are in Tasmania civil servants, especially in the clerical division, who have been fifteen years in the service, who have done their work well, and who have not a single black mark against their names ; but yet at present time, in spite of the fact that they are doing exactly the same work as is done by similar officers in States like Victoria and New South Wales, the salaries they receive are not one-half what is paid for the same quality and the same quantity of work elsewhere. There is nothing to justify the difference of salary except the fact that Tasmania has always been in an impecunious position in comparison with the larger States. If we are going to allow a commissioner - a solitary man - to do the original grading work, we cannot expect him to be in full possession of all the reasons why the civil servants in the smaller States are underpaid in comparison with those in the larger States. I appeal for sympathy in this matter to honorable senators who come from the other smaller States of the Commonwealth. It is not only a Tasmanian question, but it seems to me that it is a question that especially calls for the attention of this Senate, where we are supposed to look after the interests of our particular States. I say, without the slightest hesitation, that honorable senators from the smaller States ought to vote for some such scheme as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has suggested. I do not profess to be in love with every word of his proposal, but I do say that he is on the right track ; that he is going to do much more than we could expect to be done in any other way by securing a classification board of this sort. </para>

            <para>- I should not, and I think I shall be able to persuade the Postmaster-General that he should not object. Practically there can be no doubt as to what the salary of the permanent head will be. He is not the man whose original classification is in danger. It is the civil servants of the smaller States of the Commonwealth who are in danger. If we leave them to the commissioner he will ascertain the salaries that are being paid to the various civil servants, and promptly grade them in respect of those salaries. That would be a grossly unfair way of carrying out the classification. </para>

            <para>- I am not attempting to throw any doubts upon the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the commissioner, but he will inevitably be induced to consider the classification in the light of existing salaries. Is. it not reasonable to argue that he will? He is certain to take up the list showing the salaries which the various officers are receiving, and he is sure to base his classification largely upon it. I want to lay stress upon this point, because if the commissioner leans towards that method he will do a great injustice to Western </para>

        <para>SenatorCLEMONS. - I do not expect for one moment that we shall be able to level up the payment of the civil servants in the worst paid State to the standard received by civil servants in the best paid State. If we were to do that the additional expense involved would be enormous, but that is the direction in which we ought to aim. It is for these reasons that I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has started on the right track in suggesting a classification board. The Postmaster-General has objected to the last part of this proposed new clause. I should have no objection to the clause being carried without that provision. It has only been inserted, I presume, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> thinks it is desirable ; not because he thinks it is absolutely necessary. It has nothing to do with the real object of his amendment. </para>

            <para>- I submit that it would not. We are asking for the appointment of a. temporary board for a special purpose- a board which will disappear as soon, as it has served one defined purpose, which, is the most important to existing civil servants that this Bill can contemplate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> says that the commissioner cannot possibly know the varying reasons which have led to one man in one State receiving a certain salary, and another man, doing exactly the same work in another State, getting a different salary. If we secure local assistance - the assistance of a man who knows the financial reasons that have compelled the Government of his particular State to pay their servants such, and such salaries - we shall be much more likely to secure justice under the original classification, which is of the greatest possible importance to all civil servants. I am not their special advocate, but from their point of view, classification is the most important provision in the Bill. Every civil servant is looking forward to equality of treatment, and unless we appoint a board which comprises local representation, we shall not secure that equality of treatment. We cannot expect the commissioner, taken from one particular State, to know all the reasons why the salaries in a certain State are too high, while in another they are confessedly too low. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will withdraw the last provision in the proposed new clause, I shall support him. </para>

          <para>- With much of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has said I am entirely in accord. I agree that it is the object of Parliament to see that civil servants throughout the Commonwealth obtain equality of treatment. It seems to me, however, that I cannot say of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> what he said of the honorable senator who preceded him - that, in endeavouring to effect this object, he has got on the right track. The main principle of his argument is that, in order to secure equality, it is necessary, in constituting the classification board, to pay primary regard to locality. He urges that we must have some one from each State on the board. In my opinion, that is the very thing which we must avoid, because the individuals from each State who constituted the classification board would, in discharging the duties that devolved upon them, have regard to their own particular experiences. That is one of the things which, I feel I can say with confidence, the civil servants in the State of Tasmania desire to avoid. Too much regard altogether has been paid by &#34; superior &#34; officers to their own local limited experiences, and although </para>

The honorable and learned senator has referred to the head of a certain department which has been transferred to the Commonwealth. Personally I have nothing to say against that officer nor against his administration, but I can say that he is not personally acquainted with many of the officers in the department of which he has had control, and that many of them do not even know him by sight. </para>

He has told us to-day that when he desired recently to obtain a marquee or a boiler, or something of the kind, from the Tasmanian branch of the Defence department, the officers there informed him that they would have to telegraph to the central authorities. He knows, as a former Premier of Tasmania, that the same statement applies to the limited territory of that State, where in the past the department has been centralized and controlled from Hobart. He knows that when in Launceston similar concessions have been required, personsthere have had to telegraph from thesouthern to the northern centre to secure it. We must have a degree of centralization. </para>

I contend that if that principle, which is contained in the clause, does this, we must admit that localism is inherently bad. In appointing a representative of eachState on the board, we would select some man because of the fact that he had been associated with the service of that State in the past. </para>

            <para>- If a man is to be selected who has not been connected with the service, the whole of the argument in favour of this amendment falls to the ground, because the very same work could be done by the inspectors provided for under the Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has suggested that the Premier of Tasmania might be selected as a member of the classification board. But kas the Premier of Tasmania nothing else to do than to look after the particular duties with which he would be invested under this provision ? He would have to attend to the ordinary functions attaching to his office, and with regard to the duties which would devolve upon him under this provision, he would simply take the reports of the departmental heads. So we would get back again to the departmental heads. It seems to me that the amendment, proposed by&#62; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> is aimed at the vital parts of the Bill. We have fought this matter out time after time, and after many hours the principle embodied in the Bill has received the approval of the committee. </para>

But upon what principle did the civil servants of the various States expect to obtain equality of treatment ? Was it by a reference to the reports of the heads of their various departments <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Are there not civil servants in every one of the States who have incurred the odium of the heads of their departments, or of intervening officers, and have not all these men expected to have their qualifications for the positions which they occupy recognised and estimated by an independent authority ? That is the position of the civil servants in the whole of the States. We know that favouritism and nepotism have prevailed in some of the States, and not always in the smaller States. As one who comes from one of the smaller States, I say it is not incumbent upon us to provide for a classification board, constituted of a representative from each of the States, in order to grade the public servants of the Commonwealth and say what salaries they are entitled to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has said that if the commissioner proceeds to do this work, he is almost certain to take up a list showing the present salaries of each officer, and to make his grading according to that.

          <para>- I cannot support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in his proposal, unless he eliminates from the Bill all reference to the commissioner and inspectors. I am not prepared to give the Government power to appoint these gentlemen and at the same time appoint a board to do a considerable portion of their work. Their salaries would be going on, and their most important work would be taken away from them and given to a board, the members of which would have to be paid. A grave objection to the proposal to appoint a board of heads of departments is, that for months and months they would betaken away from their proper duties in their various States, and located in some central part of Australia, to carry out this re-classification. The matter cannot be managed in that way. I object to boards all through. We have had experience of them, and, as a rule, they have worked very badly. I would sooner trust one smart intelligent man than any board to bring up a consistent scheme. My own idea is, that the Minister could go to work, and by means of the advice he would get from the heads of his department, could properly grade the service in a uniform way. </para>

        <para class="block">There is, in my opinion, no reason why the Minister for Customs, the Postmaster- General, and the Minister for Defence should not deal in this way with their own departments without going to this fearful expense of &#163;10,000 a year for a commissioner and inspectors, &#39; and also to the additional expense of &#163;50,000 a year, which is involved under this Bill, in the increases already agreed to in connexion with the Post and Telegraph department. I say that the heads of departments are the very last people in the world who should be called upon to classify the officers under them. In their own interests I , would never ask the heads of departments to do more than report to some one else, who would have to bear the responsibility&#39; . I would never place the head of a department in the position of having to make certain recommendations regarding the classification and salaries of officers under him. That would only create heart-burnings and trouble with officers, who might think that their claims had not been properly recognised. </para>

            <para>- The head of a department can report to the commissioner confidentially. If the Minister did this work, as I contend he should, the head of a department would report confidentially to him, and the Minister would take the responsibility of the decision. If the Minister will not take his proper work, and will shunt the responsibility on to a third person, the commissioner, these officers will report to the commissioner, and their reports will not be made public. It would be most objectionable to make such reports public, and such a thing has never been done in South Australia. The&#34; Treasurer of a State has sub-estimates furnished to him by the various heads of departments, but those sub-estimates are never printed or made public. A particular matter may be referred to when the Estimates are being considered by Parliament, but otherwise these sub-estimates are private as between the Ministry and the heads of the departments. I cannot agree with this proposal at all. I have expressed my opinion upon the Bill on previous occasions. I think now that the board, suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> would be a great mistake, and would especially be a great mistake, if heads of departments were to be appointed to it. </para>

I can see very little difference, and I am perfectly certain that there would be no difference in practice between a commissioner and six inspectors and a board composed of a  chairman  and six members. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> seems to assume that while the members of the board would have an intimate knowledge of the individual officers in their respective States, the inspectors would lack that knowledge.

            <para>- It might be, and I am quite certain that if the Government wish the Act to work satisfactorily they will endeavour to pick for the inspectors men of the same type as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> had in his mind when he urged the adoption of his new clause. In New South Wales we havehad some little experience, of the work of a public service board and the work of a classification board. I venture to say that if a poll had been taken a large majority of the public servants would have been in favour of entrusting their case to the Public Service Commissioners rather than to a departmental board which, on the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> should have an intimate knowledge of their individual capacity. I refer to a departmental board which was appointed in connexion with the Lands department. The officers of the department were considerably disturbed in mind as to its operations, yet every member of that board had an intimate knowledge of every officer in the department, and it was for that very reason they feared it. They recognized, and I think we must all recognize, that in working with other officers sooner or later prejudices or fancies are created. One of the advantages of the system in the Bill is that it would at any rate place the gentleman who had to report on any branch somewhat outside the service. A further advantage would be that he would be appointed for a definite term. He would not fall back into the ranks and work side by side with the men on whose capacity he had had to report. He would be given a sufficiently long term of office - seven years - to make himself practically independent of little prejudices which his report might create. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> urged as one ground why we should have a representative of each State that there are certain reasons in his own State which ought to be considered in determining the grading of various officers. He referred to the fact that because of financial considerations Tasmania is underpaying its public servants. Surely it would be competent for the public officers in Tasmania to bring that fact under the notice of the inspector if he did not know it, and through him underthe notice of the commissioner. It does appear to me that it is an argument quite un worth y of the time which was taken up in putting it before the committee, because the contention all through has been that there is no express machinery provided in the Bill by which officers as a body could put their case before the commissioner. There would be nothing to prevent them addressing a memorial to him on the discrepancies existing between the rates in the States, and the case having been explained it is hardly to be supposed that any commissioner would overlook that fact in grading the various officers. I do not wish to say that I approve of the principle of the provision in the Bill, but the only question is whether it should be superseded by the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline></para>

            <para>- I take it that the work of the commissioner will not be limited to the first grading. It should be his duty, if he takes the view of his responsibilities which I do, to be continually supervising and revising the work - to see whether, in the first grading, an injustice may not have been done to a competent officer, or whether some man who is incompetent or negligent has been overrated. I take it that that work will be a continual one. For that reason it is very much better to place the work of classification and grading in the hands of a permanent officer rather than place it first of all in the hands of a board, knowing that its work would have to be revised by the commissioner and inspectors. </para>

            <para>- By dealing with individual officers the commissioner could undo all that the board had done. Those sub-clauses refer to a readjustment of the internal work of a department. But by dealing with individual officers, and saying to one, &#34; You are entitled to promotion,&#34; and to another, &#34; We must lower your standing,&#34; they could undo all the work of the board. I believe that either the commissioner or the board would work in exactly the same way. The members of the board would certainly add to their personal knowledge by inquiries through the heads of departments or the sub-heads, possibly by visits of inspection to the various departments. Is not that exactly what an inspector would <inline font-style="italic">do?</inline> The only difference would be that the members of the board would meet together and confer. Surely the inspectors would have informal conferences ? The very first thing I should imagine them to do, as sensible men, would be to arrive at a common standard before they proceeded to report to the commissioner. That is a matter which can fairly be left to them. No argument has been advanced to show that there will be any practical difference in the working of the two systems. Therefore I deem it advisable to retain the provision in the Bill as it stands. </para>

          <para>- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out the common sense course which the commissioner and six inspectors will take to grade the civil service. It will give them an excellent idea of the general state of the service. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> proposal the work would be done by seven strangers possibly, who would never be heard of again so far as the civil service was concerned. The commissioner and the inspectors would then come in and take up the work of the board, quite ignorant of all the details, whereas if they had done the classification they would be thoroughly conversant with the whole of the civil service by the time it was completed. There is one feature which, I think, has not occurred to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> who is always very anxious to save money, and that is the cost of carrying out his plan. During the time, sir, you were in office here the Government brought in a Bill to appoint a classification board. It became law in December, 1S97, and a board was appointed consisting of a County Court Judge, whose salary was &#163;1,500 a year, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davidson,</inline> the Inspector-General of Works, whose salary was &#163;1,000 a year, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor,</inline> a citizen whose fees were &#163;3 3s. a sitting. Although the board did not sit all the time, yet two years and seven months elapsed before their report was handed in on the 31st July, 1900. I do not know what the total cost of that board was. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> scheme were adopted, and the work occupied only two years, what would it cost <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> A County Court Judge, who would have to be allowed reasonable expenses, would cost perhaps &#163;2,000 a year, and each of the others we might assume would get &#163;1,200 or &#163;1,500 a year. The total cost would be &#163;9,000 or &#163;.10,000 a year. As the board would have to travel all over the States, the chances are that its work would not be completed within a period of two years, because as a rule men do not hurry when they are getting good fees. It seems to me that the cost of the board would be a very large item. I recollect that when the Victorian service, consisting of 11,000 or 12,000 officers, was classified by the board, there were innumerable objections made to the classification and appeals to be heard and re-heard, until the thing seemed to be never ending. Agreatdeal of dissatisfaction arose in consequence of their recommendations. I shall have to vote for the Bill as it stands so far as this amendment is concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> idea is, I think, the proper one. If the commissioner and the inspectors are fit to control the public service afterwards, they are fit to classify it. I do not know who could be fitter. . </para>

          <para>- I think the Senate has reason to be grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> for moving this amendment, and opening up for debate again a subject which in many of its aspects cannot be debated too often. The object my honorable and learned friend has in view is as far as possible to secure an efficient public service. He has also another object in view, and that is to bring about an effective beginning for the public service, which will largely consist of officers transferred from the States to the Commonwealth service, and who will be graded according to the salaries they are paid, though to some extent by the measure of the quality of the officer and his ability to perform his work. To accomplish that my honorable and learned friend proposes an amendment which does not supersede the system which at present appears in the Bill, though it is an encroachment upon it. I am free to offer this criticism, because I intend to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> to withdraw his amendment, for reasons which I would suggest for his consideration. </para>

            <para>- I do not believe that the amendment would be improved by the striking out of the last paragraph, though it would be improved by amending it so as to make the powers of the Public Service Commissioner and the inspectors subject to the provisions <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> introduces with regard to the proposed classification board. Therefore, I think that his amendment has .to some extent been misunderstood. It does not supersede the system proposed by the Bill, and we are not debating the principle of the Bill, which is embodied in clause 5. The amendment encroaches upon it a little, but only to this extent - that my honorable a,nd learned friend says that it would be very much better for the Commonwealth service if the original grading, which will apply largely to officers transferred from the States, is intrusted to a board upon which there will be men representative of each of the States of the Commonwealth. That, I take it, is what his object is, and he has given a large number of reasons, into which I do not propose to enter, in support of the view he takes. The reasons he gives are founded upon the presumably greater need for a board of six local men, who will be familiar with the conditions of their particular States and with the public service in those States, who will be familiar with the salaries paid, with the local conditions which caused those salaries to be fixed, and with the work the officers have to do. I am bound to bear out - as I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> will bear out - what has been said in the course of the debate -. that not only in Tasmania, but in some of the other States as well, notably South Australia, owing to the stringency of the financial position, great reductions had to be made in the public service, until it came to be said in Parliament, and out of it, that the remuneration of the public service was being cut down to the bone. None of us, I think, are entitled to cast any reproach upon the States which, under the pressure of emergencies like that, were obliged to reduce their expenditure by reducing the salaries of their public servants. No one likes to do that kind of thing ; but sometimes even in one&#39;s private establishment and business one litis had, with great grief to one&#39;s self, and with great pity to those who have had to suffer, to cut down expenditure in that way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> launched his amendment based upon these reasons, which are very good and excellent reasons ; but it appears to me that there is another good reason for it that has, perhaps, to some ex-  tent been overlooked. We are at the beginning of a new era, a fresh dispensation. We are inaugurating a new public service for the Commonwealth, and it has to be manned from the public services of the States. Are we in this Bill going the right way to inspire confidence in the public servants with regard to transfers and regrading ? We ought, I am sure all honorable senators will agree, not only to secure if we can - and as I hope we shall do - an efficient public service for the Commonwealth, but to inspire confidence on the part of the State services in the board, or body of men, or commissioner, or inspectors, who have to arrange these transfers and to grade the Commonwealth service. </para>

            <para>- My honorable and learned friend does not imagine that I think the Government are not trying to do it. The question iswhich is the best way of accomplishing that object <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We have one way proposed in the Bill, and my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> proposes another way. I propose to state the reason why it appears to me that it would be unadvisable for him to press his amendment to a division.  His  desire is to give that confidence to the State services from which the Commonwealth service not only has to be recruited but to be manned, by se curing representation for each State on the board of classification. I understand that is the object. The answer made to that is. that that will be unadvisable, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> stated that what he contemplated was that these men should be the permanent heads of the various departments in the States ; and there is no doubt very great force in the objection taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> to a course of that kind that, by adopting it, we shall be placing the permanent head - who will not be the permanent head of the whole department but what is called in this Bill the chief officer, who will be always in a sense the permanent head in the State - if his recommendation came to be known, in a position which would be almost intolerable to him. Those .who were discontented would visit their resentment in some way or another upon him, possibly great irritation would be caused, and his official life would become very burdensome to him. Therefore I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that it would be unadvisable to have a man who was to retain office as local permanent head of a particular Commonwealth department in the invidious position of being a member of that board, and of making these recommendations. Of course that difficult}1&#39; and objection would be lessened by the fact that there were five others besides himself constituting the board, and therefore the blame would not so pointedly and individually be placed upon him at the hands of those discontented civil servants, as would be the case if he were the sole person to recommend. But at the same time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will see that that is a failobjection to taketo the proposed constitution of his board. But there is another objection which has been put with great clearness and force by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles.</inline> One of my strongest objections to this Bill altogether, is the enormous expense which it proposes needlessly to throw upon the Commonwealth. This mischievous system is going to cost the Commonwealth &#163;10,000 or &#163;12,000 a year unnecessarily. I am a constant and unchangeable believer in Ministerial responsibility to Parliament. Let us have the simplest form of Ministerial responsibility, which will be easy of correction in the Commonwealth Parliament. My objections to this Bill on that ground - and they are concurred in by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> - are as strong now as ever they were. But when we remember that the effect of this amendment would be to multiply that expenditure and to put into a state of suspended animation the commissioner and the six inspectors until the board reported, I am afraid that the proposed scheme would not be very workable. I am sorry it isso, and am exceedingly sorry to feel gravely oppressed by that objection ; because my sympathies are entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in his object. It is said that this amendment assails a vital principle of the Bill as we have passed it. If that be so I rejoice in it. If this so-called vital principle of the Bill can be assailed either in whole or in part effectively, and without following a course which will entail additional expense, I am ready to support it. Anything which will destroy what I believe to be a mischievous system in connexion with the control of the public service, I shall be glad to assist in. But this particular provision would, I am afraid, increase the expense without gaining for the service or the country very much benefit. The board would have to inform itself in very much the same way as the commissioner would have to inform himself; and I find that taking clauses 8 and 9 together it is the commissioner upon whom rests the immediate direct responsibility for the initial grading of the Commonwealth public service. There is also a provision in clause 10 which will enable him to summon witnesses, to take evidence, to investigate every matter that comes before him for decision ; and therefore he will have practically the same facilities for investigation, and possibly for a more or less satisfactory decision, as any board would have, unless it were constituted of men belonging to the local State services. To appointments of that kind the objection of my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> applies. I really see no difficulty - and I have listened attentively to what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> - which will inure for the benefit of the public service by means of this board, that may not with equal effect be arrived at under the scheme proposed in the Bill. Therefore, unless my honorable and learned friend can put forward some stronger reasons, I shall ask him to withdraw his amendment, and to seek the recommittal of clause 5, against which he fought so valiantly and persistently before. </para>

            <para>- Yes, let us have it over again ! Let us have it time after time, until we eliminate from the Bill what I believe we shall all regret if it is placed upon the statute-book as a measure for the control and government of the public service. I believe in Ministerial responsibility, and I dislike the provision for a commissioner and six inspectors, who cannot possibly be maintained by the Commonwealth at a cost of less than &#163;12,000, or perhaps &#163;15,000 a year. We are not in a position to warrant a cumbrous costly system of that kind. It is merely designed to lessen Ministerial responsibility, and to allow things to be done in the name of the commissioner in order to shelter the responsible Government of the day. Let the Government take the responsibility of grading the service, come down to Parliament, and face the criticism to which they may be subjected, in the open light of day. With our service covering comparatively few departments that is the course which we, having a patriotic interest in lessening expenditure, ought to adopt. I hope, therefore that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will not hesitate to maintain his principles by again opposing clause 5, and letting the committee consider the whole matter, instead of pressing the new clause which he has argued so ably, but which will probably fail to be any more effective than what remains in the Bill, while being open also to the objection as to expense. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will probably tell us what was the attitude of his government toward the civil service of Tasmania, but the persistent opposition shown by one of the representatives of that State towards this Bill, is only part and parcel of the treatment of the public service of Tasmania in the past. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> cannot get away from his old surroundings. He cannot get away from the old political ideas which influenced him when he was at the head of the Government of that State. I would appeal to him, seeing that he has been defeated by a fair vote of the committee, to refrain from using these obstructive tactics. He has told us that he wants to kill the Bill. He does not want the Public Service Bill, because he objects to the system of control proposed in it ; and he has been told by the leader of the Government that if we do not have this system we shall not have the Bill. I am going to support the system of control originally provided in the Bill, and I shall vote against the amendment. </para>

            <para>- That may or may not be. I want to accentuate the fact that each of the larger States have passed legislation dealing with their public service. Any man who has been in public life in the larger States knows well the reason for it. We found that our State services were being overburdened by political appointments made by one Ministry after another, and the burden became so great that the States themselves could not stand it any longer. I wish those honorable senators who talk about having the service of the Commonwealth under ministerial control to see how readily abuses can creep in. A Minister occupies his position by virtue of the support he receives from members. The members keep their positions by virtue of the support of their constituents. And what more ready means are there for a member to retain that support than by yielding to pressure by his constituents, to obtain billets for their friends ? He goes to the Minister, who is dependent upon him and other members for his position, and urges that certain appointments shall b3 made, with the result, finally, that because of the pressure the service becomes overmanned. </para>

            <para>- It- may have been unknown in the virtuous little State of South Australia, but I have been in the Parliament of the larger State of New South Wales, and have had an opportunity of seeing how the system of ministerial control works. There the railway service, for example, was looked upon as a department in which every deadbeat should be placed. The Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goodchap,</inline> stood out against the practice as strongly as he could, but he was overruled by the Minister of the day, who simply sent a note to him to appoint &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> &#34; or someone else to the position of porter or to some minor office of the kind. Once a man got his foot into the service it was impossible to get rid of him until drastic steps had to be taken. These remarks apply not only to the railway service, but to other departments in New South Wales, and Victoria has the same history. </para>

            <para>- So far as the public service of New South Wales was concerned, reports were presented to Parliament showing that it ought to be possible to effect savings in its administration amounting to &#163;200,000 a year. Commission after commission reported in that way, and eventually the legislature passed the Public Service Bill because of the abuses that had cropped up. If we do not take care we shall find the same abuses creeping into the Commonwealth service. In small States likes Tasmania or South Australia, where there is not a vast army of men employed in the service, the danger has not been so great as it is in connection with the service of a larger State. As time goes on we shall find our public service increasing in numbers. </para>

            <para>- There is a great tendency on the part of the average man to secure a position in the public service. He knows that he is certain of his position and of his pay in the service, and that the work is not always very hard. Be that as it may, we want to stop anything like this in the early stages of the Commonwealth, and it is to the credit of the Government that they have brought down a Bill to prevent these abuses taking a hold on the Commonwealth. I am very glad, therefore, to find that this has been done. Any attempt to destroy the Public Service Bill will receive my opposition, because I believe it is a step in the right direction, and because I believe the bulk of the States have proved the necessity for it. I do not want the Commonwealth to get head over heels in debt by having an over-manned public service, and to be compelled to dismiss a large number of men who have believed that they were likely to remain in the service for the rest of their days. The moment it becomes necessary to cut down the public service, however anxious we may be to avoid injustice, we may have to inflict injustice oh individuals in order to do justice to the people as a whole. I do not wish to see the Commonwealth driven into that position. These are the reasons wiry I oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> proposal. I believe that, if this Bill is honestly worked . by the commissioner, these six inspectors will occupy relatively the same position towards him as the body proposed to be appointed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> would occupy towards the Commonwealth or the Government of the day. With regard to the Bill abolishing Ministerial responsibility and placing the control of the service in the hands of some individual who would be responsible to no one, while it is necessary that the commissioner should have a strong position, I remind honorable senators that he will not be above Parliament. If he prostitutes his position and acts unfairly and unjustly Parliament will be there to deal with him, and there is a constitutional way of dealing with him. </para>

            <para>- If the Minister chooses to depart from it he will have to accept the whole of the responsibility himself and will not be able to shelter himself under the commissioner. If the commissioner goes astray it is true that special resolutions will require to be passed by Parliament to deal with him, but Parliament will have no difficulty in dealing with him if it is found that he is not acting fairly and justly, and even intelligently, in grading the public service. In my opinion it is far better in the interests of the community that we should have a Public Service Bill of this character. I would rather have seen three commissioners appointed, but as the Senate decided to accept the proposal for the appointment of one commissioner, I am prepared to stand loyally by that principle of the Bill, and I recognise with the Postmaster-General that to eliminate that principle would be to destroy the Bill absolutely. </para>

The same discussion cropped up again as the Bill was going through committee, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> now re-introduces the subject: After the decision upon clause 5, I said that it would be better to accept the principle of the Bill, and go through with it. Upon recommittal we can again consider clause 5, and strike it out. I shall do all I can to strike out clause 5, providing for the appointment of this commissioner and his inspectors ; but I shall reserve what I have to say upon that subject until the clause is recommitted. I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will now withdraw his amendment, and as we were only beaten by a majority of one in the decision upon clause 5, I hope we shall be able to reverse the decision then come to upon the recommittal of the clause. </para>

          <para>- I am grateful to my honorable and learned friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> for two reasons. First of all, for explaining in clear and terse language that almost every honorable senator who has spoken against my proposed clause has misunderstood the meaning of it. That is a fact. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> seems to think that I wish to supersede the Bill. I wish to do nothing of the kind. I am also grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> because he has suggested a course which I feel inclined to take. I listened with a great deal of attention to the practical speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> If the Bill is worked as he has suggested, it will, to some extent, meet my objection, and will practically give us what I want. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> however, that I do not think that inspectors were proposed in this Bill with any such idea as he has suggested. I have read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> very carefully, and Ifind that when Ministers in another place were twitted, as Ministers have been here, with the very great unnecessary expense involved, under this Bill, they at once withdrew from their position that six inspectors must necessarily be appointed, and they said that there might be one or two, or, at the outside, three. I repeat again, that if one inspector is to be appointed, as a permanent officer for Tasmania, at a high salary, for a number of years, it will be a piece of gross extravagance. I hope that six inspectors will not be appointed, but if they are, and they are allowed to take part in the classification which I wish to be performed by the temporary board I propose, I admit, that that would be a good way out of the difficulty. But what about the question of expense <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Under my proposal I would get the chief officers of each of the States to form a board, and would make them work for a month or six weeks during office hours without paying them anything extra, but if they had to work at night as well, and I think they should, to get this work of classification finished as soon as possible, they should be paid fees for their night sittings. </para>

            <para>- That is a strange objection from a Minister who the other evening told us that every man who had been twenty years in the service should get twelve months&#39; leave of absence on full pay. If a chief officer from each State could not be spared to meet here for five or six weeks to do this important work, we must have a very extraordinary service. We must  classify the public servants, and the sooner the work is done the better. It is idle for the Minister to tell me that he could find no civil servants to do it. My way would be to pay these men fees for night sittings only during the five or six weeks they would be engaged in the work, whereas the Government scheme involves the appointment of permanent inspectors who are to be continued year after year in receipt of a salary which will form part of this burden of &#163;10,000 a year. </para>

            <para>- Anything that might be considered reasonable for the work done during night sittings, but for work done during office hours I should pay them nothing beyond their ordinary salary. If they were asked to sit at night, as I think they should be, in order to get the work over in five or six weeks, I think they should be paid for the night-work, and should get their travelling expenses. I think I cannot do better now than withdraw the clause. I am very glad the debate has taken place, because I feel that some practical good may come of it. There must be great difficulty in carrying through this classification no matter who does it, and it is now quite likely that the inspectors will bear a part in the work which they would not have done had it not been for this discussion. Ithink there should beone inspector for New South Wales, another for Victoria, one for Queensland and Tasmania, and one for South Australia and Western Australia. That would be four, and the commissioner would make the fifth member of the board to carry out this re-classification. There is no provision in the Bill for it, but they will have to sit together. Under the Bill, no matter how much an inspector may know of the circumstances in the different States, he will have no vote whatever. All he has to do is to make a report, but I contend that the commissioner must sit hour after hour, and week after week with these men in order to get a proper classification of the public service. I now ask leave to withdraw my amendment, and I shall take an opportunity of securing, if possible, the recommittal of clause 5. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> has said, we were only beaten by a majority of one in dealing with it, and judging by the second reading speeches which were made, we should have been in a majority of two or three. </para>

        <para class="block">The necessity for the insertion of such a clause in a Public Service Bill must, I think, be obvious to every honorable senator who has noticed the awkward position in which civil servants find themselves during a general election. I have often thought it very humiliating to civil servants to find that, though they are allowed to interfere in other public questions, they are practically gagged at election times, and are prevented from giving expression to their opinions upon things political, just as if they were not enfranchised, and had no right as free men to give expression to any political aspirations they might have. That is a state of affairs which is not at all to the credit of a country of the freedom of which Australians are inclined to talk so much about. Every citizen of the Commonwealth, whether engaged by a private employer or by the Commonwealth Government, should have his full political rights accorded to him. When a civil servant gives service equivalent to the salary he receives, he should not be tied down and prevented from exercising his rights as a citizen any more than any other individual in the community? Under existing conditions, we find that civil servants dare not take any part in politics, and for what reason I do not know. I have never heard a sensible or logical reason given why a civil servant should not have as much political power as any other citizen in the community. For thereasons I have given, I submit the new clause which I have read. </para>

            <para>- Would it give satisfaction to the community to know that all telegrams concerning political matters were passing through the hands of a gentleman who was himself actively engaged in political work. I think it would be very unsatisfactory. Take it again on the pos tal side. We have before us a Bill which provides for voting by post. Is it desirable, if we are carrying on a system of voting by post, that the postmaster, who has the handling of those letters, should be the  president  of a political association which is pledged to support a certain candidate ? Would that give satisfaction to the community? I think not. Some remark has been made lately with regard to a regulation which is being drafted, and, which has been in force in some of the States, for the express purpose of providing that a man who is engaged in the very delicate work of receiving telegrams and sending them on to their destination shall not be engaged in mining speculations. That is generally considered a very wise provision. What we desiremore than anything in that department is to ensure the utmost confidence in the work to be performed for the public. I think it would tend to impair that confidence if it were known that the officers who were engaged in the work were actively concerned in politics. There never has been, I think, any attempt to debar any man from freely exercising his full political rights- that is always preserved and safeguarded ; but it is not considered desirable that those particular officers should be members of political associations. I hope the honorable senator will not press his amendment. </para>

            <para>- I do not say that they take any active part - openly at any rate - at elections. Many years ago our Railway department made a regulation forbidding any employe from taking part ill elections, and it comprised 12,000 persons, or nearly one half of the State servants. I called on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathieson,</inline> and whatever we think of his ability as a railway manager, there can be no question about his shrewdness, cleverness, and general knowledge. I laid the regulation before him and said- &#34; Are the men employed in this department allowed to take any part in elections, to join committees, or to make speeches ? My reading of the regulation is that they can, although your officers have time and again refused permission to the men to do so, and threatened them with dismissal if they did.&#34; He went away to consult with some of his officers, and returning to his room in a few minutes he said to me - &#34; Your reading is quite right. The meaning of the regulation is that the men shall not in office hours and on the premises of the Railway department hold meetings to discuss politics. So long as they are outside the railway fences and it is their own time we have nothing to do with them. All we have to do is to see that they do the work for which they are paid.&#34; Four years ago last September, when I was about to address the electors, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathieson</inline> said to me, &#34;In order to show you that I practise what I preach, I shall come down and take the chair for you if you like !&#34; I said, . &#34; For goodness sake do not do that or you will ruin my election.&#34; He did not understand as much about electioneering as I did. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathieson&#39;s</inline> ruling will be found recorded in the columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> for a reporter was present on the occasion. On that very evening railway men got on the platform with me, and ever so many of them made far better speeches than I could make: They helped me all they could, and have done so ever since. Whoever thought that any harm had arisen in consequence of their action ? They frequently take part in political contests. There is a good deal of nonsense in this cry that they will form large associations. There is a good deal ofdivision amongst public officers, just as there is amongst other classes. A man goes into the service of the State to do certain work at a certain salary, and, so long as he does his work, and conducts himself properly, I do not think the Government has a right to interfere with him when he is acting as a private citizen. That was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mathieson&#39;s</inline> view, and he acted up to it. </para>

          <para>- There is a great distinction between the proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie and the proposition which some honorable senators seem to be discussing. It appears to be thought by some honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie, in his amendment, asserts that Government employes should be at liberty to take an active part in elections. Whether that is his intention or not I do not know, but certainly it is not expressed in his new clause. In Western Australia many political associations have been formed in the departments by civil servants, who endeavour to get what they consider to be their rights by means of political influence - by returning to Parliament men who will assist them in that respect. </para>

But does any man say they have not a right to do so? By the same token, the men employed by the Government are entitled to take that course.

            <para>- That is so, and he is an employer of labour. I am an employer of labour and a servant of the public. There are many employers of labour who do not like the results of organisation on the part of their employe&#39;s. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> might not like the results of any organization, but that is not what we have to consider here. It seems to me that civil servants have just as much right to fight their battles in their own way as have any other citizens. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie will look at the Bill he will find that nowhere within its four corners is there any prohibition against civil servants in this respect. Perhaps the Government would have power to frame a regulation preventing a civil servant from taking part in any elections, or forming these associations. But when they do it will be time to attack the regulation. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie forces his amendment to a division, I shall vote with him, but I would ask him - is it not better to let well alone, to wait until the Government try to stop the civil servants from taking part in the politics of the community, and to deal with the regulation when it is laid before the Senate? </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator KEATING</inline>(Tasmania). - I was going to utter the sentiments which have been expressed by the last  speaker.  In his amendment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie tries to prevent the issue of a prohibition which is not contained in the Bill. I cannot help reechoing the sentiments which he expressed. If the Commonwealth takes into its employ men to discharge certain duties for certain remuneration, adequate or otherwise, but still agreed upon, I see no reason why they should be denied the right which an ordinary citizen in a free community possesses. Whether they choose to associate themselves with an organization which may be opposed to theGovernment or with an organization which may be in favour of the policy of the Government, I think, as citizens, they are entitled to exercise the privileges which are extended to those who are outside the civil service. I am entirely in accord with the principle of the amendment, but there is nothing in the Bill which denies to civil servants the right to band themselves together, to associate as members of a civil service association, or to join, one or other of the many political, or semi-political organizations, or the national, or semi-national associations which permeate the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- Notwithstanding the interjection of the Postmaster-General, he opposed the principle contained in the&#39; amendment when it was submitted, and he asked would anybody like a telegraph operator to be  president  of a political association. He knows that where such officers have been expressly or impliedly denied the right of banding themselves with any particular association, it is a matter of common experience for a candidate to come in contact with telegraph operators who he knows is directly opposed to him. Does he lose confidence in that man ? Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> think that these men are destitute of political opinion or, indeed, of honour. If he does, why do we give them the franchise ? If a man is capable of exercising his intelligence as a voter, then we must assume that he is capable of forming political opinions in an intelligent way. . Why should he not be allowed to associate with those others who hold similar political opinions? If you say that a man should not form political opinions of a distinctive character, but that he should go to the poll, you deny him perhaps seven-eighths of his citizenship, the right to come openly into contact with those who agree with him, and the right to come into contact with those who disagree with him, and endeavour to convert them to his views. The principle underlying the amendment is one which I think is entirely correct. If the honorable senator who is in charge of the amendment insists on endeavouring to get it incorporated in the Bill, so as to obviate the possibility of the Postmaster-General introducing in his regulations something which will carry out the principle to which he evidently gives his adhesion, I shall vote for it. </para>

            <para>- Some of them are more influential than presidents. I am not talking of societies which exist for the common purpose of securing the affirmation of political principles to which their members give their support, but of societies of a semi-political character, which to a certain extent are more influential in determining elections than other societies which are clearly and straightforwardly nothing less than political organizations. Will the PostmasterGeneral say that there are no operators who are associated with societies of that character ? . If civil servants are for or against a particular Government, or for or against a certain political candidate, let them say so. If, however, they are found departing from principles which are honorable, and which have prevailed throughout the service irrespective of their own political proclivities, then is the time for dismissal. Surely we are not going to deny to the officers of the &#39;service the right to have their own political opinions, when we do not take from them the right to vote and give expression to their political opinions at the ballotbox. Surely we shall not take from them a right which is absolutely co-ordinate with that right, namely, to associate with those who share their convictions, and in whose company they can give adequate and effective expression to the opinions they entertain. It is for these reasons that I am in favour of the amendment which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie, on principle, although I think it would be better for him to wait for any provision under the regulations which the Government are empowered to table under this measure. If such regulations contain a prohibition such ashe desires to prevent, he will be able to take exception to it ; but, if he presses his amendment, I must support it for the reasons I have stated. </para>

          <para>- There is this reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie should insist upon taking his amendment to a division - that we know that some permanent heads are a law unto themselves. Sometimes, when there are not certain provisions under Public Service Acts, these permanent heads lay down rules of conduct for their officers, and occasionally persecute those among their employe&#39;s who differ from them. The Postmaster-General knows of cases in the federal departments where employes have been forbidden to come together, not for political purposes, but in regard to their own interests in connexion with their own departments. </para>

            <para>- Thanks to the honorable and learned senator,not now ; but we may not always have a PostmasterGeneral broad minded enough to allow his -employes to band together for such purposes as will advance their common interests. We may . not always have a Minister enlightened enough to permit his employes to band together for political purposes. Therefore, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> has pointed out, although there is no prohibition in the present Bill there may be a prohibition on the part of a permanent head or a chief officer who may administer this measure. For those reasons it is advisable to state on the face of the Bill what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie has proposed. Even if the amendment is passed we shall not in any degree intensify the political opinions of the employes of any department. If a postmaster likes to take such a keen interest in politics as to become the  president  of a politicalassociation in his district, he ought not to be made less politically independent because of the absence of such a provision in the Public Service Act ; nor would its absence make him take a less keen interest in politics. Even if he were robbed of a certain amountof of his interest in politics the fact remains that every man ought to be interested in the politics of his country, and must in that respect be a political partisan to some extent. There are such partisans in the Postoffice now, and if they are allowed to combine,no harm will be done. Nor will their opinions become less virile if they are prevented from combining. For these reasons I trust that the amendment will be pressed so that civil servants may be able to express their political opinions collectively if they wish to do so, just as other citizens of the Commonwealth can do. </para>

            <para>- We have had cases in Western Australia of the Government prohibiting a number of public servants from joining an association to which the Government was hostile. I was astonished at the attitude of the Postmaster-General because he has always appeared to be most liberalminded in dealing with the public service. I remember that before Western Australia joined the Commonwealth a number of civil servants were prevented from forming associations, political or otherwise, and that on one occasion after they had had many wrongs inflicted upon them, and many of them had not had leave of absence for as long as five years, though they were living in the hot and dusty atmosphere of the gold-fields, they endeavoured to form an association to secure some redress. But before they had an opportunity of calling a second meeting they were scattered to the four quarters of Western Australia. That struck such terror into the hearts of the civil servants of that State that they were afraid to form associations in case they should be sent to way-back places. The </para>

        <para class="block">Postmaster-General may be in office for many years, but it is also possible that he may not. In the event of another Minister taking his place, associations might be prohibited unless there was a clause in the Public Service Bill permitting their formation. We do not prevent public servants from exercising the franchise. We allow every public servant the same voting power as an individual in. a private capacity. By giving that right we clearly say that civil servants have a right to take part in politics. That seems to presuppose the right to combine. If civil servants are subject to injustices in their departments there is nothing to prevent them from agreeing amongst themselves how they will vote. If they are not allowed to form political associations, they will do by stealth what they are not permitted to do openly and above board. I was surprised to hear the arguments adduced by the Postmaster-General. He said that if a postmaster were allowed to take part in politics he might be guilty of opening envelopes in order to see how voters by post exercise the franchise. If a postmaster can be trusted with envelopes containing large sums of money, surely he can be trusted with envelopes containing votes, which would be of no use to him if he opened them. Another plea brought forward was that it would be exceedingly dangerous for telegraph operators to form a political association, in case certain information which went through their hands as operators should leak out. Is not the PostmasterGeneral aware that in a town like Kalgoorlie telegrams are constantly being sent of such a character that, if an operator chose to walk across the street, he could often get hundreds of pounds from a broker for the information contained in them? When a mining manager wires to his directors in London about a strike which has occurred in their mine, or in regard to a find which has been made there, the telegraph operator who transmits the message might make use of the information, which would be worth hundreds of pounds to him. If an operator can be trusted with valuable secrets of that kind - and I honestly believe that he can - surely he is not going to reveal to his political association how a certain man voted. For the PostmasterGeneral to bring forward reasons like this against the formation of a political association shows the weakness of his case. </para>

            <para>- I see no reason why a telegraph operator or a postmaster should not, provided that he does not devote to the association any of the hours which he is supposed to give to the duties of his office. Surely the Postmaster-General will, admit that a civil servant can devote his evenings to political meetings, and that meetings of the kind will be held whether this amendment be passed or not ? The advantage of allowing such meetings to be held is that they are likely to be more above board than they would be if the officers of the service had to hold them by stealth. I hope that the Government will not raise any strenuous opposition to this proposal. The Government of Western Australia has allowed the railway employes of that State to form an association. They objected at first in a fatuous kind of way, but there was trouble immediately, with the result that the formation of the association was permitted, and everything is now working well.&#39; Looking at it from the point of view of the Postmaster-General I think it would be more dangerous to allow railway employes to form a political association than it would be to allow telegraph operators to do so, for the reason that if the former demanded an increase of wages, and were refused, they would simply call out their men and the whole railway system would be paralyzed. The system in Western Australia is of such importance that if railway communication with Kalgoorlie were stopped for a fortnight the people o.f that place would be starving. Surely when we have the instance I have quoted - and I dare say that instances which have occurred in other States might be referred to - the Government should not object to political associations being formed as proposed by this amendment. </para>

Every civil servant is the servant of the community, and should make no distinction between one party and another. A civil servant can vote as a citizen, but he cannot be a Member of Parliament. If honorable senators who support this proposal desire to be consistent they ought to allow civil servants to become eligible for election as Members of Parliament. </para>

Whoever heard of a civil servant in the mother country attending a public meeting and speaking on behalf of any party <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We are very young yet, and have much to learn. I am opposed to the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie. Some people are so afraid of losing votes that they will not speak their minds honestly. They are afraid that they will not get back to Parliament if they speak their minds. I want us to be honest, but we are not if we say one thing and mean another. I think the commissioner would be quite justified in expecting that an officer in the service, while having a right to exercise his vote, should not take part in party politics. </para>

            <para>- It may be fashionable to make statements of that kind amongst a certain crowd, but it is not so among those with whom I have been in the habit of associating. It seems to me that too often the man who kow-tows to the most ignorant is the man who succeeds. When a man accepts a certain position, he must accept the responsibilities of that position. I fail to see where the responsibility comes in if a civil servant is to be at liberty to do what he pleases in regard to political matters outside the particular duties assigned to him. To my own knowledge, when prominent officers in certain assurance offices have been foolish enough to take part in party politics, the directors have thought it desirable to give them a hint that they had gone outside their functions. It is intended that civil servants shall serve the whole community, and the whole community expects to be served by them. The PostmasterGeneral has shown the danger of allowing officers who have charge of secrets to take part in party politics, and, although I am sure they do not disclose office secrets, I hope the Government will use all their influence to cause the amendment to be rejected. </para>

          <para>- I was very interested in listening to the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker.</inline> While I think that I am honest, and while I certainly have no thought of my ultimate destination at the hands of the electors when I speak in the Senate, I am inclined to support the adoption of this clause. I am a free- trader, and 1 can see no distinction between the free interchange of commodities and the free interchange of thoughts; If a man is entitled to entertain certain views upon politics, I see no reason for disentitling him from becoming a member of a society where those views are freely expressed. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has lost sight of the very marked distinction that exists between liberty and propriety. It is one thing to say to a civil servant, &#34; You shall not join such an association,&#34; and quite another thing to say to him, &#34;You ought not, perhaps, to join it.&#34; When a gentleman becomes an employe of the Government his liberty of action or thought should be restrained iu no greater degree than if he were the employe of a private individual. There may be circumstances when it would be unbecoming and unwise, and when an employe would make a bad servant if he became a member of a political association, but I take it that as masters, in these circumstances, we should be at liberty to take that into account. I maintain now, however, and I hope I shall always maintain, that we ought to give no encouragement to legislation on the supposition of dishonesty or fraud. I was not in the chamber when the PostmasterGeneral spoke on this proposal, but from the observations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I understand that the honorable and learned senator pointed out some circumstances in which the temptation to defraud would be very strong on the part of an employe who was a member of an association of this kind. </para>

I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> was connected with a bank himself, and if he never had any ideas in connexion with politics, how did he get here ? He must, for many years, have had political intentions. I have known, even in the model State of South Australia, banking institutions whose authorities were prepared to allow their officers to do any thing they liked so long as they were assisting a certain conservative association to carry out its propaganda work, but as soon as they went in the direction of assisting any democratic institution they were told that it was improper, and that it was not right that officers of such an institution should take any part in politics. It was not a question of taking part in politics, but of the kind of politics in which they took part. </para>

Has any one ever objected to a public servant, whether a letter sorter, a telegraph operator, or a  Deputy  Postmaster becoming affiliated with a Young Men&#39;s Christian Association, with the Australian Natives or with any temperance society. Yet every one of these exercises a very great amount of influence so far as politics are concerned. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> seems to me to have adopted a tone which, with all respect to him, is altogether extravagant upon this question. It is assumed that those opposing the introduction of this clause are opposed to the civil servants belonging to political associations, and exercising the right of combination for political purposes, or exercising their right as citizens to influence elections. But nobody dreams for one moment of placing any obstacle of that kind in their way. There were times when a man who was a member of a public service found it very difficult, if not impossible, to give effect to his political opinions, but that kind of administration has gone for ever. In any Government which is carried on under the control of Parliament, under the eye of the press and the influence of public opinion, such administration can no longer exist, and can never return. What is the proof of it? That all through the States of Australia it is recognised now that men in the public service as elsewhere, whatever their position may be, have a right to combine for political purposes in political associations. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie wishes to go beyond that. He wishes to place on the face of this Bill a declaration that - </para>

        <para class="block">What is the meaning of that? I say that at the present time there is no necessity for it, if it is merely intended to give a public servant liberty to join political associations and act with them. But placed in the forefront of this Bill it is an intimation to every officer in charge of a department of the public service that every one of the employes has not only the right to belong to a political society, but may, as a civil servant, exercise that right in the most public way, it may be in the most indecent way, and it may be in the way  least consistent with his duty as a public servant, and his superior officer cannot interfere with him in any manner whatever. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> put the matter upon its proper ground when he said that the public servant is the servant of the whole community, and when in connexion, with the duties of his office he is dealing with communications passing between every member of the community and every class in the community, he ought not to be placed in such a position as to be tempted to do wrong, and to do an injustice to persons who do&#34; not happen to belong to the political party to which he belongs himself. </para>

            <para>- I do not think it requires much imagination on the part of any honorable senator to suppose that during the heat of an election there may be communications of a most important kind going through the telegraph office. It is quite true that that information goes through now, and that a telegraph operator may be a member of one of these political associations now, and may receive that information and communicate it ; but I remind honorable senators that at the present time, if a man is a member of a political association, he may attend its meetings and take part in its work, but undoubtedly he would not be allowed to take such a prominent part in its proceedings as to be identified with them as a high official of the association, in such a way as to  cause  the public to suspect his fairness in the carrying out of his public duty. That is the position at the present time, and is it to be continued ? At the present time the head of a department would not interfere with a man who was merely a member of an association, but I think he would undoubtedly interfere with a man who was the  president  of some political association which held public meetings, at which he denounced his political head in the most violent way. How is it possible to carry on the business of Government with any decency at all, or with any security to the public interests, if that kind of thing is to be allowed? Honorable senators who have spoken have appealed to the illustration of private employers. I should like to know what private employer would allow an employe associated in some intimate way with him, and carrying out important duties of a confidential nature, to occupy some public position in which night after night and day after day he denounced his employer ? I should like to see the kind of employer who would allow that sort of thing to be&#39; done. Where the employer is the whole community, and the employes are put in a position in which they must do their duty fairly to the whole community, why should we put a clause into this Public Service Bill which would enable any man, no matter how prominent a position he took in political movements, to defy his official head and say - &#34; What right have you to say that to me? My rights are absolutely preserved under this clause, and you have no right to interfere with me. 1 am acting in the position of your private secretary ; I see all your official and confidential correspondence; I know all that is being done in connexion with the work of political parties, and  every evening as the head of a political  institution, I denounce you and your Government.&#34; </para>

If he is not prepared to take up that position he has no right to be in the public service. I hope the day may be very far distant when it will be supposed to be the right thing for. any public servant to think that his liberty in regard to the discussion of public questions and public action in a prominent way is exactly on the same footing as that of a person who does not serve the public. I trust that the amendment will not be carried. Whether it is intended to be a placard, or in whatever way it is intended, I hope a majority of the committee will see that there would be a danger in its enactment, and that if we wish to have our public service preserved as a fair servant of the whole community, we shall have no such provision in the Bill. </para>

          <para>- I do not share the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> that there is anything to fear or dread from the enactment of this provision. It asserts the principle that no regulation which may be framed under the Act shall debar the citizens of the Commonwealth, who may be employed in the public service, from exercising to the full, not merely the right to vote, but the right to use the faculties with which Providence has endowed them. In this enlightened age we are told that something desperate is likely to happen if this principle is enacted. I always follow with the greatest possible interest anything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> says. As a rule he is broad minded, liberal, and democratic, but on. this occasion he has preached doctrines which are not very democratic, and which, if followed out to their logical conclusion, would restrain any employe from expressing his opinion. In fact, no man who held land from the Crown or from a private person would care to express an opinion on a public platform contrary to the view of the lessor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> says that there is no necessity for this amendment, inasmuch as there is no administration in Australia that debars a civil servant from exercising his full rights as a citizen. In Queensland to-day there is a regulation which has not met with the approval of Parliament, because it was never submitted, and it provides that a civil servant shall not take part in political matters except by recording his vote. Civil servants have not only been reprimanded, but in some instances a more extreme course was taken, because they had taken part in an ordinary meeting. </para>

            <para>- I could cite, a number of cases, but it is not wise to mention any names, because the men are still employed in the public service of the State. Again, in our Railway department, we have a regulation preventing the men from taking part in political matters, except by casting their votes. It is idle to say in this enlightened age that no administration in Australia debars persons from exercising their full political rights. They are debarred, and it is for the purpose of removing that barrier that this amendment is submitted. I have never yet been able to draw a distinction between a man who works for a private employer and a man who works for the Government. What is the difference between the two ? A man gives his services to the State for a certain remuneration, but has it any right to step in and say to him - &#34;In addition to the service you render, the right of free speech is denied to you, and your reasoning faculties are to rust.&#34; I have heard no argument to convince me that it was ever intended by the Creator that the best faculties with which a man is endowed shall lie dormant, that a puny man shall step in and dictate to his fellow men that those faculties shall not be used. For what reason? Because the servant may differ in political opinion from the head of the department or a Minister of the Crown. Surely that is a state of affairs which ought not to exist. Take the other argument which was advanced by the two Ministers - that it would be most dangerous to allow a telegraph operator to be  president  of an organisation. What is the difference between being a  president  of an organization and being a member of it ? The  president  is merely the official head of the body for the time being. Do not Ministers know that every one of these civil servants has some leaning or other, and if they are inclined to be dishonest, they will be dishonest whether they belong to an organization or not. In Queensland a large number of men occupy the position of station-master, telegraph operator, and postmaster. Many of these men are connected with the Railway Employes Association. This is purely a body for the purpose of advancing their interests so far as wages and hours of labour is concerned ; but the bulk of them have strong political leanings. Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> point to one instance in the keenly contested elections of late years when public opinion ran exceedingly high, where a postmaster or railway employe occupying that position was guilty of dishonorable conduct? </para>

I do not share the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> in that beautiful tory speech he delivered. He claims to b a whig, but I would advise him to read the language of Daniel O&#39;Connell respecting whigs. Certainly it was not very complimentary to the whigs, although it may be a little rough emanating from so great a man as O&#39;Connell. The question is - Shall civil servants be debarred from exercising to the full their faculties, not only by speech and by vote, but also by writing to the press ? I have no fear that civil servants, in using political power to advance their own interests, will take any step that is likely to be detrimental to the best interests of the Commonwealth. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie will press his amendment to a division. On more than one occasion in the Parliament of my own State I have brought forward an amendment similar in principle to this one, but perhaps a little more extended, for the purpose of protecting to the full the rights and liberties of the civil servants. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HARNEY</inline>(Western Australia). - I was very glad indeed to hear the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> and it did occur to me that they were somewhat similar to my own. The question we are discussingreally seems to be not one of principle, but whether the new clause would not prove a danger. The Bill in no way prevents public servants from joining these associations. If there were, even by remote insinuation, any such provision in the Bill I should oppose it. But as I said before there is a distinction to be drawn between liberty and propriety. I think there are many circumstances in which a public servant out of selfrespect ought not to join certain associations. And if he does, it ought to be in the power of his employers to say to him, &#34; Your service and your membership of this association so collide that both cannot be allowed to exist.&#34; If such a situation were to arise, and this provision were in the Act, it certainly does occur to me that it could be used with great force by the employe who was dismissed as grounding an action against the Government for so doing. If the Government in effect said, &#34; We dismiss you because, by reason of the association of which you are a member, it is impossible that you can be a good servant,&#34; he could go into court and parade this provision, and the Judge would have to ask himself, &#34; What was that provision put in the Act for ? The Act did not prevent the man from joining the association, therefore the provision is meaningless unless it was intended by the Legislature to be an encouragement to join any such association - unless it was intended by the Legislature that, whatever might be the inconvenience, the damage arising to the public by reason of the employe being a member of such and such an association, under no possible circumstances could it amount to a ground for dismissal.&#34; That would be the only reading given to the provision. I think that would be dangerous. While I am entirely in accord with everything which has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> and indeed whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> is also in accord with everything they have said, I think that the provision ought not to appear in the BilL If it is wanted for the purpose of enabling employes of the Government to join such associations, then let us put it in. But if it is not necessary for that purpose; why insert it, when by doing so we may give effect to what is not our intention, namely, an express declaration on the face of the statute that not only ought civil ser&#62;vants to be at liberty to join political associations, but that ib was our desire that they should be encouraged to join them, and that whatever the inconvenience arising from their joining might be, there would be no justification for the Government dismissing them. That would be the effect of- the amendment ; and therefore, while I. adhere to what I have said, I must vote against it. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON</inline>(Tasmania).- There are one or two points which have not already been mentioned, and which I should like to state to the committee. There are between a Minister and his officers certain confidential relations, and if Parliament declares in this Bill that it practically invites civil servants to join political associations it means, I suppose,, that civil servants may exercise their full rights by talcing part in private and platform discussions. That- is absolutely inconsistent with the confidential relations which must exist between a Minister and his officers. Suppose the time comes round when taxation has to be imposed. Every one is anxious to know what, the Government proposes to do. The Minister, of Customs sends- down to a clerk an intimation that he wants the statistics with regard to the importation of&#39; tea. There is nothing: in that, it may seem; but to the sharp business man it means a great deal. He will draw the inference that it means an extra duty on ten.. The Treasurer may send for the statistics with regard to the incomes of certain people. If that fact were divulged it would convey the information that in all probability the Treasurer intended to increase the income tax. Any information which a Minister asks for in that way is intended to be confidential. But if we invite officers of departments to join political associations they may make use of information received, not perhaps using it as a secret, but as a kind of every-day occurrence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> has put the .matter so well that I do not think any one can improve upon it, that civil servants are paid by the whole community, consisting of free-traders and. protectionists alike. What right have they then, to get up and advocate free-trade for all they are worth <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

            <para>- &#34;For doing their dutv ; and they draw their salaries from the whole of the taxpayers. They canvote just as they like, bub they ought not to take part in public discussions on matters of party politics. But. we are really making a great fuss about very little, because- no Minister in this country would be so tyrannical as to prevent civil servants -from holding meetings to say which candidate they would- support. Again and again civil servants do come together and resolve to. combine against a particular Ministry or to vote- for a particular candidate. This- is commonly done and is not interfered with. In England certain correspondence has lately been published showing that whilst certain trades unions do their duty well and protect the industry in- which their- members are concerned, there are others which exceed their duty and behave in the most tyrannical manner. We can understand that if we allow, civil, servants to form associations we shall presently have those associations determining that unless their members act in a certain way they shall be fined &#163;5. That kind of . thing .is quite common in. England amongst the trades unions. If the Bill permits civil servants to join associations we do not know what the rules of those associations may be. Therefore, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has pointed out, we have no right to say in this measure that officers of the service shall be allowed to join properly constituted associations. A society may be properly constituted so long as it behaves itself properly, but by means of its rules and its pamphlets- it may at a certain time behave most tyranically towards the publicand its own members, whom it may compel to do certain things against their own judgment. That lias happened again and again. Let . civil . servants . band., .together- and resolve to vote for whom they like,, but they should not be allowed to go on the platform and endeavour to override at night the policy which they forward in the day-time by the assistance they lend to the Minister. The thing is monstrous and altogether opposed to common sense. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DE</inline>LARGIE (Western Australia). - The argument has been used that if civil servants are given the privilege asked for in my amendment, a breach of confidence may take between masters and the officers of their department. I do not expect that anything of the kind willoccur. If our civil servants were so unreliable that political secrets could filter out of a department into the hands of the opponents of the Government, that would take place now. The very fact that there has been nothing of the sort in the past isthe best proof that our civil servants ore not anything of the kind ; and I am sure that if they got leave to go on the public platform and address meetings&#39; they would be quite as honorable in dealing with departmental business as they are at the present time. There is really nothing in the argument, which is very weak, and only shows, that the opponents of my amendment are very, hard pressed for reasons to advance against it. In my own State not many months ago there was a very bitter strike of railway servants. The Minister in charge of the Works department tried to foist as a condition of employment on the railway men that they should have no right to enter any trades union. The men come out in defence of their rights, and the result was one of the bitterest strikes that ever took place in that State. I am glad to say that eventually the civil servants came out on top, and to-day there ore no more active politicians in Western Australia than those very railway men. Yet we have the testimony of the Minister at the head of that department that the men carry out their duties in a very satisfactory way, and do not interfere, with thedepartment in any wrong manner. It is only right and proper that when civil servants are off duty&#39; they should have the same privileges of citizenship as are accorded to other workmen. I have yet to learn why a railwayman or a Customs officer or a postal official should not hove the same opportunity of exercising his rights of citizenship as a miner or a carpenter. If the public official is paid for eight hours&#39; work, he gives that service loyally to the Government, and that is all that the Government have the right to claim, from him. The other sixteen hours should be passed as he pleases. It is nothing, short of political tyranny to say to our public servants - &#34;You shall not interfere in politics.&#34; This is the very thing that time and again in every part of the world we have fought against, when employers have endeavoured to interfere with the political rights of their employes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> has referred to the position of affairs that would arise if public servants were permitted to take part in politics. He has asked what would be the position of a workman who denounced his employer out of business hours. </para>

        <para>SenatorDE LARGIE. - The emancipation of the workers has been a matter of slow growth, and this is another, step further in that direction. We can look back to the time when workers were looked upon as having no soul of their own. One of the old Greek philosophers - either Plato or Aristotle ;I do not remember which - said, that the workers of his day had only half a soul. The Postmaster-General and those who are supporting him in his objection to this, amendment, seem to share the opinion of that old philosopher. They say to the workers in the civil service -&#34; You have a right to vote, but you must not tell any one, about it.&#34; In other words they say that civil servants must, not express their thoughts. That is an intolerable state of affairs, and is certainly not in accordance with common sense and reason. The Government say to the civil servants - &#34; You have the right of citizenship, but at the same time we put a gag upon you.&#34; That is an illogical position, and one from which the Government should back down as quickly, as possible. I hope the committee will accept the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I do not doubt that they will always -prove trustworthy. What I lay stress on is not that any member of the service would prove untrustworthy, but that if the officers of the service were taking an active part in politics in a time of excitement it might impair public confidence in them. I think the committee must see that such would be the effect. If in the Postal department, or in the Telegraph department, men were to proclaim by the positions they had taken up that they were strong political partisans, it would tend to impair public confidence in them. </para>

            <para>- No. That brings me to the other point, to which I shall refer briefly, namely, that whereas the statement that charges of want of trustworthiness had been made are purely imaginary, so it is purely imaginary to suppose that officers of the public service have been prevented from exercising their right to become members of associations. No attempt has been made to prevent them, at all events since the establishment of the Commonwealth. No member of this Government has used his authority to prevent members of the service from joining associations. Then why not leave the matter as it stands? Regulations will have to be mode under this measure and laid on the table of both Houses. If any of those regulations are thought to be inadvisable it will be for Parliament to reject them. The regulation which &#39; has existed under some of the State Public Service Acts is to the effect that, whereas every political right is secured to officers of the public service^ and they can- express their views as freely as they like, they are not expected to take an active part in politics. That is a very proper regulation, and is probably the kind that would be made under this Bill. I do not think Parliament would object to a regulation of the kind. What is the use, therefore, of inserting this proposal ? Its effect, if it had any, would be to create in the minds of a number of civil servants a feeling that the statutory right to become members of a political association carried with it a statutory right to exercise all the powers and privileges of that association. </para>
