                    <para>- Before the business of the day is called on it may be convenient to the Senate if I state what course the Government intend to pursue with regard to the Customs Tariff Bill and the Excise Tariff Bill in committee. After the second reading of the Customs Tariff Bill is carried, about which, of course, there is no doubt, as I gather from the expressions of opinion in the Chamber, I shall ask the Senate to go into committee formally on that Bill. The second reading of the Excise Tariff Bill will then be moved, and after it is carried a motion will be made to refer that Bill to the, same committee as the Customs Tariff Bill. That course, as a matter of certainty, will enable the freest reference to be made to both Bills, but honorable senators who have moved in this matter will understand that, considering the terms of the Constitution, there will be no possibility of incorporating the provisions of one Bill with those of another. The Bills will be taken separately, and considered separately. </para>

                        <para>- I feel that the opportunity of speaking on this Bill is a great one. During the debate I have been much struck by one peculiar feature, which I think I am safe in saying has never occurred, at any rate to the same extent, in any such discussion in Australia before. Whether from the free-trade or from the protectionist side great attention has been paid by almost every speaker to the way in which the operation of the Tariff will affect the condition of the workers. Being here especially as a representative of the workers, I can only say that it is a matter of keen interest to me, and an aspect which I am glad to hear discussed. From a perusal of the debates I know that past Tariffs have been looked at and settled primarily in the interests of either the importers or the manufacturing class. I am glad to see that at this period of our history the effect of the Tariff on the workers is one of the most important phases of this debate. I feel that I am in a responsible position. While the labour party in the other House is equally divided on the fiscal question, eight members being on each side, the labour party in the Senate is not so equally divided. Owing to the other labour senator, who is a freetrader, being ill, the responsibility of putting forward the free-trade labour point of view rests upon myself, and knowing my own incapability I feel the great responsibility which is placed upon me of proving that free-trade can be of advantage to the workers of Australia. The position which the labour party in Western Australia took up at the time of the federal elections was that if our comrades in the other States were prepared to sink the fiscal issue, we were prepared to come into this Parliament as a party pledged to sink the fiscal issue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie and I were elected on the understanding that if the labour party in Parliament decided to sink the fiscal issue we were free to do so. But that position has not yet arisen, and consequently we are compelled to take sides. Although we were prepared to sink the fiscal issue, it was not because we had no fiscal opinions, and the electors of Western Australia when they returned me were not ignorant of my views. During the federal campaign, as a member of the federal league, I advocated Federation from the free-trade stand-point. In West Australia the federal issue was fought out very largely upon fiscal lines, and strange to say the protectionists opposed Federation on the ground that they would be swamped by the products of the cheap labour of Victoria. I clearly defined my position before the federal election, and my attitude has always been that of a free-trader. I am not a revenue tariffist. I am prepared to support straight-out free-trade, and to raise revenue by direct taxation. In the address delivered by me at the Perth Town Hall at the beginning of the campaign, I used these words - </para>

                            <para>- I believe they will. I have more hope from them than from the protectionists. I listened with great interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> appeal to us to accept the Tariff as it came from the House of Representatives. I must say that he made his appeal with very great force and ability, and that there was nothing in his speech which would arouse any resentment in the minds of those who hold opposite views. I have, however, to recognise that if we accept the principle of protection in a modified form, we shall be starting on a road that will lead eventually to high protective duties. No one who really believes in freetrade would be justified in accepting the present Tariff even as a compromise. Whilst there may be a majority of free-traders who believe that it is necessary to raise a certain amount of revenue, I judge from what I have heard during this debate that their efforts will be devoted to robbing the Tariff of much of its protective incidence, and in that I thoroughly agree with them. The only point of difference between the revenue tariffist and myself is, that they are not prepared to rob the Tariff of its revenue as well as of its protective incidence. I look to the people of Australia, when they are sufficiently educated on this question, to divest the Tariff of its revenue-producing incidence also, and judging from the attitude of the free-trade party in New South Wales, they are prepared to go a considerable length in that direction, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> remitted about 300,000 worth of customs duties, and imposed taxation to that amount on land values. </para>

                            <para>- In any case, I believe the land tax in New South Wales realizes about £300,000 per annum. There is another reason why, although I cannot obtain free-trade, I am still less able to support a protective policy. Holding the view that direct taxation affords the most equitable and wise means of raising revenue, I should be defeating my ultimate object by assisting to build up vested interests supported by bodies of workmen who would combine to clamour, not only for the continuance of protection, but for its increase in later years. That has been proved by Victorian experience. I think we should all remember that we were sent to this House primarily to represent the States. I am here to see that the interests of Western Australia as a State do not suffer, and I have to ask myself how a protective Tariff would benefit her. Iri order 'to answer this question, it is necessary that we should look at the position of that State as a trading country. In 1S91 the exports from Western Australia were valued at £S,515,623. Of this amount £S,154,21S was represented by the following products : - Gold, wool, timber, skins, pearls and pearl-shell, sandalwood, copper, and tin. The people engaged in producing these commodities would not receive the slightest benefit from a protectionist Tariff. Other commodities represented a value of £461,405, and it might be possible perhaps to confer some benefit upon those engaged in their production by means of a protectionist Tariff. In the year 1900, there were in Western Australia 40 industries, employing 5,259 persons, which would receive no benefit from a protective Tariff. There were eleven other industries, employing 5,327 persons, which might possibly be benefited by protection. I am speaking of town industries, and am not taking into account those engaged in mining or in the agricultural or pastoral industries. There are some thousands of persons engaged in the agricultural and pastoral industries, and 100,000 persons altogether, or fully one-half of the population, are directly supported by the mining industry. If we assume that half of the persons engaged in the industries that might be benefited by protection are heads of families, and allow five persons per family, we find that a total of 15,978 persons might have some benefit conferred upon them by a protective Tariff, whereas 184,022 persons would suffer. Of the 40 industries referred to many have grown up without the assistance of any protection. The machinery industry, which is by no means insignificant - because we have foundries in Western Australia which will compare with the best of those in the eastern States - has grown up under a 5 per cent. Tariff, which cannot by any stretch of imagination be called protective. A't Kalgoorlie we have a large foundry which employs a considerable number of hands, and which not only effects repairs, but does a good deal of constructive work. This establishment is being carried on successfully in spite of the fact that from 12s. to 15s. per day has to be paid to the workmen. In support of what I have stated as to the danger of building up vested interests under a protectionist policy, I might refer to a circumstance mentioned in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> a few days ago. Any workmen's association would support a proposal that the means of production and distribution should be in the hands of the people, that a system of State socialism should be carried into effect; but what happened when the Victorian Railway department put forward a proposal that rolling mills should be established in connexion with the railway workshops at Newport?

                            <para>- I do not say that they do ; but I am not a champion of the importers. A great deal has been said as to the condition of the industrial classes in different parts of the world, and attempts have been made by inference to draw the conclusion that because of protection in certain countries there is pauperism and poverty. On the other hand it has been urged that owing to freetrade there is pauperism and poverty in other countries. I recognise that in the instances I propose to refer to, these evils are not merely the result of protection, but arise from laws which penetrate more deeply than do those which relate to Tariffs. I recognise that the unequal distribution of wealth, and the unequal opportunities of acquiring wealth, have much to do with poverty, and I realize that this evil cannot be cured at the Custom-house. I regret very much that attempts have been made by some honorable senators, who ought to know better, to prove that if we only imposed customs duties we should insure prosperity and plenty for the workers. No matter what protective duties we may impose here, we shall not bring about prosperity unless our internal laws are good. Similarly, free-trade cannot' bring us success unless our internal and industrial laws are sound.

                        <para>While every observant person realizes the rapid concentration of wealth, it is not possible for them to point out the exact evidence of the fact. The census bulletins for 1900, just coming out, furnish proof of the position. The bulletins of labour and production so far out include the States of Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, Connecticut, Delaware, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Dakota., and West Virginia. In these States in 1890 the workers received an average of 400 dollars a year wages: in .1900 they received 397 dollars. But in 1890 they produced only 2,000 dollars a year per employe, while in 1900 they produced 2.540 dollars. This shows a decreasing wage, while the labour produced an increasing wealth. This shows concentration on one hand, and decreasing wage on the other. But this is the least of the matter. The values given are factory values. </para>

                    <para class="block">I ask my protectionist friends how they propose to cure that sort of thing ? They will not cure it by protection, but I believe that we can begin to cure it by free-trade. It is sometimes argued that the leaders of the workers in the old country are beginning to recognise that free-trade is the cause of the poverty which prevails there, and are consequently prepared to favour socialism. I am sure that all those who have studied the labour movement in Engment must recognise the service that has been rendered to that movement by the newspaper known as the <inline font-style="italic">Clarion.</inline> In an article which appears in that publication, from the pen of Robert Blatchford, entitled " The Wisdom of the Times," the writer, after dealing with the opposition of the tories to the social reform movement, says - </para>

No; by far the ugliest sign of the times is the fact that of late years two words which have for half a century been tabooed in British politics are now, after some whisperings and stealthy hintings beginning to be spoken trippingly on the tongue. These words are - "Protection" and "Conscription." They are words of abomination and desolation ; words that, being openly spoken, should be resented by the people as an insult to their understanding and a threat to their liberty. </para>

                        <para>In England, a patentee has to pay £99 for a fourteen years' patent, and even then gets no guarantee of validity. In America the patentee gets a seventeen years! patent for £7. In England, out of 56,000, more than 54,000 were voided, and less than 2,000 survived. In America there is no voiding. Consequently, the American firms have a choice of 32 patents to one which the British firms have. According to the American Patent Office report for 1897, the American patents had in seventeen years found employment for 1,776,152 persons, besides raising wages in many cases as much as 1 '73 per cent. </para>

                    <para>These are the lines upon which the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> declares that one can judge this question of fiscalism. Applying that judgment to the condition of Victorian industry in 1896, what is the verdict ? Did protection save the industries of Victoria then? I know that the reply will be - " What about the boom and the bank smash?" But what caused the bank smash and the inflation of land values in Victoria ? Undoubtedly, they were due to the operation of a fiscal policy which produced a feverish and unhealthy activity, which bled the country districts, and attracted the country producers to the city. It lured country producers into Melbourne, and thus gave an inflated value to land, which in turn produced the building boom. Then came the inevitable smash. Protection produced the feverish activity to which I have referred, and that activity resulted in the banking smash. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; and the argument is that a protective policy creates a diversity of employment, and enables the sons of the miner to secure work in other branches of industry. We have also to remember that by a protective tariff it is possible to injure existing industries. This fact is borne out by the first paragraph in the Factories Act Inquiry Board, which was appointed by the Victorian Parliament in 1S93. That document states- - </para>

                            <para>- They did increase the price, and that is why they injured certain industries. The imposition of high duties enhanced the price of the raw materials of those industries. For example, woollen manufactures, constitute the raw material of other industries, and by levying high duties upon those goods in order to benefit the woollen manufacturers, other industries will be injured. How can our protectionist friends prevent that <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> How can they say that any particular article in its finished state does not constitute the raw material of another industry <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> That is a difficulty which they cannot overcome, and that is why a protective policy handicaps and injures production. We have only to look to Victoria to find what has been the experience of protected industries here. In this connexion I should like to read a leading article directed against the free-trade party, which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 13th May, of the present year. But an admission is made, which I am very glad to hear, because it bears out a statement which free-traders have continually made during, the debate, but which has been denied by the protectionist party all along. Speaking of England, the article says- </para>

All the charge made in the article is that 25 per cent, are in a worse position than the workers in a protective country ; and I regard this as a splendid admission from the champion protectionist journal of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- But I believe that a change is coming over the workers of the metropolis. A significant fact is that 50 per cent, of the people in the coast towns of Western Australia are Victorians, and, except in isolate instances, protectionists cannot be found amongst them. That I attribute to the fact that once Victorians get away from the influence of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> into a country where there are not high protective duties, and find it possible to get higher wages and live better than they do in Melbourne, they realize that, after all, protective duties are not necessary. </para>

There are a number of other industries of which we find an equally bad record. This shows that the protectionist policy of Victoria totally failed to provide proper hours or remunerative wages for the employes. </para>

                            <para>- I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> may be able to prove that the report is untrue. It was only when the men woke up to the benefits of trades unionism and became organized that they were able to get anything like a living wage or decent hours. It is not protection, but trades unionism, that they have to thank for the improvement of their condition. Another significant fact is provided in the immigration returns of Western Australia. Previously the Government of that State published merely the immigration from the whole of the Australian States, but recently they have begun to give quarterly returns for each State. For the quarter ending 31st March, 1901, the total arrivals from the eastern States into Western Australia were 7,879, of whom 4,260 were from Victoria, and 853 from New South Wales. This means that 60 per cent, of this total immigration was from Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- The downfall of Victoria has been greatly minimized by the action of Victorians in Western Australia. From 1S91 to 1900, a period of ten years, there was sent through the Western Australian post-office to Victoria money-orders representing £1,589,541, not counting the shillings ; whereas in the same period the money sent in a similar way to New South Wales was only £794,770. That is, nearly twice as much was sent to Victoria as to New South Wales ; and that proves, if anything, that Victorians were the bulk of the population in Western Australia. </para>

It was the very success of protection which produced the reduced wages in the boot trade, because every journeyman operative was able to start for himself, and so increase the cut-throat competition. </para>

                            <para>- Some are still fighting, but I notice that many of the arguments which were used in past years have been thrown overboard as unworthy. There has now been adopted what is called the new system of protection - that is, a system under which protective duties must be accompanied by wages boards. But the Commonwealth Government or Parliament have no power to establish wages boards combined with protective duties. That is an impossible policy so far as this Parliament is concerned at the present time. Although in the State Parliament we could provide for wages boards and Arbitration Acts, it is impossible for this Parliament to enact that each of these duties shall be accompanied by a wages board. </para>

                            <para>- No. But a protective Tariff would affect only one State - and that is Victoria - so far as the starting of industries is concerned. I desire further to support what I said just now in regard to the leaders of the working classes in Great Britain. I do not claim that John Burns, Keir Hardie, and other labour leaders, advocate free-trade as a cure for the evils under which the workers of Great Britain suffer, but 1 contend that they are sufficiently intelligent, and sufficiently interested in the condition of the workers of Great Britain, to warrant the assertion that they have studied every known means of improving the condition of the working classes. I make bold to saT that these men have spent many hours in studying the fiscal question. If they were of opinion that protection would benefit the workers of Great Britain they would be foremost amongst the advocates of that policy.

              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Inskip</inline>comes to the same conclusion. Speaking with deference of his American brethren, he is nevertheless of opinion that " the workers in England are better off than the workmen in the United States, for, while the latter may earn more in actual cash, the purchasing capacity of their wages for the necessaries of life is less by comparison than the wages paid in England." </para>

                    <para class="block">That quotation has already been given during the debate, but I have again put it before the Senate, for the reason that when it was read on a former occasion some honorable senator said that John Burns was only in America for five minutes. That was a direct insult to the intelligence of John Burns, because he is not the man to form hasty conclusions. He is so levelheaded, and he feels so strongly his responsibility as a leader of the working classes of Great Britain that he would not make any hasty statement. I guarantee that when he made the statement to which I have just referred he was satisfied that he had .good justification for it. </para>

                            <para>- I explain it in this way : The United States of America is a new country and new areas are continually being opened up. It is an accepted fact that in a new country there is greater opportunity for a man to make what is called " a rise" ; and it is this which causes so many to go to America. It was the possibility of making a " rise " which caused the protected workers of Victoria to go to Western Australia. They were told of " So-and-So " who went to Coolgardie and came back " worth thousands," and they heard of somebody else who went to Perth, purchased building land and also caine back to Victoria " worth hundreds." Men desire to follow such examples. </para>

                            <para>- The statement has been made during the debate that there is one labour journal in Great Britain - <inline font-style="italic">Reynolds' Newspaper</inline> - which supports protection. I should be very surprised if that were the case. Here is an article from that journal referring to the " thin small voice of protection " - " But," says the protectionist, " we don't want to tax the British workman ; we propose the taxing of the foreigner." That is their first piece of humbug. How many times is it necessary to prove that a tax on competing imports is not paid by the foreign manufacturer or wheat-grower at all ? Suppose that £100 is the price of a certain amount of any commodity that is produced cheaper abroad - let it be silk, tin, wheat, books, toys, meat, or any other competing import. Assume, further, that the same class and quality of commodity cannot be sold at a profit by an English producer at less than £.1 .10. Our protectionist foes will advise a tax of .11 per cent. Then, of course, no one will buy from the foreigner. No one will pay him £111, when he can buy from an Englishman at £110. What is the result ? Instead of the cost being £100, it is £110, and £10 comes out of some one's pocket. Is it possible that any one can believe that the foreigner pays that £10? The £10 is obviously paid by the purchaser. If the purchaser is himself the consumer he is £.10 the poorer. If he buys to sell again, then the people at large - the ultimate consumers - pay the £10. </para>

We are supposed to believe that our gold and silver is departing from the country. The facts, however, prove that our stock of precious metals and our bonds have been increasing during the period of the enormous development of our imports. Then we know from this that we have not paid cash at all for the goods. We have paid in kind. In other words, we have exported things that we can make cheaply in exchange for the cheap products from abroad. </para>

                        <para>The one thing that is fatal to protection is the simple fact that if you begin it, you must go on with it. When you have taxed imported silk you will have to tax imported worsteds and so on. Thus, every workman and every workman's wife would soon feel the fearful hardships of a shrinkage in the purchasing power of the weekly wages. </para>

The article continues - The recent debates in the German Reichstag are full of this recognition. The German realizes that America wins by virtue of her superior methods. The manager of a tool shop in Berlin says that, apart from differences of wages, the American can turn out his product 2d per cent, more cheaply than the German. This is not because the A American workman toils longer hours than does his European brother. The difference arises mostly from the superior adaptability of the American, his readiness to use newer laboursaving processes, and his ability to get the best result from the machine which he is tending. It is due in part also to the superior efficiency of the American shop, the economy of arrangement by which handling of the article in the various processes of manufacture is reduced to a minimum, all delays are eliminated, and every one is kept constantly employed. It is upon these things, and not in cutting the workman down to a starvation state of living that the American relies for maintaining his supremacy. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say, but the list I have given shows the prices of ' various articles in London and in Paris,  I am not asserting that protection has made*the prices of these articles higher in Paris-. than they are in London. In referring to this quotation, I am only combating the statement that it costs the working man in England more for his living requirements than the worker in France has to pay. I am proving by these figures that the working man of England can purchase these goods for practically one-half the price at which they are obtainable by the working man in France, and that a French doctor mentions the under-feeding of the working men of Paris as one of the causes of the - extent of phthisis there. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator did not take the trouble to show us how it was becoming better, and the extracts I have read show the leakage of population which is going on from this State, and that people are still leaving Victoria at the rate of 5,000 per annum for Western Australia, while only 800 per annum are leaving New South Wales, where they have no wages boards. That does not appear to me to prove that the condition of things here is all right. </para>

                            <para>- I have here a statement showing the comparative progress in social reform amongst the workers of Great Britain as compared with the workers of' continental countries. First of all let us consider the number of men who are to be found in trades unions in the different countries. I have been associated with trades unions for a long time, and for most of that time as the secretary of a union, or as a member taking a leading part. I have always found that whenever there is depression, bad times and bad conditions existing, men are most dubious about joining unions. Just at the time they ought to join they are most backward iri joining. Why is that ? It is because they wish to be in a position to undercut their fellow men, and because they are afraid of their employers. If I can show that in Great Britain trades unionism and social reform are making greater strides than in continental countries it will, prove that the workers of Great Britain are in a more independent position, and less afraid of their employers, and have advanced further along the pathway of social reform. </para>

                            <para>- I think I shall show the honorable senator before I' have done that they need them very badly in the United States. From the <inline font-style="italic">Board qf Trade Journal and</inline><inline font-style="italic">Labour</inline><inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> of January, 1902,. dealing with changes of wages in England, I find that the net effect of all changes in 1901 was a fall of ls. 9d. per head, affecting 901,820 work-people, and involving a total sum of £78,516. This was for a year following a year of unusual industrial activity, and the decline was con fined entirely to mining and metal trades, but for the year 1900, 1,135,786 workpeople received an increase averaging 3s. 8^-d. per head, as the result of all changes in wages for that year. But if we compare 1896 with 1901 in the mining districts of England and Scotland, we find a net percentage of increase on the standard of 1896, ranging from 25 per cent. in Durham, to 56 per cent. in South Wales and Monmouthshire. That is a remarkable increase in so short a space of time. In the iron and steel trades in 1900 the total increase of wages over the standard of 1895 amounted to £33,420, or 8s. 4d. per head of those affected. In 1901, two-thirds of this increase was lost, but the total result is a substantial increase for the period indicated. Changes affecting 13,676 work-people were effected after strikes, and changes affecting888,144 without a strike. Taking a period of nine years - 1893 to 1901 inclusive - a gross gain in wages is shown to the extent of 9s. 2½d. per head, and a gross loss of 4s. 5d. per head, or a nett gain for all trades during that period of 4s. 9½d. per head. I have some information also with respect to changes in hours of labour, and I contend that any movement which reduces the hours of labour of workmen is of even greater benefit to them than a movement which increases their wages, because the mere increase of wages will not always improve the moral well-being of the worker, while a decrease of the hours of labour has a wonderful effect upon his moral well-being, as it secures for him better health and more time for study and recreation. </para>

                            <para>- I know if is ; but it makes no difference whether it is a Government or a private concern. I have quoted one of each, and still the honorable senator is not satisfied. On this question of the changes in the hours of labour, I find that in 1901 the number of people reported as having their hours of labour decreased was the smallest of any year since 1895. The total number was 24,759, of whom 24,176 had their hours decreased by 219 hours per week, while 573 had their hours increased by 1 69 hour per week, or a nett decrease of 2 09 hours. I again point out that this was in the year which followed a year of unusual industrial activity, and when we might have expected there would have been some reaction. There was, however, in that year, a nett increase in wages of 4s. 9½d. per head, and a decrease in the hours of labour of 209 hours per' week. Taking the period since 1893, I find there has been a steady, but sure, reduction of hours, ranging from 1896, when 108,271 persons had a reduction of 076 hours per week, or a total reduction of 78,533 hours, to 1900, when 57,726 persons obtained a reduction of 412 hours per week, or a total reduction of 238,043 hours. </para>

The changes in hours during 1900 were brought about as follows : - 1 1 per cent. by stoppage of , work; 2 per cent. by arbitration ; 1 per cent. by a conciliation board, and the remainder, involving 11,413 persons, without a strike, and by direct negotiation. Every person who has watched labour movements will admit that it is most easy to win a strike when the labour market is not glutted ; when the workers have a fair reserve capital behind them, and where there is not much poverty. On the other hand it is most difficult to win a strike, when the workers are sweated, are unemployed, poor, and oppressed. If the workers of Great Britain are poorer, and if they have less savings, as has been stated, than their continental brethren, they should lose more strikes than their continental brethren. But I find that it is not so. </para>

I have here a statement as regards employment, from which I find that in December, 1901, 4.6 per cent, of trades union members were unemployed in England ; and in November, 1900, 3'Sper cent.: and in December, 1900, 4 per cent. I again remind honorable senators that 1901 was a year following the year of greatest activity in the United Kingdom. In France, in December, 1901, the trades union returns show 10 per cent, unemployed for the same period as 4'6 per cent, in England ; and in November, 1901, 10'7 per cent., a slight increase. In Germany they do not compile the statistics in the same way, but they are still compiled in a manner which gives a good indication of the state of the labour market. I find that in Germany the average number of applications for employment for 100 situations was 240-6 in December, 1901. That is to say, that for every 100 persons advertised for, I presume through Government offices, there were 240 applicants. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly, that is so, but as I have said, I do not endeavour to make any comparison between the United Kingdom and Germany, for the reason that their figures are not compiled upon the same basis, but I do make a comparison between the free-trade United Kingdom and protectionist France, and free-trade England showed 4-6 per cent, of trade unionists unemployed, while protectionist France showed 10 per cent, unemployed. Let us look at the United States - that country where the employment is so permanent, and where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> interjects that they do not need trade unions. According to the Labour Bureau statistics in 1897 New York state had 976 trade unions with 151,206 members, of whom 18 per. cent, were idle in June. In the protected textile industry 38 per cent. of the employes were idle, and of the glassworkers, another protected industry, 34 per cent, were idle. In Connecticut, in November, 1898, 12 percent, of the trades unionists were unemployed. Ohio registered 26,457 unemployed. The state bureau at Rhode Island in 1898 reported that out of 253,485 persons of a working age 11,561 were unemployed. Now we come to the results of trade disputes, and the figures I am about to quote are taken from the British Board of Trade returns, published as the second abstract of foreign labour statistics. Taking the figures 'for Germany, for the period from 1892 to 1898- compiled by the official trade union organ - I find that the most favourable year for employes was 1896. Of the strikes in that year the employes won 48 per cent., the employers won 21 per cent., and 25 percent, were compromised. In 1894, which was an unfavourable year for the employes, they won 27 per cent., the employers won 38 per cent., 2S per cent, were compromised, and 5 per cent, were unfinished. Of the trade disputes in the United States from 1881 to six months of 1S94, 32 per cent, were won by the work people ; 55 per cent, were settled in favour of the employers ; and 1 2 per cent, were compromised. Of the trade disputes in France in 1890, the employers won 63 per cent.; the employes won only 11 per cent., and 23 per- cent, were compromised. In 1891 the employers won 29 per cent. ; the employes won 20 per cent., and 49 per cent, were compromised. The most unfavorable year for the employes between 1890 and 1899 was 1894, when they won 23 per cent., and the employers won 30 per cent., and 45 per cent, were compromised. These figures show that, at any rate, the workers of the United Kingdom have more than held their own as compared with the workers of European countries, that there has been a gradual and constant decrease of wages, and a gradual and continual reduction of hours of work, and that their position has been steadily but continually improving. In face of these facts it is idle to say that it is impossible to improve the condition of the workers under free- trade. What trades unionism has done in Great Britain it can do in Australia, and what the wages boards have done in protected Victoria, they could do in Australia, if it were a free-trade country. Regarding the question of pauperism, some comparisons have been made, which, on the face of them, appear to be unfavorable to Great Britain, but honorable senators who made those statements know very well that there is no country in the world which has such an efficient poor law, and such an efficient administration, which has the same facilities for keeping in touch with the poor, and preserving a record of all the assistance given to them, as has Great Britain.

                        <para>The annual report of the Local Government Board can hardly be described as light reading, but it contains information which should lighten the heart even of the most pessimistic person. . The report shows that in the last complete year the average pauperism in England and Wales was lower in proportion to the population than over it had been before. In the year 1849, which was the year of the repeal of the navigation laws, and may therefore fairly be described as the last year of the protectionist regime in England, the estimated number of paupers per theusand of the population was 02 7. The actual number was greater than this, because many parts of the country then made no returns. In the year ending Lady Day, moi, the corresponding number was 24 -3. What this enormous reduction means can best be seen from the further statement of the report, that if the rate of pauperism had been the same in 1901 as in .1849 the number of paupers now chargeable upon the rates would have been 2,012,809, instead of 781,298. Even these figures, however, do not tell the whole tale, for in the earlier period a very large proportion of the total number of paupers was made up of able-bodied men who were tumble to find work. Today the able-bodied paupers form a comparatively small percentage of the total number. It is the old people, feeble in body and feeble in mind, who now .fill the institutions - miscalled "workhouses" - where they receive comforts and attention that they could not secure for themselves, except at an altogether disproportionate cost, even if they had the means. The actual figures of the decline in able-bodied pauperism are even worth giving. In 1849 the average of able-bodied paupers was 13-2 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 2'S per 1,000 in the present year. Such figures as these are eloquent testimony to the remarkable growth in the wage-earning capacity of the working classes ; and, although there is plenty of room for improvement, we, at any rate, have the encouraging assurance that the great mass of the population has now reached a condition of comfort and prosperity higher than was ever known before. </para>

                    <para class="block">That shows that pauperism in England has been decreasing, but it cannot be compared with the pauperism in the United States, because there is no efficient registration of pauper statistics in that country. There is no poor law. The relief of pauperism is left entirely to private charity, and no statistics are kept. But, as I have been asked to give some particulars, I shall quote a comparative statement of the density of population in London and New York, which has some bearing on this subject, "because we know that where population is densest there paupers congregate. It is taken from a book entitled, <inline font-style="italic">Mow the Other Half Lives,</inline> by Jacob Riis. In the Tenth Ward of New York in . 1S90, he says, there were 334,080 persons per square mile, and the densest crowding of old London never exceeded 175,000 persons per square mile. That is to say, people are crowded in New York to nearly double the extent that they are in London. A description of the American worker is given by Paul de Rousiers in his <inline font-style="italic">American Life</inline> - a most instructive volume, written by one who made the subject almost a life-study, and translated by A. J.  Herbertson.  Speaking of the condition of the workers, he says, ' at page 206 - </para>

                        <para class="block">I defy any honorable senator to read anything that has been published as to the pauperism of London which will in any way compare with the account of the pauperism of New York that is given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pais</inline> in his book, <inline font-style="italic">How the Other Half Lives.</inline> He says that the destitution and misery and sweating are frightful. He gives a vivid description of life in the tenements, describing in particular one containing 35 families in Essex street. Two small rooms hold a family of father and mother, twelve children, and six boarders. He says the diseases these people suffer from are caused by want of suitable food and pure air. Sweating is carried on in these tenements. Children work as soon as they are old enough to draw a thread. Men and women work far into the night. Factory hands work at the factories all day, and then take work home to do at night in order to increase their scanty earnings. He describes a Sunday in a sweater's den. He found five men, one woman, two girls, and a boy hard at work in one small room, and says that work was going on throughout the tenement. He states that his experience convinced him that hundreds of men and women are every day starving to death in these tenements. There are 32,390 such buildings in New York, and in one quarter 13,220 of them contain nearly 500,000 inhabitants, In New York 17,000 persons annually were registered as paupers. One out of every ten that died was buried as a pauper. It might be said that this took place in the early days of New York, but he is speaking of the year 1889, and, moreover, he points out that as the population increases the state of things grows worse. The population of New York city was 1,206,299 in 1880, and 1,575,073 in 1889. In 1870, 468,492 persons lived in tenements, and 1,093,701 in 1888. Dealing with the number of persons living in a dwelling, which is a sure test of the pauperism of a city, he says that in 1880 there were 16-37 persons to a dwelling in New York, compared with 7 -9 persons in London ; that the death rate was 26-47 in New York in 1880, as against 21-3 in London in 1881 <inline font-style="italic">;</inline> while in 1889 it was 25-19 in New York, as against 17-4 in London. That is the legacy which industry has' left in America. It shows, at any rate, that protection alone is not going to benefit the position of the workers, that something more drastic than that is required. We are told that whilst this may be so, the effect of protection is to increase production. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> quoted <inline font-style="italic">Drifting</inline> to prove that the production of Great Britain was declining, whilst that of protectionist countries was increasing. I would ask, however, whether it is fair to institute a comparison in this respect between Great Britain and the United States <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> Let us look at some of the resources of the United States. The coal measures of Pittsburg extend uninterruptedly, with a varying thickness of from one to three yards, across a territory 226 miles long and 100 miles broad, and the deposits are especially easy to work. There is nothing in the United Kingdom that can compare with this, and this vast deposit of coal in itself gives the United States an immense advantage in manufacturing enterprises. Then again, Pittsburg also possesses natural gas which is conserved in the earth and is used for manufacturing purposes. It only needs to be tapped to be at once ready for use. Nothing of this kind exists in the United Kingdom, and thus the United States possesses an immense advantage which was not conferred by protection, but by the Creator. The Westinghouse Company alone distribute 400,000,000 cubic feet per day of this gas, which is used 'for driving machinery in connexion with all sorts of manufacturing concerns. Is it any wonder that a country with such vast natural resources available at such small cost should become a great manufacturing centre? The known coal-fields of the' United Kingdom have an area of only 9,000 miles. The total area of the United States is 3,603,884 square miles, and the area of Europe, exclusive of the United Kingdom, is 3,600,000 square miles. Therefore, the United States is equal in extent and natural resources, not to Great </para>

Again, America has immense rivers which afford her means of conveying her raw and manufactured products from place to place at very low cost. I venture to say that the cost of railway transit from some of the inland factories of Great Britain to the coast is greater than the charge of conveying goods on these river steamers from the interior of the United States to the ocean. Water haulage is the cheapest of . all, and the facilities America enjoys in connexion with her vast waterways in themselves give the United States a great advantage in her industrial operations. </para>

                        <para>- - Quite so. I admit that for the reasons I have stated it is also somewhat unfair to compare Victoria with New South Wales. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> would point out, however, that the larger area, unless it is combined with corresponding natural resources, does not confer any special advantage. The only reason why the greater area of the United States places her in a better position than Great Britain is that her larger territory abounds with vast natural resources. In New South Wales, however, a large portion of the interior is barren and of comparatively small value. </para>

                            <para>- I should not be prepared to admit that. There is something else also to be taken into account. What has given such an impetus to Western Australia but the discovery of gold ? There is nothing like a large gold production to attract capital to any country, and the goldfields of Western Australia are having that effect. What are the respective positions of Victoria and New South Wales in regard to gold production ? The gold produced in New South Wales up to the end of 1900 was valued at £48,730,533, whereas in Victoria it amounted to the huge sum of £257,376,448. The gold-fields of Victoria gave a great start to Victorian industry. They were the loadstone that attracted population and capital to Victoria in the early days, and they may be fairly set off against the large territory of New South Wales. I propose to make one comparison only between these States. In 1891 the population of New South Wales was 1,121,860, and in 1899 it had increased to 1,356,650. The population of Victoria in 1S91 was 1,133,266, and in 1900 1,180,807. </para>

                            <para>- I am giving the figures according to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> and I cannot undertake to check them. AVe see from these figures that New South Wales has gone on steadily increasing her population under free - trade, and that in eight years she overtook Victoria, notwithstanding the advantages which were supposed to flow from the protectionist policy in that State. The number of males between the ages of 20 and 60 in New South Wales in 1899 was 309,531, whereas Victoria had 297,839, or 11,692 less. This is a fair test of a nation's prosperity. The females in New South Wales numbered 231,302, and in Victoria 260,752. Therefore Victoria had an excess of females ' over New South Wales of 29,450. This proves that the wage-earners of Victoria had to leave that State and look for employment, leaving their female relatives behind them, whereas the wage-earners in New South Wales were able to remain there and earn sufficient to keep those dependent upon them. In a summary of the bread-winners of New South Wales and Victoria, given by <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan.,</inline> it is shown that in 1899 New South Wales had 128,206 primary producers, as compared with 123,996 in Victoria. Of distributors - middlemen, who live on the primary producers - New South Wales had 85,506, and Victoria 98,472. There were thus 5,202 primary producers in New South Wales in . excess of the number in Victoria, and there were 12,966 less distributors - parasites, as they are sometimes called. </para>

                            <para>- I have yet to learn that it is the fat animal that carries the greater number of parasites. It is generally supposed that unhealthy animals are more affected in that way. The imports of New South Wales in 1898 amounted to £18 6s. 5d. per head, whilst those of Victoria represented only £14 5s. lid. per head. The protectionists tell us that we need not trouble about imports, but that the export? are the true test of a nation's prosperity and that the aim of protection is to increase exports. Therefore, if there is anything in that argument, the exports from Victoria should be of higher value than those of New South Wales. We find, however, that in 1S98 the exports from New South Wales represented a value of £20 14s. 3d. per head, whilst those from Victoria were valued at only £13 10s. 7 1/2d. per head. Thus, the protectionist policy in Victoria has failed to realize one of the great fundamental requirements. I was very much struck with an article published in the <inline font-style="italic">Contemporary Review</inline> as to the present position of Germany, the country which we are told is going to wiDe out Great Britain in the race for industrial supremacy. I was so much impressed, with this article that I desired to read it a second time, but strange to say it disappeared from the Parliamentary Library, and I had to resort to the Public Library in order to find it. Perhaps it was part of the protectionist policy to remove the book, because it contained the most damaging statements as to the effect of protection in Germany. In this article on the industrial crisis in Germany, the author, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> M. Hodgson, after describing the feverish activity in German industrial life since 1871, says that the Paris Exhibition of 1900 witnessed the climax of Germany's industrial glory. He prefaces his remarks on the depression now existing there with the comment - "Life at high pressure is as unhealthy for the nation as for the. individual." He points out that the extraordinary confidence of previous years has been succeeded <inline font-style="italic">hy</inline> an all-pervading sense of mistrust and fear. The Germans attributed their condition to all sorts of outside influences, such as the South African war, for instance, but he points out that Great Britain, which had to bear the full force of that storm, had weathered it successfully. The writer says that one of the first causes of the depression is overproduction, and he points out that the syndicates of Germany contained all the inherent vices of the United States trusts, and did much to accentuate the depression, instancing the coal, coke, and iron syndicates forcing up the prices of the raw material of the manufacturers. The inference is that a protective policy enhanced prices in these particular lines, and that this reacted upon manufacturing industries by forcing up the price of raw material, thus accentuating the depression from which Germany is suffering. He further shows that the building trade was the first to feel the effects of the depression. Precisely the same thing that is happening in Germany occurred in Victoria. He estimates the number of unemployed in Germany at the present time at 500,000, and says - </para>

That is the opinion of a man who has evidently not committed himself upon the question of free-trade or protection, because the last statement is a very guarded one, although, from an impartial stand-point, it condemns the industrial system of Germany. I wish now to deal with the alleged growth of protectionist sentiment in England, which has caused so much jubilation in protectionist ranks in Victoria. We have been told that Great Britain is becoming a protectionist country. There are, however, some remarkable instances which do not seem to bear out that suggestion.

                            <para>- - -We are continually hearing that we have to face the cheap labour of Japan, and that unless we impose high protective duties we shall be swamped with the manufactures of that country. I want to be perfectly convinced that I am upon the right side. If it could be shown that under a revenue Tariff the cheap products of Japan would find their way into the Commonwealth, and make life impossible for the Australian workman unless he comes down to the level of the Japanese, I should say - ''By all means let us shut out Japanese goods." But I am not satisfied that a revenue Tariff will produce any such result. In this connexion I wish to give the position of coloured labour as compared with the white labour .of other countries. In 1898 the percentage of total imports into the Commonwealth was as follows : - From the United Kingdom 34.76 per cent., from the various Australian states and New Zealand 49'87 per cent., and from other countries 15-37 per cent. Therefore, compared with the inter-State trade, the trade with coloured and cheap labour countries aggregated only 15 per cent, of our .total imports. In 1900 the percentage of our imports from various countries was as follows: - United Kingdom, 36-63 per cent., inter-State 49-98 per cent., and other countries 20-39 per cent. These are the figures for the whole of the Commonwealth. I have also statistics showing how much of the products of coloured labour, as compared with the products of white labour, enter Australia. From the <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Register</inline> for February, 1902, I find that the total imports into Western Australia during 1900 represented a value of £5,962,174, of which £2,225,746 worth came from the United Kingdom, or about 50 per cent., whilst £2,743,502 worth came from the other Australian States, £279,593 from British possessions, and £713,337 from all other foreign countries. That was the result under a Tariff which we protect equally against Victoria, and China and Japan. <inline font-weight="bold">"'Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon. - What was the £713,337 made up of? </para>

Further, this £713,337 included all foreign countries, but of that total only £276,337 came from coloured-labour countries. If there was anything in the coloured-labour bogy, surely we ought to expect an increasing trade from coloured-labour countries ? That there is not an increasing trade cannot be due to want of communication. There is a regular fortnightly service between Western Australia and Singapore, besides sailing vessels which trade continually to Hong Kong, with occasional vessels to Japan. If there was any demand, those cheap-labour countries would be able to import largely and compete in the market against our own workmen. Of the total trade of Western Australia in 1900, 46 per cent, came from the Australian States, 12-4 per cent, from white-labour foreign countries, 3 7 "33 per cent, from the United Kingdom, and 4-61 per cent, from coloured-labour countries. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that question has been asked, because it is most easily answered. The question with which we are now dealing is one of trade, whereas that referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> is one of race deterioration. We may keep out coloured labour, while we admit the produce of that labour, without deteriorating in the slightest. Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> deteriorated by drinking Chinese tea or eating Indian rice <inline font-style="italic">1</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> would have deteriorated if ever since he came to Australia he had had to compete against Chinese labourers in this country, or if his forefathers had intermarried with coloured immigrants. There lies the difference between excluding the coloured labourer and admitting the coloured labourer's product. </para>

                            <para>- No; because when it comes to manufactured goods, the high-priced labour of Great Britain and Australia can beat cheap coloured labour every time. If that be not so, will some honorable senator explain the figures which I have quoted ? Why do the merchants of Western Australia buy goods in Australia, where they have to pay high prices, when they could go to Japan, where there is cheap labour, and buy them for half the amount ? Merchants always buy in the cheapest market, and it is because the Australian market is the cheapest that the eastern States get 46 per cent, of the trade with Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- There has not yet been a movement in that direction. Another stock argument of the protectionist is that it does not matter about paying a little more for our food, because we, as a consequence, get high wages. When I challenged <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> on this point, that gentleman admitted that protection does raise prices. But it is impossible to pin a protectionist down to this argument. One day he will say that protection does raise prices, and the next day he will tell a different audience that it does not. </para>

                            <para>- I shall give honorable senators the benefit of my experience in Western Australia, and at the same time remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> of the experience of his father and my father in Great Britain. Under the corn laws, food was dear in England ; but were .the workers' wages there high, or were they not at their lowest, during that period ? It was after the repeal of the corn laws, when food became cheap, that wages began to rise. I went to Kalgoorlie in the early days as a gold seeker ; and like many other unfortunates, I got hard up, and had to work at my own trade as carpenter. For some time I was paid £1 per day, and then wages dropped to 15s. But it cost me <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> a week to live at that time, whereas to-day, although exactly the same wage of 15s. per day is paid, a man can live' for 25s. per week in Kalgoorlie. Why has the decreased price of living not brought down wages ? I have given an Australian example and an English example ; and in Kalgoorlie the reason why wages have not decreased with the cost of living is supplied in trades unionism. I shall now turn from coloured labour countries to cheap-labour countries. We are told by protectionists that they would not object to free-trade if all countries had wages boards, and wages were brought up to the Victorian or the Australian standard. Under these circumstances it is said that free-trade would be fair and equitable, and we could then hope to compete with America, the idea being that it is only because of the low wages _ elsewhere that we are unable to hold our own without protection. But is it a fact that cheap wages mean cheap cost of production % All my inquiries and experience convince me to the contrary. ' For instance, the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> on the 8th March, 1902, contained the following - </para>

                        <para>American wages are on an average 40 per cent, higher than in England, but these initial disadvantages in any international struggle is more than counter-balanced by our use in shipbuilding, of superior- tools, and our employment of economical processes unknown abroad. As a consequence of this better equipment and organization we can build freight steamers as cheaply as British yards can turn out similar types with poorly-paid labour. </para>

                    <para class="block">That argument in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> altogether disposes of the idea that we cannot compete against low-wage countries. If further proof is desired, it can be found in an article written by the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, who in the <inline font-style="italic">North</inline><inline font-style="italic">American Review</inline> of September, 1 900, speaking on the exclusion of Chinese labour, said - </para>

                        <para>Chinese labour is not cheap - compared with the cost of American labour it is dear. The fact is, the amount of American labour is small, compared to coloured labour, for a given product. Take, for instance, the Soy Che cotton mills, in Shanghai. They run two shifts,, and employ 2,200 persons. A factory of the same capacity in New Jersey would employ 300 to 350 persons. In the engine-room of Soy Che 65 men are required. In an American mill their worK would be crone by two engineers, two helpers, and two foremen. </para>

Three armoured cruisers, of 13,000 tons, cost from £723,000 to £733,000 odd each to build in England, while similar vessels of 12,000 odd tons cost £1,169,000 each in France. That shows the fallacy of the idea that cheap wages mean cheap cost of production. </para>

                            <para>- These statistics were supplied by French officers for the Chamber of Deputies. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> wants statistics from a protectionist source, he can obtain them by applying at the Public Library for vol. I., 55th Congress, U.S., 3rd session, 1898-9. There can be found the results of an inquiry ordered by the department of Labour of the United States, as to the relative cost of the production of manufactured articles in England, Belgium, and the United States. The committee of inquiry were convinced that cheap wages do not mean cheap production. The United States wages were higher in nearly every instance, but the total cost of production was less than in the other countries ;. and the high-waged, intelligent labour of the American can more than successfully compete against the cheap labour of European countries. This result of a protectionist inquiry by a protectionist body should settle for ever the argument that we require protection against cheap-wage countries. It ought to show that if we pay our labourers well, and employ them during reasonable hours, their very intelligence will make them formidable competitors against the cheap labour of other countries, as long as that cheap labour remains in those countries. I admit that if that cheap labour and the conditions under which it works were brought here, the result would be to depreciate the intelligence and energy of our own workers ; their production would become dear, just as it has become costly in the countries in which low wages are paid.

I have been very much amused in watching the agitation which is being carried on in the Victorian press and by certain associations in Victoria against the wages boards of this State. The employers of Victoria request the working men to give them protection at the Custom-house, and, that achieved, they say to them - " While you see that we are protected at the Custom-house we practically must have free-trade in labour ; we must have labour at our mercy so that ve shall be able to take advantage of an overstocked labour market and pay lower wages." The manufacturers who have been thronging' the galleries of the Senate while the debate on the Tariff has been going on, are the very mcn who have set on foot the movement against the wages boards of Victoria. It is singular, to ray mind, that in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 27th February last, two statements which were in striking contrast to each other should have appeared side by side. In one column appeared a report of a meeting of employers and employes in the boot and shoe industry, which was held at Collingwood, to consider the protectionist Tariff then before another place. Strong resolutions were carried in favour of a high Tariff on boots and shoes, and the employers pointed out that they must have protection through the Custom-house if the boot and shoe industry of Victoria was to live.

                            <para>- I would point out to the honorable senator that freedom of contract is entirely different from freedom of trade. It is there that I differ entirely from the Manchester school of free -trade. The Manchester school carry their doctrine of <inline font-style="italic">laissez-faire</inline> not only into trade, but they believe also or they did in the early days - that there should be no interference between employers and employes. </para>

                            <para>- Advanced freetraders believe that it is possible to have wages boards, that it is possible to have highly-paid workers, and to employ them only during reasonable .hours, and yet to compete with the cheap labour of other countries. The experience of America has shown that it is possible to pay high wages, and, provided that the workers are intelligent, to compete against the cheap labour of other countries. It is because of that, fact that I can advocate consistently the establishment of wages boards in connexion with all our trades, and the passing of Arbitration Acts to settle industrial disputes, while I am prepared at the same time to admit manufactured products through the Custom-house free of duty. </para>

I have already trespassed on the patience of the Senate, but as bearing on the question of free-trade and protection, I wish to say that while recognising that free-trade will benefit the great primary industries of Australia on which we depend - and which are the head and bod}' of the Commonwealth - I consider that protection on the other hand would hamper those industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> said the other night that the Tariff passed by him in South Australia - in 1887, I think - resulted in agricultural implements becoming cheaper there ; that as a result of the Tariff, the implements manufactured locally were sold at lower rates than those demanded for imported articles.

                            <para>- I ask honorable senators what will be the result to the mining industry of Western Australia if the proposed duty on mining machinery is carried? If it is passed we shall compel the people of Western Australia practically to buy the mining machinery required by them within the Commonwealth ; we shall shut out from them the most up-to-date machinery in the world. It is said that the. mining machinery of the Common-, wealth is opened up to them ; but the manufacturers of mining machinery here have a very limited market, and they cannot avail themselves of the most up-to-date machines and methods in carrying out their work. We have to go to America, and to the countries where there is a great output, in order to obtain the most up-to-date machinery. What is the position of the mining industry in Western Australia? There we have a number of mines which are working and paying dividends, but there are a number of others which are carrying on operations, although they are not paying dividends, and indeed scarcely covering working expenses. Are they likely to continue doing so very long ? If they do not begin to pay dividends shortly, will not the shareholders say that it is- time to suspend operations ? There are also a number of mines there which have an abundance of low-grade ore - " half-ounce mines " they are called - and which, if we could cheapen the work of production, would employ thousands of hands. Then, shall we act in the interests of Western Australia if we increase the cost of mining machinery ? Shall we benefit the mining industry of Australia generally by imposing a duty of 15 per cent, on this class of machinery, thus compelling those engaged in it to adopt older methods in milling their minerals, and shutting them out from all the latest and most improved machinery of America ? Is that the way to foster the industry ? Are we going to benefit the agricultural industry by excluding those engaged in it from the latest methods of harvesting ? Changes are not made very quickly in agricultural machinery, but great improvements in the methods of agriculture have taken place during the last few years. The seed-drill, the" new American method, has ousted the seed-sower, which was the old Australian method. </para>

                            <para>- That shows that new machinery can be invented in a freetrade country. If we hamper these industries - if we injure the mining and agricultural industries - we shall do injury to every manufacturing industry. What was the use of the manufacturing industries of South Australia when the depression came? What was the use of the factories in Melbourne when the depression took place here ? Eventually it was recognised in Victoria that the people must be induced to produce more wheat and fruit and other natural products ; that it was only by increasing the export of butter from this State, and by inducing the people to go on the land that the factories of Melbourne could be benefited. They realised that it was in this way alone that they could be helped, and not by being pampered at the expense of the country. They recognised that it was only by giving the farmers liberal freights and helping them in every way to produce that-- </para>

                            <para>- A protectionist member of another place said while the Tariff was being discussed that the Tariff should not be decreased further, otherwise the country would have to resort to direct taxation. That is behind many of the protectionist proposals. If I were to vote for a protective duty, I should vote for a duty which would bring into existence a number of people who would clamour for its retention. But if I vote for a revenue duty, I shall bring into existence a clamour for its removal. People are always anxious to remove taxation, but when we have taxation with a protectionist incidence there are many moneyed people ready to clamour for its continuance. I believe that the question of direct taxation should not be lost sight of. Of course, as a reasonable man, I must recognise that it is not feasible with the present Parliament, or with the present Government, but it would be well if the manufacturers and the farmers could see , that it would be far better for them if we had a free port, and raised all the revenue required by means of direct taxation. I believe that if the revenue were raised in that way it would be good for the country, because direct taxation is not only a good thing as a revenue producer, but it has a wonderful effect on the productive industries ' of a country. A land value tax in Great Britain would do away with much of the poverty of that country, and it would solve the agricultural problem of Great Britain. A. land value tax in America would do away with much of the poverty there, and would solve the agricultural problem there also. What would happen there would happen here, and I hope the time will come-when the people of Australia will face . this question boldly. ' </para>

                            <para>- This customs taxation presses more heavily on the farmer than any taxation they have in South Australia. This taxation will extort more from the farmer than any land value tax in Australia. A land value tax falls not upon the farmer's land, but upon the valuable city land. It is from the valuable city land that the bulk of- the revenue from a land value tax is collected. From whom will this taxation be collected <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Not from the rich owner of land in Collins-street. He may be in England or on the Continent, drawing great rents from land values here, and he will not be taxed to the extent of Id. by this customs taxation. But the farmer, workman, miner, and producer of every class must pay the taxation collected under this Tariff. I contend it is time that the people of Australia grappled with this question of direct taxation, and in all friendliness I warn my honorable friends of the free-trade party that in voting even for a revenue Tariff they must give some protective incidence, and by so doing they will be sowing the seeds of a protective policy. We know that protection grows upon that upon which it feeds, and if they allow 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, duties to remain in the Tariff they will create a demand for increased protection which will rise up against them at the next election. I contend that the safer policy for the freetrade party to adopt is that which was adopted 'in New South Wales, where even revenue duties were dropped, and they adopted direct taxation. I know very well that my free-trade friends are not prepared to do that. I know that they do not accept responsibility for the words I am uttering now. </para>

I am only sorry that there is not a greater number of free-traders prepared to go to the logical conclusion of free-trade, and that is direct taxation.

                            <para>- I have heard what I think was a very good explanation of that. The proposition is this : If we put a 10 per cent, duty on goods the trade between foreign countries .and Australia - and Great Britain and Australia, we will say - will be equal ; but if we raise that duty to 20 per cent, the trade with foreign countries will fall off, and the trade with Great Britain will increase. That, I think, is the proposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> quoted some statistics which seemed to bear out his contention. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator stated the facts and drew no inference from them, but I have said I have seen the inference stated, and I merely adopt it. The reason is that owing to the fact that Great Britain is a free-trade country, it can better overcome the obstacle of Tariff protection than can the .protected countries of the world. When we increase the protective Tariff around Australia we stop trade with foreign countries and increase trade with Great Britain, because Great Britain, owing to her free-trade policy, is in a better position to compete for the trade than are the foreign protected countries. If, however, that be correct, it should show that a free-trade country is in a better position . to produce and manufacture than is a protectionist country. If the effect of the free-trade policy of Great Britain is to make her better able to send her products here, notwithstanding our wall of protection, than are foreign countries that have protective Tariffs, that is a splendid argument why- </para>

                            <para>- It is a splendid argument why we also should adopt a freetrade policy. Because if her free-trade policy benefits Great Britain in that way it is only reasonable to assume that it would similarly benefit Australia. I must admit that the figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> give food for thought, and it is not wise to form a hasty judgment upon them. I do not wish in any way to say that what I have stated is the final conclusion I should draw from them. The subject is one well worthy of study, especially in view of the agitation going on in the old country for Imperial federation, and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> deserves the thanks of the Senate for having brought the matter before us. I desire to thank honora'ble senators very much for the patient hearing they have given me. </para>

Various arguments have been used, and the extreme free-traders, it seems to me, are taking up a most anomalous position. They do not profess to. advocate free-trade, or if they do they have not the courage of their opinions. We all know that so far as that is concerned, this discussion is a perfect sham, and there is no sincerity or truth in it. </para>

                            <para>- I said the discussion is a sham, and I made no personal allusion to any member of the Senate. I said the discussion is a sham, and I repeat it. That being so what is the use of our wasting our time making comparisons between New South Wales and Victoria, and between Victoria and some other part of the earth ? Unless the conditions are similar there is no use in making any comparisons whatever. I have heard a great deal about the intense prosperity of New South Wales. But I am an old enough colonist to remember when freetrade did not find favour in New South Wales. I remember the time when we were paying £50,000 a year to have freetrade on: the Murray. Our New South Wales" Mends were not prepared to continue that bargain, but asked the Government of this State to pay £100,000 a year in order to keep free-trade on the Murray, and because we would not do that, Customhouses were established there. That proves, if it proves anything, that New South Wales saw the error of her ways, and was coming round to the adoption of a more advanced and intelligent policy. However, the comparison between New South Wales and Victoria should afford men of observant minds with some food for reflection. Let any honorable senator go to Sydney now, and witness the reckless extravagance which is going on all over that city, and tell me whether it it is not a great factor in the apparent prosperity of that city. When I was in Sydney last Easter, I read a letter in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> pointing out that the Government of New South Wales were actually concreting the bed of the River Parramatta, and they called that a reproductive work J If that is the way in which the prosperity of the great free-trade State is brought about, I much prefer the benighted condition in which we are in Victoria at the present time. We have had many arguments founded upon what we have been told is being done in England, America, and Germany. I ask honorable senators to look at what is being done in those countries, and they can have no doubt that the prosperity of England as a great free-trade country is due to the fact that she has an abundance of labour and an immense quantity of raw material ; ironstone, lime, and all the different products that go to make great national wealth. That is the secret of the prosperity of the old country. But let us be fair in discussing this matter, and see what America has done.. Let us remember that America began her course under somewhat similar conditions to those which exist in Australia, and let us see what she has worked herself up to at the present day. Let us look at the imports we get from America, and there is no honorable senator present but must acknowledge the enormous strides which America has made in mechanical and industrial progress. She is the wonder of the world, and has proved at all events that her protective policy has not been so detrimental to her advance as some honorable senators would have us believe. I ask honorable senators to admit in all fairness that if they go into any ironmonger's store here they will find that the best tools supplied are of American manufacture. The most expert men will admit this. I might mention, amongst other products of American skill, axes, locks, hammers, workmen's tools generally, domestic appliances, hinges,&amp;c, and railway bridges. The honorable the President will know that in his own State, between Adelaide and the Murray-bridge, there are some instances of American construction which show the great advance that country has made in railway bridge work. When we had to deal only with the engineers of the old country, some four or five tons of material were used where, on American plans, only one ton is necessary. That is an evidence of the intelligence of American workmen, and it does not show that the protective Tariff of America has been the bane and drawback to that country which some honorable senators wish us to believe. </para>

                            <para>- I am trying to show the honorable and learned senator what the imposition of a tax has done for America. It has developed these manufactures, and the industrial spirit of America, which is to-day one of the most highly-developed and most prosperous countries on the face of the earth. In addition to this, what has been done in the way of buggies? I would ask honorable senators if they do not know that in the old country it was about as much as a horse could do to draw an empty English coach, and with the invention of the American buggy, we find that a horse can draw two, three, and four men as well as the carriage. Does that not show the great advance which has been made? Look at the coaches which we had on the gold-fields in the early days; they were introduced from America, and we had American harness, cheaper springs, and a multitude of other things connected with manufactures. Then again, look at the stoves, lamps, radiators, and fuel savers, all of American origin. They show the greatest amount of research and development. Then we have reapers and binders, light ploughs, and agricultural machines. They, perhaps, did not originate in America, but they have been very greatly improved and cheapened by American manufacturers. In the matter of electrical science and the development of electrical machines, I ask honorable senators to consider what the Americans have done. Last, and not least, has not the old country prided herself in being the foremost country in nil the world in the construction of ships. Yet a yacht of English construction has been beaten by an American yacht recently, showing that, at all events, the American Tariff has not been of such a prejudicial character as to prevent the highest development of a mercantile marine. We have heard a good deal to the effect that trade is not carried on to such great advantage in the United States as in the old country. What do American statistics show us ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Austin,</inline> who is one of the leading officers in the United States Treasury, made, on behalf of his Government, a return for the year 1890, in which he gave some striking statistics, which I think honorable senators should consider 4for a moment. He commenced by stating that whereas in 1850 the population of America was 23,191,876, in 1900 it had grown to 76,303,387. I take it that if this was such a poor country as' some honorable senators desire to prove it to be, the population would not have increased to this great extent. Take the railways in the United States. The mileage increased from 9,021 miles in 1850 to 190,833 miles in 1900. Of wheat, 100,485,944 bushels were grown in 1S50, and 522,229,505 bushels in 1900. That does not look as if this industry were going back. It shows, at all events, that the protective Tariff has not been detrimental to the production of wheat. The cotton crop has increased from 987,561,586 lbs. in 1850 to 4,757,062,942 lbs. in 1900, or nearly 500 per cent. That is a most wonderful instance of the vitality of American production. Let us see how America competes with the old country in her staple industries - pig-iron and steel. Not. very many years ago Great Britain had practically a monopoly of steel-making, but American products are taking the place of English ones all over the world. Whether that has been through over-production in America I leave economists to consider and decide. At all events this broad fact remains, that the American steel industry has been developed to an extent which is practically incredible. Of pig-iron alone in 1850 she made 563,755 tons, and in 1900, 13,789,24.2 tons. The production has increased 24 times - or 2,400 per cent. - in 50 years. The production of steel has increased from 6,078 tons ia 1850 to 10,639,857 tons in 1900. These are most wonderful instances of the enterprise and development of the United States. It shows, to me at all events, that the Tariff which many persons think has been such a great detriment to the country has been of the greatest possible service. Again, the imports of iron and steel increased from £3.533,079 in 1850 to £4,095,746 in 1900, while the exports increased from £382,264 in 1850 to £24,382,749 in 1900. By 63 times, or 6,300 per cent., the export trade increased in 50 years. Can any other nation show such a record <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We must bear in mind that America is a young country like Australia. It started from small beginnings, and its inhabitants have worked up this extraordinary record and produced results which are not to be paralleled in any other part of the world, and all under a protectionist policy, which we are told is going to ruin us. In 1850 the petroleum industry was unknown, but in 1900 it produced 2,396,975,900 gallons. That in itself was almost enough to develop the industries of a great continent. AVe have heard a great deal of the drawback which a protectionist Tariff has been to Germany, and the lee-way which she has made. In the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> of the 4th of April last a correspondent makes a comparison between German and British trade, showing the progress which has been made in Germany in. recent years. After speaking of the increased prosperity she enjoyed under her policy, he goes on to say that in 1885 the population of the United Kingdom was 36,000,000, in round numbers, and had increased in five years by 1,100,000, whereas the population of Germany had increased in a similar period by 1,600,000. In 1890 the population of the United Kingdom had increased in five years by 1,500,000, and in Germany by 2,500,000. In 1895 the population of the United Kingdom had increased in five years by 1,600,000, and in Germany by 3,000,000, or very nearly double. In 1900 the population of the United Kingdom had. increased in five years by 1,800,000, and in Germany by 3,-800,000, or very nearly three times. In twenty years the increase of population in the United Kingdom had been 6,000,000 as against 10,900,000 in Germany, or 17 per cent. in the former as against 24 per cent. in the latter. It shows that on the population basis that Germany has taken a greater lead than the old country has done. Then the writer compares the position held in foreign trade by the two countries in successive years. In 1875 the imports of Great' Britain were £373,000,000 and the exports £223,000,000, making a total of £597,000,000. In that year the exports from the German Empire were, of course, very much below those of the old country. The imports totalled £176,000,000, and the exports £122,000,000, making a total of £299,000,000, as against £597,000,000 for the old country. I shall not weary honorable senators by giving the figures for each year, but shall content myself with taking the figures for the first and last years in the table. In 1900 the imports of Great Britain were £523,000,000, and the exports £354,000,000, making a total of £877;000,000 ; whereas in Germany in that year the imports had increased to £277,000,000 and the exports to £220,000,000, making a total of £498,000,000. The figures show that even in Germany - this highly-protected country which we are told is not worthy of our consideration in any respect - the foreign trade had increased by 80- per cent. as against 54 per cent. in the United Kingdom. The comparison of the principal exports from the two countries - coal, cotton manufactures, machinery, iron and steel, wrought copper and brass, woollen manufactures, and worsted - show equally astonishing results. It shows that, although Great Britain has not, as some honorable senators have stated, declined, she has not kept up her position in the race among the nations like either Germany or the United States has done. It is true that she has not declined in the ordinary sense of the word, but she has not made that progress which either Germany or the United States has made, and by comparison she has declined.

                    <para class="block">In 1890, £100,802,000 worth of minerals, including coal, was raised in the United Kingdom, as against £36,282,000 in Germany. In 1899, the production 'in the United Kingdom had increased to £117,309,000, and in Germany to £52,581,000. The increased production in ten years was 76 per cent. in Germany, as against17 per cent. in the United Kingdom. That does not show that there is any falling off in the production in Germany, even when compared with one of the richest and most enterprising countries in the world. In1890, the iron production was 7,904,000 tons in the United Kingdom, and in Germany only 4,658,000 tons. In 1899 the production had increased in the United Kingdom to only 9,421,000 tons, while in Germany it had increased from 4,658,000 tons in 1890 to 8,143,000 tons in 1899, showing that she was all but abreast of the old country. In drawing this comparison, I do not wish to say anything which would tend to depreciate the industry of our dear old land, of which, I am sure, we are all very proud. But if it does show one thing, it shows that, so far as Germany and the United States are concerned, the argument of some honorable senators that a protective Tariff is prejudicial and hurtful to the people of a country is ill-founded, and that an entirely contrary result has been brought about. Comparing the shipping of the United Kingdom and Germany for the period commencing in 1896 and ending in 1900, we find that there was a total increase of 7 per cent. in British shipping as compared with 25 per cent. in German shipping. In the social statistics, which more nearly concern the working classes, the same progress is noticeable in Germany. In the post-office, which is one of the great distributing departments of the Empire, Germany has made rapid strides, and her development has, in fact, been quite extraordinary. In this discussion it is not for us to seek the unattainable, but to -follow the course that would be adopted by any practical business man in .dealing with his own concerns. ' We should not attempt to upset industries established by thoughtful enterprise, ' and if we do not give due consideration to what is desirable in a new country, we shall be the sufferers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> made a most extraordinary statement. I am an old colleague of the honorable senator's, and as one who has been associated with him in the Victorian Parliament for many years, I can conscientiously declare that to the best of my belief the honorable senator never lifted up his voice in the State Parliament in favour of free-trade. Furthermore, during the last session , in which he held a seat in the Parliament of .Victoria, it was mainly, if not entirely, through his influence that the Factories Act, providing for wages boards, was re-enacted. On that occasion he produced a report from New Zealand, pointing out the inestimable advantages that had accrued from similar legislation in that colony. Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> is a free-trader or a protectionist, I can only say that I believed him to be a protectionist. He says that he was a free-trader, but if he was, I was unaware of it. However we may feel, and whatever we may wish, it is our duty, as business men, to do the best we can, and not to follow the inclinations of those who would seriously imperil the industries of the country. The principal exponents of the ultra-free-trade arguments in this Chamber are members of the legal profession. Will these' honorable and learned senators tell me in what way they practice free-trade in their own profession <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I remember a case in Victoria not many years ago, in which a man who had been a conveyancer in a lawyer's office for a very long time, and was as competent to carry out his duties as was the principal 'of the firm employing him, undertook to draw up a title under the Transfer of Land Statute, and was prosecuted by the Law Society for looking over the legal wall. We should take with a grain of salt advice- coming from such a tainted quarter. A man ought to practice what he preaches. When we continually hear these arguments from our legal friends about the benefits of free-trade, which they do not practice, we should beware of them. We should use our own common sense, and -bring this eternal controversy to a conclusion. </para>

                        <para>- I had hoped that this debate would have closed some time ago. We have listened to many able speeches from both sides of the House, and I think that all the protectionist arguments have been effectively answered from this side of the Chamber. The commercial community, and in fact all . classes of people throughout Australia, are extremely anxious that this Tariff should be disposed of, and I, therefore, shall not prolong . the discussion, i It has been urged, notably by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> that there can be no secondary industries unless protective duties are imposed. We know, however, from our own observation that' without protection the secondary industries . are established as the demand arises .for what the secondary producers can supply. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> told us that the Tariff which he introduced in South Australia, in 1SS7, had led to the establishment of a great number of industries. </para>

                            <para>- No one called it a protective Tariff. I remember that after <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Bray had visited England and Canada, he told the people assembled at the Town Hall in Adelaide, that he was still undecided whether he would introduce a protectionist Tariff or not, but he afterwards decided in favour of protection. This shows that what we had before in South Australia, was really a revenue Tariff. It may have been incidentally protective, but none of us object to that. We find that in New South Wales every industry that can fairly be expected in a new country has been established, and that secondary industries have sprung up according to the requirements of the people, without any fostering care. In such cases the industries are always stronger and better than where their establishment has been due to protection. </para>

                            <para>- Ireland suffered because of the protective policy of England, which ruined her manufacturers. We are told that America owes a great deal to protection. President Hamilton was the first to introduce protective duties at a time when most of the industries of America had been established, and he thought 12½ per cent. might help them. I wonder what the protectionists in Victoria would think of a 12½ per cent. duty for protective purposes. The whole system of protection is based upon the false idea that commercial exchanges mean warfare. That idea may be traced back to the age when the nations were afraid to exchange their goods, because they thought it was to their disadvantage to part with gold. Now we know that exchange tends to enrich every one, and that no country will attempt to trade unless it is likely to derive benefit. Taking into account the vast resources of America, it is not to be wondered at that she is so rich. We are told that free-trade has failed as a fiscal system, because Eng land is the only country that has adopted it. Why is it that the prophecy of Cobden, that every nation would follow the grand example of Great Britain, has not been fulfilled? It is largely because the nations' required large revenues which could be most easily derived from Customs duties. If it had not been for the great war between Germany and France in 1870-1, the free-trade system would have been much more widely extended. It has extended, because we find that in America 51 States, having a population of 80,000,000 people enjoy a system of absolute freetrade, so far as the States are concerned. The United States are equal in area to the whole of Europe, which is divided up into 20 different States. If Europe should become federated under one great Government, all the existing barriers between the various States would be removed, and the conditions would be very similar to those now existing in America. If there were any advantage attached to free-trade between Alsace and </para>

It is absurd to make comparisons between nations so differently circumstanced as Great Britain and the United States. At the time England adopted free-trade, what was the condition of her people? Great Britain was burdened with a war debt of over £800,000,000, and her population aggregated only about 26,000,000 of people. What was the position of the United States? That country had a debt which was not worth speaking about, having regard to its vast area of virgin soil which was undeveloped. </para>

After the war the Government undertook to assist in the construction of that railway by guaranteeing bonds, -and by making land grants.

                            <para>- Exactly ! Notwithstanding the large surplus which England sent to America to assist in the development of that country, she was still able to develop her own territory. In support of this statement, I may mention that in 1845 England possessed only 2,405 miles of railway, whilst in 1895 she had 25,575 miles. One might go on enumerating how Great Britain has stimulated the energies of her people and increased her wealth, notwithstanding the bad conditions under which she started her free-trade policy. In this connexion it is interesting to note that in the interim between 1846 and 1899 she has reduced her national debt by nearly £200,000,000, besides diminishing taxation upon the working classes to an enormous extent. Well do I remember how, in 1877, the United States metaphorically threw up her hat whilst the newspapers in the eastern states rejoiced because her exports to England were greater than were her imports. At that time the Americans thought they had England practically in their power. "Now," they said, "England cannot live without us, because she requires more from us than we import from her." But about that time English capital, which had been flowing so long into the United States, ceased for want of fresh investments. As a result goods had to be sent from the United States to England to pay interest on the money which had been borrowed and upon English investments. What happened? A new market had to be found. Accordingly the British people turned their attention to Australia, and established the magnificent line of steam-ships which connects the old country with this. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; of course that .amount includes private debts as well as the public debt. ' I think that the private debts would about equal the public debt, and the latter aggregates some £200,000,000. Yet England, which is such a small country that an American once said he feared to go out at night lest he should walk over the cliffs, has materially assisted to build up every other nation. Surely then free-trade must have done a great deal for England. The United States, by means of absolute free-trade between the eastern and the western States has helped to develop that country, but she could not have accomplished the task by placing barriers between them. It is the barriers which have been raised between the various Australian States that led to a demand by the people for free-trade. Those barriers proved so burdensome to the industries of Australia that federation became a necessity, in order that we might break them down and have free-trade in this great island continent - a continent which is even greater that of Europe. Free-trade is making rapid strides in every part of the world. What did Chancellor Caprivi, in addressing his people, say ? He said - </para>

                    <para>That resolves itself into what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said this afternoon when he declared that we must either receive the goods of other people or receive the people themselves. Is it not wise for us to produce whatever we can to very great advantage, and to exchange any surplus we may have for goods that we can secure more advantageously from other people ? The free-trade principle, after all, is only the true principle of cooperation. We are launching out upon our career as a young nation, and it is extremely necessary that we should guard against the building up of vested interests, which will afterwards demand as a right the continuation of certain privileges. What do the protectionists say ? They ask that industries shall be protected whilst they are infants? But I would point out that scarcely an industry is provided for until it has passed through all the struggles of birth. Every industry has to stand the cold blast of commerce in its early infancy. It is only after it has become a healthy infant that the protectionists cOme along and claim for it a certain amount of fostering care. Duties are not imposed in order that industries which do not exist <inline font-style="italic">may</inline> be created. There is no thought of that. Those who clamour for protection ask only for protection to those industries which are already in existence. Let us , take the illustration given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> in reference to Shearer's ploughshares. What are the facts in reference to that matter ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shearer</inline> established his industry under free-trade. </para>

                            <para>- I have shown that this industry was started prior to the introduction of the Playford Tariff, and has stood the cold blast of commercial competition. Surely the local article should now be able to make its way by reason of its superiority. When we are asked to support these secondary industries in order to create work for our artisans, I, as an artisan, claim that the best system for my fellows is free-trade. If we put a duty on mining machinery and thus hamper the mining industry, artisans are all crippled to the 'extent of the restriction. If we, by the introduction of the best and latest plant, develop mining properties, railways are demanded, and the services of fitters and engineers are required for repairs and the manufacture of a hundred and one necessary articles. What do we find in New South Wales? </para>

                            <para>- There is no necessity to impose heavy duties for the sake of establishing secondary industries. If we impose duties with that object, we shall, in a few years, when these infants have under our fostering care developed into gigantic concerns, find great difficulty in re-establishing free-trade. We shall have representatives of vested interests around this Chamber protesting against the removal of the props which have hitherto supported the industries. Now that most of the secondary industries are fairly well established, there is no need for protective duties. Is it not enough that Victoria has had protection for 35 years? Infant industries, which, now ought to be matured, are all crying out for further help; but why should we, as a Commonwealth, pledge ourselves to support industries, and thereby impose heavy burdens on future generations ? Our anxiety is to develop the resources of this great country. We want to develop our mining, pastoral, agricultural, and the hundred other industries which are bound to arise. . If we free those industries from taxation, we shall most materially assist their progress, and add to the, wealth of the community, ' without burdening ourselves with . pledges which may become burdensome.'

                            <para>- All these points have been referred to so often that nothing further need be said concerning them. It is unnecessary to impose heavy duties- in order that .industries may be established; ; all that is required is to afford the opportunity and ' ' provide a market. The Senate during this debate- has been surfeited with statistics," and although I have provided myself with a great many, I shall not take UP time by dealing with them. Our primary industries( are really, our great sources of .wealth, and anything which would have a tendency to hamper the, production of that wealth must'/ of, course, result in great loss. As a warning to the Senate, I should like to point out that if. we observe the productions of America we shall see the very great '. necessity . for giving every encouragement to. the primary .'as opposed to secondary industries. In the United States of America those engaged in three great industries - the pig-iron and the wool, on which there are heavy duties, and the silver industry - have become so powerful that they have sought in a very great measure to corrupt Congress. Yet we find that the products of those industries fall far below even that of the poultry-yard of America. In 1890, the output of the pig-iron industry there was valued at about 130,000,000 dols., the output of the wool industry at about 60,000,000 dols., and the actual value of the output of the silver industry at about 50,000,000 dols., making a total of 240,000,000 dols., whereas, according to the lowest computation, the output of poultry and eggs in the United States of America for that year may be put down at 250,000,000 dols. Thus, an industry of which we seemingly take no notice is really of such great importance in America that its produce is 10,000,000 dols. in excess of those great industries of which we hear so much, and which are clamouring so loudly for protection in Australia we have to depend largely upon our primary products for our wealth and for the revenue which we. require. In 1900, South Australia exported eggs to the value of £62,493 ; flour,£338,820; bran, £17,161; pollard, £5,331; and wheat £422,439. I might also refer to our wool exports and to the quantity of hay and chaff and other natural products which we also exported. It is really to its primary industries that South Australia has to look for its support, and consequently we should be very careful to refrain from doing anything which would hamper the full development of those industries. It has been said that protection has done something for South Australia, in the engineering trade, but I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> who was the author of the protectionist Tariff, to which reference has been made, that that Tariff did nothing for the engineering trade in South Australia. I think I can say that 95 per cent. of the work of the trade there has been in respect of orders received from places beyond the State, such as Broken Hill, where we have had to compete against the world. </para>

                            <para>- We have done remarkably well, but we have succeeded without the aid of protection. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> imposed a duty on machinery, but our local requirements in that direction have been so small that they have not called for any extensive production. Nevertheless, we have established the engineering industry there, and to-day. it is able to turn out machinery as good as that which can be manufactured in anyplace, and at very low figures. We have very good plant, and as shown by their work on the Western Australian gold-fields, our engineers are equally as good as those of any other country. What I desire to impress upon the Senate is that that great industry has really been established upon free-trade lines. Fortunately for the trade <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> in framing the State Tariff, did not put a duty on the raw material required by it. It has been able to obtain its raw material free. In that way it has been in a position to enter fully into the industry, and Broken Hill being so close at hand we have been able to supply all the machinery and so forth required by the mines; there. It is true that in1900 we had a larger number of engineers employed in South, Australia than we have there to day, but that was because of the protection which, was given by way of a bonus. Apart altogether from any question relating to the Tariff, the Government of South Australia decided that the locomotives required by it should be manufactured locally, and they were prepared to pay a very much higher price for those locomotives than that which ' they would have to pay for engines imported from England. </para>

                            <para>- That was the bonus system. What was the, result? The manufacturer entered into the industry. From a financial point of view he had a hard struggle to carry out the contract, but he succeeded admirably in the execution of. the work, and on completing the contract he had so far succeeded from the financial standpoint that he was able to call the plant which he employed his own. In other words all the profits which he made were to be found in his machinery. But what was the value of that machinery unless work could be found on which to employ it ? The Government have removed the contract. </para>

Gold is a commodity just as a steam-engine is. The steam-engine we want to keep in the country ; the gold we want to export. It is really to our primary industries that we have to look, for the success of this great Commonwealth. In comparison with the exports of our primary industries from South Australia, the list which I have taken out shows that those which come from the secondary industries, such as mechanics and arts, are very much lower in value. </para>

                            <para>- I mean to say that the produce of the hens is of far greater value to the Commonwealth than that of many of the manufactures. I have shown that the products of the poultry yards of the United States of America are of greater value than those of the great industries which have so encompassed the Congress as to become really a power for evil in their transactions. </para>

                            <para>- I am not exaggerating. I have taken the figures from our own statistics. I should like to emphasize some of the remarks which have been made this afternoon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> for he has dealt with most of the matters on which I had intended to speak. I can vouch from my own knowledge of the mechanics of Great Britain, which is very considerable, that they are in favour of freetrade as against protection. How do we know that such is the case <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Only in last Saturday's papers, I saw a report of a con tference in Liverpool at which resolutions were passed condemning all the attempts which are now being made to influence the British Government to adopt a protective Tariff. It has been argued here, as showing the weakness of free-trade principles, that Great Britain, who may be called the mother of free-trade, is now departing from those principles. I believe there are a great many in England who would like to return to at least a modified system of protection. Lord Salisbury and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> are, I think, amongst the number ; but we find that the labouring classes of England are opposed to any return to protection, and well may they be so. When, as I have shown, and as has been shown time after time during this debate, their condition has improved under a free-trade policy, it would be worse than madness on their part to make any attempt- to return to protection. </para>

                            <para>- I know that in my own trade in Cornwall the hours of labour have been reduced, and the wages have been increased by fully 25 per cent, since I served my time. We have been told that the English people leave their own country, but, as I have stated before in this Senate, a child is a burden upon the community in which he is born until he is fourteen years of age. He is consuming all that time, and producing nothing. From fourteen to eighteen he begins to do something for himself, and from eighteen to twenty-one perhaps a little more. </para>

                            <para>- After England has reared the child, and has been at all the expense of keeping him up to that age, he goes away to America. Why? Because in America there are still vast opportunities for labour. In that country he at once becomes a source of very great wealth, because of the energy and ability with which he has been provided at the cost of the old country. In addition to that we must take into account the millions of money which England has lent to other countries. All this shows what England can do under her free-trade system. The debate has been ably conducted on both sides; argument has been met by argument ; and I am sure that every one here must now be satisfied that the condition of the labourer is always better where he has freedom to employ his energies as he thinks fit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> in his speech, quoted some figures with regard to the value of kerosene. </para>

But the honorable senator tried to show that in a free-trade port the price of kerosene' was higher than in a port where a duty was imposed upon it. If he had consulted a trade journal he would have learnt the correct prices charged to the consumer at the time he referred to. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Hardware Journal</inline> of 1889,. the prices in January were as follow : - In Sydney, where kerosene was free, 8 1/2d. to 9d. ; in Melbourne, where it was also free, 8|d. ; in Adelaide, where there was a duty of 3d. per gallon, the price was from ls. to ls. 0 1/2d </para>

                            <para>- I am showing the honorable senator how the figures work out, and showing him that where a duty is imposed it is added to the price of the article. That is what we have said all through on this side in contending that a duty does increase the price of an article upon which it is imposed. In April the price of kerosene to the consumer in Sydney was from 83/4d. to 9d.; in Melbourne, 83/4d.; in Adelaide,1s.1d.; and in Brisbane, from 1s. l¼dto1s. 2¼d.In July the price in Sydney was from ; 8½d. to 83/4d.; in Melbourne, 8½d.; in Adelaide,1s. 0¼d.; in Brisbane,1a. 33/4d to 1s. 43/4d. In October, when there was a famine in kerosene, owing to difficulties in getting shipments, and the prices had risen, the price to the consumer in Sydney was10½d.; in Melbourne, 9d.; in Adelaide,1s. 2d.;andin Brisbane,1s. 6½d. These figures answer the honorable senator, and prove that the figures he quoted from <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> were not of any value as showing he market value of kerosene. </para>

I do not suppose the honorable senator was wilfully misleading the Senate, but if he had taken a little more care he would have seen that the figures he presented were not absolutely correct. When giving the average wage paid in New South Wales, he took the average for the 21 industries to which he referred, and included . the wages paid to adults, women as well as men, youths, boys, and girls. But when dealing with Victoria, the honorable senator took the wages paid to adults only, and the wages fixed by the wages board. </para>

                            <para>- From a return supplied in the report brought up by the Victorian Shops and Factories Commission showing the relative wages in the two States. One State had the advantage of wages boards ; but the honorable senator took the adult males only in one case, and classed with the adult males, 'the youths, boys, women, and girls in the other. In all the other trades referred to in Victoria, the wages per 100 was £126 5s., whereas in New South Wales it was £146 6s. . The lower result in Victoria was due to the larger number of women, boys, and girls employed. If we " take the adult males by themselves, then in. Victoria the amount is £136 12s.11d., whereas in New South Wales it is £13911s . But class the adult males with the youth's and the women, and it is £126 5s. 6d. in Victoria, as against £146 6s. in. New South Wales. I think that the honorable senator is fairly well answered in that respect. We know that the'Tariff contains a great many anomalies. I am thoroughly convinced that the people of Australia are extremely anxious that we should get to close quarters as soon as possible with the Tariff, and settle it so that they may know how they are to conduct their business. Still one cannot help feeling anxious, because once a Tariff of this sort is imposed it is very difficult to alter it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> told us the other night that his Tariff has stood in South Australia since 1887 with scarcely any alterations. That has been because of the difficulties of opening up the revision of the Tariff. The people of South' Australia would have liked many items to be altered, . but they were afraid of opening up the revision of the Tariff, because it was such a big task ; and as the Treasurers knew what they had been receiving from the. Tariff as it existed, they were always unwilling to introduce a new condition of things. We must be extremely careful that we base this Tariff on such principles as will be conducive to the great interests of Australia and its people. It ought to be so framed as to enable the people to have the greatest possible enjoyment of the wealth that is produced, and let the taxation fall as lightly as possible on their shoulders. If we impose a Tariff which is said to be protective, but which does not keep out the article, then where we raise perhaps £1,000 at the Customhouse we shall, notwithstanding all that has been said on the other side, pay a large amount to those who are manufacturing that article within our borders. </para>

                            <para>- It is n6t rubbish at all ; it is clearly shown that it cannot be otherwise. If the interests of the workers are to be considered, then I tell the honorable senator that the moment in a protective country the prices come down to that level that it is prepared to compete against the rest of the world, under those conditions with a limited market, it will always be found that wages will be reduced considerably. The competition, our honorable friends tell us, is always so great as to keep down prices. If it keeps down the prices it also keeps down the wages, and consequently the workers, can' 'get nothing out of the protective system. But .there is one. thing which- honorable senators seem to forget. They continually tell us that the competition amongst the manufacturers will always tend to keep down the prices ; and yet competition amongst the importers did not keep.' down the prices. On the one hand the people can import for themselves if they think that they are being-imposed upon. ' There is nothing to prevent them f from purchasing in any market of the world ; but if only a few are engaged in the manufacture of an article, and the prices fall to that level which we are told competition brings, there is nothing to prevent these few persons from coming together and saying - "We must not allow competition among ourselves to depress our profits to the extent that we are doing. Since we are protected to a certain extent let us form a ring, and keep prices to just below those at which the article can be imported." Honorable senators must see that. We know what the result has been in America - not that I say monopolies are bad in themselves. A monopoly may be used in the interests of the people. In England a monopoly can only be successful while it gives the people better goods at lower rates than any other body does. With a large combination the public really get the benefit of its large capital, which they could not get otherwise. In committee I shall assist to reduce the duties on many items in the Tariff. I - earnestly hope that when it leaves the Senate it will be Very much improved. I was somewhat amused at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie in bringing up what he called a free-trade Tariff. It was  published by a writer to the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily</inline><inline font-style="italic">Telegraph,</inline> under no authority from any free-trade party. As a writer he gave his opinion as . to what the Tariff should be. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie compared that suggested Tariff with , the Tariff, not as it was introduced in the other House, but as it was brought to the  Senate. In the other House .the freetraders made the Tariff, in the interests of the public, so superior . to what . it was before that the Minister for Trade and Customs scarcely knew it. </para>

                        <para>- I confess that I venture with considerable misgiving to interpose in this debate, and that misgiving does not arise, I think, because of any consciousness of more than usual ignorance on my part of what I presume to be the subject of it, but because I feel quite uncertain as to whether, in attempting to discuss the Bill, I shall meet with the approval of the Senate. That was our original starting-point, but we have had such a rich profusion of facts and figures piled on this poor unfortunate Tariff, and the annals of history so carefully examined from the time, I might almost say, of the Ark, down to the latest edition of <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall,</inline> in order to find something or other in regard to this question, that I feel that if I address myself to the Tariff only, as I propose to do, I shall be, at any rate, doing something which during the last few days has been quite novel, and, therefore, may  be misunderstood.  I submit, first, that in considering the Bill we are brought face to face with two problems. One of these I venture to say is not accompanied by difficulties of an unusual nature, but the other I feel, and I believe it has been so recognised by every one who has touched on the point, is surrounded by extraordinary and unusual difficulties. One is the problem of how to frame a scheme of taxation that will carry out the ordinary axiom that taxation, in its incidence, should fall with proportionate equality on ' all classes. That is a problem which is not unusually difficult, and which is not made unusually difficult by the stage we have reached in the history of this Commonwealth. But the other problem is a peculiar one, which is forced upon all of us who recognise that the Commonwealth has some moral obligation towards every State. That problem is to so adjust this large scheme of taxation that we shall render to each State as nearly as we possibly can that amount of revenue which it got before it entered the Federation. Before I enter upon the discussion of these two problems, that I think are the only problems which we ought to discuss at any length, I desire to refer to the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> In introducing the Bill, he approached the subject with very great reverence. He laid the Tariff on the table as if it were a sacred thing, and as if we must not lay violate hands upon it.' I do not blame him, of course, for approaching the subject in that manner. It was obviously his duty, at any rate it was what we might have expected from him, but in the course of his remarks he more than once entirely changed his tone and attitude. Whilst I admired him for the bold way in which he stood up and said that this was a protectionist Government, I confess that I reared him more when he began to treat the whole subject in honeyed words, and to appeal to us, if we touched the Tariff at all, not to do so unless it became absolutely necessary, and when he warned us of the serious responsibility we should undertake if we attempted to modify or alter it. He also made some remarks which I think I am bound to refute because of their unintentional inaccuracy. We have heard the statement more than once that Tasmania had a practically protective Tariff. The Vice-President of the Executive Council told us that "a rose by any other name would smell as sweet," and tried to make us understand that because the Tasmanian Tariff was high, it was protective. Tasmania has never in her history' had anything but a revenue Tariff. She has been forced to derive a very large amount of revenue from customs duties, and in times of stress and adversity has been compelled reluctantly to increase the taxation by that means, but this has never had a protective result. The proof of that is very simple. As a matter of fact, we have never had anything to protect. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> may think so ; but I am dealing with facts, and not with descriptions. If, instead of having a 20 per cent. Tariff, such as was recently in operation in Tasmania, duties had been levied upon a 50 per cent, basis, it would still have been a revenue Tariff. There was never anything in Tasmania to protect, and there is nothing there at the present moment. Therefore I think the Vice-President of the Executive Council will recognise the impropriety of including Tasmania amongst the States that imposed a protective Tariff. Even the Vice-President of the Executive Council makes a slip sometimes, and he did so when he was referring to some of his colleagues in the Ministry. He made an unfortunate reference to his colleague, .who ought to be called <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Jacob</inline> Fysh, when he said in effect that, whatever that gentleman's words had been, his acts had been the acts of a protectionist. Of course that reminded us at once of the story of Jacob and Esau, but the honorable and learned senator was not very complimentary to his colleague when he said that his acts had always been the acts of a protectionist although his voice had been the voice of a free-trader. He then went on to point out, with the emphasis of which he has such a perfect command, that - </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>Whatever may have been said in criticism of the Tariff as compared with the Maitland manifesto, I assert without hesitation that there is not one item in it, and not one principle which was enunciated in the statement of it by the Government, which does not directly carry out the promise made in the Maitland manifesto. </para>
                    <para class="block">The question immediately arises which Tariff the honorable senator was referring to. If he referred to the Tariff as originally introduced in the House of Representatives, I should like to bind him down to it. The obvious inference was that that was the Tariff he had in his mind. I venture to submit that the Tariff as introduced, whether it did or did not carry out the Maitland manifesto, has been materially and vitally altered during its passage through the House of Representatives to this Chamber, and that even this Tariff with all its modifications does not carry out adequately what the general public of Australia understood by the Maitland manifesto. I may go further, and say that the party with which I have the honour to be associated in this Chamber will not relax in' any way their efforts to make this Tariff give to the people exactly what they understood by that manifesto. I could not find in the Vice-President of the Executive Council's speech any remarks with reference to what I have said should be the first great object of this Tariff, namely, to devise a scheme of taxation which shall fall upon all classes of this Australian community with equal effect. I appeal to every honorable senator, irrespective of the party with which he may be associated, to see that whatever else this </para>
                    <para class="block">Tariff may do, it shall embody a scheme of equitable and fair taxation. I have not the slightest hesitation in asking every protectionist in this Chamber if he does not consider it his duty to make this Tariff operate in such a way as to carry out that elementary principle. We .have to recognise that the Commonwealth has to give to the States a large proportion of the total revenue that will be derived by them from all sources, while so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the Tariff represents its only means of raising revenue. Therefore, the obligation rests upon the Senate, to see that the Tariff represents a fair scheme of taxation. I should like to point out how the view I have taken, with regard to the two problems presented to us, corresponds with the position of this Senate. We are elected upon the broadest franchise, and by the people of each State voting collectively, and in that respect we represent all the communities of the Commonwealth to as great an extent as, if not to a greater extent than, do the representatives in the other House. We, also, stand here - to use a somewhat confusing term - as representatives of our own States. In other words we recognise that the Senate is the special custodian of the State rights. This being so, I submit that it is specially our duty to solve the second problem to which I have referred by returning to each of the States as nearly as possible the same amount of revenue as they previously derived from customs. Finding, therefore, as I have indicated, that the position we hold here as senators so adequately and harmoniously corresponds with what I conceive to be our two chief duties, I venture to appeal to every senator to assist the Government in carrying them out. With regard to the first problem of fair taxation, I may, perhaps, be permitted to remind honorable senators of the elementary axioms of taxation and of what we are bound to do. . One axiom is that taxation should fall upon all persons according to their means ; another is that it should hinder production as little as possible ; and a third - and this practically comprises all that ought to be found in a proper scheme of taxation - is that it should be as little difficult and costly, and as little embarrassing to trade as possible. I submit that honorable senators, no matter where they may sit, ought to regard it as their bounden duty to see that this Tariff carries put these three axioms. Every honorable senator will recognise that it is absolutely impossible for a protectionist, if he wishes to give force to his protectionist views, to emb'ody in this Tariff a fair scheme of taxation. I say that without fear of contradiction. </para>

                            <para>- I - I shall not accept such a' qualification as 'that, even from the Vice-President' of the Executive Council. If a 'protectionist wishes to carry out protection, he cannot embody his scheme' in a fair scheme of taxation. If a protectionist wanted to tax boots, as the Government did in the Tariff which they first brought down to the House of Representatives, to the extent of from 100 to 180 per cent., he would be compelled at once to commit a .breach of the great principles which should regulate a fair scheme of taxation. I submit that, whilst we have to light practically with' both our hands tied behind our backs, we can, at any rate, by adhering to our principles as free-traders, do a great deal more to make this Tariff represent a fair scheme of taxation than could any protectionist',' unless he too consented to fight fairly, and to recognise that his hands also were tied firmly by the necessities of the States. That, however, is not the way in which this fight is being conducted. The protectionists are trying to embody their principles in this Tariff as fully as possible, and in seeking to eliminate this element, we are under no risk of departing from a proper system of taxation. If honorable members think that I am abandoning my free-trade principles they are quite mistaken. </para>

                            <para>- Free-trade has a great deal to do with it. The free-traders are going .to fight fairly, and none of us intend to make' any fanatical attempt to frame such a Tariff as would end in hopeless disaster to all the States. Every freetrader recognises that his hands are tied behind his back, and that the financial necessities of the States will not allow him to carry out his free-trade principles in their entirety ; but he does not abandon them. I agree largely with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said this afternoon. I was delighted with his speech, as I have not listened to such a deliverance for many a day in this Chamber. It had great intrinsic merit, and it came with greater force from him because of the position he holds in the labour party. I agree with all he said about free-trade. I do not know that I could go as far as he would, but if my hands were not tied under present conditions I' would venture to go further than I am able to proceed in connexion with this Tariff. . That, I take it, will be the attitude- of most freetraders in this Chamber. ' They do not in any way abandon their principles, but they intend to remain 'loyal to the necessities of their respective States. -What is the attitude of protectionists? If they put in this Tariff a single protectionist item, they will ignore what we consider to be a proper scheme of -taxation. They may -do'it,. but it will be at their own risk. Protectionist 1 speakers with whom I sympathize largely , because they believe in ' their view6 -have said very little upon a subject to which. I now desire to refer. Prior to federation the chief protectionist State in Australia was Victoria. That State had a high 'protective Tariff in operation, and now . its senators consider that Victorian industries are threatened. The Victorian : Tariff ranged from 25 to 35 per cent.', and, giving protectionists credit for all they claim, let us assume that that Tariff enabled this State to retain control of its own market. .To me it is quite obvious that protectionists in Victoria fear they are going to lose the advantages which they possessed prior to federation. I honestly ' think that they fail to appreciate the altered circumstances which . exist. I doubt if any business man would ; argue that to give him al 10 per cent, advantage over the wide area comprised in this Commonwealth would . place him "in an inferior position to that which he occupied when, under the operation of a 25 per cent, duty, he commanded . only the Victorian market. I am not using that argument . in an <inline font-style="italic">ad</inline><inline font-style="italic">caplandum</inline> way, but I do not believe that Victorian 'industries will suffer by reason of this Tariff when it finally passes the Parliament. The 10 per cent, advantage which Victoria will derive under it will be worth more to the industries of this State than the 25 per cent, which they previously enjoyed. It is obvious ' that honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber will have to agree to the imposition of a 10 or 15 per cent, rate upon many articles which are manufactured in Victoria. Victorian industries will be able to compete in the whole of the Commonwealth by reason of the advantage which they enjoy as against oversea goods. Such a position will, I think, be decidedly better for Victoria than that which she previously occupied. I wish also to point out that no protectionist in this Chamber has ever seriously considered that by the aid of a protective policy Victoria would be able to compete with the world in foreign markets. Such an idea has never entered into the minds of Victorian manufacturers. It is not contemplated by the most ardent protectionist in this Parliament. His ideas have been limited to his own State before federation, and to the whole of the Commonwealth since federation. That being so, surely protectionists will admit that much of the results of their policy must be nullified ? I do not intend to enter into a discussion upon the abstract question of free-trade and protection. It is necessary, however, that I should point out what really is the position of the industries of Victoria, and what should be the desire of those who advocate their maintenance by the aid of protective duties. Surely even protectionists will admit that where, if anywhere, benefit has arisen from the policy of protection, it has been derived, not in their own market, but in foreign markets ? Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> who believes in protection as firmly as any man in this Chamber, will recognise that that, if any, has been the beneficial result of protection. As a matter of fact - and I do not wish to put the matter offensively - by getting more from their own people they have been able to manufacture very largely. </para>

But much of the success of America, if it has been due to protection, has arisen from the fact that she can compete in foreign markets, and the most ardent protectionist in Australia can never hope that the Commonwealth will be such an advanced manufacturing country that it will be able to compete openly with other countries in foreign markets. </para>

                            <para>- I am not talking of our natural products, but of our manufacturing industries. I did not designate them as "secondary" industries, because that term might be offensive, but they are certainly industries which would best be recognised under that name. Obviously, we have never invaded foreign markets in connexion with any of those industries. No protectionist contemplates such an invasion at the present time, and therefore if our protected industries are to flourish at all, they will flourish simply in the markets of the Commonwealth. A revenue Tariff such as we feel impelled to impose will give to protected industries as much help as they enjoyed in Victoria under the operation of a 25 per cent. duty. I do not propose to pursue that subject any further. I would rather turn to the other question, which I admit interests me vastly - the question of the provision which the Government have made for meeting what we all recognise as the financial necessities of several of the States. The facts are simple. Frame what Tariff we may, New South Wales certainly, and Victoria probably, will come out all right. Of the other States Western Australia, owing to an arrangement which, I am sure, we all deprecate, has made provision for herself. It is lamentable, but it is afact. </para>

                    <para class="block">Tariff, as introduced by the Government, is that whilst they have- regarded the total amount to be collected, they have seriously neglected to pay attention to the method by which that total is to be made up. They have laid too much stress upon the fact that they are going to collect £8,500,000 or thereabouts. After making calculations regarding the total amounts which the States previously collected, and the expenses of the Commonwealth, they have decided that a revenue of £8,500,000 will be sufficient. I say that that is a very misleading way of attempting to solve this very difficult problem. I contend that, neglecting the position of New South Wales and Victoria, the chief duty of the Ministry was to investigate the position of Queensland and Tasmania, and to ascertain by what method of adjustment they could have returned to those States the money which they require. If due regard had been paid to the two items which yield the most revenue, this Tariff would not have been nearly so disastrous either to Queensland or Tasmania. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to say that the Government have been entirely blind to this fact, but certainly the method which they have adopted is decidedly fault}7, and I am prepared to indicate why it is so. I can point to methods by the adoption of which Queensland and Tasmania may be benefited without working injury to the rest of the States. But whilst we are perfectly read}' to sacrifice our principles for revenue - because it is essential that we should do so - we find great difficulty in extorting from protectionists a willingness to make a similar sacrifice. When it has come to a conflict between a protective duty and the raising of revenue for the the smaller States the latter have gone under in almost every instance. </para>

                            <para>- I hope it will not be so. Let me refer briefly to the position of the smaller States. In this connexion I can indicate at once a way in which they may be benefited without any harm being done to the other States. My suggestion has reference to the great revenue-producing items of narcotics and stimulants. There is no senator, whether he be a free-trader, a protectionist, or a member of the labour party, who is not perfectly willing to tax these items to the full extent of their revenue-producing capacity. Surely wo do not want to extend protection to either narcotics or stimulants. We tex them because they are essentially luxuries, and because they belong to a class of luxuries indulgence in which borders closely upon a vice. Therefore, I appeal to honorable senators to tax. them to the full extent of their revenue-producing power, and" to do so in such a. way that the smaller States will derive the greatest amount of revenue possible under the circumstances. The best way of realizing the largest amount of revenue from those items is by levelling up the difference between the excise and the customs duties. If we retain that difference we shall confer a measure of protection. I think I am abundantly justified in saying that I can show the Senate instances in which the Government have preferred protection to revenue, or, at least, to revenue for the smaller States. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with, items which even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> is. willing to tax to their fullest extent. If the Government wish to do likewise they have certainly adopted a faulty method by leaving too great a margin between the excise and customs rates. Let us consider for a moment the position of Tasmania and Queensland. For every gallon of spirits or lb. of tobacco distilled or manufactured within the Commonwealth, Tasmania and Queensland lose a considerable amount of revenue. Of course, the object of the Government is to afford protection to local industries.. But surely in the case of narcotics and stimulants we can afford to forego any idea of protection ; and if that be done our revenue will be increased hugely. Tobacco would be a better instance. We in Tasmania do not manufacture tobacco, and never have. Under the Tariff there is a duty of ls. 6d. per lb. on the unmanufactured leaf and an excise of' ls. on% the commercial product. In the case of a pound of tobacco manufactured in Victoria out of imported leaf, and sent to Tasmania as 'the State of consumption, the latter State will receive about 2s. 3d. ; that it to say, not quite ls. 6d. and ls. On the imported pound of tobacco Tasmania will get 3s. 3d., or1s. more, which will make a tremendous difference in the case of both Tasmania and Queensland. To Tasmania it will, in my opinion, make a difference of £25,000 a year. The same analogy holds good with regard to spirits. For every gallon of spirits produced in Australia and consumed in Tasmania, the latter State will lose a definite amount of revenue. To extend my argument, and show how this Tariff might have been framed so as to materially assist the smaller States, let me deal with the matter of imported hats and boots. If Tasmania imports these commodities from oversea, she will get a definite duty; but if they are. imported from Victoria, no revenue will be received by the smaller State. The effect of this Tariff in imposing even the new duty of 30 per cent. on hats and boots, is such that nearly all those commodities consumed in Tasmania will be manufactured in one of the larger States. </para>

                            <para>- I have already told honorable senators that, free-trader as I am, I regard ray hands as being firmly tied behind my back by the financial necessities of the States. I do not want a free-trade Tariff imposed j and an absurd suggestion as to excise is really more than irrelevant. I have pointed out that in my opinion an all round duty of 15 per cent. would, in the case of hats and boots, be just as much to the benefit of Victorian industries as was the original duty of 30 per cent. I do not say that the original duty would be of as much benefit at the present time, but another obvious way of giving revenue to Tasmania is by modifying the excessive duties on those articles which are likely to be consumed in that State, and manufactured in one of the larger States. Where is the injustice of my suggestion ? Is not 15 per cent. enough ? I do-not want to go back to the discussion of free-trade <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> protection, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> clearly pointed out that the natural protection added to 15 per cent. would really make the assistance - if that term be preferred - to the bootmaking trade enormous, and enable it to prosper abundantly with the wider market now offered. I hope to have another opportunity in committee, but if I chose now to go into detail, I could cite numberless similar instances, in which a moderate duty on articles which enter into universal consumption would vastly improve the financial position of the smaller States. Seeing how important it is that we should consider these smaller States, we free-traders are justified for that, if for no other reason, in saying to the protectionists - "In this case sacrifice some of your principles, as we are sacrificing ours." Free-traders do not want a duty of 15 per cent. on boots, and we therefore ask the protectionists to meet us half way. Some honorable senators may be induced to think that the 20 per cent. duty in the Commonwealth Tariff will operate in exactly the same way as the original duty of 20 per cent. in Tasmania. But in that supposition there is a great fallacy. I have heard it remarked that because Tasmania had a duty of 20 per cent. on many articles before federation, . she ought to be perfectly satisfied with a duty of 20 per cent. now. But the difference between the position then and the position now is enormous. Of the original duty of 20 per cent. Tasmania got every penny, whereas she will get. precious little revenue from a similar duty <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the Commonwealth Tariff. The duty of 20 per cent. imposed by the Commonwealth Tariff will enable the Tasmanian market to be largely held by manufacturers in the Commonwealth, and will therefore be illusory so far as that State is concerned. </para>

That contradicts what I started by saying tonight, namely, that we did not export articles manufactured in Tasmania. As a matter of fact, Tasmania has exported a large number of blankets to England, and the woollen industry of that State is one that could be carried on at the present time without protection. </para>

                            <para>- We free-traders want to make taxation fall on the capital which appears in consumption, and not that which appears in production. If I can get honorable senators to take .that view, they will join most heartily with me in modifying the Tariff. Freetraders are further said to adopt a harsh attitude towards manufacturing industries. I believe every free-trader in the Senate is perfectly prepared to help all industries in the Commonwealth by handicapping them as little as possible. We desire, by remitting taxation, to assist and encourage all industries, no matter whether they be primary or secondary. Show us any article which if imported free would greatly help any industry, and we will try to have it made free. That is the sort of Tariff we free-traders wish to impose. </para>

                            <para>- I know what the honorable and learned senator is going to say, namely, that protectionists do the same thing ; and so they do. But we freetraders regard an industry much as we might regard a boat's crew preparing for a race. We are willing to make the industry as fit as possible by training, and to remove all encumbrances, but we want a fair start without any handicap. We are prepared to remove every impediment, but we want to see a start from the scratch on level terms. Protectionists, on the other hand, would not only take away from certain industries all encumbrances, but would give them a 50 per cent, start. That is not the attitude of the free-traders, or even of the revenue-tariff party, who are concerned with the present discussion. We are prepared to remit taxation, even to the vanishing point, if by so doing we' can help any industry. "5?et we have been accused of harshness, simply because we do not say we are prepared to give any industry a long start in the race. </para>

                            <para>- I also follow the analogy ; but the necessities of State finances compel us to give every one a 10 per cent, start. We have to get revenue, and in collecting that revenue under a 10 per cent. Tariff we give a start to the local industries. We revenue tariffists say that, even with this 10 per cent, start, we would take every precaution against -hampering industries in any way. That is the Tariff we should like ; a Tariff which puts heavy 'duties on luxuries. It is not for a moment to be supposed that we are going to attempt to remit duties on luxuries, simply because other duties have been lowered to 25 per cent, or 30 per cent. There are some items on the free list which I should like to see taxed. When taxing luxuries t heavily, we ought to treat necessaries as lightly as possibly. In the Tariff, however, there are any number of necessaries of life which are taxed almost more heavily than any other items. We further say that tools of trade ought to come in free, or to be taxed very lightly. Mining and agricultural machinery are absolutely necessary to the success of those industries, and to the financial success of the Commonwealth and the welfare . of every individual. Therefore, as far as possible, subject to our revenue limitation, we are in favour of agricultural, mining, and all other machinery being admitted on a duty as low as is reasonable under the circumstances. We should be glad to see all such machinery admitted free, but if revenue necessities compel us, we shall, against our will as free-traders, .be prepared to accept a small tax.. In the Tariff, however, we do not find these items considered in that connexion. It is recent history that it was only after the most strenuous efforts of the free-traders in the House of Representatives that the duty on mining and agricultural machinery was reduced to 15 per cent., which, however, is still too high. So curious is the attitude of some protectionists that I do not hesitate to say that when we come to deal with agricultural and mining machinery, I shall be perfectly prepared to find that honorable senators who, otherwise, are strong protectionists, will at once vote for a reduction of the duties. The necessity for doing so will be brought home to them by their local and immediate necessities. They will recognise that the heavy duty on mining and agricultural machinery is going seriously to affect their position. I am certain that they will recognise local requirements before' any theories of protection which they may hold. Their sympathy with the manufacturers of the Commonwealth will disappear when they are brought face to face with the immediate requirements of their own localities. I do not hesitate to say that we shall have no difficulty in materially improving the agricultural and mining industries of this great Commonwealth by reducing the duties on both these items. This is a most interesting topic, and I have been diverted from the argument which I had intended to use with regard to the question of State rights. In view of the fact that I have wasted my own time, and that I have done so at my own loss, I do not intend to refer back to that question. But, before I leave it entirely, I should like to impress again upon honorable senators that in this respect it is absolutely their bounden duty, wherever they can possibly do so, to lay their hands upon this Tariff which the Vice-President of the Executive Council asks us to reverence to such an extent. I put it to honorable senators - whether they are protectionists or freetraders, and especially, if they are protectionists - that wherever they can see "their way to a slight modification of the principles which they hold, they should do their utmost to assist the smaller States. In concluding my remarks on this subject, I wish to say that I am not so pessimistic in regard to the position of Tasmania as most people appear to be, judging by their utterances. I am glad to say that, in my opinion, the State Treasurer of Tasmania has made an exaggerated estimate of what will be our loss. At the same time, I must confess - and I wish to approach the subject in all fairness - that our loss during the next five years is certainly going to be serious that is to say, that the difference between our revenue under Federation and that which the State collected before joining the union will be very great. But whereas our Treasurer has estimated that it will be about £180,000 per annum, I venture humbly to say that I do not think it will exceed £100,000, or, at all events, £110,000 per annum. I am prepared to cut down the State Treasurer's estimate by £70,000. </para>

                            <para>- A loss of £110,000 represents a great deal to a small State like Tasmania. As to the suggestion that the money will remain in the pockets of the people, I contend, for reasons that I. have given already, that to a large extent that will not be the case. Wherever the people have to pay the same price as before for goods which have been manufactured in Victoria, the money does not remain in their pockets \ it cOmes out of their pockets. I do not wish to raise again the old free-trade argument, that the money, instead of going into the Treasury, goes into the manufacturers' pockets, nor do I wish to raise the protectionist reply to the contention. It is unfair to say in answer to my statement, that this money will remain in the pockets of the people. In most cases it will be taken out of the pockets of the people, with just the same facility with which it is taken out of the revenue of the country. </para>

                            <para>- No, higher. Even although it may appear somewhat irrelevant to the debate, I should like to say that I have been much impressed with the view of federation that I am now about to put forward. I can see no proper cure for the financial troubles of the various States, until, in the first place, the five years period has elapsed, and until, in the second place, the Commonwealth has .taken over the debts of the various States with sufficient i assets to counterbalance them. Speaking with all frankness, I do not think that Tasmania will ever find herself in a satisfactory financial position until both these events have occurred. In the meantime I venture to say that I hope Tasmania will not make any absurd appeal to the Commonwealth for financial assistance. The absurdity of such' an appeal is obvious. It would be the kind of thing that a man might justify if* owing a large amount of debts, he were to obtain an overdraft from a bank to pay the money off. The position would be exactly the same, and I hope that as long as she remains an integral part of the Commonwealth, Tasmania, no matter what her financial distress may be, will never consent to accept a gift of £500,000 from the Commonwealth. I recognise that so far public suggestion has never got beyond an application for a loan. I have simply ridiculed that idea because, as I have just said, it would be exactly the same as the action of a man who obtained an overdraft from the bank in order to pay off his debts. If Tasmania borrows £500,000 from the Commonwealth, she will have to pay - or she ought to do so - not only the interest upon it, but at some time or other she will have to refund the principal. Therefore I dismiss that question entirely, and say that Tasmania must be left to work out her own financial salvation as best she may, subject to any assistance which we may give her by means of this Tariff. I hope that assistance will be great. I find that this subject has for me the same fascination that it has apparently for every honorable senator. I find that I am compelled to stop, although I seem hardly to have touched upon many of the subjects to which I desired to refer. Coming to the Tariff again - and I said at the outset that I intended to deal only with the Tariff, as that was the matter under discussion - I should like to point out two anomalies which are not mere items of detail, and which I hope to see removed. One is to be found in the customs Tariff, and relates to the duty on iron and steel. The proposal is that certain fixed duties which are scheduled in the Tariff shall be passed by this Parliament, and be made binding upon some future Parliament at such time as the establishment of the industry under bonuses shall have satisfied the Government that iron can be manufactured in the Commonwealth. That I believe is practically the proposition. I ~~do not wish at the ' present moment in any way to discuss the desirability of imposing 10 or 15 per cent, duties upon iron, but I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that it seems to be almost a monstrous thing that we should be asked to legislate on this matter for, and instead of, a Parliament which may be sitting three, four, five, or perhaps ten years hence. , It seems to me to be monstrous that we should be asked now to pass legislation that will bind a future Parliament, and also the people of the Commonwealth to certain duties. </para>

Item 81, relating to iron and steel, is intended to be binding for all future time. That being so, I would ask whether it is desirable that we should give effect to this proposal before even we look into the merits of the proposition itself. It may have merits ; it may not, but is it not bad legislation? Should we not at once reject item SI ? Can any honorable senator feel that he would be justified in passing such a duty? To descend almost to frivolity in these matters, I would say that some of us are protectionists or free-traders to-day, but heaven knows what we may be seven years hence.  </para>

                            <para>- If we are all going to be protectionists seven years hence the Vice-President of the Executive Council should not have any feeling of alarm in regard to what may be the work of a future Parliament. ' if he thinks that is going to happen he may safely leave the matter to a future Parliament. I say unhesitatingly that this . is a blunder in legislation which the Senate ought not to permit, and that, therefore, the item ought to be struck out. There is one other comprehensive item of the same sort in the Excise Bill. It relates to sugar, and directly contains this contract : that after the year 1907 there shall be no excise duty whatever on sugar. The position, therefore, is practically the same as that in relation to iron. I am not going to enter into the very vexed question of the sugar duties, and I trust that honorable senators, no matter what their feelings may be in regard to the great sugar question, will disabuse their minds of any notion that I am attacking it at present. I am attacking it only on the same grounds as I have attacked the item relating to iron. The provision in the Excise Bill in regard to sugar carries with it an implied contract, which will be binding on future Parliaments, and binding on the people of Australia, that after the year 1907 there shall be no excise duty on that article. </para>

                        <para>- .Tam glad to take from the Vice-President of the Executive Council the assurance that there is not such an implied contract. Under these circumstances I feel sure that I shall have his assistance in putting the question beyond dispute ; that when we come to deal with the Excise Bill he will join with honorable senators on this side in putting '.he matter beyond doubt, unless he wishes to contend that it is a desirable thing that such a contract should be given. I should prefer to make a few remarks on the question of desirability, and obviously they must be short, for reasons that must appear at once to any honorable senator. Can we possibly consider that in 1 907 the Commonwealth will be in such a position as to be able to do without any duty whatever on sugar - a duty that has been of immense assistance to every State. A revenue has been derived from sugar either by means of excise or through the customs ever since the States have been States. I submit, that assuming that my reading of this provision is correct, it would be absolute madness on the part of Parliament to consent now to the removal of the excise duties altogether at the end of 1907, and to something which would not reimpose them. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to go fully into the very vexed question of sugar, because it is a difficult one ; but Queensland sugar has been able to compete in the foreign markets. The market of every State was a foreign market to Queensland prior to federation, yet sugar from that State has been able to compete in those markets against all the world. In one year Queensland had positively a slight excess of production over the consumption of sugar for the whole of Australia. She did that without the slightest trouble. But now, Queensland, at the expense of the other States, is going to have a protective duty of ±'6 per ton, which is not to be counterbalanced by any excise whatever. I recognise that this is another of those instances in which the smaller States have to suffer, only in this case Queensland is inflicting her own suffering upon herself, though she might get some relief by an excise on sugar if she consumes it </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable and learned senator had heard me he would know that I said "if she consumes it." I did not fall into the boyish error of supposing that she would get anything out of sugar unless she consumed it. If there is an excise duty upon sugar, the State of consumption will get the whole of that duty. That we have lost ; and if I read this provision with respect to the sugar excise correctly, hereafter we shall for ever lose it. I have trespassed upon the time of the Senate longer than I intended, but I should like to say again with regard to the Tariff, and with regard to nothing else, that the very most I can hope to get from ' this Tariff is a negative blessing. I cannot believe that any arrangement of this Tariff by any body in Australia could materially benefit Australia. With regard to all these industries which the Tariff, where protective, purports to benefit, I say without the slightest hesitation, that if we are going to benefit them we must start in another way. If we look to the history of the world, and see where industries have progressed, and have been of material benefit to the individuals and to the nations, we shall find that the chief factor in their success has not been a Tariff. Their success has had nothing whatever to do with duties, and nothing whatever, practically speaking, to do with either free-trade or protection, but they have depended almost entirely upon the individuals engaged in those industries, their own industrial skill, their own aptitude for a particular occupation, and, indirectly of course, upon the opportunities that have been given by their local legislation for developing that industrial skill. </para>

                            <para>- Under my proposition we get men made fit to enter into the industrial struggle, and I say that the only way in which we can ever help to make manufactures in the Commonwealth a success is by- improving the technical education of our people. We all know that that power is removed from us entirely. It seems to me deplorable that although the Commonwealth Parliament has been invested with so many powers we have been bereft of that one power which might have made for the material prosperity of the* Commonwealth. My attitude with regard to the Tariff is that at best it can only be a negative blessing. We . free-traders are going to endeavour to prevent it hampering or injuring any sort of industry, primary, secondary, or otherwise. When we have acted in that purely negative way we shall have discharged, in my opinion, all the duties which can be expected of us, and shall have rendered to industrial Australia all the help we can possibly give it. </para>

                        <para>- Like the honorable and learned senator who has just resumed his seat, I intend, during the course of the few remarks I shall make, to avoid as far as possible any discussion of the relative merits of the two ascal policies of free-trade and protection in the abstract ; but, unlike that honorable senator, I do not intend to announce, either on my own behalf or on behalf of the party with whom I am associated, that we are going to do something which nobody hitherto, judging from the honorable and learned senator'sremarks, might have imagined any particular party in this House was going to do, namely, that we are going to be so generous as to abstain altogether from insisting upon' a rigid adherence to fiscal principles, and act in accordance with the exigencies of the occasion. That is the attitude taken up by many senators. It was the attitude taken up by the Prime Minister when submitting his policy to Australia at Maitland, and it is the attitude which, so far as I can make out, Ministers have ever since intended to abide by. It is not left to Senator Clemons and his free-trade friends to have this particular virtue in federal politics, that they are going for the nonce in the* interests of the people of Australia, not to persist in rigid insistence upon doctrinaire principles, but are going to have a due regard for the financial exigencies of the various States. We have all taken up that position, and it is now a question of the exact method by which we shall bring about a revenue for the Commonwealth which will secure to the various States some large proportion of the revenue which they have hitherto received, and will, to a certain extent, guarantee their solvency under the altered conditions. </para>

                            <para>- In fact, in Tasmania we have no excise duties except those on beer, cigarettes, and cigars, and an excise duty was put upon cigarettes only because a few years ago a couple of firms in Victoria established works in Hobart for the manufacture of cigarettes, with the idea of subsequently manufacturing cigars. They were not long established there with their works in full swing before an excise duty was put upon cigarettes, and they promptly cleared out of Hobart and came back to Melbourne to manufacture here and export to Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has also referred to woollens, and has told us of the woollen industry that exists in Tasmania. I am in perfect accord with the honorable and learned senator in saying that that industry is, comparatively speaking, in a very flourishing condition for the State of Tasmania, but I do not agree with him that it has attained its present proportions without the existence of a duty, because we have had a duty of 20 per cent, for a considerable time. There are many engaged in it both in the north and south of the island, and although the honorable and learned senator may say that they do not need the assistance of a protective duty, I must differ from him, because those engaged in the industry have been unanimous in the expression of the opinion that it is absolutely necessary for them that the duty, which has been lowered to 15 per cent, by the House of Representatives, should again be raised to 20 per cent. </para>

                            <para>-There is nothing wonderful in that, but it shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> was speaking from his own standpoint, and that his views do not coincide with the views of those who are primarily interested in the industry. The honorable and learned senator seems to me to have tripped in one matter. He told us at very great length and with considerable emphasis that it had never been the hope of those who had adhered to a protectionist policy that any of these industries which had been brought into existence in Australia by such a policy should ever invade foreign markets with their products. Senators Downer and Playford disagreed with him, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> rightly interjected at the time that they did not perhaps immediately contemplate invading foreign markets with their products. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> himself, in dealing with the comparatively small woollen industry of Tasmania admitted that it has successfully placed its products on the English market. If- that can be done by that modest industry which the honorable and learned senator says does not need protection, but which those interested in it contend does need protection, what can be done by some of the larger industries in other branches, which are to be conserved, or which may come into existence as the result of the operation of a Tariff such asis now submitted to us <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                            <para>- That is so, and possibly many industries will spring up in Tasmania the products of which will be sent to the other end of the world. Honorable senators on both sides have admitted that it is necessary we should have a Tariff" which shall raise a revenue of between £8,000,000 and £9,000,000. It seems tome, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> that it is not so- much a question of the amount actually to be yielded in the aggregate that we have to consider. We have to consider what will be the effect upon the finances of the States when the surplus revenue returnable to them is distributed amongst them. I agree with the honorable and learned senator that we can never have a proper adjustment of State finances until the five years of the bookkeeping period has gone by, and there is a more equitable distribution of the surplus revenue, and until some of the debts of the various States have been taken over by the Commonwealth in consideration for which .assets of the various States must be taken over. What will the Tariff submitted to the Senate yield ? That is a question which has given rise to varying opinions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has given expression to the opinion that it will yield too much, and will be too much of a burden upon the people. The honorable senator does not say that the duties themselves will be too much of a burden upon the people, -but that actually too much- will betaken out of the pockets of the people and put into the Federal Treasury, and that too great a burden will be placed upon the people in that way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> thinks that the amount which the Treasurer of the Commonwealth considers he will receive from the Tariff is an over-estimate. Again, we have had the opinions of a financier like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid.</inline> Only a couple of months ago or less than that, when the people of Tasmania were very much interested in this matter owing to an election being in progress, he telegraphed over to that State, and it appeared in triple columns, that the Government had brought forward financial proposals which -spelled ruin for the smaller States, inasmuch as they would not receive enough revenue. A little while after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> in the State of New South Wales, said that the proposals of the Government were of such a character that they would yield such a large amount of revenue as would lead to -extravagance on the part of the State Governments. In these circumstances, it is only natural to expect that those who have not had the experience of finance which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> has had, and who have not conducted the long and elaborate investigation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has conducted, should be in a state of some perplexity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> pointed out, that according to our statistician the population of Tasmania has not a capacity for consuming ordinary revenue-producing goods to the same extent as has the population of any. other State, and that by reason of that, with a uniform Tariff, the actual amount of consumption per head of ordinarily dutiable articles would be smaller in that State than in any other, and consequently in accordance with the bookkeeping clauses, the surplus returnable to Tasmania would also be smaller in proportion than that returnable to any other State. It has to be remembered that in the matter of finance Tasmania stands in a peculiar position with relation to the other States. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that there has been a disposition on the part of too many persons to deplore what they contemplate will be the financial results of the Tariff to Tasmania. I agree with him that it has recuperative powers which have not been taken into consideration. There are other circumstances, too. The direct taxation in Tasmania is nothing like as extensive as that which exists in any of of the other States. </para>

                            <para>- On land it may be ; it is a half-penny in the £1 on the improved capital value. Practically we have no succession duties. Personal estates up to £100 net, that is after deducting liabilities, pay nothing, from £100 to £500 2 per cent., and from £500 upwards 3 per cent. In all the other States succession duties range from 1 to 10 per cent, on realty and personalty ; and Queensland, in addition to succession duties, has small probate duties. In Tasmania there is practically no taxation in that direction, and it is, I believe, the only State in the union in which there is not a duty stamp put on such a document as a receipt. There are various sources of taxation which have never been resorted to, but I am not in a position to say what they would yield. It is well known that the customs and excise revenue relatively to the total taxation is much larger than that which exists in any other State ; 46-53 of the total revenue comes from customs and excise duties. I recognise, with all other honorable senators, that it is absolutely necessary to have a Tariff which will produce revenue. No matter how protectionist we may be we cannot have a Tariff that will result in nothing but protection. I do not mean a revenue Tariff in the sense in which that term seems to be accepted by the old free-trade party. Having come to a common agreement that we wish to raise £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 from the Customhouse, in order that the amount returnable may keep the States in a practically solvent condition, the question then seems to me to be this - What, broadly speaking, should be the character of the Tariff of the whole of Australia 1 Are we to enter upon a policy which shall be nothing but a policy of tax gatherers <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Or are we going to enter upon a policy of taxation which shall also be an industrial policy, and which shall reflect some value, and some benefit upon the people of Australia who are taxed ? I cannot ally myself with a party who, so to speak, in this, perhaps the largest, issue that will come before the Parliament will take up the banner- of the tax-gatherers -as apart from the industrialists. On whatever side of the Chamber we may sit why should we set about framing a Tariff designed to take out of the pockets of the people such a large amount per head as we intend to do, and not have some regard to the industries in our midst many of which came into existence as the result of Tariffs, and many of which are only existing in the face of the world's unequal competition by reason of the incidence of some duty in their favour ? I should like to quote some very appropriate remarks, which I remember having read and previously 'heard, in these terms - </para>

              <inline font-style="italic">Ti</inline>presunte, from what I have heard from the Government side, that we are to have a revenue-raising Tariff. But if there is an article which -can be produced locally, upon which they can place a duty and give a certain amount of protection, they will place it on that article rather than on one which cannot be produced in Australia., although it is in consumption here. They will get a certain amount of revenue and protection at the same time. I fail to recognise any vital distinction between the policies of either side. If it came to. a clearcut issue between free-trade and protection, my vote would be in the direction of free-trade. If it came to putting, a duty on tea, which is an Article largely consumed here, but which cannot be produced' locally, or of putting it on boots, which can be produced, I would be prepared to put it on boots. I take it that the position adopted by the Government is that they will show they can raise sufficient without putting a duty on both. </para>

I merely say 1 am in perfect accord with the remarks of that speaker with regard to the proper incidence of inevitable customs duties. In framing the Tariff we have not to close our eyes and simply put a dutv on certain classes of goods with the object of getting revenue alone, but we have" to consider in every instance what is the particular nature of those goods, and the method of their manufacture, and how far the conditions of Australian life are adaptable to such methods, and if we find that they are adaptable, even whether those goods are now being, made in the Commonwealth or not, it is our duty to so adjust the incidence of every detail of customs taxation as to give the greatest possible encouragement to the manufacturer of the most varied requirements of the people of the Commonwealth now and to be.

                            <para>- The honorable and learned senator will sing the song of the consumer exclusively perhaps for many years to come. That was the song which was sung by what is known as the American democrat, whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> the other day in making a comparison somehow or other seemed to liken to the Australian democrat. We all know that the basis of the American democratic party was the subordination of the interests of all to the interests of the consumers. It was the corner stone of slavery in the south, and it was the great thing which brought into existence the political republican party who were determined at all hazards that " buy in the cheapest market " should not be the motto adopted by the American people, that the interests of the consumer should not be made primordial, and the interests of everybod}' else subordinate to his, and that the interests of the slave-owner, who merely wished to live on the work of the slave, and to be a consumer, and of a higher order of being than the producer, should not be paramount. Yet we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> apparently applauding the democrat of America, whose whole existence as an integer of political party rests upon principles such as I have referred to, and such as absolute freedom of contract, principles with which I know that honorable gentleman has not the slightest sympathy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> addressed himself at very great length to the ethical and economic advantages that were to be derived from a system of free-trade. </para>

Free interchange does not simply mean free buying, but that is where the mistake is made by those who support the Cobdenite doctrine, and their theoretical conclusions, therefore, have little practical value. We have to recognise that various countries will not buy freely from us, and we have to modify our policy in accordance with existing circumstances- and not in accordance with Utopian ideas. Another mistake into which senators opposite seem to have fallen is that arising from the assumption that existing circumstances are absolutely unalterable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> told us of a visit of inspection which he paid to the Parramatta Woollen Mills, near Sydney. He informed us that these mills were carrying on their business without the assistance of any duty whatever, and that they had Just paid a dividend of G per cent. ; but when he went into the history of the enterprise he was candid enough to admit that the proprietor had told him that the 10 per cent, duty imposed by the Dibbs Government had set the woollen mill-owner upon his legs, and that he was now able to dispense with the duty altogether. But what about other persons who might wish to establish woollen mills in New South Wales? Would a duty of 10 per cent, be imposed specially for the purpose of setting them on their, legs ? Practically the honorable senator asks us to accept existing conditions, as if they were irrevocable. Such -an unalterable state of things might be satisfactory to the gentleman who was " set on his legs." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> also sought by a very nice syllogism to induce us to believe that if we restricted importations "by protective duties, we should prevent ships from coming here with imports, and thus make it more difficult for the primary producer to send away . his produce to the old country, because the less the accommodation, the higher the freights would be. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> really think that Australia is always going to remain .as she is now ? Does he think that when we establish industries to a far greater extent than we have done hitherto, and attract population, we shall still be absolutely and wholly dependent upon outside countries for shipping facilities? Does he imagine that we shall never strike out for ourselves, that we shall never initiate trade on our own account, that we shall always wait for people to come here to trade with us ? That is the fallacy that underlies the arguments of nearly all the free-traders, who look only to the immediate present, and pay little, if any regard, to the future. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> fell into the same blunder when dealing with the position of Tasmania, as was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser. Senator Fraser</inline> said that Tasmania would have to learn to produce for herself more than she does at present. The arguments deduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> were based upon the supposition that Tasmania would remain as she is now, and that there would be no progress whatever. That is the assumption that underlies one-half of the arguments used by the revenue tariffists. I do not intend to indulge in any statistics or quotations. I think that, in very many instances, the statistics furnished in a debate on this fiscal question are very misleading, inasmuch as they are deduced from apparently like conditions in unlike cases. T very often wonder who spend their time least profitably, those who collate such statistics, or those who quote them, because very often comparisons are instituted between countries on bases which are entirely dissimilar. They are just as different as the " democrat " in America and the " democrat " as known in the British Empire, and particularly in Australia. In conclusion, I should just like to say that now that we are approaching the settlement of this .Tariff, we have seriously to ask ourselves why the different States entered the federal union - what were the motives and the considerations that prompted them? Did not each and every one of them know that it was surrendering for evermore its own State right to impose a customs Tariff, not only as against other States but as against the whole of the world? Did they not know that there existed in the larger States manufactures that had been brought into existence, more or less, by customs Tariffs ? We recognised all these circumstances, and when the people of Australia were asked to join the federal union I venture to say there was no cry which resounded through all the States - I except Western Australia, because I know very little of what took place in the campaign there - more than the cry that by entering into federation the people would obtain inter-State free-trade with protection against the outside world. </para>

                            <para>-' - I - I leave honorable senators to judge of the facts for themselves. I know that throughout Tasmania there was not one free-trade newspaper which ventured to suggest that the battle cry I have mentioned was one which the people should not regard. I announced that in principle I was a protectionist, but that I must have regard to the financial exigencies of the States. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> who preceded me, so far as the fiscal fight is concerned, my hands are tied. All protectionists recognise that in this matter their hands are tied just as much as are those of the free-traders. I merely desire to say that if any senator comes to this Parliament entertaining the hope that we are entering upon this union to revolutionize pre-existing institutions without changing them, that we are going to unify six divergent Tariffs and yet leave them producing the same results as they produced previously, he is wandering away in a very hopeless quest. We must recognise, and we did recognise, that the alterations consequent upon the establishment of InterState free-trade and the loss of. revenue occasioned thereby, the alteration of the "State Tariffs against the outside world and the loss of revenue resulting therefrom, the displacement of -trade by substituting the consumption of Australian articles for extra Australian articles aud the loss of customs revenue involved therein, must complicate the financial conditions of the various States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> referred at some length to Tasmania. ' I have taken the trouble to collate a number of duties as they appeared in the Tariff 'in its original form, and to compare them with the duties which existed in Tasmania and those which are imposed by the Tariff' in its present form. What do I find ? In regard to wheat-meal, upon' which' a duty of 20s. per cental operated in Tasmania, the Government proposed to levy Id. per lb., but that amount was reduced to id. per lb. Upon maizena and corn flour, the duty in Tasmania was Id. per lb.; the Government proposed a similar tax, but the amount was reduced to <inline font-style="italic">i.d.</inline> per lb. Upon honey, jams, jellies, and preserved ginger, the duty formerly operative in Tasmania was 2d. per lb.; the Government proposed a similar rate, but the other Chamber reduced it to 1 Jd. per lb. Upon mustard seed a duty of 20 per cent, existed in Tasmania, the Ministry proposed 2d. per lb., but the item was-placed upon the schedule ,of exemptions. Upon rice, uncleaned, the duty in Tasmania was Id. per lb.; the Government proposed to levy 5s. 3d. per cental, which amount was reduced to 3s. 4d. per cental. Upon rice, uncleaned, n.e.i., the Tasmanian duty was Id. per lb.; the Government proposed 8s. '4d. per cental, which amount was reduced to 6s. per cental. Upon rice, uncleaned, for manufacturing starch, the Tasmanian Tariff imposed Id. per lb.; the Ministry proposed 6s. 3d. percental, and the article was.made-.free. Upon salt, a duty of 30s. per ton was operative in Tasmania; the Government submitted a. proposal for 20s. per ton, and the amount was reduced to 12s. 6d. per ton. Polishing soap was taxed in Tasmania at 3d(. per lb.; the Government proposed Id. per lb., but the amount was reduced to Jd. Upon soap, n.e.i., a duty of Id. per lb. was operative in Tasmania ; a similar charge was proposed, by the Government, but the amount was reduced to Jd. per lb. Upon tea a duty of 3d. per lb. was levied in Tasmania ; the Government proposed 2d. and 3d. per lb., but the article was made free. In Tasmania blankets and woollens were taxed at the rate of 20 per cent.; the Government proposed a similar rate, but it was' reduced to 15 per cent. Upon cottons and linens the Tasmanian Tariff imposed 20 per cent.; the Government proposed 10 percent., and the amount was reduced to 5 percent. Tents and tarpaulins were taxed 20 per cent, under the Tasmanians Tariff; a., similar rate was proposed by the Government, but it was reduced to- 5 per cent. </para>

                    <para class="block">Upon ammunition a duty of 9s. 4d. per cwt. waa charged in Tasmania; the Government proposed 7s. 6d. per cwt., but the House of Representatives reduced the amount to 5s. per cwt. Rifles and shot-guns were taxed 20 per cent, in Tasmania ; the Government proposed 15 percent., and the tax operating to-day is only 10 per cent. Lamps and lamp ware were charged 20 per cent, in Tasmania ; the Government proposed a similar rate, but it was reduced to 15 per cent. Upon lead-sheet and lead-piping the Tasmanian Tariff imposed 2s. 6d. per cwt.; the Government proposed a similar amount, but the articles were placed upon the free list. Sheep-shearing machines were charged 10 per cent, in Tasmania; the Government proposed 15 per cent., but these machines are now admitted free. Upon tanks the Tasmanian Tariff levied 20 per cent.; the Government proposed 3s. per 100 gallons, but this item was included in the schedule of exemptions. Similarly, kerosene was charged 6d. per gallon under the Tasmanian Tariff; the Government proposed 3d. per gallon, but the article was exempted from duty. Upon medicines the duty in Tasmania was 20 per cent.; the Government proposed a similar rate, but it was reduced to 15 per cent. Of course I do not expect any State to gets its Tariff adopted absolutely as a model. I am simply pointing out that the proposals of the Government were in absolute conformity with the Tasmanian Tariff in regard to particular lines many of which would not be affected by the establishment of inter-State free-trade, and that those proposals have been modified to the extent to which I have referred. Who has modified them <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Certainly not the Government or their supporters. </para>

                            <para>- They represent a considerable loss, and it was to demonstrate that fact that I selected them from amongst many others in the Tariff. They are articles many of which are not to any great extent affected by the establishment of inter-State free-trade ; the duties were purely revenue-producing, and their reduction must result in a serious loss. </para>

                            <para>- Tasmania would; not import from the mainland, because of the alleged presence in the stock of pleuro-pneumonia, which necessitates six months' quarantine, whereas but 30 days' quarantine are required for cattle from New Zealand. On biscuits, blue, and candles the original duty in Tasmania was 2d., and the Commonwealth Tariff is Id. On cocoa beans, cocoa and chocolate, cocoa butter, caramel butter, and! caramel paste the duty in Tasmania was. 2d., or 20 per cent., whereas the Commonwealth Tariff is id.; the duty on linseed, which was 1 d. per lb. in Tasmania, is reduced to 2s. per cental, and on linseed meal from Id. per lb. to 4s. per cental; and infants'' and invalids' food, n.e.i., was charged 20) per cent, in Tasmania, and is now free.. With regard to protecting local industries it has been pointed out that Tasmania is not a manufacturing State to the extent of some of the others. But there are industries which have evidently been, considered in the' case of Tasmania as of other States. In the case of bacon .the duty in Tasmania was 2d., and it is now 3d. per lb. Bacon-curing is an industry in which Tasmania comes into competition with the colony of New Zealand. In the case of hams and butter there has been a similar increase in the duty, and all this benefits these particular industries, for which we have been reliably assured by high authorities Tasmania is admirably adapted. Hops under the Tasmanian Tariff were subject to a. duty of 3d., but under the Federal Tariff ore-. charged 6d. j. and I suppose no two States are likely to come into competition in this connexion more than Tasmania and New Zealand. Tasmania has a large trade in potatoes, and while her own Tariff was 6d., <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Federal Tariff is ls. Tasmania henceforth will have a free market throughout the Commonwealth for the sale of these products with effective protection against her rival New Zealand. On going carefully through the Tariff as submitted by the Government, and as it left another place, I have come to the conclusion that the difficult task of adjusting the various Tariffs and fixing one uniform Tariff with the idea of raising the revenue necessary to keep the States solvent, and also with the idea of giving encouragement not only to industries in existence,  but  to those for which Australia is well adapted, has been discharged by the Government with as much consideration as was humanly possible in the circumstances. On the whole I regard the Tariff as a fair compromise. We are told that duties :such as those on hats and boots are too  high.  We must remember, however, that according to statements made during this debate, the Victorian Tariff ran up as high as 160 and 180 per cent, on such articles, whereas in Tasmania the duty was only 20 ;per cent. A rise from 20 per cent, to 30 per cent, does not make such a difference as does a drop from 160 per cent, to 30 per cent. The Tariff must be considered as a matter of compromise. Of course I shall be told that with a 30 per cent. Tariff and inter-State freetrade, we  in Tasmania may not import so much  from abroad and the  revenue will suffer.  That statement is cheered by the honorable senator opposite; but did not every elector in Tasmania know that with federal . union there would be inter-State free-trade, and that, no matter what duties might be fixed, results of this character, more or less, must be brought about <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> Are we accentuating these financial disadvantages unnecessarily 1 The interests of every State have to be guarded, and the Government cannot take one State as the criterion for Commonwealth administration. Having considered the Tariff in all its bearings, I am prepared - as a Tasmanian and as an Australian, because the Australian view must not be forgotten in this discussion - to accept it generally as a fair compromise between all the contending interests which have to be regarded. Some of the alterations made in another place are beneficial ; others I cannot regard in the same light. These latter alterations will in the long run be seriously injurious, especially to the less populous States of Queensland and Tasmania. I have to thank the Senate for the patient hearing which they have given to me at this late stage of the debate, I hope that the long discussion we have had on principles will enable us to deal with the Tariff more expeditiously in committee, and thus to give rest and satisfaction to the commercial and trading public of Australia. </para>
