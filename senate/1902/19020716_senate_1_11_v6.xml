                - I think that if anything concerns the privileges of members it is surely the method in which our debates are reported.
            </para>
            <para>The PRESIDENT. - I do not think so. I will read from <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> what the privileges of Parliament are- </para>
            <para>Breaches of privilege may be divided into (1) Disobedience to general orders or rules of either House. </para>

            <para>4. Assaults or insults upon members, or reflections upon their character and conduct in Parliament. </para>
            <para class="block">Those are the four heads into which <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> divides breaches of privilege, and I cannot see that the manner in which the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> officials report our proceedings can be a breach of privilege. The honorable senator has, however, a remedy if he considers that he has a grievance in the manner in which the debates are reported. He can either move a specific motion after notice, or he can move, without notice, that the Senate at its rising adjourn until some particular hour. If the question were a breach of privilege he could not adopt the latter course, because a breach of privilege cannot be dealt with upon such a motion. When a breach of privilege has been committed, the member who brings it forward must move a motion vindicating the power and position of the Senate. The Senate is not a debating society, and it is not consistent with its position or dignity that it should simply talk about a matter and apply no remedy. I think that the honorable senator is not in order in seeking to supersede the ordinary business of debate by bringing under review in this way the manner in which our debates are reported. At the commencement of the session the <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> reporters were placed under the jurisdiction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself, and we gave them certain instructions as to' the manner in which the debates were to be reported. They will continue to obey those instructions until the Senate expresses a wish to the contrary. If the members of the Senate think that the reports are not long enough, it is for them to take action, and until they do so, the officials will obey the instructions which have been given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself. </para>

            <para class="block">In moving this motion I do not wish to be taken as finding fault with the members of the Hansard staff, because I believe that senators generally are indebted to them for the manner in which our speeches are presented to the general public. If our utterances were interspersed with the hems and haws with which we intersperse them, and our grammatical blunders and faulty constructions were set out in full, it would no doubt be considerably to our disadvantage. What I find fault with is that certain personal exchanges between senators are not reported. </para>

                I am inclined to think that they would be more interesting to the electors than some of the arguments occasionally put forward in support of propositions. The particular omission to which I take exception to is this : At a recent evening sitting I challenged
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild--</inline>
            </para>
            <para>SenatorLt.-Col. Neild. - I rise to order. Under Standing Order 48, the motion for the adjournment of the Senate to a particular day can be moved only for the purpose of discussing some matter of urgency. Is this a matter of urgency ? </para>
            <para>The PRESIDENT.- That is a question for the Senate to decide. Of course, any member can object to the debate proceeding, and if such objection is taken the business of the day must be called on. </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS.</inline>
                - I had challenged
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                with having written, to the
                <inline font-style="italic">Australian Star,</inline>
                stating that it would be well for New South Wales to adopt federation, even with a high protective Tariff. He described that statement as a "mendacious" one.

                - The Chairman, so far as I recollect, then said, "Did the honorable senator write anything about blacking ? " And
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                said, " I shall be writing something about blacking somebody's eyes presently."

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                having followed up his remark, that my statement was a "mendacious" one, with the further observation, that he would, perhaps, blacken my eyes showed what the Senate was coming to.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                said, that he did not say that, and I replied that
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                would show. The members of the committee will agree with me that
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                said that my statement was a mendacious one. The Chairman asked me if I deemed that to be a reflection upon myself, and I said, " No" ; that I took higher ground.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>
                Neild. - How can the Senate discuss something which took place in committee, and of which it has no knowledge?
            </para>
            <para>The PRESIDENT. - Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> think it worth while to bring forward this trivial matter ? </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS.</inline>
                - With all deference to you, sir, I do not think it a trivial matter. Every member of the Senate must take full responsibility for his utterances. I am willing to take the responsibility of everything I say, and I think that other honorable senators should be willing to do the same. They should not be in a position to make remarks in this Chamber which are not fully reported in the daily press, and then to disclaim them. Our utterances are sometimes only partially reported in . the press, because there is not space for verbatim reports, and the electors, when they desire to ascertain what actually occurred, naturally go to
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline>
                but when they do so they cannot find there an account of what took place. They could find an account of such observations in the official reports of the State Parliaments", the debates of which are more fully reported than ours are. If people take exception to the length of our reports, the best thing we can do is to reduce the length of our sittings. We have sat three times as long as the duration of an ordinary Parliamentary session, and therefore it is only natural that the reports of our debates should be three times as bulky as the reports of an ordinary session. I was at one time inclined to think that some condensation might well be effected in the reports of debates in committee, but knowing the omissions which have been made, I have come to the conclusion that it would be better for
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                to be an absolutely full record of our proceedings. The other night, when I mentioned that
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                threatened to blacken somebody's eyes, he said - " I did not say that."
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>
                Neild. - Neither did I, and the honorable senator ought to know it.
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS.</inline>
                - The honorable senator did not say that, but he did say something which appeared to me very much like a threat of that nature. I said that
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                would show whether he said it, but
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                does not show. The observation he made was, "Ishall, perhaps, be writing something about blackening somebody's eyes."
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>
                Neild. - I did not say that. The honorable senator should stick to the truth.
            </para>
            <para>The PRESIDENT. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> must not say that. </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS.</inline>
                - We must make allowance for
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline>
                heat in this matter. I can prove that the statement was made, and I challenge
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                to call for the original proofs of the debate to substantiate what I say. "When the proof of roy speech came to 'me, I read it to
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline>
                and I said, " I was right about what
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                said." But when I referred to the printed and bound copy of
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                I found that the remarks were not recorded there.
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline>
                - Quite right.
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS.</inline>
                -
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline>
                may wish that the Senate should appear before the public as an immaculate body of men, but I desire that it should appear as it really is. If honorable senators indulge in undignified threats, the public should know it. It is only fair to us that the electors whom we represent should be made aware of the treatment we receive in the Senate.
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline>
                - -The honorable senator has received fair treatment, I think.
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS.</inline>
                - I leave it to the honorable and learned senator ' to imagine what would happen to me,- if I were a particularly thin-skinned and nervous man, under the threats of such an august and herculean personage as
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline>
                Some honorable senators are positively afraid of that belligerent gentleman.

            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>
                Dobson - The honorable senator should speak for himself.

            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS.</inline>
                - I am not speaking for the honorable and learned senator. He has given us an excellent idea of the abundant courage he possesses, so that it is not necessary for me to speak ou his behalf. Exchanges sometimes take place here between honorable senators which throw the speaker off his subject, and prevent him from presenting his case as well as he otherwise would be able to do. When speakers are thus interfered with, it is only fair that the interruption should appear in
                <inline font-style="italic">Howard,</inline>
                so that their constituents may gain some idea of the work they have to do, and the difficulties which present themselves.
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>
                McGREGOR (South Australia). - I second the motion, and desire to support to a very great extent the statements made by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline>
                I would point out that, as far as the affair between
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                and
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                is concerned, the latter honorable senator need not take the matter to heart, because it is not with any feeling of animosity towards him that
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                has brought this subject forward.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                and myself, ns well as many others, think that the public are as much entitled to know ' of the ability, the discretion, the courage, and the courteous conduct exhibited by their representatives as they are to be informed whether senators are imbecile or idiotic. The people have a right to know everything that goes on here, and it is for that reason that I- consider that the
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                reports of our proceedings should be as nearly as possible (a correct record of what really takes place. If the
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                is to be corrected out of all resemblance to a record of what actually takes place, it will lose its value. If it is to be a mere record of the motions proposed and the decisions arrived at it will be an entirely superfluous publication, because we have the ordinary parliamentary journals which give all that information. It is desirable, however, that
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                should be. a "record of such a. character as will show the people of Australia the general conduct and ability of their representatives. I am sure that if you,
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline>
                made some remarks, either in committee, or upon the second reading of a Bill, or upon any other question, you would like to see them reported. You might moke remarks having a particular meaning, which could be understood only by those to whom' your statements were directed, and yet, under present conditions, the whole responsibility of deciding whether these remarks should be reported or not is thrown upon the
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                staff. I am sure that you will regard that as scarcely fair.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline>
                may think that some of the little irregularities which take place here are entirely undignified, but we have to remember that other people may hold a different opinion. Therefore I hope that steps will be taken to secure a full report of our proceedings, irrespective of the eternal cry which we hear about economy. I am fully convinced that, as far as the Commonwealth Parliament is concerned, our arrangements for reporting and printing are as economical as those which exist in connexion with any State Parliament. The people who eternally cry out about the undue length of the
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                reports pay no consideration to the fact that we have been fifteen months in session, and have been meeting three and four days a week, instead of, as in the case of some State Houses, perhaps one day per week during the earlier part of the session. If these facts were taken into account the public would hold an entirely different idea as to what is being done here, and I hope that some attention will be paid to the representations now being made. Neither
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                nor myself have anything to say against the ability or integrity of the gentlemen who are carrying out the
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                work. We know that they are able and willing to do what is right, and I am sure we all have confidence in them.

            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON</inline>
                (Tasmania). - I should be sorry to think that you,
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline>
                or any of the public outside, should for one moment rest under the impression that the two honorable senators who have just spoken have in any way voiced the opinion of the majority in the Senate. Nothing could be. more suicidal or wasteful of public money than a determination on the part of this Senate that
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                should record the numerous silly and stupid interjections that have been made during the discussion of the Tariff. When we recollect that
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                and
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline>
                have interjected probably more silly remarks than the whole of the other members of the Senate put together it is rather--
            </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline>
                Largie. - I rise to a point of order. I desire to know whether the honorable and learned senator is in order in stating that certain honorable senators have made silly and stupid remarks ?
            </para>
            <para>The PRESIDENT. - I am not prepared to call the honorable and learned senator to order. I have frequently heard remarks made by honorable members in other Parliaments characterized as silly. </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOBSON.</inline>
                - I do not desire to say anything that might be considered impertinent, but I wish to Speak the truth. I assert that more silly and stupid interjections have been made by honorable senators in the labour corner - interjections which have had nothing whatever to do with the subject under discussion and which have been utterly irrelevant and absolutely out of order - than have emanated from the whole of the other members of the Senate. It savours of cant and insincerity for
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                to complain about the interjections which have been made against himself. With regard to the one point which
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                desired to have noticed, I wish to express an absolutely contrary opinion to that voiced by him. You,
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline>
                and the Chairman, have told us again and again that all interjections are out of order, and I hope the day will never come when
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                will record any interjections whatever, unless they are strictly relevant to the question before us. If interjections are relevant they are equally out of order; but we know that, according to an unwritten law of Parliament, they are allowed, and that they are also of the greatest use in assisting in the elucidation of the matter under discussion. I hope that interjections which bear upon the matter before the Chair will be recorded if the reporters have time; but I shall oppose any suggestion that all silly and stupid interjections of a personal character, which have nothing to do with the question before us, should be placed on record. I hope that, if there is any chance of such a thing being brought about, other honorable senators will express their opinions against the proposal.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline>
                If his desire were achieved he would be able, whenever it so pleased him, to make a left-handed attack upon honorable senators who sit in the labour corner, who would have no opportunity of replying. The honorable and learned senator has stated that more silly, stupid, and irrelevant interjections have emanated from honorable senators in this corner than from honorable senators in any other part of the House. That is a charge which will appear in
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline>
                and will go forth to the public who will be led to suppose that the labour senators are a little clique of silly, stupid, and irrelevant interjectors. No stronger argument could have been adduced for reporting all interjections, so that the' public might be allowed to judge for themselves whether certain honorable senators' come within the category maintained by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline>
                We do not want charges of this kind made whilst the interjections complained of do not appear in
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline>
                There has been a great deal said about the cost of
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline>
                but I think we should, in our own defence, insist upon as complete a report of our proceedings as it is possible to give in
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline>
                Honorable senators are subject not only to the misrepresentations of their fellow members - we have had an example of it here to-day - but they are also exposed to misrepresentation at the hands of the press and of the public. We ought to be prepared to stand or fall by our utterances, but if our statements are not reported, is it not possible that a cloud of false witnesses may arise against us, and disseminate gross and erroneous information throughout the country with regard not only to our actions but to our words. In our own defence, and in order to maintain our own integrity, we ought to insist upon being reported as fully as possible. As to the COSt of
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline>
                I could suggest a hundred different ways in which the expenses of government might very well be minimized" without loss to the community or clanger to the representatives who have been chosen by the electors of the Commonwealth to conduct their business, and whose words ought to be conveyed to the people. I could point out a hundred cases in which useless expenditure might be dispensed with, if economy were- the sole consideration. I agree with
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline>
                that it is extremely desirable that interjection's should be reported, and that there should be as little editing of
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                as possible. I believe that there is a good deal of this going on at the present time, but I hope it will not continue. No man should say anything here that he would be ashamed of outside. If the reporting were more verbatim in character, honorable senators, I dare say, would be more careful in their treatment of their fellow members. In the interests of the preservation of that courtesy which every honorable senator should exhibit towards his fellows, I think it is desirable that the reporting should be as full as possible.

                LARGIE (Western Australia). - I should have been satisfied to remain silent upon this occasion - seeing that only Senators Higgs and Neild are directly interested in the matter which has been brought forward - but for the quite uncalled for observations of
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline>
                When a question of this sort is under discussion I think it is going a little too far for the honorable and learned senator to seize the opportunity to make direct attacks upon senators who are not concerned with the main question, and to stigmatize the remarks of the members of the labour corner as " silly." Such a course of conduct evidences the animus which
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline>
                never misses an opportunity of exhibiting towards members of the labour party.

                LARGIE.- No ; the honorable and learned senator applied them to every member who sits in the labour corner. Of course, we all understand that during' the heat of debate honorable senators sometimes make observations which they would not make in their calmer moments. But if any honorable senator, upon reflection, desired that such remarks should be omitted from
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline>
                he would merely have to rise in his place and express a wish to that effect, thus showing that he was sorry for having made them, and the Senate would doubtless be willing that they should be excised. But honorable senators ought not to be . allowed the privilege of editing what they have previously said, and, therefore, I quite agree that the reports should be as full as possible. I hope that when a matter of this, kind again comes before this Chamber,
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline>
                will be careful to avoid making such charges as he has made this afternoon.

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>
                NEILD (New South Wales). - It appears from what has just been uttered by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DeLargie</inline>
                that some people entertain the very erroneous impression that the excision of what is alleged to have been recorded in the proof slips of
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                was in some way due to myself. I am sure that no one knows better than the President that it is quite impossible for any member of the Senate to eliminate  anything from
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline>
                or to alter the reports in any way. Honorable senators are merely allowed to correct their own utterances. I know nothing whatever about this matter. Until I saw the
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                report, I did not know whether the incident to which
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                has referred had been recorded or not. But from the remarks of some senators, not only should
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                be a verbatim report of everything that is uttered, stupid or otherwise, jocular or the reverse, but it seems to me that it ought to be illustrated, and some member of the staff should be specially told off to write descriptive side notes for the purpose of adding effect to the report. Unless details such as I have indicated are given, even with verbatim reporting, it will be impossible to convey to readers- - if there be any persons left in the community who are insane enough to peruse these reports - whether or not a remark was made in anger. In my view this matter has been brought forward as a piece of jocularity by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs.</inline>
                In the course of his remarks he has given very good reasons for my entertaining that view. He has raised this question partly as a joke, and partly in the hope that by misrepresenting me as much as possible, even considering the license that is permitted in Parliament, he may do me some vague form of injury. To begin with, the whole incident arose from a statement which was repeated by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline>
                - a statement which he could not have made from his own personal knowledge. Therefore, I am justified in saying that he repeated here one of the most absolute of falsehoods. He stated that I wrote a letter of a certain character to the
                <inline font-style="italic">Australian Star,</inline>
                advocating protection. As I never wrote such a letter to
                <inline font-style="italic">theStar,</inline>
                and as the Star never published it, it is quite clear that
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                must have spoken from hearsay, and I say again that the statement which he repeated in this Chamber is absolutely an untruth. I do not charge
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                with falsehood, but with repeating a falsehood. That statement had previously been made in this Chamber, and I had contradicted it, and I must ask that, in accordance with parliamentary rule, my contradiction and assurance shall be accepted. I object to senators continually flinging at me a statement which I assert has been concocted by some one whom I can characterize only as a liar. I never wrote such a letter to the
                <inline font-style="italic">Star ;</inline>
                I have contradicted the statement again and again, and I hope it will not be repeated in the future. Now, as to what took place the other night.When
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                asserted that I had written this letter, I did interject that his statement was a "mendacious" one, and this I repeat. It was the repetition of a falsehood. The question before the committee at the time was that of the duty on blacking and other articles. The Chairman, addressing
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline>
                said - "Never mind what the honorable senator wrote about that matter, but did he write anything about blacking ? " Thereupon I was guilty of a very poor joke, and that is the whole of my offence. I interjected, more by way of reply to the  Chairman  than to
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                - " I may have written something about blacking some one's eyes." I did not say " blackening," but " blacking," and thus perpetrated a very bad joke.
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                then complained that I had threatened to blacken some one's eyes. I denied the charge, and he expressed himself as greatly relieved that I did not intend to do any senator personal injury. Commencing with the unintentional repetition of a falsehood by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs,</inline>
                and on my part a very bad joke--

                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt. -Col. NEILD.</inline>
                - Yes, and that is why I am explaining it at the present time. Necessarily what I said was uttered in anything but an angry manner, and I cannot see what advantage can accrue to Parliament or the public by spending half-an-hour in discussing an incident which ought not to have taken place. Beyond that I have nothing to say, except that I should like the President, in view of what has been said, to make inquiries from the chief of the
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                staff, with a view of ascertaining whether I had anything whatever to do with the excision of the incident in question from the official report. It is only just to myself, particularly in view of the remarks of
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline>
                Largie, that the President should make such an inquiry, and if it is found that I was in any way responsible for the alteration of the report, I hope he will acquaint the Senate with the fact. I do not think it to the advantage of the public that every little exchange of jocularity, or heat, should be published at the public expense. The public do not crave for it. If anything of a spicy character takes place, the press always find space for it, even if they have not space for more solid matter, because it is usually regarded as being a little more attractive to the genera] reader.

                - It is all very well for Senators Dobson or Neild to say that it originated in a bad joke, but honorable senators can judge whether or not it was a joke by the earnestness with which Senator Neild dealt with the suggestion that he had written a certain letter to the
                <inline font-style="italic">Australian Star.</inline>
                He declared that that statement was an absolute falsehood, and that he could only characterize the writer of it as a liar. Of course we must not judge by appearances but at the time
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                uttered his alleged joke, he will pardon me for saying that he looked most ferocious. Of course
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline>
                does not want a Hansard at all, because he has stated that he does not think it is very necessary. Members of the labour party, however, regard Hansard as the greatest protection which honorable senators can have. I can quite imagine a case in which a majority of Members of Parliament might combine to browbeat and threaten some other members to such an extent that the latter would scarcely dare to open their mouths. I take the view that if any honorable senator utters a threat, even in the form of a joke, it ought to be reported, because it may protect the Senate by preventing it from getting beyond the joking stage. We can well understand that the free use of threats might develop into something serious, although, as a rule, we are not a very belligerent body.

If we have been guilty of silly and inane interjections, and of cant and insincerity, the fact should be made known to the electors as far as possible. I do not take the view that we are guilty of such conduct.

                mathematical discoveries ; and I really believe that when the honorable senator's brain ultimately comes to be examined, in the interests of science, each lobe will be found to be full of figures.

                - Is
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline>
                in order in introducing fresh matter when speaking in reply?
            </para>
            <para>The PRESIDENT.- I have already twice asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> to confine himself to the question at issue. We have business to perform in the Senate, and the question before us ought to be disposed of as soon as possible. </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS.</inline>
                - Will you permit me, sir, with all respect, to ask what is the question at issue ?
            </para>
            <para>The PRESIDENT. - The question at issue is that of the non-reporting of an interjection made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild.</inline> That, I understand, was the question originally brought forward. I do not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> must confine himself absolutely to that question, but he must only refer to other interjections, reported or not reported, by way of illustration. I do not think the honorable senator ought to wander over the reporting of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> from the commencement of the session. </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS.</inline>
                - If the general impression of the Senate is that I brought this matter up merely to obtain the publication of an interjection by
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline>
                such an impression is erroneous. My object is to have in
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                a complete record of our proceedings in the Senate and in committee. If people complain of the length of the
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                reports, they must consider the length of the session. I have no desire to reflect on
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson.</inline>
                I am only too glad he had an opportunity of defending himself.
            </para>
            <para>The PRESIDENT. - I must really ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> to obey my ruling. The question before us is not whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> had an opportunity of defending himself, but whether or not the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports are correct or incorrect. </para>
            <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS.</inline>
                - I do not want to debate this matter at any length by taking exception to the President's ruling. I must, however, reiterate that I did not submit this motion with a view of getting this particular interjection of
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild's</inline>
                published, but to endeavour to secure, in the interest of honorable senators and of the general public, full reports of the parliamentary debates. The general public refer to
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                to see what takes place here on a given night. In conclusion, I am perfectly willing, as I have no doubt other honorable senators are, to take the responsibility for all my utterances, whether they be ridiculous, inane, silly or wise, relevant or irrelevant, lengthy or brief. I have been sent here by the electors, for whom I shall, do my best, and they, in judging of my conduct, will be guided by the
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                reports. I do not agree with honorable senators who say that the
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                reports, should be condensed. If the reports are to be condensed in one part, and full in another, then let an intimation be given as to which plan has been adopted in regard to each speech. At the present time, the feeling in the public mind is that
                <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>
                is an absolute record of what takes place in Parliament. I ask leave to withdraw the motion.
            </para>
            <para>The PRESIDENT. - Before putting the question, I wish to state that I take the full responsibility on myself. This is not a matter for the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters, who simply obey instructions. It is considered necessary to curtail the length of the reports in committee, and, to that end, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters have been instructed to leave out all irrelevant interjections. It seems to me that this debate has shown how necessary it is to strictly apply the standing orders, and prevent interjections, especially when these have nothing to do with the question at issue. I believe I am correct in saying that it is the custom in the New South Wales Parliament to record irrelevant interjections only when they elicit a ruling from the Chair, or are subsequently debated. The question now is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> have leave to withdraw his motion. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be apparent to those who have studied the matter, and looked at the Tariffs which prevailed in the various States, that 30 per cent., which is equivalent to 33 per cent., is not a fair compromise. The Victorian duty on men's boots was 60s. per dozen ; and the Queensland and South Australian duty 33s. per dozen, or a little more than half that of Victoria. On women's boots the Victorian duty was 45s. per dozen, and the Queensland and South Australian duties 19s. 6d., or absolutely less than one-half that of Victoria. In Western Australia there were varying rates averaging about 15 per cent., while in Tasmania all. boots had to pay an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 20 percent. On girls' boots the Victorian duty was 36s. per dozen, and the Queensland and South Australian duty 16s., which is again less than half. In Victoria the duty on boys' boots was 30s. per dozen as against a duty of 1 7s. 6d. in Queensland and South Australia. On another class of girls' boots the duty in Victoria was 34s., as against11s. 6d. in Queensland and South Australia. In the face of these figures I contend that the duty of 20 per cent, would be a fairer compromise than the duty of 30 per cent, proposed by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I have not worked out the percentage, but I have worked it out sufficiently to know that 20 per cent, is a fair compromise, if we take the duties in all the States into consideration. I am glad to deal, with this industry, because the more it is studied the more interesting it becomes. It should be a great object lesson to the protectionists of Victoria. If they are not blind, and will try to look at the matter with an open mind, and realize the facts of the case, they will get some useful lessons as to the injury and the harm which ultra-protection has been doing in this State. I hold in my hand a return of the duties which the Victorian Legislature have thought fit to impose on boots since 1865. Strange to say, in that year boots and shoes were duty free. In 1866 a duty of 4s. per cubic foot was imposed. In 1867 there was imposed a moderate revenue duty of 10 per cent., which lasted down to 1871. During all that time the factories which had started under absolute free-trade were progressing and increasing their output, and, of course, employing more men. In 1871, the duty was raised from 10 to 20 per cent, and it lasted until 1874, when they substituted a specific for the <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty. In 1875, the duty per dozen pairs was fixed at 25s. on men's boots, 14s. on women's boots, 15s. on youths' boots,11s. on boys' and girls' boots, and so on down to children's boots. In 1879, the duty per dozen pairs was raised on men's boots from 25s. to 33s., on women's boots from 14s. to 19s. 6d., on youths' boots from 15s. to 21s., on girls' boots from 11s. to 16s., and on boys' boots from11s. to 1 7s. 6d. I suppose that during this time the factories were improving and increasing in number, but let it be borne in mind that they started under free-trade, and progressed enormously under a moderate revenue duty. In 1889 the duties were still further increased. The duty per dozen pairs was increased on men's boots from 33s. to 45s., on women's boots from 19s. 6d. to 28s. 6d., on youths' boots from 21s. to 30s., on girls' boots from 16s. to 22s., and on boys' boots from 1 7s. 6d. to 23s. 6d. These rates were continued until 1892, when the highest duties, as we know them to-day, were imposed. I take it that the rates could only have been raised year after year, because the protectionists had absolutely captured the Legislature of the State, and from the cries and pleadings which a number of protectionist representatives now utter, I can quite understand the fallacious arguments which were brought to bear on that Legislature. Before I pass on, </para>

                <para class="block">I shall compare Victoria with the formerly free-trade State of New South Wales. The comparison becomes intensely interesting from the point of view of this everlasting fiscal issue, and it shows most conclusively that the utterances of protectionist senators on other items, if repeated on this item, are absolutely falsified by what has taken place year after year in the adjoining State. According to a return which was laid on the table of the House of Representatives at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knox,</inline> in 1899 the boot factories numbered 79 in New South Wales and 105 in Victoria. The men and women employed numbered 3,510 in New South Wales, and 4,288 in Victoria. The value of the machinery employed in the 79 factories of the mother State was £77,939, and in the 105 factories of Victoria it was only £70,300 odd. The output was 3,400,000 odd pairs in New South Wales as against 2,900,000 odd pairs in Victoria. In 1900 the factories numbered 94 in New South Wales, and 108 in Victoria. The employes numbered 3,959 in New South Wales, and 4,812 in Victoria, being 525 more in the latter than in the former. The machinery column is again interesting, because the 94 factories in New South Wales had machinery worth £82,000, while the 106 factories in Victoria had machinery worth only £78,000. The output of the factories of the mother State under free-trade was 3,657,000 pairs as against 3,44-6,000 in Victoria. How do my protectionist friends account for the fact that while the imports of New South Wales were almost ten times more than those of Victoria, - certainly the population of New South Wales was 15 per cent, more than that of Victoria - and the employes 525 more in Victoria than in New South Wales, the New South Wales factories turned out 211,000 pair of boots more than did the factories of Victoria ? </para>

                        <para>- That is one answer to my question. In New South Wales the factories must be better organized. There must be more work got out of the men there must be less of the half-time system ; in every way the factories of that State must be superior; and the workmen, I presume, must be more skilled, or better managed, or there must be more of that canny system that we hear so much of at home. The people here, thinking that they have an enormous protection to bolster them up, do not put forth the same energies as others who have to fight their way without a duty. Unconsciously to themselves the workers of Victoria are less energetic, less industrious, and less skilful than are the workers in some other places. I have read the statement in <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> that the wages in New South Wales average about 6d. per week less than the wages in Victoria; but when we go into the question we find that two or three large factories in New South Wales - one of which is larger than any factory in Victoria - pay higher wages than have been fixed by the Victorian Wages Board. But in some of the factories in New South Wales, which have gone back, and which are now crying out for protection, the wages have been and are falling, and that accounts for the difference. If we take the two or three largest factories in the mother State and the two or three largest factories in Victoria, we find that the wages paid in the former are quite equal to, if not larger than, those paid in the latter. I quite admit that on the whole the wages paid in Victoria are higher than those paid in the mother State. </para>

                        <para>- If protectionists are going to argue that the wages paid in Victoria are higher than those paid in New South Wales, all I have to say is that the workmen of the latter State, for less wages, do more work, and turn out more goods than do the higher-paid men here. Honorable senators may get over some of the difficulties, but they cannot get over all these facts. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so, and leather was free in New South Wales. I believe that a 30 per cent, duty will cripple our revenue to a very great extent. This being an article of common use, we might reasonably hope to get a very large revenue from it without doing any harm to the factories. The estimate of revenue for the year is about £68,000, and from some figures which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> showed me yesterday, I think that the importations for a period of eight months come to about £40,000 or £41,000. But what is the use of bothering our heads about estimates where we have reliable data that, with a very small duty, the revenue ought to be £200,000 or £300,000. It certainly would be over £200,000 with a 20 per cent. duty. In 1900 the imports of boots into New South Wales, where there was no duty, were £464,000, and into Victoria, with an enormous duty, only £49,871. The imports into Queensland, where the duty was about one-half . less than the Victorian duty, were £69,577. The imports into South Australia, where the duty was also one-half less than the Victorian duty, were £62,194. The imports into Western Australia, where the duty averaged about 15 per cent., were £1 08,375. The imports into Tasmania, where the duty was 20 per cent., were £46, 205. In that year the imports into all the States forming the Commonwealth were £800,910, of which £355,896 worth came from Great Britain, £218,339 from the United States, £179,144 from the other Australian colonies, £28,138 from Germany, and £8,288 from other European countries. In view of those figures the talk about Chinese and Japanese competition may be put on one side, because we have imported hardly any boots from those countries. It is perfectly certain that under the duty proposed in the Tariff the importation of boots must decrease. There are boot factories in all the States, most of them equipped with up-to-date machinery, and capable of turning out good articles, so that the competition will be very keen. In this connexion the following extract from the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of the 10th July is exceedingly interesting : - </para>

                <para class="block">O'Connor and his officials are wrong in saying that a reduction of the duty upon boots will bring about a reduction in the revenue. There can be no getting away from the facts which I have just quoted. Even when every allowance is made for the loading up which took place before the declaration of the Tariff, the decrease in the importations is very large. </para>

                        <para>- It could not account for it. Of course, all figures of this kind must he taken <inline font-style="italic">cum grano salis</inline> . I wish now to give the committee some more facts which tell against the policy adopted in protectionist Victoria, and in favour of the free-trade policy of the mother State of New South Wales. In 1900 Victoria exported goods to the value of £61,463, and New South Wales to the value of £25,931. But upon analyzing those figures it will be found that the free-trade State of New South Wales did a larger export business in protected markets than did the boasted protected State of Victoria. The difference in exports is explained by the fact that while Victorian boots were admitted duty free in New South Wales, the boots of the latter State were excluded from Victoria by prohibitive duties. As a result only £71 worth of boots made in New South Wales were imported into Victoria, while the latter State sent £43,605 worth of its boots into New South Wales. Apart front this trade between the two States, the export of locally-manufactured boots was greater from New South Wales than from Victoria, the exportation from New South Wales being £25,860, and from Victoria, £17,858. </para>

                        <para>- I have already pointed out that these figures must be taken <inline font-style="italic">cum grano salis</inline> - that allowances must be made. But other honorable senators have trotted out similar figures, and, therefore, I wish to give these figures for what they are worth, - to show that the fears of my Victorian friends are unfounded, and that if they tried to walk alone, and became more self-reliant, it would be better for them. I contend that boots and shoes do not require heavy protection on the ground that they represent a large cost in labour. The industry has been a strong one in all the States for many years past. In Victoria it has been coddled and fostered for 30 years, so that the factories here should be, and, I believe, are, up-to-date. Therefore, I hope that instead of making the duties upon boots higher than they were in New South Wales, Tasmania, and Western Australia, and about on a par with what they were in South Australia and Queensland, they will be reduced in order that the Commonwealth may. obtain a little more revenue, while the industry is at the same time' given a moderate amount of protection. In the engineering trade, where the cost of labour represents about 60 per cent, of the price of the finished article, we have given a protection amounting to about 20 per cent. In boiler-making, the cost of labour is equal to about 50 per cent, of the price of the finished article, and we have given a protection of 15 per cent. We have given the same amount of protection to the manufacturers of woollens, and a protection of 20 per cent, to the manufacturers of apparel, while it is proposed to give to the manufacturers of boots, who have to pay in labour only from 25 to 30 per cent, of the price of the finished article, a protection of from 30 to 33 per cent. Therefore, from whatever point of view it is looked at, the duty appears to be an unfair compromise. I think Ministers would have done better if they had kept to their original idea of not having higher duties than 25 per cent., and the fewer of those the better. A duty of 30 per cent, is, in my judgment, a blot upon any Tariff. In , New Zealand the duty is only 22½ per cent., but there are a considerable number of factories which are doing well. In Canada the duty is 25 per cent. ; in France about 2s.1d. per pair on men's boots, and about 9¾d. a pair upon shoes. In Germany it is about 8d. per pair upon men's boots, and about 4d. per pair on shoes. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but Germany is also one of the closely-protected nations. In 1882 New South Wales, under a duty of 5 per cent., imported boots to the value of £635,596, or at the rate of about 15s. 6½d. per head of the population. In 1883 she imported boots to the value of £571,402, or at the rate of 13s.1¾d. per head of the population ; in 1884 she imported boots to the value of £581,820, or at the rate of 12s. 7½d. per head of the population. In 1 898 the importation was reduced to a value of £316,650, or at the rate of 4s. 8½d. per head of the population, and in 1899 to £348,295, or at the rate of about 5s. 1½d. per head of the population. With absolute freedom of trade the importations into New South Wales decreased and the local factories more than held their own against the competition of foreign, manufacturers. If any advocate of protection can explain those facts so as to make them support his policy I shall be glad to hear him, but, in my opinion, they show that free-trade has benefited the boot industry of New South Wales, while protection has so coddled the industry in Victoria as to make it unsound and unhealthy. Shortly after the duty of 60s. per dozen was placed upon boots in Victoria, men with insufficient capital and knowledge of business started factories all over the State, and within from 12 to 24 months many of these factories could not pay their way, and the industry was brought into discredit. Surely we do not want to repeat that state of affairs. The duty of 30 per cent., which is equivalent to a duty of 33 per cent., is, in some instances, higher than the Victorian State duties. For instance, the duty upon an American boot valued at 21s. is now one-third, or 7s., whereas the highest duty in Victoria was 5s. per pair. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> desires to fix some rate below that which was previously collected in Victoria, and one which would be a fair and just compromise between the Tariffs of all the States. Take the case of American boots at 24s. per pair - that is an enamelled kid boot, with a hard toe - a few of which are imported. The duty upon these would be 8s. per pair as against 5s. under the Victorian Tariff. Women's 13s. 6d. boots were subject to a duty of 3s. 9d. per pair under the Victorian Tariff, but now bear an impost of 4s. 6d. Therefore, in these leading lines in men's boots and women's boots, the duty of 33 per cent, represents more than that which was previously collected in Victoria, and is not a fair compromise. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but even on the lowest quality of boots a high duty is levied. It will be sufficient to stop the importation of women's boots worth between 2s. and 4s. per pair, and men's boots worth from 4s. to 6s. per pair. Not only is the duty of 30 per cent, excessive, but the import charges range from8 to 20 per cent. The average is probably 10 or 12½ per cent., but on the lowest class of goods the charges would amount to 15,18, or even 20 per cent. Supposing that it case of boots containing 50 pairs, worth 10s. per pair, were imported, the freight charges would, perhaps, represent a reasonable amount ; but upon a consignment of 50 pairs, worth 2s., 3s., or 4s. per pair, the freight would represent a very much larger percentage. The protection afforded by import charges is far more than honorable senators generally recognise. If a trader buys local boots, he can order in small quantities, and select the sizes according to immediate market requirements ; but those who have to import boots have to send home their orders six, nine, or twelve months in advance, and the goods remain on their hands a long time. Therefore, the charges for rent and interest are much higher in the case of the imported article, and that tends to increase the protection given by the import charges. The protection under a duty of 20 per cent, would amount in reality to from 36 to 40 per cent., whereas the present rate affords a protection ranging from 46 to 50 per cent., and that seems absolutely unreasonable. I hope honorable senators will look at the veal facts of the case, and realize that a high protective duty will cause a material loss of revenue which three at least of the States urgently require. </para>

                    <para>- I always admire my honorable friend's speeches upon freetrade, and his clear exposition of its principles. He applies those principles most rigidly to the continental States, and allows the kindly feeling in his heart to qualify them in some degree where any little industry in Tasmania is concerned. He reminds me very much of Hamlet's description of his own madness. </para>

                <para class="block">When I listen to my honorable friend's clear exposition of the principles of freetrade, and his denunciation of any duty over 30 per cent, as being outrageous - I need not mention any item - I cannot help thinking of Tasmania. Coming to the question that my honorable friend has dealt with very concisely and ably, the first point that presents itself is the matter of revenue. We have to deal with the same problem that has previously presented itself over and over again during the Tariff discussion, namely, to provide a duty which will yield a reasonable amount of revenue, and at the same time afford fair protection. I contend that this duty fulfils both requirements. In the first place, how has it affected the collections, and how does the revenue derived under it compare with that received under the State Tariffs? In 1899 the total revenue collected under this item in the whole of the States was £43,169. That did not include anything from New South Wales, where boots were admitted free of duty. Supposing, however, that we allow for New South Wales £20,000, which is something like double the amount received in Victoria during that year, the total revenue under the State Tariffs would amount to £63,000. We have returns of the collections of duty under the Federal Tariff for eight months. During a portion of that time the duties in force were higher in regard to some classes of boots and lower in respect to others. The specific duty was in force from October to 6th March, and after that an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty of 30 per cent, was levied. The amount collected under item 116 was £42,093; and under item 117, £17,336 ; making a total of £59,429, or, roughly speaking, £60,000 for the eight months. Taking that as a fair basis, . we may assume that the total collections for the year would be something like £90,000 or nearly £30,000 more than the amount I have stated as representing the revenue collected under the State Tariffs in 1899. How can it be complained, therefore, that the present duty does not yield a substantial amount of revenue? I admit that if our only object were to obtain revenue it would be much better to reduce the duties to 10 or even 5 per cent., but, as I have before pointed out, our aim is to obtain revenue without the destruction of existing industries, and I think the figures I have quoted prove that this object has been attained. Before any attempt is made to obtain mora revenue by a reduction of the duties, it will be necessary to consider to some extent the position of the industry which will be affected. </para>

                        <para>- -I do not know whether Tasmania will derive more revenue, because her case is complicated by the importations from Victoria and New South Wales. There was a duty in Tasmania prior to federation against goods introduced from those States, but now that Inter-State trade is free, it is possible that the importations from America and the United Kingdom will diminish, and that the importations from New South Wales and Victoria will correspondingly increase. I do not say that Tasmania will receive more revenue. She may, on the whole, obtain less because of the displacement of importations from abroad by goods introduced from the other States. </para>

                        <para>- That maybe, but I am speaking generally of the revenue of Australia under this item, and there is no question about the correctness of what I have stated. I admit at once that if our manufactures grow, there must be a falling-off in the revenue, but even allowing for that, there is a great deal of difference between the revenue actually received by the States before federation and that which is now being collected. That is to say, there is a margin of between £20,000 and £30,000 with which to make allowance for any difference that may be made in the revenue by reason of the increase of local production. If we were considering the question of revenue alone, there might be a very great deal in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has said regarding the wisdom of reducing the proposed duty. No doubt a lower duty would yield more revenue : but it would do so only by displacing our own productions. Because we find in framing, this Tariff that we are faced bv a large  number of interests connected with the boot industry throughout Australia, we are bound to consider how our proposed legislation will affect those interests. I think that the honorable and learned senator and 'myself may very well agree in a general way as to the number of factories which exist throughout the Commonwealth. When I speak of " interests " I refer in the first place to the capital, labour, and skill which have been invested in the industry, and in the second to the interests of the immense number who find 'employment in it all over Australia. I find that in 1899 the total number thus employed was 11,224. </para>

                        <para>- Victoria employs 4,304 and New South Wales 3,227. Those are the latest figures. I am not now dealing, however, with this question from the point of view of contrast, but from that of the interests involved. When we have to deal with 218 factories, with the capital that has been invested in them, and with more than 11,000 employes, we are bound to consider how legislation will affect existing conditions. It may be that it is unnecessary to grant to the industry more than a certain measure of protection foi- the purpose of enabling it to be carried on successfully. But we must also consider that in Victoria a number of these factories are carrying on so prosperously that, not only have they been able to raise the wages of their employes to the highest possible standard, but the Legislature has thought it right to interfere to secure the permanence of those wages. We must further recollect the condition of affairs in New South Wales,- where the wages paid are in some instances higher than those paid in Victoria, although in the great bulk of cases they are lower. We must also consider not only whether the protection which we propose to grant is sufficient to enable these different businesses to be profitably carried on, but whether it is sufficient to allow of them being conducted in such a way as to ensure the payment of a reasonable wage to the operatives - such a wage as will enable them to live up to the standard of comfort which in the past they have- been able to enjoy. That is one of the reasons why I so strongly object to some free-, trade doctrines which measure everything simply from the standpoint of how much it is going to cost- which reduce everything to the attainment of the utmost amount of cheapness. I hold that the other considerations merit our close attention. Social considerations come into play in connexion with this question, and we have to look at the loss or gain to the nation as a whole. It may be found upon analysis that it is very much better that persons who desire to wear American or English boots should be made to pay a little more for them, if thereby we give permanent employment to our own people and enable them to live up to a higher standard of comfort and happiness. I point to these considerations simply for the purpose of showing that we cannot fix a duty by merely adopting the arithmetical process of taking the duties that formerly existed and striking an average. Many other points have to be remembered. We have to consider how our legislation will affect existing conditions, and also that our primary purpose is to give_something like a real protection to the industry. It would be worse than useless to impose a duty which is called protective, by way of carrying out. the obligation which rests upon this Parliament to regard existing industries, but which was not protective in its operation - a duty which would have the effect of keeping a number of persons employed in these industries lingering on in a state of uncertainty, but which would ultimately lead to their extinction. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has made a point of the history of the legislation in Victoria in this connexion, but it appears to me that that history proves exactly the opposite of that for which he contended. It shows that these industries were established in I860, when there was no protection upon boots. In the next year, however, a protective duty was imposed. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend calls it a revenue duty. I know that very much higher duties than 10 per cent, are imposed upon articles produced by farmers in different parts of Australia and in Tasmania. I say that 10 per cent, may be a revenue duty merely, or it may be a protective duty. Looking at the history of Victoria, it is evident that that 10 per cent, duty was intended as a protective impost. But under its operation it is quite evident that the industry did not flourish, because the duties imposed in 1866 lasted only three years, and were then increased to 20 per cent. Finally, in 1879, they were made very much the same as those which operated when federation was accomplished. What does that show? .It evidences that these successive duties were imposed not by some foreign power, but by the people of Victoria in Parliament assembled. </para>

                        <para>- But why did the protectionists capture the Legislature <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Because the people of Victoria generally had come to the conclusion that it was better for their interests that the protectionists should rule, than that the free-traders should constitute the dominant party. These duties, therefore, were imposed by the will of a majority of the people. If the effect of these gradually increasing duties had been to enhance the cost of boots to the great bulk of the consumers, would those consumers in their own Parliament have made the duties higher <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> No ! They must have observed that the operation of the duties did not increase the cost of boots to the average consumer, and that they were able to obtain locally-manufactured boots quite as cheaply, or cheaper, than they could obtain them from abroad. They also realized not only that the industry provided employment to a large number of operatives, but that- it created a demand for hides, leather, and other products of the country. It is also known that the persons who pay this duty are those who, as a matter of taste or for other reasons, desire to have their boots from America or England. The historical aspect of the matter in Victoria, so far from supplying reasons against the imposition of the proposed duty, seems to me to be the strongest possible argument which can be used in its favour. It is an argument drawn from the experience of the people, amongst whom the experiment of protection - it was an experiment in years gone by - was tried, and who absolutely believed that in the interests of the State, as a whole, the duties were necessary. The duties were regarded as imposing no hardship on the great bulk of the consumers, while giving certainty of employment, at higher wages, to a large number of persons. </para>

                        <para>-I wonder at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> making such an observation, seeing that in Victoria, in 1899, the imports amounted to £24,944, and brought in a revenue of £9,812. Of course, the effect of these duties was to greatly cut down importations ; but a certain amount of importation must always go on, and the duty, is paid by persons who insist on having articles made abroad. It was not the common class of boots made of kip or calf which paid the duty, because these were shut out altogether, and a large amount of manufacture was encouraged in the State. It was the higher-priced boots from abroad on which the revenue was collected ; and that is exactly a right condition of things. If people will insist on buying that kind of article which cannot be made in the State, they ought to be prepared to pay the extra price which is involved. It may be asked why this duty is required on boots, while in regard to other articles, a much less rate of protection is found sufficient. One of the reasons is connected with the Tariff itself. The great bulk of these boots which are imported will compete with boots made of glace kid, on which material manufacturers have to pay a duty of 15 per cent. It will be noted, therefore, that the 30 per cent, is not net, but really means no more than 25 per cent, seeing that the 15 per cent, is chargeable on say a third of the value of a pair of boots. When we compare, this protection with that afforded in other businesses, the former is not at all too high. Another reason is afforded in the fact that the development of machinery and the specialization of labour of late years, particularly in the United States, have been such as to make it possible to produce boots in large quantities at exceedingly low prices. These American factories, with the best of machinery and an enormous output on a market which is secured to them by heavy, duties, are able to produce at a cheap rate and to sell their surplus stocks abroad at very low figures. American boots are beating the English in every market in the world where they come into competition ; and it is necessary that we here should have reasonable protection. As to New South Wales we are delighted to know that the boot factories there have been able to carry on so large a business, but the range of work in the factories of New South Wales cannot be compared with that in the factories in Victoria. The work in New South Wales . is confined largely to the cheaper articles, and consists, to a considerable extent, in making up imported parts. In Victoria, there is a considerable manufacture of the better class of boots, upon which the duty will be charged. If we wish to compare the two States we must not simply take the output of boots, but also 'have regard to the general quality and range of the product, and endeavour to ascertain which is best calculated to supply almost the whole needs of Australia if the local market be secured. I hope that factories in all the States will have an opportunity of sharing the local market. In imposing a reasonable amount of duty we must not lose sight of the fact, that a large portion of the boots are made for wholesale clothiers, who are very often importers, and keenly appreciate the small profits on which such business depends. It may often be a small matter whether it is more profitable, to import certain classes of goods or ; to have them made in the Commonwealth. A very large portion of the business is in the hands of importers, and we know that the firm of McArthur and Co., of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McMillan is a member, have already started a manufactory of the kind in New South Wales. Other firms connected with the softgoods business have also started factories; because if it be shown to them that it is more to their interest to manufacture than import they will start manufacturing. Considering how finely profits are cut, it is, as I have said, very often a small matter between the amount of duty which will give real protection and the amount which will give nominal protection by allowing profits to be made by importing in large quantities. I should like to call the attention of the Senate to the history of this item, as disclosed by the records of another place. The duty as originally proposed was a composite duty of £1 per dozen pairs, and 15 per cent, on the line we are now discussing. An attempt was made to reduce that duty to 20 per cent., but the proposed amendment was negatived by 27 votes to 18. A further attempt to reduce the duty to 25 per cent, was negatived by 27 votes' to 21. An attempt to make the duty 27£ percent, was negatived by 27 to 23 votes, and then 'the Treasurer moved that the duty be 30 percent., as representing in the fairest possible way' the general feeling of the House of Representatives after the question had been thrashed out for days, and there had been ' no fewer than five divisions. These facts ought to be taken into consideration in this Chamber, and I hope honorable senators will come to the conclusion that the duty as now proposed by the Government hits the happy medium between a reasonable revenue and what is only fair protection to an immense number of people throughout the Commonwealth who have invested their money, skill, and enterprise, or are engaged as operatives in this industry. </para>

From the latest returns laid by command of the King before both Houses of the British Parliament last year, we learn that in 1896 the imports of hoots and shoes into Great Britain amounted to £519,000, and five years later, in 1900, they were £695,000, an increase of £176,000. In 1896 the exports of boots and shoes from the United Kingdom amounted- to £1,799,000, as against £l,479,000in 1900, or a decrease of  £320,000. The increase in imports and decrease in  exports represent a loss of £496,000 for the five years, or about £100,000 per annum. If the loss continues at that rate for a period of seven or eight years,, the imports will balance the exports, and the. great boot-exporting industry will have come to an end. America, sent  to the  United Kingdom £91,000 worth of boots in 1896, and £201,000 worth in 1901, showing an increase of 121 percent, in the five years. America exported to British Australasia £119,000 worth of boots in 1899, and £.214,000 worth in 1900, showing a rise of 79 per cent, in one year. The bulk of these boots went into New South Wales.

                <para class="block">To come a little nearer rhome, in 1899 New South Wales imported £146,900 worth of British boots, and £146,700 worth of foreign boots. Victoria, on the other hand, imported only £19,000 worth of British boots, and £10,000 worth of foreign boots. While New South Wales sent £146,700 to the foreigner, 'Victoria sent only £10,000 to him. Surely these matters are worth considering a little. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> attached a great deal of importance to the boot industry, and the rate of wages paid in New South Wales. From Coghlan's returns, and from the wages board returns, I showed here months ago that the rates of pay were considerably higher in Victoria than in New South Wales. It was only in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">.Age</inline> that I read the following telegram from Sydney : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>At u special meeting of the Boot Clickers' Association this evening the <inline font-weight="bold">president, Mr.</inline> Mugglestone, said the trade in New South Wales was gradually slipping away to Victoria. It was bad enough to have to acknowledge the fact that very bad times had been experienced recently in New South Wales, but notwithstanding that Victoria was taking the market for New South Wales boots away from the Sydney makers. He produced statistics to show that in May of this year one firm in Melbourne sent £3,000 worth of boots into Sydney, and in the same month over 25,000 pairs of boots were put on the" New South Wales market by Victorian manufacturers. In Melbourne recently he noticed that the one topic of conversation in the boot manufacturing circles was how best to capture the Kew South Wales market. It was most serious, because it was bound to hit the Sydney manufacturers, and it concerned the employes, who would lose their bread and butter. Hie suggested that an endeavour be made to find out the cause of the trouble, and that the masters be aided in every way in the matter. This was agreed to. </para>
                    <para>It whs announced with regard to the minimum wage question that a conference had been held between the association and the masters, that the former pointed out that £2 5s. had been agreed upon as the minimum wage by the wages board in Melbourne, instead of £2 2s. As the Sydney manufacturers had agreed to raise-wages when Melbourne did, the rise was asked for. At the conference the -employers held out on the point that they were not in possession of any official notification that the Victorian wages board had gazetted an increase. .The president of the association last evening announced that he held an official notification on the subject, and a further demand will be made for the increase. </para>
                    <para class="block">Of course they are .following Victoria's lead, and very properly so, too. We are told that the wages in Sydney are higher than, or as high as, they are here, but there is a flat contradiction given by the Sydney Clickers' Union. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> was a little astray in his statement of the number of the employes. He did .not tell us that out of the 3,894 employes in New South Wales mentioned in the return he quoted 165 were boys and girls, and that the 4,812 employes in Victoria were all men and women. I apprehend that  the boot-making industry consumes a natural product. Surely we do not wish to send away a natural product that we grow -in large quantities ? According to a return that I got from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Penton,</inline> the Victorian statist, in May last, £501,000 worth of material was used in the boot factories of Victoria in 1900, and the articles produced were valued at £867,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> said that the "value of the machinery and land in Victoria was £78,000, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Penton</inline> gives the value at £204,000. In Sydney one or two of the very large factories have their men well under control, and, having up-to-date machinery and an established trade, they can import boots. I can -well understand that those manufacturers may not want a very high duty, and it would be quite consistent with their interests to say - "If we have a very high duty on boots the result in the Commonwealth will be as it. was in Victoria. Innumerable factories will spring up all over the place, prices will go down, and our factories will have to close." Surely those consumers whom we hear so much about would benefit if !the price of boots fell so low that the factories could not keep their hands at. work on account of the cheapness of the article they produced. What do my free-trade friends say to that % One of the strongest arguments in favour of the high duty on boots was furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson,</inline> when he was reminded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> that-there is a duty of 15 per cent, on leather. </para>

                    It will keep enough factories going to supply the wants of the people. It will kill the surplus factories. If you increase the duties to a prohibitive extent, too many factories may start, but even in that case the consumers must be benefited by the competition.

                    <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> is .a member of a Government which is very much concerned about the 'pattering of bare feet ; but to prevent it they propose to make boots dearer - a proposition -which sounds very much like the chattering of barefaced politicians. The history of the boot and shoe industry in New South Wales- is in very many respects an interesting one, and cuts away any excuse for protective duties. I find, from the New South Wales <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Register,</inline> that in the year 1S90-91 there were in New South Wales 60 factories, employing 2,806 hands, while in 1900 there were 94 factories, employing 3,953 hands. That increase in the manufacturing business of the State occurred under free-trade, and notwithstanding the development of the American boot and shoe industry, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has referred. In 1891 the New South Wales output of boots was 2,600,000 pairs, but in 1900 it had risen to 3,200,000 pairs, and 400,000 pairs of slippers and shoes - an increase pf 1,000.000- pairs of boots, slippers, and slices within ten years. It is interesting to note, too,, that, notwithstanding her free ports, the importations of boots and shoes into New South Wales steadily decreased. Nearly the whole of the present boot manufacturers of New South Wales were originally only importers, but one by one they began to manufacture - without any assistance from the State in the shape of duties. Deducting the re-exportations, the net importations of boots into New South Wales during 1901 were valued at £581,000, and in the succeeding eight years at £431,000, £336,000, £271,000, £270,000, £341,000, £277,000, £295,000, and £318,000 respectively. Those figures show a remarkable decline in the importations. The importation of boots and shoes per head of population was, in 1882, 15s. 6½d., and in 1899 only 5s. 3id. In 1888 the manufacturers of New South Wales produced boots valued at £342,000, and in 1899 boots valued at £823,000, an increase of 200 per cent., whereas the importation/) were worth, in 1888, £582,000, and in 1899 only £348,000. In spite of those .facts we are asked to believe that the boot industry in New South Wales would be destroyed without a heavy duty. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has admitted that a reduction of the duty upon boots would mean an increase in the revenue - an admission which he has refused to make in regard to reductions which have been proposed in other items. The duty of 20 per cent, is higher than the average, duty under the State Tariffs, and although it is not so high as the Victorian duty, it is in respect to New South Wales an absolutely new duty. In many parts df Australia the people hope that we shall reduce the duty to 15 per cent. It must be remembered that the manufacturers of the various States have now the whole Commonwealth for their market. Messrs. John Hunter and Sons, Limited, wholesale boot manufacturers and importers, writing to me from Sydney, say - </para>

                    <para>We believe we are correct in stating' that, with very few exceptions, the manufacturers of! this State would be satisfied with a 15 per cent, duty, and if that had been adopted for all classes of boots, including lasting boots, canvas shoes, sand shoes, goloshes, &amp;c, the Commonwealth would derive a good revenue, and the protection afforded manufacturers would be ample, taking into consideration the fact' that freight and charges average from 12A per cent, to .174 Pei- cent. We consider that any industry which requires more than 25 per cent, protection is not worth fostering, as the boot trade in this State for years past has advanced very considerably with a free port, and, in fact, we consider that high duties are rather detrimental than otherwise, as manufacturers have no incentive to put any energy into their business when such excessive duties are imposed. </para>

                <para class="block">I have another letter from a correspondent who says - lb is <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> purely Victorian impost, bused, essentially on the lines of their protectionist policy. To support this contention, I would draw your careful attention to an analysis of the voting on the various divisions on this duty on the 5th March last. Counting pairs, I find-that on the 20 per cent, division nineteen Victorians were in the majority numbering 40 - nearly one-half. In the subsequent three divisions the numbers were practically the same. Only four Victorians voted in favour of the 20 per cent., and in the three other divisions this number was increased to five only by one member coming over. 'Deducting the 23 Victorian votes, nineteen of whom voted for, and four against, you will find that the 20 per cent, duty was carried by the remaining five States' representatives by 27 to 2.1,. </para>
                <para class="block">In connexion with the amount of revenue that will be derived under this duty, it must be remembered that prior to the introduction of the Tariff a considerable proportion of the boots imported into Tasmania, Queensland, and Western Australia came from New South Wales and Victoria, and now that Inter-State free-trade is established, importations from abroad are likely to be displaced to a still further extent. In Western Australia the importations of boots in 190.0 were valued at £65,000, upon which duties amounting to £10,700 were collected. The rates of duty varied, but they were equal to an - all-round <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> charge of 16A- per cent. Of the i total importations, no ' less than £1,8,000 worth came from the other States, and it is certain that .the trade with the other States will very largely increase under the influence of a high protective duty. This will have the effect of considerably diminishing the revenue. In 1900, Tasmania derived £9,000 from the duty upon boots. More than one-third of her total -imports came from Victoria, and the Treasurer estimates that the revenue Tasmania will receive from the duty upon boots under the present Tariff will amount to. only £3,600 per annum. This shows that a large falling-off in importations from abroad is contemplated. </para>

                        <para>- Because I object to the waste of time involved in its discussion, and because I do not desire to witness the spectacle of a number of senators - who now appear to be very belligerent - backing down at a later stage, thus making the Senate appear to be a spineless body. I am very pleased to note that some senators who hold free-trade views voted with the Government upon the last division. Why did they do so? Was it because they believed in the duty? No ; it was because they respected the decision arrived at by the other House, and I venture to say that the public will respect them for the attitude which they have taken up. I do not wish to discuss the abstract question of free-trade <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> protection in its relation to the bootmaking industry. But I may be permitted to point out that Australia is so eminently suited to cattle raising that we can produce any quantity of leather. In all the States a large number of people are engaged in the boot-manufacturing industry. Fortunately, our standard of living is a great deal higher than that which is adopted in other parts of the world. There are teeming millions of people in the world who have just emerged from serfdom, and are available for exploitation by capitalists. There are capitalists who are prepared to establish works in any country. Some have already gone to Japan, and we have a right to protect Australian manufacturers and their employes from foreign competition. It may be said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> and others that if Australia is so naturally fitted for the production of cattle and cheap leather, there is already sufficient protection. We know, however, that these circumstances do not mean sufficient protection. Where we can produce leather cheaply the Japanese can produce it more cheaply still, and the same holds good in regard to. the manufacture of boots. Some honorable senators may take the view that it is far better for Australia to have this interchange with Japan ; but I take an opposite view, and submit that all the facts are in favour of protection. If we allow our boot manufacturers to be brought into competition with the cheap labour of Japan, or any other country, our own people must go down. Circumstances are very different from what they were a few years ago. Most of us can remember the time when it took months to get a cargo of goods from other parts of the world to Australia, whereas now there are lines of steam-ships which can bring a cargo of boots or anything else from Japan in three weeks. </para>

                        <para>- Because the industry has not yet grown to that extent ; but it has taken Japan only a few years to become one of the strongest competitors in the match trade, she having almost captured the markets of the world against a country like Sweden. Once the Japanese acquire sufficient knowledge to make them suitable employes for foreign capitalists, we shall find them producing boots just as cheaply as they now produce matches. I find, on reference to page180 of the <inline font-style="italic">Statistical Register</inline> of New South Wales for 1900, that Japan is attempting to obtain a market there, £37 worth of boots and shoes samples, I suppose - having been received from that country. I am in great hopes, now that the facts about the compromise made in another place have been reiterated, that honorable senators will alter the decision recently arrived at. We may retrace our steps gracefully, without loss of dignity, and without any danger of our rights and privileges being interfered with in any way. </para>

                    <para>- After the division which has recently been taken, there is no need for honorable senators to speak at any great length on the present proposal. While it is perfectly true that there was very little debate on the motion, I do not suppose that further discussion would make any important change in honorable senators' views. I desire, however, to accentuate one or two points. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has given us one very excellent reason, from a revenue standpoint, why the Senate should adopt; a duty of 20 per cent. The honorable and learned senator said that if our object was only to get revenue, that could be attained by reducing the duties, and he pointed out how the reductions in another Chamber had resulted in a larger amount than would have been brought in under the original duties as they existed in the various States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> told us that we had to consider the industries already established in our midst, and contended that it. would be unfair to reduce the duty below 30 per cent., because that would mean greater importation, and an increase of the amount of revenue which the Government anticipated. </para>

                <para class="block">South Wales, under absolute free- trade, there are 3,000 persons employed in this industry as against 4,000 employed in Victoria. Although the numbers seem so different, . the production in certain years was greater in New South Wales than in Victoria. If this industry was established, and could remain in existence in New South Wales without any duty, can it be said that a duty of 20 per cent, will close up similar industries in other States? It stands to reason that the larger area over which these manufacturers may now send their goods duty free must foe equivalent to a large duty with the market of only one State. Surely we are not going to say to the people of the Commonwealth that they are to be unduly and needlessly taxed, and that revenue is to be destroyed in the interests of any particular industry? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> could have said that the proposed reduction would both reduce revenue and turn men out of employment, there might have been some strength in his contention. But the honorable senator's contention was absolutely the reverse. He urged that by reducing the duty we should increase the revenue; and I ask honorable senators who represent the smaller States, and are desirous of obtaining as much revenue as can fairly be raised - I ask honorable members who do not want additional taxation imposed on the people by the States Governments - whether they can vote for the imposition of a heavy duty, which will be to the detriment and injury of State finances <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not think honorable senators can have realized what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> was saying in the earlier portion of his address on the revenue aspect of the question. The honorable gentleman made out a clear and incontestable case in favour of the proposed reduction; and f from the protectionist stand-point, and that of keeping men in employment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> failed to prove his case. If we had similar importations under a duty of 20 per cent, to those which have taken place throughout the Commonwealth within the last two or three years, we should receive a large revenue. Speaking on the authority of the Treasurer, I point out that the value of the importations of boots and shoes in 1898 into the Commonwealth was £484,000, which, with a duty of 20 per cent., would mean a revenue of £97,000 annually. The importations in 1899 were valued at £465,000, which would realize £93,000 per annum; and in 1900 the value was £623,000, representing a revenue of £125,000. For the sake of argument, I shall assume that the importations in 1900 would not have amounted to £623,000 had it not been in anticipation of duties being levied by the Commonwealth Government. I shall take it that the importations in 1900 would have amounted to an average as between . 1898 and 1899, and represent a value of £470,000 odd. That means a revenue of £94,000, which is larger than the estimate of the Government ; and that is in spite of the fact of an important reduction of the duties in the State of Victoria. Do honorable senators believe that the importations throughout the whole of the States will be very much less than those which have taken place hitherto ? At any rate, it may be taken for granted that with a duty of 30 per cent, we should have far fewer goods imported : and we are justified in adhering to the proposal of 20 per cent. It must not be forgotten that we reduced the duty on apparel to 20 per cent., and in other cases have made similar reductions. We are only following the line of action taken by the Senate from the very commencement up to the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> said that we ought to give fair consideration to the decisions of the other Chamber. The high duties were supported in the House of Representatives mainly by those who represented Victorian constituencies. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, Victorian representatives have as much right to consideration as have the representatives of other States, but the life-training of Victorian politicians is such that the bulk of them naturally desire the highest duties they can get, . because they are under the impression that with free-trade the industries of Victoria would go by the board. They are unwilling, to take note of the march of events in New South Wales, where our manufacturing industries have not gone by the board, although they have had no duties to protect them. The manufacturers of the other States will be able to compete against the manufacturers of New South Wales if the duty is reduced, just as New South Wales has been able in the past to compete against the manufacturers of other countries. I hope that honorable senators will agree to the motion now before the House by a larger majority than carried the last motion. With regard to the wretched bugbear which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has attempted to raise about the other Chamber not agreeing to this or that, let honorable senators realize that they have a right to exercise an independent judgment upon the Tariff, and that a means is provided by the Constitution for the settlement of any difficulty which may be created by their action in so doing. If we accepted the doctrine of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> we might as well agree to the proposals of the House of Representatives without any deliberation at .all. </para>

                        <para>- It is our will, because we have the power to enforce it. It has been said that because the other House may reject our suggestion in regard to this duty, we are only wasting time by discussing it. But more time has been wasted by other senators than has been occupied by those who advocate the reduction of these duties. The duty proposed by Senator Pulsford is 5 per cent, more than the duty which has hitherto been in force in Western Australia, and, -as a representative of that State, I have a right to put forward what I consider to be the views of my constituents. We should be untrue to those who sent us here, and to the Constitution, if we were afraid to do that. We were not elected upon a property qualification, but upon the same broad franchise as that on which the members of the House of Representatives were elected, and we represent the people as truly as they do. The duty upon boots originally proposed by the Government was in some instances twice as high as that now contained in the Tariff ;.but, seeing that the debate in the other House was almost wholly upon the question of composite duties, we have ground for assuming that they did not consider whether the actual <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty imposed was or was not high enough. In. Western Australia a considerable boot industry has been built up under a duty of 15 per cent., whilst Victorian manufacturers have been protected by a duty of 35' per cent. Western Australia entered into federation, however, upon the distinct understanding that in the Senate her representatives would be as powerful as those of Victoria or of any other State, upon this or any other question. Those who framed the Constitution gave us much greater powers in respect of taxation than have ever been given to the members of an Upper House of any State Parliament, and it is idle to ask us to surrender those powers. We have a. right to say what duty we believe should be imposed, and to trust that the other House will agree to our suggestions. There can be no compromise until each House has expressed its will in regard to the Tariff, and we must follow up the vote which we have just given by reducing these other duties. </para>

                    <para>- I have already voted for a duty of 30 per cent., and I am going to do so again, because I know that when there was a duty of 20 per cent, on boots in Tasmania, and a much heavier duty in Victoria, the ordinary classes of boots could be obtained here for from 15 to 20 per cent, less than in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not answer that old stock argument. The argument that this heavy duty will increase the price of boots to the poorer classes falls to the ground when it is viewed from the stand-point of practical experience. In a country in which the duty is 20 per cent, and the consumer has to depend entirely on foreign imports, boots are from 20 to 50 per cent, dearer than is the case in a country in which the duty is very much higher, and the heavy duty in Victoria does not seem to have increased very much the price to the consumer. These are the reasons why I think that, in voting for a 30 per cent, duty, I am not increasing the burden of taxation to the great masses of the people. I am increasing the burden of taxation to those who will under any conditions wear imported boots. For nearly a year I have been wearing a pair of Victorian boots, which cost me 20 per cent, less than I should have had to pay for them in Tasmania, where the protection was not so high, and they are almost as good as when I bought them. </para>

                    <para>- I have some figures which have been prepared by a gentleman well known in the trade as to the rate of duty in the different States. In the paper that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> laid upon the table at the commencement' of our consideration of. the Tariff, it is shown that in the majority of the States the duty is reckoned at so much per dozen pairs. This gentleman shows that a 30 per cent, duty nominally is a <inline font-style="italic">33</inline> per cent, duty actually, because the cost of importation has to be added to the shipping value of the goods. Reckoning the duty at 33 per cent., it appears that it is 15 per cent, higher than the duties which have obtained in Western Australia, South Australia, and Queensland ; exactly 13 per cent, higher than the duty which obtained in Tasmania; obviously 33 per cent, more than that which obtained in New South Wales; and somewhere between 10 and 15 per cent, less than the duties which obtained in Victoria. The people of New South Wales, who constitute a third of the population of the Commonwealth, have a right to be considered to some little extent, I suppose, as well as the people of Tasmania, or any other section. If they are to be burdened with a from 22 to 33 per cent, duty, according to whether this is fixed at the schedule rate or according to the amendment. Surely they have as much right to consideration as have the manufacturers of Victoria. There must be some levelling up or some levelling down somewhere, and I submit, with great confidence, that the entire population of one State is entitled to more consideration than are the comparatively few persons who are engaged in a given industry in another. I have been asked by one of the largest manufacturers of boots in New South Wales to strenuously oppose a duty of 30 per cent. He says that he does not want it, and by my vote I shall oppose its imposition. With reference to the amount which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> hopes to derive from the duty, let me point out what has happened in New South Wales. I propose to compare the imports from the 1st January to the 22nd March, 1902, with the imports for the corresponding period of the previous, year. The goods that were imported in the three first months of 1901 were goods that had been ordered before any Tariff proposals were placed before the country. The imports amounted to £137.000 in that period of 1901, and to £58,000 in the corresponding period of 1902. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> therefore, will see that he has very small prospect of deriving any material revenue, in New South Wales at any rate, under a duty of 33 per cent. I think that enough has now been said on this matter to enable a division to be taken. I cannot believe that the committee, having fixed a duty of 20 per cent. on men's boots, will vote to impose a higher duty on the boots of their sons. </para>

                <para class="block">I submit this motion because the facts most conclusively show that this high protection is not wanted. Comparing New South Wales with Victoria, it is idle for the protectionists to contend that it is wanted. It will prohibit the importation of some boots entirely. If the importation of low priced boots is prevented by a protective duty, the poor will never know how Australian boots compare in quality with the boots of other nations. In my opinion a little competition would be a good thing. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to direct attention to . the fact that under item 117, boots and shoes, n.e.i., including goloshes and slippers, are subject to a duty of 25 per cent., whilst the impost upon rubber sand shoes is 20 per cent.., and upon infants' boots, shoes and slippers, ] 5 per cent. I find that one-third of the revenue derived from the duties upon boots is obtained from those which I have just enumerated, and in view of this fact, the proposal to reduce the duty upon boys' boots to 20 per cent. does not seem unreasonable. The determination just arrived at by the Senate is a most regrettable one, and we should do our best to rectify the mistake made. </para>

                    <para>- Honorable senators can <inline font-style="italic">very</inline> well make a distinction between the boots worn by men and youths and women's foot wear, because when the Tariff was first submitted, the Government proposed a duty of 20s. and 15 per cent., <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> upon men's boots in sizes above fives, whereas the duty upon women's boots was fixed at 15s. and 15 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> So far as I know, the lower grades of women's boots are not made within the Commonwealth to the same extent as are men's. With very few exceptions, I understand that they are imported, whereas the lower classes of men's boots have always been made in Australia. I therefore ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> if he cannot see his way clear to make some distinction between the duty upon men's boots and shoes and that upon women's. </para>

                    <para>- I presume that the public outside will criticise our actions in this Chamber. Believing, as I do, that a 20 per cent, rate is the maximum measure of protection required upon boots, that the operation of such a duty will foster the industry and return a reasonable amount of revenue, I think the conclusion at which the public will arrive is that the Government are asking for what is unfair. However, it is quite certain that things cannot remain as they are. Either one or more senators must give way and allow the committee to reduce the duty upon this item to 20 per cent., or we must restore the duty upon men's boots to 30 per cent. If the latter course be adopted the Government will issue a Tariff containing so many imperfections that it will be within the power of revenue tariffists to criticise it from one end of the Commonwealth to the other. </para>

                    <para>- After the division which has just been taken, I do not think it is worth while attempting to effect any alteration in the remaining items which stand at 30 per cent. But I should like to remind honorable senators that when we arrived at the decision to reduce these duties to 20 per cent., it was regarded as a satisfactory solution of a very difficult question. Whilst protectionists who were accustomed to the high duties which operated in Victoria felt that it was very hard to forego that measure of protection which the boot industry had previously enjoyed, it was nevertheless recognised that to call upon the free-trade States to pay heavy taxes upon articles which they had previously admitted free would constitute a great hardship. Therefore, it occurred to honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber that ! if they assented to the imposition of a duty of 4s. in the £1, or 20 per cent., they would be giving a large amount of assistance to industries -which had enjoyed protection for many years, and at the same time would be able to justify their action, and urge the community to accept it as a satisfactory settlement. But instead of the action of the committee being regarded in that light, there will probably be a demand, which will grow irresistible, for a reduction of these duties. I should like to point out the peculiar position in which the Senate finds itself at the present moment. We deliberately decided that the duty upon men's sizes above 5 should be 20 per cent., but almost immediately after we adopted a different line of action in regard to the smaller sizes of boots. Within the last two hours the Senate has jumped jimcrow. One vote was given in one direction, and another in an entirely different direction. However, I recognise that it would be quite futile to expect the Senate to go back to its original decision, and therefore I am prepared to accept as final, the divisions which have taken place. I wish, however, to impress upon the committee that their action is bound to cause trouble in the future. People will recognise that the prices which they will be compelled to pay for articles of universal consumption have been considerably enhanced, and will grumble accordingly. I protest against the imposition of these heavy duties in the interests of the free-trade State of New South Wales, which contains a third of the population of the Commonwealth, in the interests of free-trade Western Australia, and of the large number of free-traders to be found in the other States. Of course, where the voting is equal the duty proposed by the Government is retained, but if the various items in this Tariff had been dealt with in the same way as items in an ordinary Bill, the position would have been absolutely reversed, and upon almost every occasion the Government would have been defeated. I protest against the retention of these unreasonably high duties. </para>

                <para class="block">Commonwealth will be up in arms and upset the Tariff ; but at the present time the leader of the free-trade party is on a stumping tour in Victoria, assuring the people that the Tariff will be upset in a very short time. Whether we pass a 15 per cent, duty or a 30 per cent, duty, the free-traders are all working for a re-opening of the question of the Tariff ; and simply because the Senate has not chosen to agree with the particular views of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> the present imposts, instead of lasting for a great many years, are to be upset. The honorable and learned senator gave us another fallacious argument when he told us that he was moving in the interests of the poor working man. The poor working man does not care a snap of the finger what the particular duty is on his boots and shoes, because the class of goods which he uses would still be made in the States if there were absolute free-trade. To talk about the working men and the working women rising up in arms against the proposed duty, is simply absurd. It is further argued that the duty introduced by the Government is not a fair compromise, because in Victoria there was an exceedingly high duty, while in New South Wales these goods were free. But the duty now proposed approximates as nearly as possible to those which prevailed in South Australia and Queensland, and in this way the Government have hit the happy medium, the latter duties having been in force for a great many years, and given ever}' satisfaction. The people of South Australia or Queensland will not rise in indignation, nor will the people of Victoria, seeing that it means a reduction of the duty in the latter State. The compromise arrived at in another place is exceedingly fair, and I have much pleasure in supporting it. </para>

What did we see here the other day? When the question was raised of imposing a duty on kerosene, where were the free-traders ? They deserted their principles. Can honorable senators imagine any taxation more consistent with a' free-trade Tariff than a duty on kerosene or tea ? <inline font-style="italic">On</inline> the item of kerosene, those honorable senators who pretend to be free-traders deserted their principles, and voted on the other side. I am astonished to find that persons who call themselves free-traders very often do not know what free-trade means. Does free-trade necessarily mean either high duties or low duties? Most certainly not; there can be a very high .free-trade duty, just as there may be a low protectionist duty. If the duty on boots and shoes is borne by the whole of the community, and goes into the Treasury, it is a free-trade duty, whether it be high or low. </para>

                        <para>- I say that if the duty goes into the Treasury, it is a free-trade duty, no matter whether it be high or low. Some people are continually stating that a high duty is necessarily protectionist ; but they do not understand what they are talking about. This item of boots and shoes I divide into three classes. There . is one class - the lowest class - which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> says, will be made in the States, no matter what duty is imposed. In regard to the highest classes of boots, the same remark may be made, seeing that people who use them have them made to order, very often on their own lasts. It is the intermediate class of boots which we have to consider. In my own State of South Australia, we must have revenue, and as, in my opinion, this tax will be spread over the whole of the community, I voted for the higher dutv. For a senator to attack me when I have never said a word during the whole of the debate, and have voted according to my conscience, is, to say the least of it, in exceedingly bad taste. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline>
                    may have given on any particular item. But the remarks made by the honorable and learned senator induce me to say a few words in reply to both him and
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford. Senator Baker</inline>
                    has told us truly that one of the tests of a f ree-trade dutv is whether or not it goes into the Treasury. But it has been expressly stated by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline>
                    that with a duty of 30 per cent, there will not be so much money go into the Treasury as there will with a duty of 20 per cent. No doubt if
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline>
                    takes the trouble to examine into the matter carefully, he will find that the conclusion arrived at by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline>
                    is absolutely and literally correct. Can any honorable senator say that, as a free-trader, he has cast a vote in favour of a duty of 30 per cent., when it is shown that that duty will go into the pockets of certain favoured manufacturers of boots and shoes 1 The duty must go one way or the other, and if it does not go into the Treasury' it must go into the pockets of the manufacturers, though the labouring man may get a small portion of it. There is no doubt that the lower duty will induce greater importation, but under all the circumstances it is just such an impost as will command "revenue without destruction," to adopt the words of the Prime Minister in his Maitland speech.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline>
                    has alluded to the action of certain free-traders on the item of kerosene. Was it not stated clearly and distinctly by those free-traders that they were not prepared to put their hands into the pockets of the people of the country unnecessarily ? The people have high duties surrounding them in every direction. Whenever a man wants to buy an article, he has, in consequence of those duties, to pay a higher price. That is the main reason that kerosene was not touched, and the free-traders were perfectly justified in their action. It is no part of our duty to take more money out of the pockets of the people simply on the ground that the tax is a free-trade tax. The only justification for taxation is the necessity for revenue in the interests of the States ; and when the Tariff was introduced there appeared no duty of this character. The Treasurer has told us that he is satisfied with the Tariff as it left the other House, and free-traders would have made a very serious mistake if they had taken a couple of hundred thousand pounds out of the pockets of the people without any justification in the shape of need for revenue. When honorable senators twit the freetrade party with being in favour of duties upon kerosene and other similar articles, my reply is that they are revenue producing duties which must be borne equally by the whole community, but that we. are not justified in imposing such duties when there are already in existence many protective duties which will produce more than the revenue required. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council agreed to remit the high duties upon boots and shoes and other necessaries, we on this side might be prepared to vote for duties on kerosene and tea and similar articles.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline>
                    told us that the House of Representatives acted wisely in adopting the duty under discussion, because it is practically the duty which was formerly in force in Queensland and South Australia. But in Tasmania and Queensland the State duty was only 20 per cent., in Western Australia 10s. and 18s. per dozen pairs, or 15 per cent., while in New South Wales there was no duty at all. Even in Canada and New Zealand, whose protective Tariffs are very high, the duty on boots is only 25 and 2.2^ per cent, respectively. It was no compromise to take all but the highest rate prevailing under* the State Tariffs. It is regrettable that this subject has caused so much discussion, and warmth of feeling, but it is a disappointment when men whom we were led to believe were returned as free-traders or protectionists, give votes which seem to be contrary to the doctrines which they profess. Of course, honorable senators must vote as their consciences dictate, and* must ultimately submit their actions for the approval of their constituents. I have no doubt that if the right honorable gentleman, to whom
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline>
                    has referred, has his way, the country will be stirred up pretty strongly against this Tariff.

                        <para>- The only right reason for imposing taxation is to obtain revenue for the administration of the Government, and if the Government are already obtaining from the Tariff as much as, or more money than they need, why should we increase the burden i upon the taxpayers ? Many of the duties to which we have agreed, while they produce perhaps £100,000 of revenue, take from the pockets of the people £200,000 or £300,000. I could show how duties .might be remitted which would save the people perhaps £500,000 in taxation, but which bring into the Treasury only about£1 50,000. The object of the free-trade party is to prevent the absorption of revenue by protected manufacturers. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> that the amount of a duty does not determine whether it is protective or not. A duty may be very high, but if the whole of the revenue derived from it goes into the Treasury, it is not protective, and the more we can reduce protective duties the nearer we get to free-trade. We on this side have tried to reduce the protective duties, and have in every case allowed purely revenue duties to stand. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose the second is a very new affair. The chief users of indiarubber hose and the other articles embraced under this duty are the Governments of the Commonwealth, and of the various States and the large steam- ship companies. It cannot be of any advantage to the Governments to have to pay duty upon the articles they, use, and the steam-ship companies avoid the payment of the duty by obtaining their supplies outside the Commonwealth. Although New Zealand is a heavily protected country, these goods are -admitted free there, and the steam-ship companies obtain their supplies from New Zealand rather than pay this duty. As the duty upon canvas or tyre fabric made waterproof with indiarubber, and outer tyre rubber, is only 10 per cent., it would facilitate the working of the Tariff to make both duties in this item 10 per cent. </para>

                <para class="block">A duty of 20 per cent, on composition belting is an anomaly. Under the head of " Cotton piece goods, n.e.i.," cotton belting comes in at the rate of 5 per cent., and as it is manufactured here the duty operates not only as a revenue, but as a protectionist one. Composition belting is not and cannot be manufactured here. It is manufactured by a patented process, and is very largely used in the machinery factories. It is also used in mining : in fact, in almost every avocation in which machinery is employed. This duty will largely affect all manufacturers. I think it was an oversight on the part of the other House to allow cotton belting to come in at 5 per cent., and to tax composition belting at 20 per cent. It- may be said that we are protecting the manufacturers of leather belting, but it cannot be used in many avocations where it comes in contact with steam, acids, or great heat. It is not so good as composition belting for some of the finer classes of machinery, as it has to be jointed every 4 feet. That increases the thickness of the belt, and makes the motion more uneven. Composition belting was previously absolutely free in Victoria and New South Wales, which are the two largest manufacturing States in the Commonwealth, and we shall be doing a very great injury to all the manufacturers here if we say that it shall be subjected to a duty of 20 per cent. In South Australia, the duty on composition belting was 10 per cent. I appeal not only to free-traders, but to other honorable senators who have the interests of our industries at heart, to vote for my suggestion for a revenue duty pure and simple. </para>

                    <para>- I understand, from the officer of Customs who supplies me with information, that composition belting is manufactured here. The patents for several kinds of composition belting have expired. As composition belting is made of canvas and other materials, there is no reason why it should not be made here. . Apart from the patent, it is a very simple article of manufacture. It is not only because of that, but because it comes into competition with leather belting that this duty is. imposed. It may be that under certain circumstances composition belting is better than leather belting. It is really because it comes into competition with the leather belting that it is put under this head. There may be certain circumstances under which composition belting may be preferable, but there are a very large number of cases in which it simply comes into competition with leather belting, and the question of price will affect the sale of the local product. It would be rather absurd to protect our leather manufacturers in every other way, and not to protect the product of their work. With regard to cotton belting, I do not see the point of my honorable friend's argument. It has been explained over and over again that it is necessary to make all cotton goods as cheap as possible, and for that reason the duty is fixed at 5 per cent. 13ut that is really no ground why either leather or composition belting should be subject to a 5 per cent. duty. We must take this item "as a whole. I hope the committee will see that it will be unwise and inconsistent to make any alteration. </para>

                    is quite wrong in saying that the patents for composition belting have expired. For instance, the Lancashire Patent Belt and Hose Company and R. J. Dicks and Company are manufacturing patented composition belting. No reason has been shown by the honorable and learned senator why any difference should be made between cotton belting and composition belting. If composition belting competes with leather belting, does it not also compete with the cotton belting which is made here

                    If this duty is imposed for protectionist purposes, why is the 5 per cent, duty placed on cotton belting? It seems to me an extraordinary thing that on their belting one class of manufacturers should be required to pay a 20 per cent, duty, while another class is required to pay only a 5 per cent. duty. I have tried to ascertain if composition belting is made here. I have asked
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Campbell,</inline>
                    a large importer of belting, and others, in Melbourne, and they have all informed me that no composition belting for large machinery is made in Australia. In Victoria and New South Wales, where composition belting has been free hitherto, we find the only leather belt factories that exist in the Commonwealth. Why should we require the manufacturers, who use composition belting - and it is used in the great majority of the factories - to pay a 20 per cent, duty when in this highly - protected State of Victoria it was found advisable in the interests of the manufacturers to allow the article to come in free

                    <para>Composition-belting has all along been free in Victoria and New South Wales, where the five successful leather-belt manufacturers have been established, so that when they were able to build up businesses with composition-belting free, surely they can carry on now much more successfully with the larger field to work upon, seeing that five of the other States were previously closed against them, through the high duties on leather-belting, especially if they are afforded the 10 per cent, protection which we now propose. </para>
                    <para>It is impossible for leather-belting to be used in mining, agricultural, and other industries in cases where belting has to be run through water; and composition-belting is the only kind that can be used for this purpose.

                    <para>- I had given notice of my intention to propose to add to the list of exemptions glacier kid, both tan and black, American ooze calf, and French and German calf. I had also intended to propose the exemption of patent calf. For the reason advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> I have abandoned my original purpose. The leathers which I have enumerated are not produced successfully within the Commonwealth, and manufacturers of high-class boots are placed at a disadvantage compared with the American boot-makers, who are able to obtain their raw material free of duty. Some of these leathers may be produced here, but I am informed by boot manufacturers that they are not equal in quality to the American goods, and that the boots made of them do not exhibit the same finish as the American foot-wear. In view, however, of the high duties retained upon boots, there is no reason why any leathers should be admitted free, because the boot manufacturers are already over-protected. </para>

Some of the leathers mentioned by me are made within the Commonwealth, but their quality is not satisfactory. It is true that samples of glacier kid have been exhibited, but I defy any honorable senator to name any place within the Commonwealth where supplies can be obtained sufficient for the purpose of boot manufacture. I have received a letter from the Colonial Boot and Shoe Manufacturing Company, Sampson-street, East Perth, which reads as follows : -

                    <para>The views of my societies, us previously stated, are that the duties on leathers, as they left the House of Representatives, were sufficiently low, und any attempt to lower them, or to cause any of them to be placed cm the free list, on the part of the Senate, would be very disappointing to the members of my societies. </para>

                        <para>- The duty which it is proposed to levy upon this item is aimed at all the different forms df advertisements which enter the Commonwealth, either accompanying goods, or sent out in connexion therewith. If these advertisements can be produced locally, there seems to be no reason why a duty should not be imposed upon them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has declared that in some instances the rate proposed will range up to 100 per cent. In the case of very cheap paper upon which advertisements are printed, it may represent that amount ; but if an average were struck, it would be found to be equivalent to about 33 per cent. Is there any reason why that duty should not be paid <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The greater portion of these advertisements can be produced here, and if we impose only an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duty upon them it certainly will not shut out the bulk of the cheaper advertisements. Moreover, these goods are seldom invoiced, and cannot be accurately valued. There would thus be great difficulty in collecting a duty founded upon value. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - The Vice-President of the Executive Council has confirmed practically everything that I said. He admits that in some instances the duty would be equivalent to 100 per cent., but claims that in other cases it would not- be so much. For that very reason it appears to me that an
                    <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline>
                    rate would be a very fair one. Moreover, the duty upon printing paper qf large sizes, which was originally 10 per cent., has been abolished, and consequently the protection to all articles manufactured from paper has been considerably increased. A duty of 3d. per lb. is simply a monstrous one. Manufactures for advertising purposes may comprise pictures unframed. .These may be very bulky, and weigh a great deal. It is only fair that foreign manufacturers, who are sending goods here in large quantities and paying heavy duties, should lie permitted to land their advertising material at a moderate cost.

                        <para>- Of course it can, but 100 per cent, is a prohibitive duty. When the printing is done abroad for distribution, perhaps in ten or twenty different countries, it can be obtained on much better terms than in Australia. But I think that 20 per cent, is a fair and reasonable duty to give to the local producers. There are protectionists in the other House, at any rate, who say that an industry which cannot stand with a duty of less than 20 or 25 per cent, had better be allowed to go. I do not see why we should be pressed to adopt a prohibitive duty. </para>

                        <para>- It appears that in all the States with the exception of "Victoria, the duty was collected on an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> basis, and I do not see how there can be any difficulty in taking a similar course for the whole Commonwealth. It is a great anomaly that while we propose a duty of 3d. per lb. on this particular class of advertising matter, magazines and publications of that character are admitted absolutely free. I believe that the anomalies in the Tariff will be found more in connexion with the printing trade than with any other trade. I have here illustrated catalogues printed by the Mallery, Wheeler Company of New York, for distribution over the whole of the world. The books show various kinds of padlocks and agricultural implements which the firm sell, and they are printed in large numbers in order to save expense. It would be absurd to say that the company should be -compelled to have all its advertising matter printed in the particular States in which they desire to do business. There is, however, no desire to prevent a reasonable duty, and 25 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> would result in a fair amount of revenue, and would not be an unknown rate. </para>

                        <para>- I am concerned with printers throughout the Commonwealth who, as a general rule, are struggling men. It is very hard for a local printer, when seeking orders, to discover that in the various Australian capitals there are representatives of American and German firms who are prepared to undertake printing at very low rates. This duty is intended to prevent the importation of large quantities of advertising matter of various kinds, from great ornamental poster down to chemists' labels. I do not see how it would be possible for the Customs officials to decide a fair charge on an <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> basis. An American firm might send over 100 catalogues, out of 1.000 which had been printed, and it would be impossible for an officer to decide their . value, though it would be easy enough to put them on. a scale. </para>

                <para class="block">Chamber. It has been said that the Government have singled out particular classes for taxation while allowing other classes to go scot-free ; but a proposal to impose a duty of 10 per cent, on paper used in the production of newspapers evidences a desire to compel every class of the community to share the expense of carrying on the Government. When we look down the schedule we see that all classes excepting newspaper proprietors are called upon to pay taxation. Every class in the community, from the woman who buys a mangle to the lady who wears Parisian bonnets, has to contribute something towards the administration of the Commonwealth, and why should the newspaper proprietors escape ? Honorable senators may ask, " Why do you propose a tax upon knowledge?"I admit that some newspapers - especially those which preach protectionist doctrines - are really unbound books ; but the proposed duty cannot be regarded as a tax upon knowledge. I believe that the House of Representatives struck off the proposed duty of 10 per cent, out of consideration for the small country newspaper proprietors, but a duty of 5 per cent, on printing paper will not cost them more than 6d. per week. </para>

                        <para>- The average circulation of a country newspaper is not more than 500 copies. Why should the proprietors of these papers go scot-free? This duty would fall most heavily upon the proprietors of the big metropolitan dailies, with their circulation of 50,000 copies, and per 100,000 on Saturdays. I do not blame them for getting the small country proprietors to join with them in opposing this tax, because every one tries to escape taxation ; but it is our duty to see that every class pays its fair contribution to the revenue. </para>

                        <para>-From the very first I have agreed with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that it is the duty of the Senate to remove all anomalies from the Tariff, and I regard it as an anomaly that the users of printing paper escape without paying a duty, while all other classes of the community are taxed. If a duty is imposed, newspapers will not be any dearer, and therefore those who buy newspapers will not have to pay it. On that ground I ask for the support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who is always anxious to protect the consumers, except when he is assisting the interests of the great importing industry. Let honorable senators show their courage in this matter. As a rule, the politician looks through his newspaper in the morning to see what is said of him, and he is perfectly happy if he can discover a paragraph in which his name is mentioned, whether favorably or otherwise. His great trouble is that he may be ignored. </para>

Senators who vote against the motion because they are afraid of the press will be despised, if not by the newspaper proprietors, by the pressmen from whom they are so anxious to get a pat on the back. The Tariff is not a scientific protectionist Tariff - the free-trade party have seen to that - it is a kind of medley. But even a revenue Tariff should press as evenly as possible upon all classes, and I therefore appeal to honorable senators to make the newspaper proprietors contribute with the rest of the community. </para>

                    knew as much of what goes on in a printing-office as he assumes to know, he would not have made some of the statements which we have just heard. He has told the committee that newspaper proprietors entirely escape taxation, but as a matter of fact country newspaper proprietors have to pay heavily for the carriage of their supplies, and are taxed upon many kinds of paper which they use, as well as upon their ink and other requirements. Then he told us that the tax upon printing paper would amount to only about 6d. a week in the case of small country offices, but I know from personal experience that it would amount to a great deal more. A very strong reason why we should reject the motion is that it is not desirable to impose taxation which will in any way prevent the dissemination of knowledge.

                    foresaw that objection to his proposal. It is a very substantial objection. 'We should do all we can to make literature as cheap as possible, and therefore I would rather support the removal of the duty upon printers' ink than' vote for the imposition of a duty upon printing paper. I hope that,, the committee will not entertain this proposal.

                    has called a free-trade tax. The article must come in, and therefore a tax should be imposed. This duty will not press hardly on small newspaper proprietors in the country, and the proprietors of the big journals can well afford to pay it. When we are putting a tax of 30 per cent, on the boots of the people we may very well put a little taxation on the printing paper which is used by the proprietors of big journals.

                <para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Major GOULD</inline> (New South Wales). - Too much attention has been given ' to the position of the newspapers. We have to go a step further and see how this duty will affect the use of printing paper in the Commonwealth. It is perfectly true that newspaper proprietors use a very large quantity of printing paper in . their business. Even if it were newspaper proprietors alone whom we had to consider I should be prepared to support the position which the Government is taking up, because ! recognise that newspapers are great educators of the people in the community. In the country districts particularly they are of great educational value. It is of very great moment to a struggling, country newspaper proprietor to be able to get all his material at as low a rate as possible. There are different works which might be printed in the Commonwealth from time to time, but the printing of which is discouraged by. the Tariff. We admit books duty free,, but if- an author decides to publish a work in Australia a duty is levied on the type, the ink, the paper, and. whatever else <inline font-style="italic">may</inline> be used in its production.-. That policy is a distinct discouragement to- authors to publish their works in the Commonwealth. At the present time it pays a man much better to have his work published at the other end of the world. There are great advantages in having a work published, in the old country by a firm which is in a position te)' give an enormous circulation, to a book of- any merit. At the same time, it is a great pity to see the printing of. many Australian books driven- out of the Commonwealth by the imposition of heavy, duties. I think it is the duty of honorable senators to free printing materials from duty as far as they can. </para>

It was considered there extremely unfair that all books and printed matter of an educational value should be admitted free, and yet it is proposed to tax the very paper on which Commonwealth books will be printed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> did not deal .fairly with this question when he considered it from only the newspaper point of view. When it is regarded simply as a newspaper question, there is an extremely good case, for there does seen* to be no reason why newspapers should get free printing papen. But we cannot confine our view of the case to one industry that uses printing paper. We have to take into account all the industries in which it is used. Certainly from an educational point of view, quite apart from newspapers, it ought to remain duty free. </para>

                <para class="block">It is desirable that free tinfoil paper should be at the service of the packers of tea, which is duty free, and various other articles. On the free-trade list we find emery and flint paper, filter paper, litmus paper, coated printing-paper, tissue cap-paper, and parchments. Surely we can also have tinfoil paper on the free list in view of the important uses to which it is put. </para>

                    <para>- When the Tariff was introduced, tinfoil paper was included in the line "n.e.i.," but it was expressly placed in its present position on the Tariff and subjected to the lower duty of 3s. per cwt., because it was understood that it would probably be largely used for tea packing and other similar purposes. It may or may not be made within the Commonwealth, but there is no reason why it should not pay duty. </para>

                        <para>- I object to the motion because the bookbinders have been very well treated in having their tools of trade, their printing paper, and a number of other articles used by them placed upon the free list. There is no reason why they should enjoy special privileges with regard to these particular classes of paper. The Tariff must be regarded as a whole. A large number of trades are involved, and they are compensated for the duties which they have to pay upon their raw material by the protection which is afforded to them in connexion with their finished products. If special advantages are given to a particular trade, the balance of the Tariff will be disturbed, and therefore I shall oppose any change. </para>

                    (New South Wales)... - I would direct the attention of the Vice President of the Executive Council to the duty of 3s. per dozen packets imposed upon playing cards in sheet or cut. Playing cards form a very proper subject for taxation, and an excise duty with a countervailing Customs duty is levied in England. The present duty, which is equivalent to 100 per cent.,
                    <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline>
                    will be absolutely prohibitive, and, therefore, destructive of revenue. The duty should be reduced, or an excise duty should be imposed, so that local manufacturers may not be able to charge what prices they like.
