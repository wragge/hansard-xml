If we are to have a High Court of Australia there ought to be an opportunity of investing that court with jurisdiction to try disputed returns.

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> could not have been listening last night when I gave two very important reasons for the amendment. My first reason was the increased cost that would be incurred if a case were tried in the High Court, and my second reason was the inconvenience which such a reference might occasion. The clause provides for reference to either the High Court of Australia or to the Supreme Court of any State ; but who is to make the choice - the petitioner or the Government ?If it is to be made by the Government, that is a position in which no Government should be placed. It should have nothing to do with such cases. That opinion was expressed very forcibly here during the discussion on the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> when some of the evils of Government interference in these cases were very clearly and distinctly brought under our notice. If the choice is to be made by the petitioner, does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> see what a weapon it will place in the hands of a rich candidate or a candidate with a rich powerful organization at his back, to cause trouble and expense, probably ruin to his opponent? A candidate of that description would inevitably choose the High Court of Australia, as being the very much more expensive court of the two. A disputed return might very well be tried by a Judge of the District Court. The law ought to be as well-known to a District Court Judge as to any Supreme Court Judge. The chief consideration with honorable senators ought to be to get justice done in these matters as cheaply and quickly as possible. The clause as it stands must conduce to great cost and delay. The High Court will necessarily be much more expensive to litigants than will a Supreme Court, just as a Supreme Court is more expensive' than a district court, and a district court in its turn is more expensive than a police court. That disputed questions relating to elections will not be of a very intricate character is proved by the clause which provides that the rules of evidence and all other paraphernalia of the courts shall be dispensed with. The Court of Disputed Returns is to be not a court of law but a court of equity, and it is extremely desirable that as little cost as possible should be permitted to be incurred. Again, the High Court will sit in either Melbourne or Sydney, or perhaps in each city in turn. The Judges may go on circuit over the continent, but it can only be at very long intervals, and thus months may elapse before a justice may be able to go to the North of Queensland to try a case. Consider the enormous expense that would be caused by the adoption of that course. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> says it is extremely desirable to give the High Court jurisdiction in these cases, but it appears to me like invoking the aid of a steam hammer to flatten a pin, or using field artillery to shoot a partridge. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has very clearly demonstrated the utter folly of dragging these cases before the Supreme Court. What questions will come before a Court of Disputed Returns? It may have to inquire whether A was entitled to vote ; whether a candidate or his agent had treated an elector ; and trumpery questions which could easily be settled by a police magistrate. Yet it is proposed to call in the aid of the principal legal officials of the Commonwealth to try these questions. The proposal is absolutely ridiculous. ' I would strike out the reference to the Supreme Court, and have all the cases tried in the. District Courts, and so insure the greatest economy with despatch. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has been setting up a hypothesis of a most unnecessary character, and then proceeding to draw unhappy inferences from his hypothesis. He wishes to know who is to say to what court the question of a disputed return is to be submitted. It is provided most clearly in clause 194 that the House containing the member affected shall refer the question to the court. Surely, in dealing with a petition, the House will determine whether it is to be referred to the High Court of Australia or to the Supreme Court, of a State. </para>

            <para>- Under clause 193 a petition against the return of a member has to be left with the Clerk of the House, or to be presented to the House by a member. The House is then absolutely master of the position. Instead of constituting itself a tribunal to try the election, or appointing a committee for that purpose, it refers the petition to a Court of Disputed Returns, and that court is to be constituted by a Justice of the High Court of Australia, or a Judge of the Supreme Court of any State. The House has the right of choosing one court or the other. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has no objection to a petition being referred to a Judge of the Supreme Court, but he objects to its being referred to a Justice of the High Court. Surely if there is a High Court for the Commonwealth, a House ought to have the opportunity, if it thinks fit, of referring to the highest court in the land the question of a disputed return. If it thinks that there are any circumstances which make it necessary to refer a case to a Judge of the Supreme Court, that can be done. Underlying this clause is a more important principle than perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has recognised. It is quite true that generally speaking they will be very simple matters to determine, but very frequently and at any time the courts may be called upon to interpret the Electoral Act, or the Constitution, to administer the laws by which the Commonwealth is guided. Surely the interpretation of those laws ought to be left in the hands of the Commonwealth's court ? At all events a House of Parliament ought not to be deprived of the right of sending such a case to that court if it thinks that it involves such questions as ought to be dealt with by the highest tribunal in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> speaks as if the Government - or the petitioner - might send a case to any court. That is not the case, because the choice rests with the House of Parliament concerned. If the Government has not a majority to refer a case to a particular court, it will not be referred to that court. The majority of the House will decide what court it is to be referred to. I hope the committee will see that it is necessary to retain this power in the hands of each House, and to leave the clause as it is. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will do well to withdraw his amendment, because he must see what an extraordinary position will be created if we pass by the High Court altogether in the matter of securing interpretations of our own Electoral Act. The honorable senator appears to think that nothing should be left in the hands of Parliament or the Government. But the House in question must be guided by the Government, who will be able to say whether the High Court is busy or not, or whether it is more convenient or less costly to have the case tried in the Supreme Court of the State affected. </para>

          <para>- It appears to me that a most important constitutional point will arise if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment is carried. Every Constitution ought to contain within itself, and to have within the control of the officers appointed under it, the power to carry out the provisions of that Constitution. Outside authorities never ought to appear. I object to the words "a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State " being left in the clause. Suppose we referred an election petition to a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State. That Judge is not under our jurisdiction. We do not pay him. We cannot dismiss him. Suppose he says, " I will not take the case," what are we to do? The Senate ought to be most jealous in keeping within its own power, and in the hands of officers under its control, all matters affecting the interpretation of the Constitution, and the determining of the mode in which its own House is constituted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has assumed a point which is certainly open to doubt - that proceedings in the High Court of Australia will be more expensive than proceedings in the Supreme Court of a State. I do not accept that assumption. I think the facts will be the other way. We know very well that in some States certain counsel secure a monopoly of the important legal business, and charge exceedingly high fees. That will not occur in connexion 'with the High Court of the Commonwealth. Further, a Judge of the High Court will probably be able to sit in any State. It is unnecessary that he should always sit in Melbourne or Sydney. The Judges will go on circuit ; and if a petition comes from Western Australia a Judge of the High Court will try it in Western Australia when he goes to that State on circuit. I certainly hope that the amendment will not be carried, and I should like to see the words, "a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State " eliminated from the clause, so that we. shall have within the four corners of our Electoral Act the power, by ourselves, or by our officers, of arriving at the proper mode in which the Senate shall be constituted, and of determining matters of the highest constitutional importance. </para>

        <para>Senatar STEWART (Queensland). -I was much interested in listening to the few remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> but they appear to me to be altogether beside the question. I have no desire to attack the right of the High Court to interpret the Constitution. That power is given to the High Court by the Constitution itself. But surely honorable senators do not imagine that in connexion with cases of disputed elections, great questions will ever arise involving an exposition of the Constitution. I suppose it is of no use for me to proceed with my amendment. There seems to be no disposition in official circles to make law either cheap or speedy. </para>

          <para>- This clause involves a number of questions with which honorable senators are familiar, because it is copied from the Western Australian Act, and was brought before us during the discussion upon a certain election petition.

        <para class="block">Such a petition might be presented either by a member, or by being left with the Clerk. A petitioner ought not to be denied justice because he cannot induce a member to present his petition. There ought, therefore, to be some provision by which every case shall be heard. The amendment I suggest means that in the case of a petition left with the Clerk, the President will take charge of it and lay it upon the table. If a member presents it, the petition is brought before the House in the ordinary way. </para>

          <para>- I suggest that the words " and presented by a member," in paragraph 1, should be eliminated. A Member of Parliament should have nothing whatever to do with an election petition, which should be presented to an official of the House affected, who should hand it to the President. If a petition is presented by a member, the first objection is that the case assumes a political nature, and, secondly, it places the member presenting it in an invidious position in his own constituency.

          <para>- It ought to be clearly understood what is meant by presenting a petition to the House and leaving it with the Clerk. Suppose a dispute takes place with reference to the return of a senator from Western Australia. If the petition could be delivered to a member of the Senate in Western Australia, to be delivered by him to the Clerk of the Senate, it would be a saving of expense. Does presentation to the Clerk mean that the petitioner can simply put his petition in an envelope and address it to the Clerk ? It might be more convenient and less expensive to present a petition through a member. </para>

          <para>- This clause involves the question whether Parliament is to have the control over petitions, or whether they are to go automatically to the court. As the clause stands, it means that a motion must be made in Parliament. Whatever the merits of the petition may be, unless there is a majority in Parliament to carry the reference to the court nothing further can be done. The great object of substituting a court to try these petitions is to get rid of the party element ; but if we introduce between the court and the petition a motion in Parliament, which almost necessarily will involve party considerations, we are likely to defeat the purpose of the measure. It would be very much better if the Speaker or President were to send on the petition as a matter of course to be tried. If the. petition did not comply with the law, or if the allegations made in it were valueless, that would soon be found out. If, on the other hand, it was worthy of consideration, the court would proceed to consider it. If we are to entirely remove the control of these objections from the element of party, we must provide that once a petition is before the legislature it shall, as a matter of course, go on for trial to the proper court. It must be left to the President or Speaker to decide to which court a petition shall be sent. I move - </para>

            <para>- That is a lawyer's explanation ; to a layman the word seems to govern the whole clause. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> is right the protection which we believed we should derive from this clause when we were discussing clause 190 disappears, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker's</inline> remarks upon it become extremely apposite. We are proposing now to deprive Parliament of the right to determine the court to which these petitions shall be referred. In a matter of this kind we should, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has suggested, safeguard our rights most carefully. No matter who the President or Speaker might be, I should be disinclined to leave a matter of this importance solely to them. The question of whether a member should be allowed to sit in Parliament after a petition against his return has been presented should also be definitely settled. In my own case I took a great deal of legal advice on the subject, and, although the consensus of opinion was that I should not take part in the proceedings of the Senate while the petition against my return was before the House, there were a number of people who thought that I was entitled to sit before the petition had been disposed of. </para>

Neither the President nor <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> would desire to have thrusts upon them the responsibility of choosing the court, because they may not have the requisite knowledge to enable them to consider the question of convenience or expense.

          <para>- What is the object of proposing that petitions shall be laid on the table of the House, when the House is to have no say in the matter ? The ordinary triennial elections for the Senate will take place, more or less, towards the close of a year, and the Senate may not sit for four, and probably not for six months afterwards. Meantime, what would become of a. petition if it had to be laid on the table ? Nothing could be done. If the matter is to be dealt with automatically by the presiding officers of Parliament it is not necessary for it to come before the House. I am opposed to the amendment. The amendment which has just been withdrawn temporarily would introduce a method of dealing with petitions totally different from that provided in this clause, on which I founded my argument in opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> proposal, and was backed up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> in doing so. I should not have opposed that amendment if I had had the least idea that Parliament would have no voice in the matter. </para>

          <para>- Our objection to the amendment is that a petition would have to be laid on the table of the House before it could be sent to the court. The clause is quite out of harmony with the principles contained in other parts of the Bill taking away from Parliament the power to deal with these petitions. Since we have gone so far and acted so wisely why should we compel a man who thinks he has a grievance to wait until Parliament assembles, perhaps six months after a disputed election, to have his petition dealt with? I think the clause ought to read - </para>

          <para>- We appear to have got ourselves into a hopeless tangle simply because the committee had not sufficient resolution to say definitely to what court petitions should be referred. Why should not a petitioner have the power to go at once to the court without any reference to Parliament ? Some honorable senators appear to be greatly troubled about putting the court above Parliament. I am not. It will not be in cases of this kind that the High Court will arrogate to itself powers above Parliament. It would simplify matters very much, and do away with the danger of delay, if we were to provide that . 1 disputed election should be tried before the Supreme Court of the State in which the dispute occurred. </para>

            <para>- Honorable senators are divided in opinion as to whether we should leave out the reference to Parliament. If the clause is left as it is, with the formal amendment I propose, it will be referred by Parliament. Some honorable senators wish that that should be done, and others wish that the petition should be referred automatically to the court. If the words " referred by the President " are carried in the clause, that must mean logically that the President is not to wait until Parliament is sitting, but must go on with the business, and have the petition presented to the court. It seems to me that it will be necessary to give some attention to the drafting of the clause if it is to be amended in that way. I propose that this formal amendment should be carried now, because it is necessary, whichever view is taken. When my subsequent amendment is moved, if the committee are of opinion that the President should send on the petition, I will have the clause redrafted in such a way as to make it unnecessary to have the petition laid upon the table. If, on the other hand, the committee are of opinion that the President should not send the petition on automatically, but that the Senate should deal with it, the clause will remain as it is. </para>

If these duties are left to the President and the Speaker there will be the risk of some feeling that- there has been party action, and I suggest to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the whole difficulty may be obviated by providing that the petition shall be presented to the chief electoral officer for the State in which the disputed election has taken place. If he can be trusted to conduct elections he can be trusted to act as a medium for the presentation of a petition to the necessary court of disputed returns. There may be some novelty in the proposition, but it will be seen that I am making a suggestion which will remove the whole matter from any political or parliamentary influence. This may be considered an important matter to place in this officer's hands, but he will have no more to do with the petition than to forward it to the court. </para>

          <para>- Some honorable senators seem to think that there are two courts to which these petitions may be referred, but I submit that there is only one court - the court of disputed returns - to which they can be referred. By clause 190 we provide that a court of disputed returns shall be constituted by a Justice of the High Court of Australia or a Judge of the Supreme Court of any State. These are the persons qualified to be members of a court of disputed returns, but they are not the court of disputed returns - they must first of all be proclaimed by the Governor-General and gazetted. The choice is left between the Federal Bench and the State Supreme Court Benches, whichever maj' be convenient, but when the decision is made there is but one court of disputed returns. I submit to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that he should provide in the Bill a method for constituting the court. The honorable and learned senator no doubt assumes that the Governor-General in Council will have the inherent power to proclaim and gazette the personality of the court. All that Parliament is doing in the matter is to provide that the court shall be constituted bY a Judge of the Federal High Court or a Judge of the Supreme Court of any State, and when it is constituted the  Clerk  will have no option but to send any petition he receives to the court of disputed returns, whoever constitutes it. In the case of Western Australia it will probably be more convenient that it should be constituted of one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of the State, but in the case of Victoria a Judge of the Federal High Court may, perhaps, more conveniently constitute the court. The court of disputed returns must be established, and when it is gazetted it will remain until the gazettal is cancelled, and a new court has been gazetted, and therefore the  Clerk  when he receives the petition will know at once to whom it is to be sent. </para>

          <para>- This discussion shows how difficult it is to clear ourselves of precedent. We have all been in the habit, for a great many years, of considering that Parliament should have a voice in connexion with these disputed returns. I am entirely in accord with honorable senators who think that Parliament should have nothing whatever to do with them. We have provided that a petition shall be presented to one or other of the Houses, but why should the petition be presented to Parliament? Why should we not follow the English precedent, and allow the petitioner to present his petition at once to the court of disputed returns? The whole of the difficulty we are now discussing would then disappear. The English practice to which I refer was brought into operation in 1882, and it has worked satisfactorily ever since. I do not see why it should not work here equally well. </para>

          <para>- The whole difficulty is with regard to the court which is to receive the petition and finally adjudicate upon it. In this matter I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is perfectly right, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> is right also, in another sense. If we settle the court which is to be the court of disputed returns, we shall get oyer the difficulty. It will not matter then who forwards the petition, and I have no objection to the petitioner himself forwarding it. We should lay down the principle that the court to decide such petitions should be the High Court of Australia, or the Supreme Court of a State, and the balance of argument, in my opinion, is in favour of the contention that it should be the High Court of Australia, because it has been pointed out that there will be cases in which constitutional law will have to be interpreted. In certain circumstances the Supreme Court of a State would fail, and it is not a tribunal which should interpret the Constitution. We ought to decide upon the constitution of the court, because if there is an alternative court provided for, and it is left to the President, Speaker, or Clerk to forward a petition, he may make a mistake with regard to the merits of a case, and send it to a court which may not be competent to deal with it. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> has fallen into the error that it is decided to give an option to the parties as to which tribunal they are to resort. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> dealt with that matter, but he might have gone a little further. He has pointed out that the provision under clause 190, establishing a court of disputed returns, does not give the parties interested an option as to the tribunal to which they may resort. We have a power under the Constitution to invest any State court or judge' of any State court with federal jurisdiction in certain matters. The moment we do that the Judge of a State Supreme Court acting judicially within the province of the matters delegated to him, constitutes a federal court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing's</inline> remarks as to the competence of the Governor-General in Council to decide which shall be the court of disputed returns involves this position - that the Government would be able, by gazetting, to decide, for example, that the court of disputed returns in the State of South Australia should be the Chief Justice <inline font-style="italic">ex officio</inline> of that State, or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J</inline> ustice So-and-so of that State, and in the same way with Western Australia, Queensland, and the other States. The court of disputed returns would in that way be absolutely fixed, and the party disputing the election would have no option. There is a great deal in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> has said as to the absurdity of slavishly adhering to precedent. Of late years it has been the practice with other Parliaments to leave the determination of disputes connected with elections to outside tribunals, so that they may be settled in an atmosphere absolutely removed from party strife. Many Parliaments, however, have thought it necessary to provide for a formal recognition - which is of no practical value - of a right, the exercise of which they have always previously insisted upon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> referred to what has taken place in the old country, and I desire to draw the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to the fact that for many years past disputed elections in Tasmania have been determined upon very much the same  petitioner does not approach Parliament at all. He presents a petition to the clerk of the Supreme Court of Tasmania, and a copy of it to the electoral officer for the district in which the election took place, and the proceedings of the court go on without reference to Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> spoke about a County Court Judge being able to determine these matters ; but in Tasmania they are determined by the Full Court sitting without a jury, and the finding of the court is forwarded, I think, by certificate to the President of the Council, or to the Speaker of the Assembly, as the case may be. </para>

He should be able to lodge his petition with the clerk of the court of disputed returns, and the case should be determined as an action in which neither House of Parliament has any interest until it is completed. The matter should be dealt with by a court easily accessible to the parties, and there should be no cumbrous and perhaps dangerously delaying forms to be followed to uphold in some shadowy way the dignity and privileges of Parliament. </para>

          <para>- I believe that honorable senators are of opinion that election petitions should be presented for settlement to some tribunal other than the Legislature. The acrimonious debates which took place in this Chamber some months back, in regard to the petition against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> return, made it painfully evident that this is not a suitable body for the settlement of such cases. While I believe that every honorable senator entered upon the discussion of that case in an impartial state of mind, I feel that we all were very much biased before it was finished with. I would suggest, however, that the petition be placed in the hands of the Clerk of the Senate instead of in the hands of the President, and that he alone should be responsible for sending it on to the tribunal which is to deal with it. Unless we make some provision of that sort, we may have the blunder which occurred in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> petition repeated. </para>

          <para>- I think that the convenience of the petitioners, and those who are petitioned against, should be considered in this matter, and that a case arising in Western Australia, for instance, should bo dealt with in the courts of that State. If a petitioner were compelled to bring his case before the High Court the expenses might be so great that a poor man could not hope to get justice. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir WILLIAM.</inline>ZEAL (Victoria). - I think there ought to be no costs, since they would only encourage litigation. If a man has a good Case and wins it he gets everything he requires. The clause will enable rich people to fee counsel and prolong hearings to an undesirable extent without any benefit to the public. At all events, costs should be on the most reasonable scale, say that of the county court. A labouring man who, in prosecuting a claim, had to call perhaps a dozen witnesses, and was unsuccessful, might be absolutely ruined. </para>
