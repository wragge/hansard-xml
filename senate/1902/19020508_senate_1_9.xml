          <para>- I hope it will not be deemed egotism on my part in addressing myself to the question before the Chamber, to refer to the fact that this is the fourth or fifth Tariff with which, during my public life, I have had to deal, and I may fairly claim that no member of the Senate has had greater experience inParliament and upon the platform in debating the question of free-trade. I do not, however, propose to address myself to-day to the ethics of free-trade,because I think that the occasion is not opportune. That is a duty which, no doubt, free-traders will discharge from time to time as opportunity may offer ; but, at present, we are face to face with a legislative rather than an academic proposition. It is with the proposals of the Government now before us that I intend to deal to-day. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the great freetrade State of New South Wales practically abandoned&#39; theoretical free-trade when, by the vote of her citizens, she accepted the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution. I do not moan to suggest that New South Wales then abandoned free-trade for protection, and I should be very sorry if any one assumed that that is my meaning. WhatImean is, that a majority of the electors of New South Wales accepted federation, and apparently let free-trade take its chance, most worthily hoping for the best. I was one of the doubters, and all who have taken the trouble to inform themselves upon the subject are aware that I opposed the Commonwealth Bill upon the ground that I preferred the traditional free-trade policy of New South Wales to the prospective advantages, whatever they might be, offered to us in the shape of federation. Although I was in a minority, I have since loyally accepted the situation, and I take it that it is the duty of every member of the community, no matter what his views upon fiscal and other questions may be, toloyally abide by the provisions of the Constitution, and to do his utmost to see that the people of Australia benefit in every possible way from the union which was consummated by the acceptance of the Act. The proposals of the Government have created, so far as New South Wales is concerned, I will not say disappointment, but dissatisfaction, because that is a larger term which includes the lesser term disappointment, and I believe that if the State was polled to-day not 10 per cent. of the electors would vote for the acceptance of the Commonwealth Constitution. </para>

            <para>- That may or may not be ; I am stating what I believe to be a fact, though it may be a deplorable one. This dissatisfaction has been created very largely by the fact that many people did not look sufficiently far into the future, and pay sufficient regard to the possibilities that lay before them. They very worthily imagined that federation would accomplish a great deal which has not yet had time to eventuate, but which will probably come to pass in the middle or distant future. They are also dissatisfied because, instead of obtaining a Tariff such as they have been accustomed to ever since New South Wales has had constitutional government, they find themselves under trammels and restraints of which they had previously no knowledge. But it is our duty to be as loyal in adversity as in success, and if we as free-traders have not before us the privileges of freetrade which we enjoyed in the past, we must regard it as an obligation to do our best under the circumstances, and to take the rough with the smooth. It is the duty of frae-traders not to cry over spilt milk, not to ask for the unattainable, which I take to be theoretical free-trade, and not to waste time at the present juncture in discussing the ethics of free-trade. For my part, I shall leave such discussions for future occasions. I think, however, that it is our duty to demand a Tariff which, while producing sufficient revenue for the requirements of the Commonwealth, will do as little injury as possible to the community at large. The references which I have made to New South Wales will, perhaps, be the last which I shall make during my speech. I do not propose, unless I am driven to it, to draw any of the invidious comparisons, in. which some people have luxuriated, between the advantages possessed by one State and those of another, or the progress of one State and that of another ; nor do I wish to deal with the question from a narrow or purely provincial stand-point. I wish to consult the well-being of the greatest number in the community. That being so, I consider it the duty of free-traders to demand - and I use the word in its fullest significance - and if our voting strength be stronger than our voices and our arguments, to. take by vote, a policy which will do the greatest good to the greatest number, and the least evil to any. In my opinion, such a Tariff should interfere as little as may be with the natural conditions of the country, and take from the people only so much revenue as is needed in the interests of good government. In view of the fact that the Ministry submitted to the other Chamber a Tariff which, according to their own showing, would have taken from the taxpayers &#163;1,000,000 more than was required, and that the proposals now submitted to us would take from them something like &#163;500,000 more than is required, I say, with the greatest respect to those who support the propositions of the Government, that their scheme of duties is opposed to the cardinal principles of just taxation. There is no principle of taxation that has ever been laid down more persistently and with greater effect and authority than this, that it is the duty of the Parliament to take no more from the pockets of the people than is absolutely necessary for the purposes of good government. If it takes more it perpetrates a public wrong. It takes from the pocket of one man more than from the pocket of another - for whose benefit? Not for the benefit of the whole community, because when it has achieved the sum of taxation which is necessary for the purposes of good government it can go no further without committing a public wrong on some one. That being so, I submit this proposition as being a truth that it will be difficult to deny - that in view of the vast area of the Commonwealth and its sparse population, it is the primary industries - the natural industries - that produce the greatest benefits to the whole community, and consequently if there are benefits to be conferred upon any class because of the manner in which the Tariff is drawn, the primary industries are more deserving of consideration at the hands of the Legislature than are the secondary or artificial industries. Why ? Using the term widely,the whole world will buy the raw products of Australia, while very little of the world will buy its manufactured products, and for the simple reason that the natural products can be produced at the lowest possible figure, while the products of the secondary or artificial industries can only be produced, owing to our local conditions and our wages rates, at prices which render them impossible of purchase by the rest of the civilized world. We can send our wool all over the world. Every part of the world buys the clip of Australia, but all the world is not prepared to pay&#39; Australia&#39;s needful prices for the wool made up in its territory. Therefore, I submit this proposition, that in the framing of our Tariff we should seek consideration for the industries of the soil and the mine rather than the industries of the. workshop and the factory, the market for the product of one being absolutely without limit in the world, while the product of the second must necessarily be limited to a market within our own boundaries. Having laid down these initial propositions, I come to another question, and one which I think has not been raised - Is the action of the Government such as warrants our placing at their disposal the enormous revenues that are involved in this Tariff? </para>

            <para>- I shall come to another feature of the case in a short time - as to whether they spend it justifiably. I do not intend, if possible, to exceed the time I named last night - about an hour - and, therefore, I ask that I shall not be led off the track of my observations by interjections, because, if I am, I have no doubt that there will be interjections to which it will be possible to frame replies, and I do not know where I might stop. In the first instance, I ask - Are the Government, in their management of the finances, worthy of being intrusted with the huge spending power which the passing of such a Tariff as the one before us involves ? I submit these two propositions first. Has the action of the Government in connexion with the great question of defence been such in its financial relations as to warrant the Senate in placing at their disposal the large sums involved ? </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- Certainly it is relevant, according to all. my parliamentary experience. I submit, sir, with great respect, that this is a Bill which asks for money, and that when the Government ask for &#39;great powers of raising revenue this necessarily involves the manner in which that money is expended. I am not going through the Government departments. Under the speakership of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton,</inline> now Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, in New South Wales, I, as well as many others, have been allowed - I am not submitting that as a precedent, but as you have asked me a question, I am replying to it - to investigate the expenditure of every department at the fullest length, and I do not think, on consideration, you will see that there can be a more cogent connexion between revenue and expenditure than the one I propose to deal with. I have no intention of dealing at any length with this subject, nor do I propose to deal with more than the one department. The other proposition that I shall submit,, when I have dealt with the first, is a3 to whether in these proposals the Government have kept faith with the people who put them in their present position of place and pay. The framers of the Constitution Act thought that three great departments were of such momentous significance that they provided that they were to be taken over by proclamation, without waiting for any parliamentary action. They could have been taken over on the 1 st day of January, 1 90 1, so far as the law permitted. Immediately federation was consummated, it was within the power of the Government, by proclamation, to take over that which they took over very shortly afterwards - the three great departments of Customs, Post and Telegraphs, and Defence. By reason of the very fact, that these three great services were placed in the very forefront, there must be the fullest recognition, I am sure, on the part of all concerned, that they were leading features in the agreement that brought about the federal power which now exists.  I am sure it must be within the knowledge of us all that no subject was more seriously discussed and more urgently put forward as a plea for f federation  than the necessity of a satisfactory defence force. But I take it that there is no department of Government which has been so unsatisfactorily handled as the great Defence department, particularly in regard to financial matters. I see daily in the press statements by Ministers that there is to be a great saving in the defence expenditure. If there is going to be such a great saving as is intimated, that will be one reason, I submit, for not voting all the moneys which are asked for. If the Government intend to carry on the Defence department at six months&#39; expenditure, of a twelve months&#39; vote, we shall not want anything like all the money which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> is asking for in this Tariff. But what are the facts? That though Parliament has voted moneys for the Defence department, they are to be hoarded ; they are not in the hands of the public creditors of the Commonwealth. In one State  that I have a very complete knowledge of it is almost discreditable to be in a position in the defence force that involves the incurring of liabilities, because the money is not forthcoming to pay them. In answering a question of mine in the Senate the other day - and I only mention this incidentally - the Minister said that the Government had received &#163;340,000 from the Home Government in connexion with certain contingents despatched, or to be despatched. I cannot walk the streets of Sydney without being bailed up by people who wish to know why they cannot be paid when the Government have had this enormous sum in their possession from the Imperial authorities. </para>

            <para>.- Yes. There are abundance of obligations incurred by the Government to the people of Australia in connexion with the despatch of Imperial contingents, for which they, through my honorable and learned friend, have acknowledged the receipt of &#163;340,000 through the Bank of Australasia in Melbourne. These people wish to know, as I do, why the accounts are not paid. </para>

            <para>- I shall take advantage of my honorable and learned friend&#39;s request, but that does not affect the ordinary expenditure of. the departments - the money for which is derived from this Tariff. Things are so bad that, so far as I know, in one great State the whole department of Defence does not own half-a-dozen sheets of paper, or- as many envelopes, for carrying on its business. I know that officers and non-commissioned officers are incurring debts to provide even the few envelopes and few sheets of paper for carrying on their work. It is not creditable for any Government to ask us for our assent to a Tariff of &#163;8,500,000, and not to be able to afford a few envelopes and a few sheets of paper which Parliament has voted the money for, which were requisitioned for months and months ago, but which are not yet forthcoming. </para>

            <para>.- -The proper time to discuss the question is when we are asked to provide money to afford more lack of attention to the administration of government. This great spending department - one of the most costly, unfortunately, and one which, therefore, makes the greatest demand on the Tariff - has been unhappily neglected in a very persistent manner. The Government have been in office nearly eighteen months, and we are passing Supply Bill after Supply Bill to provide from the proceeds of this very Tariff the means of conducting a department that is in a condition of chaos. Let me in the briefest possible way point out why I use that term. </para>

            <para>.- If I needed a precedent to justify my present action it is to be found in the proceedings of the British Houses of Legislature, where it is regarded as a high duty to make known matters which are perhaps not pleasant, but which, in the interests of the whole community should be made known. The Ministry have been in office for nearly eighteen months, . but up to the present moment there is no law in existence which allows of the proper carrying on of the defence forces of Australia. After all this time there is not one single man who has been attested as a soldier or volunteer of the Commonwealth. There is no lawful authority under which a man can be so attested or sworn. The Government allowed twelve months to elapse - during which period they were seeking legislative assent to this profposed taxation - before they appointed a responsible military adviser. Before taking office they had a Bill prepared by the  commandants of the different  States, but although that measure was in print something very different was submitted to Parliament after it had been sitting three or four mouths. What has become of that Bill <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

            <para>- I agree with the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor. His</inline> colleague, who has taken charge of the Defence department, has done good work in New South Wales as Minister for Defence, and, therefore, I am glad to offer my congratulations in connexion with what I think is a very wise appointment. In view of what the  President  has said, I shall postpone what I intended to say in this connexion, and what, from my experience as a Parliamentarian, I thought and think within the limits of debate. I shall have another opportunity of referring to the matter, and that before very long. Therefore, I content myself with saying that in respect of the finance matters connected with the defence force, I consider that the action of the Government has been highly culpable, and of a character that does not warrant them in asking at the hands of the Legislature the enormous revenue which they seek under this Tariff. Apparently the proceeds of the Tariff will be devoted to a continuation of the mal-administration to which I have already made partial reference. I shall, however, be strictly in order in pointing out that the last liberal Government of Great Britain was hurled from power over a mere detail connected with this very question. I have been discussing the whole of the finances of the Defence department, but the last liberal Government in England were hurled from power, because, in the estimation of Parliament, they had not a sufficient supply of one description of cartridge, namely, cordite, in stock. That one fact was enough to depose that Administration. How much worse is the position when we have experienced twelve months of bungling, neglect, and most unhappy dealings in connexion with a department the expenditure of which, in its relation to the affairs of the Commonwealth, is equally as momentous as is the military expenditure of Great Britain in its relation to the finances of the Empire. Now I come to the other proposition that I laid down - whether the Government have kept faith with the electors. In passing, I must be permitted to quote the utterance of the leader of the Senate, who, in moving the second reading of this Bill, used these words - </para>

At the same time I maintain that the fact of these words being attributed to the honorable and learned senator, and being allowed to go without contradiction were the means of obtaining for him an amount of support that could not possibly have come to him had he been recognised as a protectionist throughout the piece. Now I pass to the consideration of what the Prime Minister has said and done, and of what he is asking us to help him in doing. </para>

I would remind honorable senators that in confirming this Tariff - if we do confirm it - we have not only to fix the duties for the future, but to give our legislative sanction to the Tariff which was introduced in the first instance, and under which a large amount of revenue has been collected. W e have to deal with the original Tariff as well as with that which is now before us. Therefore we must consider the Tariff as it was introduced. As regards the moderate Tariff that the Prime Minister&#39;s speech indicated, we find that a quarter of the duties imposed under it ranged from 45 per cent. upwards, some of them reaching as high as 250 per cent.; one-twelfth ranged from 25 to 45 per cent.; one-half were from 18 to 25 per cent., and only one-seventeenth of the whole were under17&#190; percent. That is entirely apart from narcotics and stimulants. Then the Prime Minister went to Newcastle, and on the 5th March said - . </para>
        <para>The only way to get over the difficulty was to raise a Commonwealth Tariff, which neither a protectionist nor a free-trader would think of for one moment. No Tariff which now existed could <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> adopted. </para>

The Government did not adopt the Victorian Tariff, because they &#34; went one better.&#34; They asked Parliament to sanction a heavier Tariff than the Victorian Tariff, which certainly was a very long way from having any free-trade element in it. </para>

            <para>- Yes, we are asked to sanction certain composite duties which were collected up to a certain date. One duty of this character still disfigures the Tariff, and I hope it will be altered before the Bill becomes law. The Tariff introduced by the Government, including narcotics and stimulants, was 6 per cent. higher than the Victorian Tariff, and apart from narcotics and stimulants, the average of the duties was 22-93 per cent., or practically 23 per cent. compared with 20 per cent. under the Victorian Tariff. The difference does not consist merely of 3 per cent. It is a great deal more, because it is 3 per cent. on 20 per cent., equal to 7 per cent., and therefore the increase is greater, looked at from the correct stand-point, than the figures would at first indicate. </para>

          <para>Whatever may have been said in criticism of the Tariff as compared with the Maitland manifesto, I assert without hesitation that there is not one item in it, and not one principle which has been enunciated in the statement of it by the Government which does not directly carry out the promise made in the Maitland manifesto. We have carried it out, and are here to adhere to it...... What I am pointing out is that ours is a protectionist Government. It is a Ministry which felt that it had a clear course to follow. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Now, I ask, did the Government follow a clear course? The Vice-President of the Executive Council has shown that instead of the Government following a clear course they followed a singularly muddy one ; one which I venture to think no previous Ministry ever dared to follow. No Government ever allowed themselves to be kicked and cuffed by a majority of the Legislature as the present Ministry has done. My honorable friend gave us a list of a dozen lines upon which he showed that the other Chamber had denied the Government &#163;1,000,000 of revenue. That is following a clear course, according to my honorable friend ; but I think j,t is following a course of an exceedingly cloudy character. The Government have accepted at the hands of the Legislature what they could get, thanking God for it, and never caring twopence about principle, or policy, or even Ministerial self-respect. Unfortunately the bulk of these reductions - and I greatly regret it - have been made upon revenue rather than upon protective items, and the protective features of the Tariff are more obnoxious to me to-day that they were when first introduced, because there has been an enormous reduction of revenue duties. On three lines only there has been a reduction of &#163;700,000, made up of &#163;350,000 on tea, a revenue item pure and simple; &#163;200,000 on cotton piece goods, another revenue duty pure and simple ; and &#163;150,000 on kerosene, a revenue duty purely, with the exception that there are two companies in New South Wales engaged in the manufacture of that article. Undoubtedly the majority in the other Chamber, if they have not made the Tariff more free-trade, have at least done grand work in protecting the pockets of the taxpayers from unjust assault. In that respect they have my very hearty congratulations, although I do not agree with their action in having struck out some lines. I do not hesitate to say that if an attempt is made here to substitute the tea duty for some of the obnoxious items that find a place in the schedule, it is more than likely that I shall support it. I wish to make another quotation from the Prime Minister, and I think this will be the last. At Maitland he asked a question in these pregnant words - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Shall we pile  the duties  on to the cottager and the artisan? </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Of course the question was asked with a view to eliciting a negative, and it implied a negative. I say that this Tariff&#39; piles duties on the cottager and the artisan, and on the workmen all round such as are not imposed upon people who are better able to bear taxation. That is mv strongest reason for not adopting this Tariff, or agreeing to it only with alterations of a material character. I shall mention a few of the duties which we were told were not to be placed upon the cottager and the artisan, and compare them with others in the schedule which will bear upon those who are better able to contribute to the revenue. If I were not a poor man I should probably nob feel as strongly as I do, because it is only by experience that we can learn to appreciate the difficulties that beset the poorer classes. If I had been born with a silver spoon in my mouth, or if I had been possessed of large property, or a big banking balance, I should probably not have been able to appreciate as I do the troubles of those who have to work for their daily bread, and to whom these imposts are matters of the direst consequence. . I find that under the Tariff as first introduced the poor man&#39;s blankets had to bear a duty of 20 per cent., whilst the furs of the well-to-do were subject to a,  duty of  only 15 percent. Flannelette, which is very  largely used  by those  who can not afford  to buy anything more wholesome or better, was taxed at the rate of 20 percent., whilst silk bore a duty of only 1 5 per cent. Butter cloth and cheese cloth, which are used, by the farmer in preparing his produce for market, were taxed at 13 per cent., the same rate as was imposed upon velvets and laces, which are among the most expensive articles imported. The man who wanted a. tent or a tarpaulin to protect him or his goods from the weather had to pay a duty of 20 per cent., whilst ribbons, laces, flouncings, and plush were dutiable at only 15 percent. Is that protecting the artisan and the cottager? I think not. I think that is an assault on the poor in the interests of those who can better afford to incur expenditure. </para>

            <para>- He wants a tent occasionally, and .also often wants, tarpaulins. Then we come to another little item that is certainly more in use by the cottager and the artisan classes than by the wealthy - floor matting, 20 per cent. ; while furs, feathers, and embroidery were to come in at 15 per cent. Is that protecting those who were to be protected according to the Maitland oratory ? The unfortunate woman who is endeavouring to earn a few pounds to keep her from the poor-house had to pay 20 per cent, on her mangle ; whilst fencing-foils and masks were to come in at 15 per cent., for the benefit of whoever wants to use them. Surely the artisan and the cottager use screws, but they have to bear a duty of 25 per cent., whilst the man with themansion, who wants electric lighting and. electric bells, was to pay, on his electrical appliances 15 per cent. Then we come to a line that seems to me to &#34; out-Herod Herod &#34; in this Tariff. Medicines for the sick, the comforts foi- the sick- room and the hospital, were to pay 25 per cent. - 5s. in the <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1 -</inline> whilst perfumery was to come in for 5 per cent. less. I do not object to the importation of luxuries. Let every one who can afford to use luxuries have them. But, sir, this Tariff does not, as my honorable and learned friend asserted in moving the second reading of the Bill, fulfil the conditions of the Maitland speech, and it fails to do so in a very startling manner. But I will cometo the Tariff as it stands. I do not care by whose votes it has been altered. It is too long a job to go through <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and study the exact meaning of each division in order to ascertain whether alterations were made by the application of protectionist, free-trade, or revenue tariff principles. I care not for the influences at work : I care for the document which is put before us today, and for which my honorable and learned friend asks our support in its entirety, though I venture to say that he knows that he will not get it. </para>

            <para>- I do not think I am paying him a compliment : I am simply speaking the truth about him. That is the way I feel towards him. Personally I feel the greatest regard for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor,</inline> and regard him as one of the most courteous gentlemen I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with in a legislative capacity. I am stating what has been my own experience - -nothing more nor nothing less. Now I come to the Tariff of to-day. Again I am going  to take the Maitland speech, and refer to the effect of this Tariff on the cottager and the artisan, though I shall not refer to its application to so close an extent as I did in regard to the original Tariff. Mangles are articles that are more used by the poor than by the rich. They are more used by people who want to make a living by means of them than in any other way. Mangles pay 20 per cent., but steam-rollers are free. Why should the old woman who wants to save herself from the workhouse pay 20 per cent, on her mangle, while the magnate can get in a steamroller duty free <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> Agricultural and horticultural implements are to pay 15 per cent. Surely honorable senators will agree with me that that is a duty which falls upon the artisan and the cottager. But the well-to-do newspaper proprietor and the owner of a great printing establishment can have their linotypes and their other laboursaving machinery of a similar character imported free of duty. Clothes-wringers pay 15 per cent. There the old woman is affected again. But printing presses are free. Washing-machines for the old woman pay 15 per cent. ; sewing machines for the young ones pay nothing. The young ones get the advantage there as it seems to mo  they  generally do in this world. Beer bottles pay 10 per cent., whilst watch glasses are free. Why should not watch glasses pay as well as beer bottles? Why should not one equally with the other pay &#93; 0 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I come next to pianos. We know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that pianos are not used for purposes of public instruction by the State. They are used by private teachers. The teacher who wants to buy a piano for the purpose of obtaining pupils, and gaining an honest and  useful livelihood - though the results of pianoforte tuition are not altogether pleasant for the neighbours - has to pay 20 per cent, on his instrument; but the man who wants to upset the sanity and peace of a whole district with a bad fiddle can get it in free of duty. I will wind up by one other  shocking example. While the tools  used by the handicraftsmen of almost every trade which can be named - even to the basket in which the tools are to be carried - are free of duty : yet, because some one has a wretched little hole where bad brushes are made, the painter and the paperhanger are to be mulct to the extent of 25 per cent, on their tools &#34;of trade. I hope, that will be one of the things which the Senate will alter. Now I have come to my last note : and if this session is to last much longer, I think we shall all come to our last &#34; notes &#34; ! The Vice-President of the Executive Council more than once used a- phrase in his speech to which I take the gravest exception. He said - </para>

        <para class="block">Where did the honorable and learned senator get the word &#34; suggestions &#34; from ? It is not contained in that part of the Commonwealth Act which deals with the powers of the two Chambers. The term that is used in section 58 is infinitely stronger and more powerful. It is the word &#34;requesting&#34;; and when that power of request is backed up by the power of penalty, it becomes so uncommonly like a demand that the difference is not worth discussing. This Senate has power to request the other Chamber to make alterations in this Tariff, and if those alterations are not made as requested, this Senate has the power to take such action as imposes a serious penalty either upon Ministers, &#39;or upon the recalcitrant Chamber. </para>

The second consideration is that there may be a penal dissolution, which would affect members of the Senate to some extent, but which would be very welcome to many of us. There are members of the Senate who. would like to see a dissolution very much indeed.- &#34;I should for one. Nothing would suit me better. Our policy would win. There would be no such Tariff before the next Parliament as the one submitted now. Of that I am absolutely sure. </para>

            <para>- I do not want to pursue the matter. I am only expressing my own view. I may not be expressing the opinion of every member of the Senate. But it is clear that the Constitution contains in very plain English and in very plain type the word I have, mentioned ; and we are justified in forming an opinion accordingly and expressing it at the proper time and in the proper place. I think it my duty to call attention to the fact  that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> told us in effect that we must accept the Tariff as it stands - that we must, to use a colloquial phrase, accept it holus <inline font-style="italic">bolus</inline> - or risk the mysterious threat, &#34;take the consequences.&#34; But I think there are many senators, even amongst those in disagreement with me and my more immediate friends in the fiscal views I have expressed, who, if it came to a question of maintaining the rights of this Chamber, would maintain them with due regard for courtesy and the public welfare. I use the word &#34; rights &#34; because I hate the word &#34; privileges &#39;&#39; - we have no privileges, but clear statutory rights, in relation to the other Chamber. It is our bounden duty to maintain those rights under all circumstances - to maintain them at all hazards - though I do not intend to convey the  extremest  meaning usually attached to that phrase. I, for one, am prepared to &#34; take the consequences,&#34; whatever they may he, and I feel sure that I by no means stand alone. I believe that the Senate is prepared to do its duty - that protectionists and freetraders alike will do their duty. Whether the extremists on each side will also do their duty I do not know ; in the present condition of affairs I do not profess to be an extremist. L desire the greatest good for the greatest number. I want I do not know how  many  alterations in the schedule before the Tariff will meet my views. I advocate what is desirable for the community at large. I want to see the taxpayers&#39; pockets safe from unjust demands, and the great producing industries of Australia considered to the fullest extent in the imposition of duties which must, in some form or another, affect or hamper the development of enterprises, not only those most suitable for Australia, but others which are very little suited to the circumstances of this country, although they are at present in existence. I do not believe that we are justified in maintaining duties merely because half-a-dozen people somewhere or other have a little factory and are trying to manufacture under conditions which render success an impossibility. There is nothing I know of te prevent the breeding of polar bears at the Equator if we only provide enough ice. But who will pursue the possible merely because it is possible? Who will risk money, and, I might almost say, risk a reputation for sanity, in attempting industries which are wholly unsuited to our conditions, as compared with industries which are natural to the country, and afford the greatest scope for enterprise and employment, with wealth for those engaged in them, and benefit to the entire community? </para>

A majority of senators prefer to tinker the Tariff a little more, although, heaven knows, it has been tinkered at hard enough in the other House. By a little more tinkering we may possibly attain something which, if it does not fulfil any known condition of fiscal principles, will at least answer the purpose of raising the necessary funds for carrying on the work of the Commonwealth, and providing for the different States the proportion of revenue to which they are entitled. All I can hope for is that, if the second reading be passed, reductions of duty representing at least &#163;500,000 may be made, in order that there may be no excess of revenue beyond the requirements which .the Government themselves have announced. My second hope is that the incidence of taxation may be to the advantage of the larger industries instead of the smaller, and that to the whole of the community of the Commonwealth there may be the greatest amount of benefit with the least possible injury. </para>

          <para>- Before addressing myself to the main question, I desire to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing&#39;s</inline> very remarkable speech, of last evening, seeing that it affects me personally. The quotations which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> used clearly prove the desperate straits to which the free-trade party are reduced in this Chamber. If the honorable and learned senator had known all the  circumstances of the case - if he had ascertained the facts for himself instead of relying on other people - he certainly would not have made the remarks to which I take exception. </para>

            <para>- If the honorable senator can make a remark like that after the explanation I have made, I give him up. The whole thing is patent. I have proved that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> was utterly wrong, and I think that by this time he will be sorry that he made the remark in question. I desire to say something in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing&#39;s</inline> speech, but I have been diverted from the line of attack that I mapped out for myself. The honorable and learned senator was so delightfully simple in the arguments which he put before the Senate last night in relation to protection that I cannot refrain from replying to the statements that he&#34; made. In this connexion also he quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bishop,</inline> who was at one time  president  of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council. If he had known <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bishop</inline> as well as I do - if he had been aware of the fact that that gentleman is out of the State, as well as the cause of his absence - he certainly would not have fallen into the trap that had been set for him by his free-trade friends. </para>

            <para>- No. But that has no bearing upon the matter. The burden of the quotation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bishop</inline> said that protection had failed. But what was the reason for that statement? Does the honorable and learned senator know the context from which the words in question were taken ? Does he not know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bishop</inline> was referring at the time to that new protection which has always been advocated by the labour representatives of the Parliaments of this and other States ? He was referring to the fact that in the past the working man had not received the full fruit of his labour. He was pointing out also that if the manufacturers obtained protection through the Custom-house, the workmen engaged in all protected manufactories should also be protected by means of a minimum wage. That is a system of protection to which I think all labour men subscribe. It is a doctrine that I have held and preached for a number of years. Hence I say now that the statement is perfectly true j that in the years that have passed and gone the protected manufacturers have not done the right thing by the workmen of Australia. It is because we recognised that fact that we put our ideas into legislative form. To-day we have the minimum wage : to-day we have Arbitration Acts in some of the States to protect the workmen in the way I have mentioned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> appeared to derive a great deal of satisfaction from quoting the present Chief Secretary of Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trenwith.</inline> Certainly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trenwith</inline> made the statement attributed to him, but he made it exactly in the way that it was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bishop,</inline> namely, that although various trades and manufactures had been protected through the Customhouse, yet they had not done a correspondingly fair thing by their workmen. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> waxed indignant upon the formation of rings and trusts under protection. That is the same old argument that has been trotted out time after time against the protectionist policy. I should like to ask the honorable and learned senator whether rings and trusts do not also obtain in free-trade countries <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

            <para>- I shall have something to say about America in a few moments. I shall read a quotation from one of the best articles by Andrew Carnegie, which cuts the ground from under the feet of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing, Senator Smith,</inline> and two or three other honorable senators who have spoken very strongly on the formation of rings and trusts. It shows that the rings and trusts in America are not as bad as those honorable senators have endeavoured to make out. I should like to point out that rings and trusts exist also in freetrade as well as in protectionist countries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> gave us a striking example of what importers can do when he referred to the coal ring which was formed in Victoria, and I shall give another. </para>

I desire to show that, even in the protectionist State of Victoria - and this example could be multiplied by many others - the importers themselves formed a ring, and forced up the price of a certain article on which there was no duty. I refer to the price of reapers and binders - a matter that is known to some honorable senators. </para>

            <para>- There was a hardheaded farmer who was thinking of taking a trip to America for pleasure combined with business. He had heard that reapersand binders could be purchased from the manufacturers there for &#163;28 each. In a, casual way he informed a friend that he was going to do a very good thing for himself ; that he intended to purchase a reaper and binder for the sum which I have named.  His  friend replied - &#34;I think you ought to help me to get a good thing too: buy one forme.&#34; The farmer replied that he would do so. The matter leaked out in the farming community in which these people lived, and before the gentleman left Victoria he had been requested by no less than eighteen men to purchase reapers and binders for themfrom the manufacturers in America. On reaching America he went to the factory where the machines were manufactured and purchased twenty reapers and binders. He put down his gold. Everything was satisfactory, and I presume that the manufacturer thought that he had done a good stroke of business that day. But eventually the manufacturer said to him - &#34; Where do you want these machines to be sent <inline font-style="italic">1&#34;</inline> He replied - &#34;Melbourne, Victoria.&#34; The answer came at once - &#34; We cannot send them there. We cannot sell, and if you want - reapers and binders, you must buy them of our sole agents in Melbourne.&#34; </para>

            <para>- This will show that, so far as reapers and binders were concerned, there was a monopoly and a ring, and the difference between the prices I have mentioned was being filched from the pockets of the farmers of Victoria. Members of this Chamber, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> in particular, have been suggesting that we should take off all duties upon agricultural implements : but what would be the result if we did <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The story of the reapers and binders would only be repeated in Victoria. The result would be that the farming community would be at the mercy of these avaricious importers, who could charge them what they pleased. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> also found fault with the Government proposal for the purpose of breaking up these monopolies. The honorable senator and others said a great deal about monopolies in America. I am going to make a quotation on the subject from the <inline font-style="italic">North</inline><inline font-style="italic">American</inline><inline font-style="italic">Review,</inline> Volume 151, for the year 1S90. The article from which I quote is by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Carnegie, and is entitled &#34; Summing up the Tariff Discussion.&#34; It is a summing up of that great controversy - I suppose the greatest -which has ever taken place upon the subject - between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> E. Gladstone and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> G. Blaine. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carnegie</inline> refers particularly to monopolies, and this is what he says - </para>

          <para>My capital is wholly invested in manufacturing, mid if there be any monopoly in the entire domain I should like to discover it. If unusual profits are being made in any branch of manufacturing, why do not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mills</inline> and those who think with him invest and share these grand returns, and by so doing strike down the monopoly V There is no branch of manufacturing into which they cannot put .100 or .100,000 dollars ; the shares of silk, and glass, and wool, and iron, and steel concerns are freely bought and sold in the open market. Those who believe that any industry gives its owners great profits have only to select the industry and invest. Into the woollen industry, for instance, investors to-day can enter for much less than its present owners did. In that of glass splendid opportunities for investment are surely at hand. In the iron and steel branch, with which I am familiar, any citizen of the United States who has 100 dollars can become part owner to-morrow. He can purchase the shares of almost all the steel concerns at much less than the capital actually invested. The shares of the Illinois Steel Company, the Bethlehem Company, Pennsylvania Steel Company, the Cambria Company, and the Troy Company as a rule do not command in the market the actual number of dollars invested. But I must not be understood as advising any one to invest too largely upon the theory that the returns will meet his expectations. The charge that manufactures in America are monopolies is without foundation, although it ma}&#39; still pass current in a rural community when delivered from the stump in Texas. </para>

            <para>- The boom was brought about by monopolists speculating in land, and as manufactures stagnated the State was at its lowest ebb, and a great number of the people being unable to obtain work in Victoria had to seek it elsewhere. Fortunately, about that time, gold was discovered in Western Australia. Honorable senators are well aware that the discovery of gold in any country always leads to an exodus of population to it from other countries. In the circumstances existing at the time it was a good thing for Victoria, and for some of the other States, that gold was discovered in the sister State of Western Australia. The discovery of goldthere was one of the reasons which account for the loss of population which we have not yet entirely regained. </para>

            <para>- I shall come to that, and I shall answer it, I think, satisfactorily. If I do not, it will be the duty of some of these honorable senators to set me right. I do not pretend to know every thing in connexion with this matter, and, if there is any knowledge to be picked up on the way from some of these honorable senators who know better than myself, I am willing to acquire it from them. Another, and, I think, a very fair reason, accounting, to some extent, for the loss of population, is to be found in the fact that Victoria is a very small State, and that almost the whole of the good agricultural land available has been taken up. In New South Wales, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has referred me, there is a very much larger area, and we know that some of the other states of Australia have larger areas even than New South Wales. The fact that there is so very little good land available in Victoria has driven farmers from Victoria to the other States in order to obtain holdings. I do not mean to say that all the land in Victoria is in use. Unfortunately a great deal of it is in the hands of private owners, who do not fully use it ; but when the time comes, as it must come, when the lands of this State, and of the other States, are fully thrown open to settlement, we shall have more population both in Victoria and in the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> would have done better if, in speaking last night about the wages paid in Victoria, he had sought for his information, instead of availing himself of the assistance of the literary helps of the free-trade party. </para>

I am not a rich man. During my whole life, except for the last three or four years, I have been engaged in manual toil, and may have to go back to it before I die. Therefore, 1 am interested in seeing that the conditions of the people are made tolerable, so that they may be able to live in this country, and not be driven out of the State or out of the Commonwealth. The gospel, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing,</inline> is that in Victoria the workmen have not been protected, and have had to invoke the assistance of the strong arm of the law by obtaining minimum rates of wage. </para>

            <para>- The honorable and learned senator is uneasy because I have had to be severe with him ; but this is a time when we must speak our minds, hit hard, and strike home. The information upon which I am speaking was obtained directly from the trades unions of New South Wales. I was for twenty years before entering this Chamber an official of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council, and corresponded weekly, and in some cases daily, with the trades unions of the other States, of Great Britain, and of the Continent. Therefore I know that wages were much lower in New South Wales than in Victoria. For years the workers there have been trying to invoke the strong arm of the law. There is no talk of moral suasion now. Those connected with the industrial life of this and all other countries are seeking to obtain &#34;legislative redress of the wrongs under which they suffer. In New South Wales an Arbitration Act was passed a few months ago, and the Arbitration Court established under its provisions has been rushed by the workers of that State, and, for a time, will be kept fully occupied. </para>

          <para>In view of the considerable number of females employed in Victorian factories (though the proportion of females in the factories of protected Victoria is only a fraction of the proportion of females in free-trade Britain), the free-trade party in New South Wales - the party which preaches free-trade, but is so very reluctant to practise it - has set up a. theory that the employment of females in manufacturing industries is one of the curses of protection. Also, that a tendency of the number of female factory employes to increase is pre-eminently the curse and birth-mark of protection. In view of which it is interesting to find <inline font-style="italic">(Mulhall&#39;s Dictionary of Statistics,</inline> page 422) how free-trade Britain is getting on in this respect.Mulhall here sets forth the number of males and females employed in manufactures and agriculture for 184&#93; - about the end of the protectionist period - to 1881, when Britain had long been en joying the &#34;blessings&#34; of free-trade. Unfortunately he publishes no similar series of statistics about other countries, so that it is impossible to say whether the same alleged evil is growingthereor diminishing. But in view of the constant declaration that the increase in the number of females employed at laborious occupations is a sign of a bad and foolish and utterly corrupt fiscal system, the figures for the United Kingdom are interesting - </para>

          <para>The fact that between 30 and 40 years of freetrade led to an increase of 444,000 females in these ill-paid and laborious occupations, and an increase of only114,000 males,is interesting, in view of the constant assertion that it is protection whichforces women to struggle for a crust inways for which they are constitutionally unfit. But if a comparison is made for the twenty years from 1861 to 1881, when free-trade was really well established in the land, the results for the United Kingdom are still more surprising - </para>

        <para class="block">These are facts which I would commend to my free-trade friends when they assert that protection is responsible for the women in our factories, not that I, or those who are associated with me, advocate the employment of female labour. We regret that women are employed in factories, and if it were possible we would do away with such employment. I have done with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> and the speech he made last evening, and I now come to other questions that arc brought under our notice. This has been a very remarkable debate. I do not think that the time has been wasted in any degree. We have had remarkable speeches ; for instance, we had for nearly two days &#34;from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> a deliverance which ranged over a great deal of ground. Not only did he bring in the birth rate, and of course the unanswered query - &#34;Why do not men marry?&#34; but he also took us to all the countries of &#34;the known world, and wound up with some remarks on what sort of life people led in the tropics. I do . not intend to discuss the general question at very great length, so far as statistics are concerned. I feel that it might be better if we were to curtail our remarks under that head. We all know that because of this discussion, because of the unsettled state of business, it is needful for the Senate to pass the Tariff so that the country may know the exact position in which it is. Tariff discussions always evoke a very great deal of heat. Although we may fight very strongly for our opinions, yet there is no need, I think, to regret any of the utterances that we have made or that we may make. AVe have heard a good deal of free-trade, and I have been asking myself the question, what is free-trade? </para>

Can that be said with regard to the free-traders in the Chamber ?

These honorable senators have changed their name, and they are now revenue-tariffists. Their mission is to strike off all protective duties, and obtain their revenue from all the articles embodied in the Tariff, giving us no free list. We have another section who call themselves moderate free-traders, and moderate protectionists. I do not know how these honorable senators explain themselves. When we speak of moderation, where does it begin and end, so far as the fiscal policy is concerned ? When we speak of an honest man, we do not call him a moderately honest man. When we speak of a good or virtuous woman, we do not call her a moderately good or virtuous woman, but we use exactly the language which conveys our meaning. Again, there are the protectionists. What is protection ? We have been told, not only during this debate, but on other occasions, that a protectionist is a prohibitionist. </para>

            <para>- Logically, I admit he is. I am quite content to bear all the odium, so far as protection is concerned, if I am dubbed a prohibitionist. I suppose by the remark of the honorable senator and by his smile he thinks that I have fallen into a trap. What does protection mean <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It means thoroughness. From my point of view, it means that unless the duty is high enough, to keep out or to prohibit the article sought to be imported, it is a sham and a misnomer. Of course, the honorable senator thought that I was falling into a trap ; but I know exactly where I am and what I am saying. If we accept the definition I am laying down, protection needs to be thorough, and it is clear that the duty must be high enough to prohibit importation. In that limited sense, therefore, I stand here as a prohibitionist. Victoria has been held up as an awful example of protection. I affirm that no nation has ever become prosperous,, free, happy, or truly great, that has not had the shield of legislative enchantment thrown around the growing industries of its people. England, the United States of America, France, and Germany, are striking illustrations of the truth of this statement. But even in Victoria have we not witnessed the stimulating effects produced by  the protective  Tariffs which have operated since I86&#39;5 <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is because we have had experience of a protective policy and know the results of its operation that we are prepared to advocate it. The other day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> in discussing this question, referred to the report of the Victorian Tariff Board, which was presented to the Legislative Assembly of this State in 1895. Broadly speaking, the assertion which he made upon that&#39; occasion was that the people of Victoria had gone hack upon the system of protection. He further declared that the report of the board in question confirmed his statement. In order that honorable senators may see whether his declaration is borne out by the facts of the case, I intend to read some paragraphs from that report. The document in question states - </para>

          <para>Although we have not examined  minutely  into the position of each individual industry, we have had exceptional opportunities for gauging the feeling of the people of Victoria in regard to the general policy of the Tariff. The principle of protection has scarcely been assailed, and we are convinced that the majority of the taxpayers of Victoria are in favour of a continuance of the system. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">If I quoted only this portion of the report, it would suit my purpose admirably, but I intend to give the whole of the quotation, and let it be borne in mind that, the finding of the board was not unanimous, several members objecting to sign it, and afterwards repudiating it upon the floor of the Legislative Assembly. Any sympathy with the latter statement, of course, is entirely contradictory of the former, and the subsequent action of the Victorian Parliament in enacting the Tariff, bore out the declaration that the people of this State were in favour of its settled policy, and rejected the untenable and contradictory statements of the Tariff Board. The report goes on to say - and this is the portion upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> seemed to hang his sweeping statement - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>But, whilst the principles have received support, a very general impression exists that the duties are too high. Throughout the country, and frequently in Melbourne, witnesses advocated a maximum rate of 25 per cent, for protective purposes. The increases made in 1892 were those which were most frequently objected to, and we are strongly of opinion that, but for the alterations then made, the outcry for Tariff reform would not have been general. </para>

The report of the board continues - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It is scarcely necessary to discuss the wisdom of reducing duties to the maximum of 25 per cent, at the present time, inasmuch as such a change is practically impossible. The <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates could, possibly, in some instances, be brought down to that amount, but the immense decrease in the fixed rates would, in some instances, lead to great loss of revenue, and in others at once destroy large industries, throwing numbers of persons out of work, and depreciating property to an enormous extent. The duty of 3d. per lb. upon dried fruits may be quoted as an example of this.

        <para class="block">At that time a little noisy band of freetraders in Victoria, together with those who were in the Legislative Assembly, attempted to give expression to their views. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Murray</inline> Smith, a gentleman for whom I have every respect, a really consistent freetrader, and a man who had been in public life for a number of years, voiced the opinions of the party to which I refer, and, whilst the Tariff was under discussion, tabled an amendment fixing the maximum rate at 25 . per cent. Upon division that amendment was defeated by 70 votes to 13, clearly demonstrating, as far as the representatives of Victoria were concerned, the particular fiscal system which they favoured. The other day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> attempted to reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> who had defined the position of Victoria under that particular Tariff, and who proved conclusively that that State did not go back upon her fiscal policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> said - </para>

          <para> On the same principle, the revision of the Tariff, which I had the honour to undertake in 1895 - I think I was the first in Victoria to reduce the duties - did not indicate for one moment any alteration in the policy of protection, but simply meant a readjustment of the Tariff to the then existing conditions. The Canadian Tariff was revised two or three years ago - after twenty years experience - and, I may add, upon exactly similar lines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> continued - </para>
          <para>Listen to some of the enormous reductions which took place. The duties on eighteen items were reduced to 35 per cent., on seventeen items to 30 per cent. , and on 40 items to 25 per cent. </para>

        <para>These are the advances in a free-trade direction which have afforded such great joy to my honorable friends opposite. </para>
        <para>If we make a comparison - talking, of course, of <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> duties - in Victoria we had one 45 per cent, duty and one 40 per cent, duty ,: in Canada they have neither. In Victoria we had nine 35 per cent, duties ; in Canada they have 53 35 per cent, duties. In Victoria we had thirteen 30 per cent, duties : in Canada they have 75 30 per cent, duties. In Victoria we had 33 25 per cent, duties : iri Canada they have 89 25 per cent, duties ; in Victoria, 21 20 per cent, duties ; in Canada, 32 20 per cent, duties. </para>
        <para class="block">This, I think, supplies the ansswer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> statements to which, by interjection, I strongly objected at the time. If we take Canada as an example - and I suppose that a comparison between that country and the Commonwealth is about the fairest one that can be instituted - we find that the trade of the former is increasing by leaps and bounds. If we are to profit by the example of other countries, we must adopt a protectionist policy. Surely the whole world cannot be wrong, and Great Britain and Turkey right ? If we are to decide this matter as we generally do, by comparison and by the weight of evidence presented to us, I say that the overwhelming testimony of the world is that a policy of protection is the right policy to adopt. </para>

            <para>- I hope that, in answering it, only reliable data will be presented. A moment or two ago an interjection was made having reference to Great Britain. In this connexion I wish to point out that from the 13th century till 1840 Great Britain was  aprotectionist  community. I mention this fact for the benefit of those honorable senators who are always using the old stock cries - &#34; How long are we going to coddle these industries&#39;?&#34; and &#34; Howlong are we to adopt this artificial means to strengthen the position of a protectionist policy?&#34; If England required from 1337 to 1S40 - a period of more than 500 years. - to develop those industries which mads her the greatest and richest country in the world, surely we can allow the Australian Commonwealth a few years, even if we go only to the extent of the life-time of the present members of this Chamber. In presenting the case for protection, I desire to quote a book written by Ernest Williams, who is also the author of that remarkable work, &#34; <inline font-style="italic">Made in Germany.&#34;</inline> Let us now inquire into the old-fashioned drastic methods employed in the thirteenth century, when England started on her protectionist career. In the time of Edward III. certain enactments were made with regard to protection. Chapter I. provided that no merchant or alien or denizen should export wool  from  England after the feast of St. Matthias until otherwise ordained. Then, according to Chapter II., the people were not allowed to wear cloth of foreign make after Michaelmas Feast other than that made in Wales, Ireland, or Scotland, upon pain of forfeiture of the goods and further punishment. No merchant was permitted to import foreign cloth other than from Wales, Ireland, or Scotland. Foreign cloth workers were permitted to reside in the United &#34;Kingdom. This shows the astuteness of the King, who was quite willing that foreign cloth workers should reside within his realms in order to assist English workmen in building up native industries. In the reign of Henry VI. enactments were made aiding the home in  dustries,  including Acts prohibiting the exportation of sheep and wool, and forbidding the exportation of woollen yarns for a period of three j-ears. In 1445 an Act was passed providing that for five years no silk ribbons  or laces should be imported into England on pain of forfeiture of &#163;20. These facts prove the soundness of the policy of protection, and show that our forefathers had more wisdom than have some of our twentieth century politicians. </para>

            <para>- I am not dealing with the labour laws,.of which I know a good deal, but with what the Kings of England did to protect local industries, with the beneficial results that we see to-day. I shall show also that England has declined because she has forsaken a protectionist policy. In the reign of Henry VII., the prohibition against the export of woollen cloths was continued, and the textile industries were aided by extending for twenty years the old prohibition against the importation of ribbons, silks, and laces. In the reign of Henry VIII., the prohibition against the exportation of woollen cloth was continued, and it was enacted that noblemen should wear cloth made within the realm, a fine of &#163;10 being imposed for each offence against these laws. An Act was also passed prohibiting the importation of woollen hats, caps, and bonnets. This was subsequently modified by an enactment which provided that imported caps, hats, and bonnets should be sold at certain prices. All this clearly proves that the monarchs of those days understood that protection was really the best thing for the nation. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-style="italic">No.</inline> If I remember aright, it was because the English industries had made such progress that they allowed foreign goods to be introduced, but stipulated that they should be sold at a certain price in order that they might not compete unfairly with the locally made -articles. I do not intend to refer at any greater length to the condition of England under protection. I might show that from the time I have been speaking of down to 1S40 Acts were passed from time to time for the purpose of  stimulating the  industries of Great Britain, and that these Acts have tended to make her the great and powerful nation she now is. Now, let us look at the position occupied by England today. She has been spoken of as declining, and I think I shall be able to prove that that is the correct view. Let us see the enormous advantages that England has enjoyed. England had three great essentials for a manufacturing community. In the first place she possessed enormous quantities of coal, and also abundant supplies of iron, tin, and copper, and, because of these enormous advantages, her decline has not been so apparent as it otherwise would have been. </para>

            <para>- The latest obtainable. Another circumstance that aided England considerably was the fact that machinery was first developed there. England was the home of mechanical invention, and when steam was applied to her industries she enjoyed such enormous advantages that she became the workshop of the world. Since 1840, however, England has declined, because she has forsaken the protectionist policy. I do not stand alone in taking this view. There are men in England who are proving to the British people day by day the truth of what I have stated. I have quoted from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williams&#39;</inline> book, and I might refer to the writings of a score of others, such as the authors of <inline font-style="italic">Drifting</inline> and of <inline font-style="italic">Protectionand Prosperity.</inline></para>

To-day, for one line of British goods such as I have indicated, 50 lines made in Germany and America can be seen in our shops and warehouses. Again, let us take watches. The English lever under protection was the standard watch of the world. What is the position today <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The watch which is most in use comes from  Amercian  factories. The English lever and the Swiss watch have been superseded by the Waltham and the Elgin. This is another illustration of what has been done under protection in America aided by superiority of mechanical invention, and by the fact that those who were engaged in the industry were prevented by the free-trade policy of England from earning a living there, and had to emigrate to America to earn a livelihood. </para>

            <para>- I cannot answer every interjection that is made. Our fathers left England because there were in Australia newer and better conditions, and because if they had remained in England, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> forcibly put it yesterday, they would have starved or died in the workhouse. In another aspect that was a good thing, because the flower of the English artisans came to Australia, and our fathers in this country have helped to build up improved conditions for us. It is because I realize the value of protection, and the position to which England has been brought by free-trade, that I am so strong in my .protectionist views. </para>

            <para>- Free-trade and landlordism combined. We ought to bear in mind some of the features of the American position in regard to this matter. Freetraders make a great mistake - I say it in all humility - when they make comparisons under this head. In order to make a fair comparison so far as Australia is concerned, we ought to take a new country. The conditions perhaps will not be on all fours with those of the Commonwealth, because we cannot secure such a case; but we should select a country possessing something like the conditions existing here in order to make a fair comparison. I am going to quote a passage from a book from which I quoted a few minutes ago, namely, the <inline font-style="italic">North American Review</inline> vol. 151 for the year 1890. I want to show what some of the great minds of America have said with regard to a protectionist policy. These passages form part of the article by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Carnegie, entitled - &#34;Summing up the Tariff controversy.&#34; He says* - </para>

          <para>That great Scotchman, Alexander  Hamilton  first struck the key-note of the second struggle when, as secretary of the Treasury, 5th  December  1791, he said : &#34; This idea of an extensive domestic market for the surplus produce of the soil is of the first consequence. It is of all things that which most effectually conduces to a flourishing state of agriculture.&#34; &#34; To secure such a market there is no other expedient than to promote manufacturing establishments.&#34; &#34;It is the interest of a community, with a view to eventual and permanent economy, to encourage the growth of manufactures. In a national view, a temporary enhancement of price must always be well compensated by a permanent reduction of it.&#34; American statesmen have followed in similar strains. Thus Washington&#39;s last annual address, 7th December, .1796, says - &#34; Congress have repeatedly, and not without success, directed their attention to the encouragement of manufactures. The object is of too much consequence not to insure a continuance of their efforts in every way which shall appear eligible.&#34;  President  Madison&#39;s special message, 23rd May, 1809, says: - &#34;lt will be worthy, at the same time, of their just and provident care to make such further alterations in the laws as will more especially protect and foster the several branches of manufacture which have been recently instituted or extended by the laudable exertion of our citizens.&#34; Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to Benjamin Austin, Boston, 1816, says: - &#34;Tobe independent for the comforts of life we must fabricate them ourselves. We must now place our manufactures by the side of the agriculturist. . . . Experience has taught me that manufactures are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort.&#34;  President  Monroe&#39;s first inaugural address, 5th March, 1817, says - &#34; Our manufactures will likewise require the systematic and fostering care of the Government. Possessing, as we do, all the raw materials, the fruit of our own soil and industry, we ought not to depend, in the degree we have done, on supplies from other countries. While wc are thus dependent, the sudden event of war, unsought and unexpected, cannot fail to plunge us into the most serious difficulties.&#34;  President  Jackson, 26th August, 1S24 - &#34;Heaven smiled upon and gave us liberty and independence. The same Providence has blessed us with the means of national independence and -national defence. If we omit or refuse to use the gifts which He has extended to us we deserve not the continuance of  His  blessing. He has filled our mountains and our plains with minerals - with lead, iron, and copper - and given us a climate and soil for the growing of hemp and wool. These being the great materials for our national defence, they ought to have extended to them adequate and fair protection that our manufacturers and labourers may be placed in a fair competition with those of Europe, and that we may have within our country a supply of these leading and important articles so essential to war.&#34; </para>
          <para class="block">This is where the point of my quotation conies in - </para>
          <para>Such are the teachings of the fathers. Pages could be filled, proving their passionate anxiety to establish manufactures by legislation, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> thinks partakes of an immoral character. I quote these memorable utterances to illustrate the difference between an old land, which has the best-equipped system of manufacture over known already in operation, and produces more manufactures than it cun consume, and a new land which has no manufactures, but is desirions  of obtaining them. How different the point of view from which the statesmen of the old and the new land must regard the policy of protection ! how different the problem with which they have to deal ! To place the differences in the clearest light, I quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone&#39;s</inline> presentation of free-trade (pages 9 and 10, <inline font-style="italic">North American Revieu),</inline> for January). &#34;International commerce is based, not upon arbitrary or fanciful considerations,- but upon the unequal distribution among men and regions of aptitudes to produce the several commodities which are necessary or useful for the sustenance, comfort, and advantage of human life. If every country produced all commodities with exactly the same degree of facility or cheapness, it would be contrary to common-sense to incur the charge of sending them from one country to another. But the inequalities are so great that, for example, region A can supply region B with many articles of food, and region B can in return supply region A with many articles of clothing, at such rates that, although in each case the charge of transmission has of necessity been added to the first cost, the respective articles can be sold after importation at a lower rate than if they were home grown or home manufactured in the one or the other country respectively. </para>

        <para>But it cannot be expected that individuals should, at their own risk, or, rather, to their certain loss, introduce a new manufacture and bear the burden of carrying it on until the producers have been educated up to the level of those with whom the processes are traditional. A protecting duty, continued for a reasonable time, will sometimes be the least inconvenient mode in which the nation can tax itself for the support of such an experiment. </para>
        <para>There is one more short quotation from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carnegie,</inline> as follows :  - </para>
        <para>Here we have the whole question in a nutshell. I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Bright say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mill,</inline> by this paragraph, had done more harm than all the remainder of his writings would ever do good. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bright</inline> confounded effect with cause. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mill&#39;s</inline> paragraph in itself has done neither harm nor good. It simply records practice to every new country that seeks to develop its latent manufacturing powers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mill&#39;s</inline> words were, no doubt, surprising to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bright</inline> and to Britons generally, perhaps to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> himself. The new doctrine differed from the policy which, being desirable for Britain, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bright</inline> naturally thought of universal application and desirable for all. The statesmen of the United States, however, had discovered, acted upon, and demonstrated by unprecedented success the wisdom of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mill&#39;s</inline> words long before they were written. </para>
        <para>So much, then, for the teachings which freetraders are always willing to accept as gospel, but which are a perfect justification of the policy of protection. It is very singular that we should be told that all the world is wrong except Great Britain and Turkey. I reiterate that if we pay any attention to the teachings of history ; if we are to accept evidence as in the ordinary affairs of life - as in our law courts, where the balance of testimony always decides the issue - we have undoubted proof that the policy of protection is the policy for the Australian Commonwealth. It is with some trepidation that I refer once more to <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall;</inline> and I only do so because of the questions which have been asked by Senators demons and Matheson. <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall</inline> clearly proves that England has been declining since she adopted a free-trade policy by comparison with protectionist countries; and I again quote from that excellent series of articles, <inline font-style="italic">A Policy forthe Commonwealth.</inline> These articles have been published in pamphlet form, and throughout may be found striking examples of the truth of the statement that England has declined, and is declining, under free-trade as compared with protectionist countries. Freetraders are always referring to the wealth of nations, and I commend to them the following quotation from the appendix to the pamphlet I have just mentioned - </para>

            <para>- I am not in the habit of giving half-truths, and have in every case stated the authority from whom I have quoted. I presume that not even the honorable senator would deny the accuracy of the statistics furnished by <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline><inline font-style="italic">.</inline> On Tuesday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> taking <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan&#39;s</inline> statistics, proved in every line of a speech which cannot be answered by honorable senators opposite, that their position is altogether untenable. We have supported our position by figures, showing that the earnings from all sources are greater in protectionist countries than in Great Britain, and that as regards agricultural and manufacturing production, mineral production, trade, internal and external, amount of savings bank deposits, areas under crop, spread of education, and in almost every other respect freetrade England is at a disadvantage when compared with protectionist countries. I have no wish to further continue this discussion, but I commend the study of the figures which I have given, and the authorities I have named, to honorable senators opposite. If they can show that <inline font-style="italic">Mulhall&#39;s</inline> figures are wrong, and disprove the arguments contained in the admirable&#39; series of articles which I have quoted, they may be able to upset my contentions ; but they cannot do so, and the assertion that protection is the right policy for the Australian Commonwealth is one which cannot be satisfactorily contradicted. I did not, when I set out, intend to cover so much ground, but I have dropped a good many points, of which, under other circumstances, I should have taken notice. In conclusion, let me say that I desire to see the Commonwealth advance and make progress. I have studied the effects of the fiscal policies of other countries, and I have seen the beneficial results of protection in the State of Victoria. I believe, therefore, that protection is the right policy, and, as I desire to lay the foundations of Australia&#39;s prosperity both broad and deep, so as to make our national life a success, and the Commonwealth a great power in the world, I intend to follow the noble example of the great men of America - some of the noblest minds that have ever existed - and not only vote for protection, but do what I can to see it adopted as the policy of this great Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- The explanation of the proposals of the Government in regard to the Commonwealth Tariff made at Maitland by the Prime Minister was, I think I may safely say, regarded by the vast majority of the electors of the Commonweal vh as a satisfactory and practical solution of a very difficult question. Throughout my electoral campaign I stated that I accepted it as such. I pointed out that the first and all important thing was to so frame the Tariff that the amount of revenue required - some &#163;8,500,000 - would be absolutely secured, and the financial position of the Commonwealth made certain from the very start. I also pointed out that as there were in existence six varying State Tariffs, five of them being protectionist, to a greater or less degree, and one freetrade, it would be impossible to frame a Commonwealth Tariff which would suit all parties ; but that whatever Tariff was framed .would be more or less of a compromise, would necessarily have to be moderate in respect to its duties, and would contain duties which, looked at from the New South Wales stand-point, would appear to be high ; but, looked at from a protectionist stand-point, would appear to be low. I also stated that where, not merely in Victoria, but also the other States, industries had been established by protection, and had been in existence for a number of years, I, although a free-trader, and opposed to protective duties, would not be a party to suddenly removing or unduly diminishing the pro-&#39;  tection  which they were enjoying. That is the spirit in which I intend to deal with the Tariff) when we come to consider the Bill in committee. The framing of&#39; the Tariff was undoubtedly a very difficult matter. Those who have had to deal with the framing of Tariffs, such as the very complex one which existed in Victoria, know the difficulties of the task. How much more difficult an undertaking had the Ministry to perform in trying to bring the diverging Tariffs of the six States of the Commonwealth into something like uniformity. Such a task would have taxed the utmost powers of commercial men of large experience, and thoroughly acquainted with the intricate operations connected with the importation and manufacture of goods. I thoroughly sympathised with the Ministry in the difficult task which it undertook, a task made the more difficult by the fact that no member of the Cabinet can be said to have had commercial experience. In my opinion, it is to that lack of practical commercial knowledge that the serious miscalculations of the Treasurer as to the anticipated returns of the duties was due. But, making all allowance for the difficulties of the task, I am compelled to say that I was  greviously  disappointed with the Tariff as at first introduced, and the more I considered it the more firmly convinced was I that it did not fairly carry into effect the promises made by the Prime Minister at Maitland. I can account for that fact only upon the supposition that our friends who believe in high duties got the better of the Ministry, and they did it in a most clever way, by the introduction of innocent-looking composite duties. It was not to be expected that those who are unacquainted with commercial matters could estimate the effect of these composite duties, but so startling did they appear to me that I felt warranted in having calculations made as to their equivalent when worked out at percentage <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> rates. I thought it my duty to the public and to the members of this Parliament to publish the results thus obtained, and I think that I am justified in saying that those results opened the eyes of the people and of members of both Houses to a very considerable extent. At any rate, duties, which ran up to 160 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem have</inline> now been reduced to 30 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem.</inline> In this discussion I wish to drop the question of free- trade and protection altogether. It is not a novel question for me to discuss, because, when protection was first sought to be introduced in 1864 under the term &#34; Incidental Protection,&#34; I was in the thick of the fight, and I have almost enjoyed hearing, during the last few days, arguments which reminded me of the struggle which took place in this State nearly forty years ago, when the battle was a very fierce one, and the protectionists won all along the line. There is, however, one point in connexion with high duties which has not been touched upon, and which I should like to mention, and that is their effect upon our natural productions, such as wool, wheat, butter, cheese, and many others, which exceed our local requirements, and which we therefore have to export. It is of importance that we should relieve from unnecessary taxation those engaged in what may be termed natural industries, and make free their tools of trade, such as agricultural implements. In passing, let me say that in New Zealand agricultural implements of all kinds have always been free of duty. Despite that fact - and I am speaking with an intimate knowledge of New Zealand, which extends over nearly 40 years - the importation of agricultural machinery has been comparatively small, and the local manufacturers have been able from the first to supply machines which the agriculturists there prefer to imported machines. To-day there are in New Zealand agricultural implement factories equal in size to any we have in Victoria, and turning out equally good work. I visited some of them only the other day, when I was in New Zealand. Although the industry is not protected by duties, the wages paid in it are at least equal to those paid in Victoria. The object and natural result of high duties is to reduce the importation of the articles upon which they are imposed. If they did not have that effect, there would be no reason for imposing them. But if we considerably reduce importation, we reduce the volume of our shipping. If we impose high duties, ships will in many cases come here with only part cargoes. I am speaking of what has happened occasionally. With part cargoes an increased freight will have to be paid on imports, while the charges on the outgoing freights, which will consist of our wheat, wool, and other natural products, will also be increased. In this way those who produce our natural products will be hit on both sides. Owing to the high duties, they will be hit first of all by the increased cost of the machinery which they use as well as of their food and clothing, and they will be hit a second time by the increased freights on the  products  which they have to export to compete in the markets of the world. That is a point which has not hitherto been touched upon, and, as it is a very important one, I have ventured to call the attention of the Senate to it. These increased freights will run into very large figures, and, speaking as a commercial man, with some little knowledge of these matters, I say unhesitatingly that they must ultimately be the result of the Tariff as it stands. I should like to say a word or two in reference to the details of the Tariff, and to examine some of the items, because even the &#34;Vice-President of the Executive Council must acknowledge that we shall have to make some alterations in it. We must admit that there are anomalies in it. When we remember that it was before another place for something like seven months : that during that time constant fighting took place ; that first one decision was arrived at, and then another, and that in some cases items were brought up for consideration a third time ; it is not a matter for surprise that, with thousands of items in the Tariff, anomalies should have occurred which we shall have to set right. Let me point out some of them. On piece- woollens there is a duty of 15 per cent., while woollen apparel - manufactured woollens - have to pay a duty of 25 per cent. That gives a protection of 10 per cent. On the other hand, cotton in the piece is liable only to a duty of 5 per cent., but cotton apparel pays a duty of 25 per cent. That gives a margin of 20 per cent, protection. The &#39; result of these duties is that while the protection on goods made of cotton, which we do not grow, is 20 per cent., the protection on woollen goods is only 10 per cent., although we grow the wool ourselves. But there is a still further anomaly, for while we give apparently a protection of 10 per cent, on woollen apparel, as a matter of fact, the yarns from which woollens &#34;are made pay a duty of 10 per cent., so that the protection is practically extinguished. I would call the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> to these matters. . I know that he is just as honest a protectionist as I am a free-trader, and I feel satisfied that I am only doing right in bringing these matters under the notice of the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I am very glad to hear that. Yarns may be made from local wool, and therefore there is a large natural protection, apart from anything else. While woollen yarns are subject to a duty of 10 per cent., cotton yarns are free. Then again, coir yarns, which are used in the manufacture of cocoanut matting, and are made by black labour, are also free. Honorable senators, who like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> do not believe in unduly playing into the hands of coloured labour, will perhaps take some action in this matter. There are other anomalies. Sporting cartridges, forexample, are allowed to come  in free under this Tariff. The consequence is that the shot contained in them is free of duty ; but shot in bulk, which must be used in the manufacture of Cartridges, locally, is subject to a duty of 5s. per cwt. The absurdity of the position is that the finished article is allowed to come in free, while one of the main items used in the manufacture of cartridges locally is dutiable. I may say, further, that the manufacture of shot is not a large local industry, for I am informed that there are only about fifteen men employed in that way. On the other hand, I have it on reliable authority that there are hundreds employed all over the Commonwealth in making up cartridges. That anomaly will have to be rectified in some way. Another matter to which I desire to refer is the position in regard to tea in packages. As honorable senators know, tea has been declared to be free. I am sorry that that decision has been arrived at, for I think it is a mistake in the fullest sense of the word. Not only has tea been placed on the free list, but tea in packages is also free. &#34;Under the former State Tariff, which imposed a duty both on tea and tea in packages, a large industry has been established in putting up teas. But the effect of making package tea free must be necessarily to drive the industry away to Ceylon and India, because apart altogether fr,om the fact that not the slightest protection is afforded it, everything used in putting up tea - the paper, labels, lead, and so on - is dutiable. It is therefore a hopeless case. I have looked into this matter carefully, although it is hardly necessary for me to say that it is not one in which I am interested, and I am credibly informed that the result of making package tea free must be a loss amounting to about &#163;50,000 per annum in the wages of those directly and indirectly connected with packing. </para>

            <para>- As I have said already, I was staggered with the figures when they were first presented to me, but after going into the details, I did not think that they were excessive. I shall now draw the attention of the Senate to an anomaly in regard to candles, on which there is a duty of1d. per lb. In order to manufacture good candles, both stearine and wax are required. Stearine is made locally, and there is a duty of1d. per lb. upon it. Wax, however, is not made locally ; it is manufactured from the residuum of kerosene, and has to be imported. It costs about1d. per lb., and there is a duty of1d. per lb. upon it. I have been informed to-day that the effect of the duty on wax, which is really one of the raw materials used in the manufacture of candles, will be either one of two things. If it is allowed to remain it will lead to the manufacture of inferior candles. I have been informed only this morning, and I have proved it to be correct, that candles made from stearine and wax have been and are still being made in Sydney under freetrade, and that they are very much superior to those made in Victoria under protection. I can vouch for the accuracy of the statements that thousands of boxes of these candles have come here from Sydney since the Tariff has been in operation, that they are selling at lower prices than those of Victorian manufacture, and that, although they are of lighter weight than the Victorian candles, they are guaranteed to burn an hour longer. </para>

            <para>- I will place the honorable senator in a position to obtain the same information as that which I have secured. The duty on strawboards is another matter which the Senate must consider. Originally the duty was 4s. per cwt., and was equal, as nearly as possible, to 100 per cent.; but it has been reduced to1s. per cwt., which is equal to 25 per cent. The selling price of the locally manufactured strawboard ranges from &#163;10 to &#163;10 5s. per ton, while equally good strawboard could be imported at prices ranging from &#163;6 to &#163;6 10s. per ton. Owing to this duty, the public have to pay the difference between the two quotations. Let me turn now to patent belting, which is required for driving engines, and is not, and cannot, be made here. Its use is absolutely necessary in all wet mines, or in mines in which there are any chemicals. The duty on it is 20 per cent. But there is another kind of belting which is made here. It is known as cotton belting. And what do honorable senators think is the position under the Tariff as it stands ? By a decision of the Customs authorities within the last few days cotton belting has been declared to be liable to a duty of 5 per cent. as cotton piece-goods. Thus, patent belting, which cannot be manufactured here, pays a duty of 20 per cent., while cotton belting, which can be made here, is liable only to a duty of 5 per cent. These are some of the anomalies of the Tariff, and, free-trader as I am, I feel that I am bound to call attention to them. I might greatly increase the list, but I do not think it necessary to weary the Senate with more of these figures. I should like to bring under the notice of honorable senators the fact that the percentages of duties shown in the schedule do not by any means indicate the amount of protection given in respect of any class of goods. There is in addition to be added what may called the natural protection, or in other words the cost of importation. Honorable senators will clearly understand that the highpriced goods are imported at a very much lower cost than the commoner goods used by the ordinary consumer. I mention a few instances in connexion with my own trade. I could obtain similar examples in connexion with other trades, but I thought it better to deal with matters to which I can personally certify. Take woollens first : High-priced, woollens cost 8 per cent. to import. The duty over all woollens is 1.5 per cent. The protection therefore upon highpriced woollens is 23 per cent. But lowpriced woollens cost 21 per cent. to import, and that, added to the 15 per cent. duty, means that there is a 36 per cent. protection on low-class woollens. There is an anomaly here also which I incidentally referred to just now. The duty on woollen yarns is 10 per cent., but as the cost of importation is 14 per cent., there is a protection of 24 per cent. on woollen yarns, while upon high-priced woollens the protection is23 per cent., and upon low-priced woollens 36 per cent. Taking felt hats, the cost of importing the higher-priced article is 13 per cent., and the duty is 30 per cent. </para>

If the honorable senator asks me what it may lead up to, I can only say that he will have as much to point out in that matter as I shall have. As I have said, the duty upon felt hats is 30 per cent.; the highpriced goods cost 1 3 per cent to import, and that is a protection of 43 per cent. But the low-priced goods cost 61 per cent. to import, and that added to the duty of 30 per cent., gives a protection of 91 per cent. on the low-priced goods. </para>

            <para>- No. The honorable senator will understand that a case of a certain size, for instance, 3ft. 6in. square, will naturally hold a larger value of high-priced goods than of low-class goods. On cotton hosiery, the import cost on the high-priced goods is 8 per cent., that, added to the duty of 10 per cent., gives a protection of 18 per cent. The import cost of the low-priced goods is 1 7 per cent., which, added to the duty, gives a protection of 27 per cent. The import cost in the case of woollen hosiery, shirts, and pants, high-priced goods, amounts to 7 per cent., which, added to the duty of 25 per cent., gives a protection of 32 per cent., while the low-priced goods cost 17 per cent. to import, giving a protection of 42 per cent. On cotton pants and shirts the import cost of the higher-priced goods is 14 per cent., which added to the duty of 25 per cent. gives a protection of 39 per cent. In the case of the low-priced goods the import cost is 29 per cent., which gives a protection of 54 per cent. </para>

            <para>- That is so, but I have not gone into that, as I did not wish to unnecessarily complicate the question. On coir netting and matting, with a duty of 15 per cent. and import charges of 40 per cent., the protection is 55 per cent. Take again the case of the Abbott buggy, the duty is 25 per cent. and the cost of importation is 70 per cent., so that the protection is 95 per cent. A low-class Abbott buggy costs &#163;10 or &#163;11, and they are largely used by agriculturists. </para>

            <para>- I have the detailed figures, but I do not desire to trouble the Senate with them. I should like tosay, with regard to the schedule, that I have had a number of instances submitted to me in which goods are made dutiable in one part of the Tariff and are free in another ; but perhaps that has been unavoidable on account of the long discussions which have taken place on the Tariff. While on this question, I should like to deal with the administration of the Tariff. We know that a Tariff containing such an immense number of items must necessarily be difficult to administer. We know also that this is a new Tariff, and though the Custom-house officials of Victoria are not new to this sort of work, the Customhouse officials of New South Wales are new to it, and there have been many differences of opinion as to the interpretation of the Tariff to begin with. I wish more particularly to refer to the effect of the financial provisions of the Constitution, which require entries to be made where goods are shipped ; for instance, from Melbourne to Tasmania. In such a case this is what has to be done : The merchant is required to give the following information : -The original docket number, when the material was imported, the number of yards used, the description of the material, the original invoice price, the amount of duty paid, the ship by which the goods arrived, the date and number, of the entry, the number of the case, the rate of duty charged, whether free or dutiable, whether State or Commonwealth duty was paid, and what the material is used for. </para>

            <para>- Is it, indeed? I shall show the honorable senator how difficult it is to secure this information. I purposely take a very common article, calico. Shipment after shipment of identically the same calico arrive. The goods are never marked in order to show what ship they came out by, but they are put into the open stock with stock already there, and no one can tell where a particular piece of calico came from. That difficulty will apply to a very large proportion of goods. </para>

            <para>- I desire to show the enormous amount of labour which this entails, not only upon merchants, but on the Customs-house officials, and all this costs money. I have in my hands a small entry in connexion with articles to the value of only some &#163;4 or &#163;5. The document contains 229 figures and 120 words, and it took five hours to obtain the information given so far as it could be got. It deals with a matter of apparel, and we are required to give the quantity of every item contained in that apparel. For instance, there is &#163; yard of tweed,2&#189; yards, 7&#189; yards, 2&#189; yards, 10&#189; yards, and 1-32 yard of other materials. Bear in mind that this does not affect the merchant one iota. He neither gains nor loses by the declaration which is required by the Customs officials. </para>

I have another case in which the amount concerned is about &#163;20, and in connexion with that men were employed for two days finding out from the factories the various quantities and values of the materials used. As different materials are in many instances purchased by the factories themselves from different importers, and no separate record is kept, it is quite impossible for this information to be given accurately. If honorable senators think that information can be obtained, I can assure them that it cannot, and if the Customs authorities continue to demand it we must give up the trade. </para>

            <para>- What is to be done in the meantime?

I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> that this is becoming a perfect bugbear. The time occupied in connexion with it is considerable, and it affects both merchants and Custom-house officers. If the honorable and learned senator will inquire, he will find that the Customs officers are as keen upon this matter as the merchants. It entails an immense amount of trouble for no practical benefit. I freely acknowledge that the same difficulty does not arise in all trades. It does not arise, for instance, in a certain number of trades which deal only in bulk, but in all open trades dealing with broken bulk the difficulty occurs. I have been interviewedby the representatives of numbers of trades, who are looking for some improvement in this matter. </para>

            <para>- We know perfectly well that the statement has been made that if certain lines in the Tariff pass as at present proposed, they may cause the closing of factories. But we in Victoria recollect perfectly well that exactly the same thing has been said whenever, from time to time,changeshave been proposed in previously existing Tariffs. In all those cases the representatives of various factories proved to their own satisfaction, if not to the satisfaction of others, that if certain reductions were made the factories must close. That was said to be particularly the case with respect to woollen factories ; but what has happened? The duty at present is 15 per cent., while the duty on yarns is 10 per cent., and yet the woollen factories are in full swing ; they are more full of orders than they have ever been before ; some of them are working day and night, and I know that they are satisfied. Again, in the case of felt hats, the duty was at one time up to 160 per cent.; it is now 30 per cent. Dire results were predicted, and it was said that the factories would have to throw hundreds of hands out of employment. Here, again, I find that these factories are in full swing and are paying well. In passing, I may say that while the duty in Victoria has been up to 160 per cent., the duty in New Zealand has never been more than 22&#189; per cent., and yet the factories there are doing well. I may add that my firm has just established a very large felt hat factory in New Zealand under this22&#189; per cent. duty. With regard to hoots, the duty used to be from 25 up to 160 per cent. In New Zealand there has never been a duty of more than 22&#189; per cent., and for a large number of years there has been no duty whatever upon boots in that State. We established our factories when there was not a particle of duty. It is only within the last few years, comparatively speaking, that there has been any duty on boots, and yet not only is the factory prospering, but we are able to pay as good, if not better, wages than are paid in Victoria. In New South Wales boots have been duty free practically all along, and yet an immense number of boots are turned out to my knowledge, and good boots, too. </para>

            <para>- I am not going to express an opinion on that point. I merely wish to give the facts, and to leave honorable senators to draw their own conclusions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> also stated that moderate protection does not raise prices. The term moderate is open to a very wide interpretation. I suppose, judging from the past, that some of our friends in Victoria would think 150 per cent. moderate. It is not safe for us to trust our protectionist friends to interpret the word ; for I recollect well that when protection was first agitated for in Victoria in the early sixties, its chief apostles, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> G. Francis and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. (now Sir Graham)</inline> Berry over and over again stated that the maximum duty would never exceed12&#189; per cent., and would be imposed for only a few years until the industry was established. That is the experience of Victoria. I have been an importer for 50 years, and a manufacturer for 40 years, and therefore I know absolutely the cost of importing goods, not only into Victoria, but also into New South Wales, Western Australia, and New Zealand. I also know all the details in connexion with the manufacture of our particular goods, and the prices paid by the public in each State. That leads up to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> that protection - I would rather use the expression &#34;high duties &#34; - does not raise the cost of commodities.We must bear in mind that the avowed object of these high duties is undoubtedly to raise wages. If you raise wages you must raise the cost of&#34; what is produced by those wages, and I state unhesitatingly, from personal knowledge tested over and over again in the various States where I have houses, that if you will take similar dates - because goods fluctuate in prices - you will almost invariably find that the prices have been higher in Victoria than in any of the other States. </para>

Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> stated that the foreign manufacturer pays the duty. I listened to the honorable and learned senator with amazement, and wondered how on earth such a statement could be made. It is absolutely incorrect. I, know the prices charged by the manufacturers to my firms in Victoria, New South. Wales, New Zealand, and Western Australia. Absolutely the same prices are charged for the same goods, and the manufacturers do not pay one cent of the duty. To suppose that manufacturers&#39; profits in the old country, America, or the Continent are such as to enable them to pay duties of from 5 to 150 per cent. appears to me to be perfectly absurd. </para>

We can buy American goods more cheaply in London than in New York, because, having got their whole local market to themselves, they charge the local consumer almost anything they like, and can afford to sell the surplus at any price outside the country. </para>

            <para>- As a proof that the duty is not paid in that way, I would point to what happens when there is a change&#34; of Tariff. Directly a duty is taken off, as&#39; occurred recently, down goes the price, and as soon as a duty is imposed, up goes the price. The merchant has to pay the duty, and he varies his price accordingly. If honorable senators are under the impression that themanufacturers in the old country, America, or the Continent pay the duties, all. I can say is that they would believe anything. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> laid considerable stress on the point that the abolition of the sugar duties had destroyed the refinery trade in the West Indies. I wondered whether he had read the report of the Royal commission which went out to inquire into the cause of the failure of sugargrowing in the West Indies. If he had read the report he would have known that it was very conclusive ; and, although to a certain extent the growers had suffered, they had suffered far more from the fact of their obsolete mode of growing and manufacturing, and their retention of obsolete machinery. The Royal commission pointed out that, if they would only adopt the modern scientific mode of growing and producing, and use the most modern machinery, they need fear very little. </para>

            <para>- I grant that it has had a very serious effect on the refiners, but has there been nothing to put against that ? What about the enormous trade in the manufacture of confectionery that has sprung up, employing far and away more hands and capital than did the refineries? Formerly, almost the whole of the confectionery trade, and all appertaining to it - an enormous trade it is, extending all over the world - was centred in France. The effect of the bounty on sugar in France, Germany, and Austria has been that the consumer in Great Britain gets his sugar at about half the price that the consumer in the producing countries pays. </para>

            <para>- I am purposely erring on the safe side. The very fact of the English being able to obtain that sugar at such a low price has enabled them to start these huge confectionery manufactories, practically using the French sugar, and sending it back to France in the manufactured state, and: making a good thing out of it. So that the labour and. the capital employed in this industry far and away exceed the labour andcapital displaced in connexion with the refineries. Another statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> was with respect to the import of foreign goods into these States. </para>

            <para>- I cannot give the date, but I shall give a reference that will lead up to it. The honorable senator will recollect that the Imperial Parliament passed an Act called the Trade Marks Act, which requires that all goods of foreign manufacture shall be branded with the name of the place of manufacture. The buyers from the various States thus very soon learned where the Continental goods came from, and the result was that the orders went direct to Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and France. But that would not have done it had not the German and French boats been started. Continental goods that used to go through London nowcome direct from various foreign ports in foreign bottoms. That is the reason why there has been apparently a very large increase in the imports of foreign goods. As regards the exports, practically the same thing wouldhappen. The. wool that was shipped for Germany, France, or Austria used to go to London, where it was transhipped to foreign ports ; but now the French and German liners, which come direct with cargoes, take away our wool. </para>

            <para>- If the honorable and learned senator knew as much about business as I do, he would understand that this information does not become known to everybody at once. But, as the knowledge gradually spreads, others adopt the same plan, and thus the direct importations increase. Of course, 1 do not say that there has not been a development of trade with the foreigner. Another matter which seemed to shock . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> was the fact of the merchant reducing the quality of goods in consequence of the imposition of high duties. But after all the whole question resolves itself into one of the ability, or inability, of the local buyer to pay the increased price. The workman naturally says that the imposition of duties does not increase his wages one iota, and that because a high duty is levied upon a suit of clothes he cannot afford to pay more for it than if no duty were operative. As he cannot pay an increase of 25 per cent. upon a suit of clothes, he practically compels the merchant to import an inferior class of goods, in order to suit his pocket. </para>

            <para>- It does not matter what the duty is. &#34; Of course, the higher it is the greater must be the reduction in the quality of the&#39; goods. Therefore, I commend to the honorable senator the advisability of joining the freetrade party, and endeavouring to reduce these high duties, thereby enabling the wages of the labouring men to go further. Another point in the honorable senator&#39;s speech amused me immensely - in fact, I could not refrain from laughing, though I hope that he will not regard my action as offensive. When he spoke about the profits upon imported goods I could not avoid smiling. He read with considerable gusto an extract, stating that the profits &#39; of the importer were 20 per cent., and that those of the retailer were 33 J- per cent., upon that. </para>

            <para>- Those profits are &#34;gross&#34; profits, and have to be reduced by the cost involved in carrying on the business - both wholesale and retail - by rents, salaries, and a thousand other things, not forgetting, the  important matter of bad debts. I may says moreover, that the statement that the profit in the soft goods trade is 20 per cent, is inaccurate. As a matter of fact, the profit upon each individual transaction is very small.&#39; Competition renders it so ; but where the merchant makes his profit and his interest upon capital is by getting through two or three transactions of that nature in the year. That is where the large firms have a distinct advantage over the small ones. The small firms do not make a sufficient return to live by it. In addition to that, high duties play into the hands of the large firms. Cash is required to pay these duties, and only wealthy firms can provide that cash. Hence the small establishments .are squeezed out of existence. If I advocated what suits my own pocket, I should say, &#34;Clap on as heavy duties as possible - the higher the duties the richer I shall become.&#34; </para>

The idea underlying his statement in this connexion is a most admirable one, and one to which we ca&#39;n all heartily say, &#34; Yea.&#34; Accordingly I followed him very closely, but I am bound to say that I fail to understand what he proposes. I cannot conceive how, by levying a 10 per cent, duty upon certain goods, we should throw the trade in those goods into Germany, whilst by levying a 25 per cent, rate upon them we should throw that trade into England. I shall, however, be very happy to sit at the feet of Gamaliel and learn wisdom., </para>

            <para>- I wish now to say a word or two in reference to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> who stated that the shipping trade of Great Britain has declined. In this connexion I desire to quote &#163;rom <inline font-style="italic">Whittaker,</inline> of 1902, which covers the period ended 31st December, 1901. According to that authority the ton.nage of the world in that year was 30,600,000, of which amount that of British ships represented 14,700,000, or as near as possible, one-half, while the tonnage of American shipping was only 3,077,000 tons. Then again, the ships built by Great Britain in 1901 represented in the aggregate 1,417.000 tons, of which they sold to foreign nations vessels representing 347,000 tons, leaving a net increase to Britain for that year alone of 1,070,000 tons. From these figures it does not appear that English shipping is going back. If we calculate the value of the ships sold to foreign countries at the low price of &#163;6 per ton - and I am. informed by an expert that I should not be far wrong if I allowed &#163;10 per ton for them - that is equivalent to no less a sum than &#163;2,000,000. Surely that is not a bad return to the old country for one year alone. From 1895 to 1901 ships aggregating 3,228,000 tons have been sold to other nations. Upon the same basis of calculation those ships would represent a return to Great Britain of &#163;19,363,000. It will be seen, therefore, that the shipping industry is not a small one, and is not flagging. Reference has been made to the rapid expansion of German shipping. But, in regard to this matter, I find that in 1895 Great Britain had 5,574 steamers alone, representing 7,775,000 tons, whilst Germany owned only 741 steamers, aggregating 929,000 tons ; so that a very wide margin existed between the two countries. </para>

        <para class="block">I suppose that the best test of the progress of a nation is to be found in the increase of her wealth, and I know of no better test that can be applied to the increase of Britain&#39;s wealth than is supplied by &#39;the operation of the income tax. In 1869 when the income tax was 6d. in the &#163;, it yielded &#163;8,600,000, or as near as possible &#163;1 , 400,000 per penny. In 1901, how.ever, a similar tax returned &#163;13,750,000, the penny producing &#163;2,600,000 or &#163;1,200,000 more that it did in 1869, or nearly twice as much. That does not look as if England is going to the dogs, or living upon capital. As a &#39;matter of fact reliable estimates show that she is saving from &#163;120,000,000 to &#163;140,000,000 per year of net income over expenditure, and the operation of the income tax clearly proves that that is so. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> said that Great Britain was living on her capital, and I have been endeavouring to show that that statement was not correct. In dealing with the trade of Great Britain - that is to say, the imports and exports - we must not forget the effect of the establishment of foreign lines of shipping. I have already referred to some of these, and I should like to mention another in connexion with the raw silk trade of the East. Formerly that was all carried in British ships to London, which was the central market for the raw silk -trade, representing a value of about &#163;8,000,000 per annum. Upon the establishment of the Messageries Maritimes line that trade was not simply divided between the British and French ships, but was all taken to Marseilles, which is now the silk market of the world. Therefore, that &#163;8,000,000 worth of trade ceases to appear in the import and export returns of Great Britain, and it is well to remember this when we are dealing with the figures. Then, again, the wool that was formerly sent through London to the Continent now goes, very largely, if not entirely, direct to the Continent. Yet, is it true, as stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey, Senator Best,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> that Great Britain is not holding her own ? Let me direct the attention of honorable senators to a few figures, taken from the Board of Trade statistics. These were published in <inline font-style="italic">Commerce,</inline> the official journal of thf united chambers of commerce in Great Britain. The table gives the value of imports into the United Kingdom from.lS91 to 1901. In 1891, the value of the imports was &#163;435,000,000, and the average for the five years from 1891 to 1895 was &#163;417,000,000. The next five-yearly period started in 1896 with &#163;441,000,000, and ran. up to &#163;523,000,000 in 1900. This was the highest point reached. The average for this period was &#163;474,000,000. Now, let us deal with the year ended 31st Decern- . ber, 1901, bearing in mind that the highest point was reached in 1900. The total for 1901 was &#163;522,000,000, only &#163;1,000,000 less than the highest point that Great Britain had ever reached.. Now I will turn to the domestic exports, exclusive of ships. I purposely referred to the ships sold to foreign nations in order that honorable senators might see that their value, which was not inconsiderable, should, in fairness, be added to these figures, because ships are just as much domestic exports as are any other manufactured goods. The exports for the five years from1891 to 1895 averaged &#163;226,000,000 per annum. The average for the next five years was &#163;249,000,000 per annum. The highest point touched was in 1900, when the exports were valued at &#163;282,000,000; and in 1901, that is last year, the exports reached the value of &#163;271,000,000. This lastmentioned amount was considerably above the average for the previous five years, and very much above that for the five years from 1891 to 1895, while it was &#163;11,000,000 lower than the return for 1900, when the highest point of export was reached. That would seem to indicate that there had been a serious falling-off, but the values of goods have to be taken into account. Unfortunately we know that there has been a very serious falling-off in the values of commodities. </para>

          <para>It will be seen from the above tables that the total value of the imports retained for home consumption in 1900 was &#163;460,534,000, and that if we had paid for our net imports of last year the same average prices as in . 1900, they would have cost us &#163;471,803,000. It follows, therefore, that there was last year an increase in the quantity of our net imports equal to the difference between &#163;471,803,000 and &#163;460,534,000, which is &#163;11,269,000, equal to 2-45 per cent. Similarly with the exports . </para>
          <para>In 1900 we exported British products to the value of &#163;291,451,000, while our exports in 1901, if we had received for them the same prices as in 1900, would have realized &#163;295,703,000. </para>
          <para class="block">There was thus last year, as compared with 1900, an increase in the quantity of our exports, which is measured by the difference between &#163;295,703,000 and &#163;291,451,000, and amounts to &#163;4,252,000, or . 1 -46 per cent.And taking imports and exports together, thevolume of our foreign trade last year (exclusive of re-exports) shows, as compared with 1900, an increase of 2-06 per cent., the computation being :  - </para>

            <para>- That is not the point at all. I think I am justified in saying that the old country is not going back. She is still to the fore, and if the information I obtained when I was at home a few years ago - which information has been thoroughly supported byrecentadvices - was correct, old England is on the eve of a very important revival. There is no doubt that her people have been too conservative.  Her  manufacturers have been too well content to jog along on the old lines. I have frequently found fault with them on that account. They have been in the habit of making a certain class of goods which buyers might take or leave as they liked, but they are now waking up to a proper realization of the necessities of the case. The fathers are dying off, and the sons are coming to the front, and I am glad to say that they are following the wise course of sending experts to Germany and America, in order to ascertain in what respect Great Britain is lagging behind. I know that in some of the trades besides myown there have been marvellous changes for the better, and that English manufacturers, sofar from being afraid of the competition of foreign countries, are courting it. I believe, moreover, that, notwithstanding the fact that an increasing portion of our trade has naturally gone to Germany or to France, because we have been sending wool to those countries, which must be paid for in cash or goods, our imports from the old country will soon be, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> and others desire, largely increased. </para>

          <para>- I think I have listened to every honorable senator who has spoken during the present debate, and if there is one thing I am heartily sick of it is the constant quotation of figures, and the constant attempts on the part of one side to show that poor old England is going to the dogs, that she is effete, that  she has arrived at a state of nonage, and will sooner or later be wiped out ; and on the part of the other side to show that she is prospering. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> has expressed a strong belief that with certain changes in her manufacturing methods, Great Britain will be able to hold her own against the world, and I trust that his prediction will be borne out. From the love I have for the old country where I was born, I do not want to see her go down. Then we have heard a great deal from the free-trade point of view to explain what has caused the prosperity of the United States. We have been told that it grew up, not because of protection, but in spite of it. Figures have been given to prove that contention. We have had the most elaborate statistics quoted by others to prove that the prosperity of America is absolutely due to protection. We have been loaded up with a mass of figures from one side and the other, till my poor brain is in a state of utter confusion as to which set of statistics is right; and I am quite sure that the people in. the galleries who have listened to the various speeches have gone away not knowing what to  believe.  One statement  made by the honorable senator who last spoke was rather astonishing to me. It was that, as far as he is concerned, it would be better, and he would be in pocket, if high duties were the rule. Is it not a singular fact that every one of the big importers throughout the States is a free-trader ? The importers do not believe in any duties. Do honorable senators believe that these gentlemen ave likely to depart from the usual custom of men throughout the world of looking after their own interests ? I am inclined to doubt it. Although I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> made his- statement in all sincerity, I very much doubt whether his compeers in the same line of business look at the matter in the <inline font-style="italic">same</inline> light as he does. I am quite sure that they do not, or they would be protectionists instead of free-traders. But they see plainly enough, and it stands to common sense, that if a protective duty is put upon an article which is being imported into a country, and by that means the importation of the article is to some extent stopped in consequence of the country manufacturing it for itself, the importer&#39;s business goes down. Then what becomes of his profit? There will be none whatever for him to make ! There is another point about which I wish to say a word. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> has spoken of anomalies in the Tariff. I will say this without much fear of contradiction from any one who has studied Tariffs : that there is scarcely a Tariff in the world in which you cannot find anomalies. I had the honour in 1887 of framing a complete Tariff for South Australia. After it was passed through Parliament, and we commenced working under it, I soon discovered anomalies in it. There are anomalies in all Tariffs, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> has pointed out some in this. It will be our duty as senators to listen to all that can be said, and, where anomalies can be pointed out, I trust we shall be able to cure them. It will be our duty undoubtedly to respectfully ask the other House to agree to any suggestions or amendments we may make in that respect. My own opinion is that the Government made a mistake in introducing the Tariff this session at all. It would have been a great deal better if the first session of the &#39;Federal Parliament had been devoted to the consideration of certain necessary machinery </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Bills. We might then have had a recess over Christmas, lasting till the hot weather had gone, when we could have had a special session to deal with the .Tariff. If that plan had been followed it would have given to the Ministers who had the duty of preparing the Tariff proper time in which to master the details. When I had the preparation of the South Australian Tariff, I had, of course, the advantage of the old Tariff to build upon, and had not to take into consideration the Tariffs of other States. Yet I remember that mine was a great job. It was an immense work to undertake in addition to discharging the ordinary duties of my office. I also know that the difficulty of preparing this Tariff must have been six times intensified in consequence of the fact that the Government had to amalgamate six Tariffs, and to study the different positions of the various States. They had to consider that a duty upon any particular article would bring in a certain amount of revenue in one State, whilst the same duty would bring in perhaps double or treble the amount in another State. The most marvellous figures came out in the statistics brought before the House of Representatives in connexion with the production of revenue from certain duties. A duty that would be sufficient to enable Victoria to keep up her revenue from a certain article would produce in the State of Western Australia an immensely increased revenue on precisely the same article. That was due to the number of males in the latter State, the number of people working in the mines, the high wages they receive, and the fact that Western Australia had to import almost everything her people ate, drank, or consumed in any way. -Of course, in the face of those facts, any Tariff that would produce a small sum in Victoria would naturally produce a large one in Western Australia. I think that this Tariff, after all the knocking about which it has received in the other House, has not emerged from the process in so good a form as when it was originally introduced. I believe that a great many of  the alterations  that have been made in the other Chamber have created anomalies rather than cured them. I make this statement after having very carefully watched the progress of the Tariff through the House of Representatives. A number of men sat down to lick the Tariff into shape. Some of them were free-traders, some of them revenue  tariffists,  some of them protectionists, some of them moderate protectionists, and some of them immoderate protectionists. Amendments were made just according as chance divisions were taken, and alterations necessarily followed which, in many instances, have created anomalies rather than cured them. But, nevertheless, the Tariff is a fair compromise, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> said when he introduced it. I say so because, on the one hand, I find the free-traders objecting to it as being too high ; and, on the other hand, I find the high protectionists objecting to it as being too .low. Therefore, it appears to me, that, taken as a whole, the Tariff may be regarded as a very reasonable compromise, except in one or two particulars. I wish now to allude to an honorable senator who has taken up a considerable amount of time, and to whom I listened with much pleasure. I allude to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> of New South Wales.&#34; I am a protectionist ; he is a free-trader: but I recognise that he is very much in earnest over the matter, a,nd he has evidently gone to a great amount of trouble to bring forward what he called &#34;facts and figures.&#34; I listened to him with a great amount of attention and instruction all through. He summed up the whole matter from his point of view in a phrase. He practically said, &#34; I am a free-trader because a protectionist Tariff takes money out of the pockets of the people as soon as the protectionist duties become effective.&#34; In other words he contended that if a protectionist duty is imposed, as long as the Treasurer is receiving revenue from it the protection is not effective, <inline font-style="italic">hut</inline> directly the Treasurer ceases to obtain revenue from the duty in consequence of its being made effective by manufacturers starting the production of the article taxed, the manufacturer claps on the amount of  the duty  to the price paid by the consumer. Now I say that that contention is altogether wrong. It is one of those wretched free-trade fallacies we hear so much about, and that are constantly being rammed down -the throats of the people at public meetings by freetrade speakers. They argue that it necessarily follows that the amount of the duty is added to the price of the article as soon as the protection becomes effective. To pro ve. that it does not necessarily follow, I will allude to a little scene that occurred between myself and the leader of the Opposition during his speech at the commencement of this debate.  In that speech the honorable and learned senator treated the question in a very fair spirit, except when he was criticising the  Vice-President  of the Executive Council, when he trespassed upon his imagination for his facts to a very considerable extent. But when the leader of the Opposition was denouncing manufacturers in protected industries, because, he said, they were practically  robbing  the . public by taking the amount represented by the duty and putting it upon the price of the article, I said, &#34;None ought to know better than you that that is not so, because you are a manufacturer, and1 your industry receives the benefit of a 200 per cent, duty.&#34; I thought I was perfectly justified in referring to that. I did not refer to it in any way that could be regarded as insulting to the honorable and learned senator; but when he was denouncing manufacturers as robbing the public, he being a manufacturer himself, it was only right that I should remind him of the fact. But no one knows better than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon*</inline> that he does not rob the public, and that although there is a duty of 200 odd per cent, for the benefit of the article he manufactures, he never puts that amount into his pocket. The statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> as to the way a protective duty works out are absolutely disproved by the fact that though Australian wine - which is the article <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> manufactures - gets the benefit of this 200 per cent, duty, the local manufacturer does not put that amount of profit into his pocket. </para>

            <para>- It is the same article, just as whisky manufactured in Australia is precisely the same article as a whisky manufactured in Scotland. There is not the slightest difference ; it is the same article, and any one who talks such utter nonsense as to say that the wine manufactured in this country is not wine just the same as imported stuff is wine, must have lost his senses. Of course, there are different kinds of wine. There are ports and sherries, and chablis and hocks, and various other kinds. But we manufacture hocks and sherries, and port wine and chablis in South Australia, and these wines are of precisely the same type as imported foreign wines. If the theory of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> is correct, that the manufacturer puts upon the consumer  the duty levied upon the imported article, the manufacturer of wine should be getting a very high price for this article. But as a matter- of fact the manufacturer is getting nothing of the sort. He is receiving only an exceedingly fair and moderate price. Why ? Because there are so many vineyards in the country that they compete one with another and bring down the price to just about the figure at which it pays to produce the article. There is very little profit attached to the industry, and the public are not robbed because of the duty. The only reason for imposing the duty at the present time is to prevent the wine-growers of South Australia and the Other States from having to compete with the cheap wines of France, made by means of cheap labour. They will sell you claret at Bordeaux for 6d. per gallon. I shall refer to another branch of industry in order to prove my contention&#34;. It is said that when a duty becomes absolutely protective, and commodities are made in the country, the manufacturer charges the duty, or a large portion of it, to the consumer, so that, although the people are taxed, the Treasury is benefited in no way. When I introduced my Tariff in South Australia in 1887, a gentleman came to me and said that he had been making ploughshares in that State for a great many years. He had commenced in a very small way by manufacturing for the neighbouring farmers, but, owing to the satisfaction he gave, his business became very large. The English agents, feeling that their business was affected, represented to the manufacturers at Home that unless something was done to kill this thriving local industry, it would monopolize the trade. The result was that the English prices were immediately lowered considerably below any which had previously been charged. The local manufacturer could not afford to sell at these prices, and represented to me that he ought to have some protection. This presented a difficult task to me, because, in this and other Parliaments, we always hear the cry that we must look after the primary producer. It was the &#34;poor&#34; farmers who were interested in these ploughshares, and, of course, they had to be considered. But I introduced my protectionist Tariff, believing the statement of the South Australian manufacturer, that he could sell his ploughshares, at the prices which had previously been charged by the English manufacturer. I managed to squeeze the Tariff through in the face of a considerable amount of opposition, with the result that now the manufacturers of South Australia, not only make all the ploughshares which are required in that State, but also export to other States. The local manufacturers do not charge the duty to the consumers, as is proved by the fact that ploughshares are as cheap, or cheaper than ever they were before. This duty was imposed to prevent the unfair competition of the English manufacturers. In order to show that this lowering of importers&#39; prices is an old game which has gone on for years, I refer honorable senators to what took place in America early in the nineteenth century, and to a speech then made by a lawyer, named Brougham. There was in the history of the mother country an unfortunate period, which was followed by the second American war. England had prevented America sending goods to our enemy, Napoleon, or to the countries over which he ruled, and eventually this caused America to go to war with the mother country. It is not a very creditable episode in the history of America, but there is the fact. The United States put an embargo on all goods from Great Britain, with the result that the American people were forced into starting manufactures. Subsequently when the infant manufactures of the United States had been started, and the embargo removed, what do honorable senators think the manufacturers of England did? They flooded the American markets. And what do honorable senators think a public man recommended in the House of Commons ? We read - </para>

        <para class="block">Free-traders deny that anything of this sort ever occurs ; but we have here a reason why there must be protection in young countries in order to enable industries to be started fairly. What was done in South Australia in a small way, was done in a large way ill 1816 in the United States. Great depression afterwards occurred in America in consequence of English goods being forced on the market. Men were thrown out of employment and wages came down,, and in self-defence the United States were forced into imposing a protective Tariff. I think I have proved my position, and that I may now ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> to join the ranks of the protectionists. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> said that the only reason he is a free-trader is that a protective duty directly it becomes effective, is diverted by the manufacturers from the Treasury into their own pockets, and the public are thus robbed. The statement is absolutely incorrect. Such a position can only arise under very peculiar circumstances ; that is to say, when industries are not fully established. After a time, when protection has had its full effect, and manufactures are firmly established, internal competition reduces prices to a fair figure, at which the manufacturers can pay reasonable wages. At any rate, prices, if at all, are little above what the commodities could be imported for if there were no duty. And workmen, who gain by protection, ought to support, and do &#39; support, their national industries throughout the greater part of the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> went into an elaborate calculation to prove that the Treasurer&#39;s estimate of revenue for a normal year is fallacious : that it is, at least, from &#163;600,000 to &#163;1,000,000 too low. I listened very carefully to the honorable senator and followed his every figure, and I came to the conclusion that he had left out one great factor which will have its effect during the next year or two. My experience as Treasurer enabled me to discover what I find to be a universal rule in the matter of revenue. In South Australia we have had at times bad years through losses of crops; but I found that in such years the revenue from the customs was practically not lowered atall. In the next year, however, there was a great drop in the returns ; and it is a fact that the effects of a bad year are never felt until the following twelve months. We have recently experienced an exceptionally severe drought, which has culminated in much disaster in Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia, and to a limited extent in the mallee district of Victoria. Does any honorable senator mean to tell <inline font-style="italic">mb</inline> that next year we shall not feel the full effects of it? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> commenced his speech on Tuesday last by alluding to a return just published, which showed that the revenue derived from customs during the last month was a considerable increase on that of the previous month ; and the honorable senator told us that that fact only strengthened him in the opinion that the Treasurer&#39;s estimate was considerably too low. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> did not take into account the fact that during the time the Tariff was before the House of Representatives, from October last until it had nearly passed through committee, every importer was keeping his goods in bond, only clearing enough to meet the barest requirements of his trade. Immediately the House of Representatives had practically settled the Tariff, importers began &#39; to operate more freely, having more confidence in what the Tariff was to be. They believed that they knew the worst or the best, as the case might be ; and their abnormal clearances accounted for the increased revenue. I am confident that the estimate of the Treasurer will not be exceeded, though I should be glad if it were. I believe that next year the&#39; Customs revenue throughout the various States, and especially in the States which require the largest revenue, such as Queensland, Tasmania, and South Australia, will fall very considerably, and these latter States will be great sufferers. As I say, I do not believe that the revenue for the whole Commonwealth will exceed the Treasurer&#39;s estimate of &#163;8,900,000 or thereabouts ; at any rate, the estimate will not be exceeded by the &#163;600,000 or &#163;700,000 mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford.</inline> We have heard a great deal about free-trade England and the feeling there in regard to fiscal matters at the present time. It is asserted that England  has already taken a step in the direction of  protection by imposing a duty on flour, and a low protective duty on wheat. I was in England from 1884 to 1S88, as AgentGeneral for South Australia, and I came into contact with politicians, merchants, and financiers. The representative of South Australia in London does all the indenting for the State : he calls for tenders for all the Government supplies, and in that way I became acquainted with many manufacturers. I also made it my business on more than one occasion to visit manufacturing centres, both in England and on the Continent, in order to do my best in the way of ob-  taining for my State goods of the best quality as cheaply as possible. I admit that the merchants of the old country are all free-traders in spite of the position they occupy. No doubt they grumble, and if any body of men have justification for dissatisfaction, they are the manufacturers of - Great </para>

            <para>- I do not know, but they have done it. Not only the Germans but the Belgians - and the French to a more moderate extent - have gone into the brush trade, the woollen trade, the cotton trade, and the machinery trade of England. When I was in England it seemed to me to be a shameful thing that&#39; the men who were paying taxes in Great Britain, who possessed large factories, and who expended considerable sums of money, should be brought into competition in the English market with goods that came from the continent, and which did not pay any more for freightage than the local manufacturers were compelled to pay for the carriage of their&#39; manufactures to their destinations. The railway fares  from  the factories in the midland counties to London and the south of England were higher than was the freight from Hanover and other places on the continent from which goods were sent to England. I considered that it was a, grossly unfair competition. I reached England just after the publication of that celebrated book, <inline font-style="italic">Made in Germany,</inline> which called England&#39;s attention to this matter in a way in which it had never been done before. On the occasion of one of his public utterances, Lord Rosebery quoted from the statistics of that book. He called the attention of the English merchants to the matter, and asked them, to improve their methods of trade and manufacture, and if possible to do something to counteract it. At the time, the whole of England was discussing the question of how to deal with the difficulty. A gentleman well known to a good many honorable senators, because he was in the Malay Archipelago for many years - I refer to Wallace, the great naturalist and writer on land tenure and a variety of other social subjects, and who. by-the-bye, if Darwin had not stepped in, would have been the first to propagate the doctrine of evolution, because he had found out precisely the same facts - wrote an article . in  one of the reviews in which he pointed out this unfair competition. He was a strong freetrader; but he pointed out that the remedy was for the British&#39; Government to impose precisely the same duties on articles coming into England as those to which similar articles of English manufacture were liable on entering Germany. He said - &#34; For instance, they put a duty of so much a ton on machinery ; you should have precisely the same duty against them ; so that if they import machinery into England they will have to  pay the duties which would have to be paid on English manufactures if imported into Germany.&#34; That would be perfect free-trade, although, of course, it would be a little bit of retaliation, and it appeared to me to be absolutely fair. </para>

            <para>- I would take Wallace against Charleston any day. It is all very fine for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> who has not studied the subject, and who, no doubt, had never heard of the question until I spoke of it, to come forward with his <inline font-style="italic">ipse</inline><inline font-style="italic">divit</inline> and say &#34; It will not do.&#34; No doubt there are objections to that Scheme, and they were pointed out at the time by other writers. But there is a strong feeling growing in England at the present time that something must be done. In order to show honorable, senators the strength of that feeling, I should like to quote from a speech made by Lord Salisbury. He is a free-trader, and a most able and intelligent man. I had the pleasure of hearing him on more than one occasion when in England, and I have always been pleased to listen to that quiet, conversational way in which he addresses his audience, because of the _ sound common sense that he invariably displays in discussing any particular subject. </para>

          <para>Forty or fifty years ago everybody believed that free-trade had conquered the world - </para>
        </quote>
        <para>I think we have heard that here - and they prophesied that every nation would follow the example of England, and give itself up to absolute free-trade. The results are not exactly what they prophesied, but the more adverse the results were, the more the devoted prophets of free-trade declared that all would come right at last- </para>
        <para class="block">Poor deluded mortals with their fallacies ! - </para>
        <para>The worse the Tariffs of foreign countries became, the more confidentwere the prophecies of an early victory ; but we see now, after many years&#39; experience that explain it, how many foreign nations are raising, one after another, a wall - a brazen wall of protection - around their shores, which excludes us from their markets, and, so far as they are concerned, do their best to kill our trade, and this state of things does not get better. On the contrary, it constantly seems to get worse. </para>
        <para>We live in anage of a war of Tariffs. Every nation is trying how it can, by agreement with its neighbour, get the greatest possible protection for its own industries, and&#39;, at the same time, the greatest possible access to the&#39;markets of its neighbours. </para>
        <para>The weapon with which they all fight is admission to their own markets - that is to say, A says toB, &#34;If you will make your duties such that I can sell in your markets I will make my duties such that you can sell in my market.&#34; </para>
        <para>But we begin by saying that we will levy no duties on anybody, and w.e declare that it would be contrary and disloyal to the glorious and sacred doctrine of free-trade to levy any duty on anybody for the sake of what we can get by it. </para>
        <para>It may be noble, but it is not business. </para>
        <para class="block">I commend these remarks to my free-trade friends. I can assure them that year by year this feeling in England is growing greater and greater in intensity. I know the feeling that is entertained by some members of the present Cabinet. I know that Lord Selborne, who was under secretary to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> had the audacity to say, when addressing a meeting, of the Chamber of Commerce of Liverpool - of all places in the world - that England was no longer going to be bound by the fetish of free-trade. He was cheered to the echo by the very men who, but a few years before, w.ould have looked upon such a statement as rank heresy, and. who would have groaned him down if he had dared to say such a thing in view of the responsible position which he occupied. Although he did not spea.lt absolutely for the Cabinet, I know that he voiced the wish of some members of the Cabinet that something should be done to prevent the grossly unfair competition of foreign traders in the markets of England. </para>

            <para>- I do not recollect that he said anything special in regard to them, but I know that England would be inclined to adopt something of the kind. When I was in England <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> asked me if I thought that the Australian colonies would give preferential treatment to the mother country so far as. her goods were concerned, just as Canada had done. I told him that they would not do so. I said - &#34; So far as I can see, we cannot do- it.&#34; There is only one line that I know of in regard to which Great Britain could give us any preferential treatment, and that is colonial wines. I knew at the time that preferential treatment in that direction, would admirably suit my own colony, but that it would not suit the others. I thought that I expressed the feeling in the colonies generally when I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> that we could not give preferential treatment to the mother country until she had a Tariff under which it would be possible for her to give us some preference. We are business people in the States, and we do not give something for nothing, no matter what Canada may do. I happen to know what Canada had in view in framing a preferential Tariff in favour of imports from Great Britain. I had an opportunity of speaking on the subject to the unfortunate Premier of Canada, SirJohn Thompson, who died suddenly at Windsor Castle, after he had been sworn in as one of  Her  Majesty&#39;s Privy Councillors. I also spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Laurier on the matter, and I know what Canada has in view. By giving preferential treatment to Great Britain, the people of Canada hope eventually to shame the mother country into giving them preferential duties in return. They donot mind suffering a loss for a few years, but they are equally as businesslike as I said the people of Australia were, when I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> that we could not give Great Britain any such preference. </para>

            <para>- I expressed what I believed to be the view of Australia as a whole. I think now that it would be impossible to pass a line in this Tariff which would give preferential treatment to Great Britain in regard to any goods which she might send out here. I do not think it could be done, and, indeed, I see no necessity for it. I look forward to the time, a few years hence, when she will be able to give us something in this direction ; when she will treat us in the same way as France and other countries treat their colonies. </para>

            <para>- Something of that sort. I listened with a good deal of attention to this debate, in order to discover if possible any new point. At last I found an absolutely new point, one that had never been thought of before ; that had  never  been referred to either in the Parliament, in the press, in the country, or anywhere else. It was first promulgated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles.</inline> The honorable senator told us that he had carefully compared the foreign, trade of States- which had protection, with that of the only State which had a free-trade policy - and it was very bad free-trade - New South Wales. He said, that as the result of this comparison he found that the State which had adopted a free-trade policy sent fi larger proportion of her trade to foreign countries, than did those States which had protection. The inference which he drew was that. free-trade in the States was to the advantage of the foreigner whilst protection was to the advantage of the mother country. </para>

            <para>- It may be right and it may be wrong, I cannot exactly say; but, during the long course of my life I have heard many statements which were exceedingly plausible, and, no doubt, in this case the facts are as stated. But is the inference drawn from those facts accurate ? That is the point. From time <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> time people have come to me with certain statements ; they have produced their facts and stated the inferences which they drew from them, and they have asked me to subscribe to them. I recollect one special instance when the fad in regard to bimetallism first came out. I think that at the time I was the Treasurer of South Australia, . at all events, I was a member of the State Government. I listened to all the arguments of those who waited on- me in reference to the subject. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator goes from one fad to another. He was a protectionist not long ago, and now he is a free-trader, and he goes round and round in the most marvellous way. I say that while the facts may be all right, the inference drawn from them may be altogether wrong. The position the bimetallists put was a very plain one. In 1S72, the German Empire resolved to have a gold standard, and it demonetized silver. . Many of the Latin nations did the some thing at the same time. Now comes the argument. From that time, 1872, right down to 1895 or 1896, there was a gradual fall in the price of silver. There was a gradual fall also in the price of products. Therefore the fall in the price of products was held to be due to the fall in the price of silver. We had only to rehabilitate silver, make it good money again, and a medium of exchange,, and all would be right. Up would go our wheat, wool, metals, and various other products, and a wonderful prosperity would be the result.. That took hold of people to such an extent that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Balfour, the leader of the Government in the House of Commons, was smitten with it, and agreed with it. Our own Treasurer in South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holder,</inline> who is now  Speaker  &#39;of the House of Representatives, was bitten with the same thing. A great many of the most able men in the world were bitten with it, including a very great number in America. So strong were, they in America, in consequence of their having behind them a lot of owners of silver mines, who wanted to keep the price of silver up, that they formed big associations, and, I believe, they went the length of running a candidate for the Presidency. It was something terrible. While the  agitation was going on it all appeared to be plain sailing. There was no doubt that the price of silver fell, and, as it fell, so fell the price of products. The  bi-metallists  gob tables out, and they sent a man, called Frewin, all through the Australian colonies, lecturing upon the subject. I do not know whether any honorable senators present listened to the terrible lecture that gentleman gave, but he would have convinced, almost any one who listened to him that it was all as true as gospel. But the time came when theprice of silver still went down and the price of products rose. Then the whole theory was knocked on the head, and we hear no more about it now. It has gone. So I say to my honorable friend. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline> that, while his facts are absolutely correct, the inferences he draws from those facts may be absolutely inaccurate. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator is a very wise man. He has generally got something up his sleeve. However, I shall not pursue the subject further, but I again express my pleasure at having heard this new point. I did hear some other new statements made also. They were made by my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> I am sure there was something new in the statement the honorable senator made about the fall of Babylon.

But the honorable senator was not content with 1 Babylon. Not a bit of it. He must go to Persia, and he told us the same yarn about Persia. I never heard it before, though I am as good a historyreader as most people, and have as good a knowledge of history, both ancient and modern. Then the honorable senator came down further to Rome, and we heard that Rome was ruined not by our old barbarian forefathers, the Goths, the Huns, and the  VisiGoths, who  overran Europe at the time. We were told that the Roman Empire did not  fall because  of those people, but because of big estates. But here we have the old mother country with big estates, and she has been floating the old flag that has braved the battle and the breeze for a thousand years, and is alive still. Surely the free-traders will not say that the mother country is extinct ? </para>

            <para>- I am glad that I have accurately quoted the honorable senator. There was no use in my interjecting across the Chamber, that Bismarck said he adopted the policy for the sake of protection. It was not a bit of use my saying that Thiers said the same thing in the French Assembly in Paris, and that Belgium put on high duties for the same reason. The honorable senator was quite sure that he had given the right reason, but does he not know that Bismarck and Thiers at least had common sense, and does he not know that to raise revenue for purposes of military expenditure, the very worst thing to do would be to put on protective duties, because, directly they became effective, there would be a loss of revenue? Bismarck was not such a fool as that. Bismarck and Thiers were both exceedingly eminent men ; but, however foolish they may have been, they were never so stupid as to put on protective duties to raise money for military purposes. Their own common sense would have taught them that directly those duties became effective, they would no longer bring in revenue to meet the expenses of their armies. </para>

            <para>- Very well; I have now got another point which the honorable senator has made. I pay particular attention to my young friend, because I like to see young men in Parliament. A dressing down occasionally does them a world of good - I have had many in my time - and I hope that when we old people leave the scene we shall have trained up the young men. I am, therefore, exceedingly glad to see so many young men around me in this Senate, which is supposed to represent the age and wisdom of the States. I wish to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> that he ought to be very particular about his facts. If he desires to secure the respect of the Senate and of the community outside, he must be especially careful as to the truth of the statements he makes. I am very doubtful about one statement he made - that wages of 4 dollars a week were paid in coal mines in America. There is no truth in it. I defy the honorable senator to prove it, and his own common sense should have told him there was no truth in it. We know that wages in America are higher than in any other part of the civilized world. We know also that men who work in mines always get high wages, even in England. They get exceedingly high wages in England, and work exceedingly short hours too. All over the world it is the same. It is a hard and dangerous occupation, and especially trying to the constitution, and where men are employed in dangerous occupations, they must always be paid high wages. Men, for instance, who are employed in smelting works amongst lead, and who, in consequence of being leaded, have their lives shortened, are paid exceedingly high wages. While on this subject, I should like to read a quotation from Bryce&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">American Commonwealth</inline> - the standard authority upon all political and social questions relating to the United States of America. Bryce says - </para>

          <para>Under protection we have had great demand for labour, wages high, and money cheap ; public and private revenues large ; public and private prosperity great beyond all previous precedent; growing national independence. Under free-trade we have had labour everywhere seeking employment, wages low, and money high ; public and private revenues small and steadily decreasing, public and private bankruptcy nearly universal, and growing national dependence. </para>

        <para class="block">He shows that almost since the declaration of independence, whenever there have been periods of protection, there has been prosperity, but that when free-trade has been the order of the day, depression, low wages, bankruptcy, and disaster have followed. When I was in England,  President  Cleveland, who was a free-trader, altered the American Tariff so as to make it practically a free-trade Tariff, with the result that the country became so unprosperous, and the balance of trade set so steadily against it, that they had to go into the market, and sell gold bonds in order to keep up the credit of the banks and of the Government. But when theMcKinley, and then the Dingley, Tariffs were imposed prosperity came again, and now the people of the United States are the most prosperous nation in the world, and are beginning to expand and to take possession of other countries. Popu lation there has increased, wealth has increased, the wages of the workmen are kept upto a high level, and the people consume luxuries which are not known to people in similar states of society elsewhere. When I visited the United States and Canada in 1882 and 1883, I made it my duty to converse with men who had some knowledge of the conditions of those countries, and as a result of what I saw and heard, I came to the conclusion that unmistakably protection was the right policy for South Australia. After I came back I got into Parliament, and in 1887 introduced what I call a moderate Tariff, though, of course, others might judge it by a different standard. That Tariff remained in existence until 1901, when it was superseded by the Commonwealth Tariff, introduced by ray right honorable friend the Minister for Trade and Customs ; and during all the years between 1887 and 1901 there was no agitation for its alteration, except in minute particulars. It was not altered, except to raise the duty upon champagne - a thing which even my free-trade friends would not object to - and to reduce the duty upon oats, for the benefit of the Adelaide cabmen. </para>

            <para>- I do not say that it is ; but we manufacture our own boots and shoes, our own clothing, our own ploughs and agricultural machinery, and our own vehicles,  which we did not do before we had protection. When I was Treasurer I was told by my freetrade friends, of whom I have plenty there, and with whom I talked over these matters in a most amicable manner - &#34; You have become Premier and Treasurer at a time of great trouble. During the last three years the colony has gone to the bad considerably over a million: When the revenue of a little colony fails to that extent to meet the expenditure, things are in rather a bad way, and yet you are bringing in a protectionist Tariff.&#34; I said - :&#34;I am not bringing in a protectionist Tariff, because in the world there is no Tariff which is protectionist in the true sense of the term. A Tariff is imposed primarily for revenue and incidentally for protection, and it is the wise people of the world who make their Tariff of  such  a character that, while it produces enough revenue for governing purposes, it incidentally protects their own people, giving them employment and making them self-reliant, and not dependent on other countries.&#34; I was told in the most serious way - &#34; You have put a tax on boots, shoes, ready-made clothing, and other things. Ofcourse, the articles will be made in the colony, and you will get no revenue, and where will you be then?&#34; I said - &#34; You will see where I shall be when the time comes round.&#34; What resulted ? It is absolutely true - as true as a proposition in Euclid - that if you put a duty on an article you get a revenue while it is imported, but you get no revenue when importation ceases. The importation of boots and shoes and a host of other things practically stopped ; but the manufacture of all our readymade clothing in the colony went on very comfortably. We lost revenue in that direction. But this is what I gained. There were 300 or 400 men employed in making boots and shoes who were never employed in that way in the colony before, and they consumed various dutiable articles like tea and coffee - they had a little drop of beer occasionally, I suppose, and so forth - and the result was that I made up any loss of revenue caused by the protective duties becoming effective. I made up that loss of revenue easily through the employment of the men who were working on these manufactures. </para>

            <para>- No ; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> said that Bismarck brought in   a protective Tariff for the purpose of producing a war revenue. I hold that no man would be fool enough to impose duties of a protective nature for such a purpose. I have heard the free-traders make these false statements from the public platform. I have got up and denounced them, and shown how wrong they were in trying to make the poor people believe that we would get no revenue if we had a protective Tariff - it was an absurd thing to say - whereas the real truth is that no Tariff is absolutely protective all round. If the protective duties you impose incidentally are effective, the revenue is made up to the Treasury by the duties on the goods which are consumed by the workmen, who would not have been at work and in the country if it had not been for&#39; the protective Tariff. </para>

Now I come to- a part of the Tariff in respect of which I exceedingly regret the action of the other House. I am exceedingly sorry that the leader of the Opposition and of the free-trade party in that House voted against the retention of the tea and kerosene duties. He voted against his principles, and I think he ought to be heartily ashamed of himself for his action. He refused to allow a reconsideration of the proposals. </para>

            <para>- The ladies have all sorts of absurd fads, which they follow. Not only do they drink their afternoon tea very often to excess, but they lace themselves so tightly that they can hardlybreathe, and do all sorts of absurd things. The honorable and learned senatormust not say that I am hard on the ladies.I could be very hard on them if 1 liked, because some of them do very stupid things, and to drink too much tea is a very stupid thing. I am serious on this question of the tea duty, and Iam exceedingly sorry that it was taken off. It was easily paid by the people. It was 3d. a lb., less in the Commonwealth than it had been in Queensland. It produced a nice little revenue to the Commonwealth, and there waa not the slightest justification for its abolition. I would sooner take the duty off cotton piece goods. That is what we did in South Australia. I wished to encourage people to make clothing in the colony, and I admitted their raw. material duty freo, but now we have a duty on cotton piece goods, which I think is a great mistake, and it might be taken off in the interests of the working people. Cotton will not hurt them very much unless it gets on fire, and then it is a very awkward thing. I am inclined to put a duty on flannelette because it is a very dangerous material for women to wear, especially if it gets alight, for it is all cotton. I now come to another item in respect of which I think a very great mistake has been made, and here Ispeak from a protectionist stand-point. It was a scandalous thing to take the duty off kerosene. In New South Wales they have a kerosene shale mine working. According to the reports in the newspapers, the little State of Tasmania has a deposit of kerosene shale of most excellent quality, far and above anything which has ever been found in Australia. Why should we not impose a slight protective duty that practically nobody would feel, and give some encouragement to the development of a natural industry <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

            <para>- It is one of the primary industries. I look upon the Tariff as a very fair compromise, except in some particulars in which anomalies can bepointed out, I have no doubt, that we may readily cure. But I ask the Senate, whatever it may do, not to lower the duties which are imposed for revenue purposes, but rather to increase them. Look at the position that Queensland will be in after this fearful drought, with a deficiency of &#163;200,000 in her Customs revenue. Look at the position that Tasmania will bc in with a deficiency of between &#163;100,000 and &#163;200,000. It is a very sad thing indeed to contemplate. South Australia will come out just about even, and therefore it is not a matter of very muchimportance to that State. Under this Tariff South Australia will derive a revenue equal to that which was previously returned by its State Tariff. But this is not thecase with some of the other States. I fear that in consequence of the severe drought which prevails in several of the States we shall fail to realize therevenue anticipated by the Treasurer, and therefore I ask the Senate not to make any request to the other branch of the Legislature to still further reduce these duties. I shall be only too glad to assist in restoring tea to the dutiable list by imposing a tax of 3d. per lb. upon it. At all events, letus levy some duty upon it. Let us preventthe tea-packing industry, which has been established in the various States through the operation of Customs duties, from being destroyed. It is an industry in which hundreds of people who are unable to do heavier work find employment, and therefore if we cannot see our way to levy a duty of 3d. per lb. upon tea, let us impose a tax of1d. per lb. upon that article in packets so that the industry may be kept going. </para>
