                        <para>- Can the Vice-President of the Executive Council give any information with regard to a cable message published in the press to-day to the effect that the Prime Minister has stated in London that the pastoralists of New South Wales are spreading alarmist and exaggerated reports of losses in the pastoral industry, with the view of exacting concessions from the Federal Government, regardless of the general interests of the community? Have the Government had communication, by cable or otherwise, with the Prime Minister on the subject, and are they prepared to take any steps to contradict statements which are both offensive and untrue ? </para>

                    <para>- I desire to say a few words on a matter of some importance to the merchants not only of my own State but throughout the whole Commonwealth. I regret very much that the circumstances are such that I am unable at this stage of the Bill to conclude with a direct motion, and that I can only bring the matter before the Senate so that the representatives of the Government may have an opportunity of consulting with their colleagues on this very important subject. When I was in Queensland a few weeks ago I was asked by several merchants to grant an interview with a view to their placing before me certain matters relating to the collection of customs duties on various articles. In some cases the duties charged were very much in excess of the duties ultimately imposed in consequence of alterations in. the Tariff. There are, I must confess, some very glaring cases of hardship, cases, I might say, almost bordering on injustice. I may cite one case of very serious hardship which has been suffered by a firm of Brisbane merchants who have been engaged in trade in that city for many years. It is a most respectable firm, and I am satisfied that unless it felt that it had been very seriously aggrieved it would not refer to the matter. To show that I am not bringing before the Senate a mere trumpery matter for the purpose of self-advertising or of killing time, I must refer to the correspondence between myself and this firm, as well as from other bodies. Shortly after my arrival in Brisbane I received the following letter from Messrs. A. M. Hertzberg and Co., dated 26th June: - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I should very much like to have a few moments conversation with you about matters in connexion with the Commonwealth Parliament which are of special interest to the mercantile community here, and about which I fear the members pf the Senate have not had all the information that could be given them. </para>
                <para>Would you kindly name a time when I could call upon you, or, if it is not asking too much, or imposing on good nature, might I suggest a visit to our office, where we could discuss the matter? Under any circumstances, I wish to suit myself entirely to your convenience, and merely suggest my office as an alternative- </para>
                <para class="block">Other firms in Brisbane have suffered in a similar manner, but this, I think, is the most glaring case of hardship. This firm has had some correspondence with the Department of Trade and Customs on the subject, which I must take the liberty of placing on record, not for the purpose of preventing an early rising of the Senate, but for the purpose of inducing . Ministers to confer with their colleagues, to see if something cannot be done to relieve such cases, not only in Queensland, but in other States. Writing . to the collector of Customs at Brisbane, on the 20th November, 1901, Messrs. A. M. Hertzberg and Co. say : - </para>
                <para>With reference to the announcement which appears in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier</inline> that the Federal Government does not propose to make any refunds of duty in the event of them being reduced or struck out, we beg to submit for your information certain facts and figures bearing on this subject, with the request that you will bc goodenough to transmit them to the honorable Minister for Trade and Customs for his information also. </para>
                <para>From the attached particulars you will gather that between the 14th ultimo and the 14th of the present month we have paid duty on 193 packages of earthenware and glassware, the duty amounting to £282 4s.1d. Under the new rates now being' collected the duty would amount to £158 15s. 10d., showing that we have overpaid £123 8s. 3d. </para>
                <para>These 193 packages are accounted for in the following manner : - </para>

                </para>
                <para>As regards the five packages delivered from the ship's side, they were Bold oil the distinct understanding that any refund of duty in consequence of the alteration would be refunded to the purchaser in accordance with sub-section (c) of clause 152 of the Customs Act 1901. </para>
                <para>Of the 53 packages opened and put into our stock, not more than at most one half has been sold, showing that fully five-sixths of the total quantity duty paid are still on hand. </para>
                <para>The figures as regards the amount of duty paid can be verified by the entries in possession of your department, and the other figures showing now the goods have been disposed of, up to this morning can be verified by an officer of your department inspecting the packages in bulk, and by our books. </para>
                <para class="block">The offer made by the firm clearly shows that, they do not wish to take advantage of the department, but feel that they are smarting under a sense of wrong in having to pay duties which previously they had not to pay, as under the practice of the State, whenever an alteration of duties took place, a refund immediately followed. </para>

In April, 1 888, we passed the largest fiscal measure that had ever been passed in that State, and it has been amended on several occasions. Upon every occasion on which duties have been reduced refunds have been made. </para>

If the revenue had suffered to any appreciable extent by this practice I think that there would have been sufficient watchfulness and vitality on the part of members of our Parliament to have led to a satisfactory settlement of the question.

                    <para>With these goods we now have to compete against merchants paying the reduced rate of duty only, which puts us at a very great disadvantage. It is well known to every merchant, and no doubt is known to you also, that whenever any alteration in the Tariff takes place and the duties are raised we are unable to take advantage of it, as competition always tends to keep prices at or near former levels, so long as any old stock is in the market, and it is only gradually that prices can be raised in keeping with the new duties. But if duties are reduced we have immediately to give to our constituents the benefit of all such reductions. So well has this fact been recognized in this State whenever any alterations in duty were made, that although the advanced duties were collected forthwith, the reduced duties did not take effect until several months later. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That bears out the statement which I have made that, whenever any reductions were made, merchants obtained a refund of the excess amount of duty collected, so that they might be placed on a fairly common level in competition. The writer continues - </para>

                <para class="block">A reduction of the duties on these articles was made on the 14th of November, and was announced in the public press on the following morning. At that time a quantity of the goods was still on board ship or on the wharves, but an application for a refund of the excess duty paid was refused. The letter continues - </para>

Honorable senators representing other States could doubtless bring forward other cases if they desired, and although this may not be the only instance of hardship which has occurred, it is a very serious one. I wish to refer to one or two points in a letter which I received from the same firm, under date 26th of June last. The firm wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> leader of the labour party in the House of Representatives, with a view to invoke his assistance, but he replied that he could not see his way clear to support the application for a refund.

                    <para>Our letters to the collector and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> clearly set forth the grounds on which we claim a. refund. These grounds have been further enlarged upon at our. interview the other day, and there is nothing left to urge in addition to what we have already submitted to you. But we take this opportunity of again drawing your special attention to sub-section (c) clause 152 of the Customs <inline font-style="italic">Act,1901.</inline> It seems to us that the intention of Parliament that refunds should be made, could not possibly have been put into clearer language, that is considering the sort of language which is used in Acts of Parliament. </para>

                <para>I do not think it is - more especially as that implied promise largely, influenced importers to clear goods freely instead of doing so ina hand-to-mouth way. </para>
                <para class="block">That is a point which I wish to bring prominently before the Vice-President of the Executive Council. If the English language means anything there is an implied promise in paragraph (c) of section 152 of the Customs Act that in the event of a reduction being made in a duty on articles upon which the original rate has been paid refunds will be allowed. In consequence of that promise merchants, not only in Brisbane, but elsewhere, cleared goods much more readily and in larger quantities than they would have done had not such a provision existed. The writer proceeds - </para>
                <para>There is only one other point which we wish to touch upon, and that is items 89 and95 - Crockery and Glassware. As we pointed out to you at our interview, the reduced duty of 20 per cent, <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline> has been collected since the morning of the15th of November, whereas, according to the schedule, the original duty ought to have been collected up to the 21st of February. This goes to show that duties were imposed and altered entirely at the will of the Minister - </para>
                <para>Of course, I do not acquiesce in that statement, because I do not think the Minister would do anything of the kind. There must be some other reason for it - without parliamentary sanction, and the commercial community should not be made to suffer loss through such action. </para>
                <para>The last paragraph in our letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> refers to a shipment of crockery and glassware, <inline font-style="italic">ex s.s.Harbury, on</inline> which we paid duty late on Thursday afternoon, the 14th of ' November-an hour or more after the Minister had already announced in the House at Melbourne that the duties would be reduced to 20 per cent.; and the whole of the shipment was still on the wharf, or in the ship, when the alteration was publicly announced the following day. </para>
                <para>We thank you for your courtesy and attention to this matter, and hope your efforts will be successful in obtaining justice for us. </para>
                <para>I think that the justice of making a refund must surely commend itself to the Government. Communications have been received by me, not only from this firm, but from others on this question. In common with other honorable senators from Queensland, I have received a letter from the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, which, acting on behalf of the mercantile community generally, passed certain resolutions on the 6th May. The letter is as follows : - </para>

                <para>Refund of duties. - At <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> meeting of this Chamber held on the 6th inst., the following resolution was passed : - " That <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> deputation from this Chamber, consisting of the members of the committee, wait upon the Chief Secretary, and solicit the influence of the Government of this State to make representations to the Federal Senate with the object of inducing them to consider the question of refund of duty, in order that justice might be done, and that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the senators representing this State in the Federal Parliament. " "The deputation met the Chief Secretary to-day, when he promised to bring the matter before the conference of Premiers to be held in Sydney. My committee desire me to express the hope that the Representatives  of each State will support the action of this Chamber to bring about a satisfactory statement. - I am, dear sir, yours faithfully. </para>

                <para>So widespread was the dissatisfaction among the merchants generally, that they actually caused a. deputation to wait on the Premier of the State to request him to bring this matter before the Federal Parliament, believing, no doubt, that representations made from such an influential source might do more than those made by an ordinary member of the Senate. I must add that when I interviewed several firms at their own request, I found that they had the one complaint - that duties had been collected at the original rates, that reductions had been made suddenly, and that demands for refunds had not been complied with. There must surely be something wrong when that is the case. It is unfair that these people should be called upon to pay the higher duties, particularly when the duties were lowered so soon after payment had been paid that some of the goods had actually not been removed from the ship's side. I have also had communications as well as' the petitions which I presented the other day, from the Brisbane, Maryborough, and Townsville Chambers of Commerce, all bearing on the same question. Surely, therefore, this is a matter that deserves very serious consideration, and even if the Government had previously made up their minds they might well further consider the advisability of refunding these moneys, which in many instances have been collected entirely in violation of the practice of Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- That is true, but there is the practice to which I have referred, and merchants are naturally smarting under a sense of injustice. Under this new arrangement the greatest wrong that can be inflicted upon any individual or company is a blow struck at the pocket. These people have been struck severely, and I bring this matter before the enate, and especially before the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in the hope that he will confer with his colleagues, and see whether moneys which - in the opinion of these merchants as well as in my own opinion - have been improperly collected cannot be returned . I do not wish to say anything in regard to Customs administration. I have too much respect for and confidence in the Minister to think that he would willingly do an act of injustice. But there may be too much anxiety to obtain money for the Treasury. If we had better returns coming in, the department might not be so eager about retaining money thus collected. But I think that the practice which previously prevailed in Queensland was a fair one. It has given satisfaction both to the merchants and the general public. As I said before, I regret that I cannot put this matter in concrete form, in order to test the feeling of the Senate, with a view of doing what I consider to be fair and just to the mercantile community of Queensland and the other States. Before I sit down, I will refer to the section of the Customs Act to which I have alluded. There is not the slightest doubt that had it not been for this section, many merchants would not have taken their goods out of bond in such large quantities as they have done, nor would they have run such risks. Section 152 of the Act says - </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator, having read section 152 of the Customs Act, has placed the Senate in full possession of the case upon which he relies for his contention that the merchants are entitled to refunds of duty paid. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> will only take the trouble to read the section over again, he will see that it is utterly foreign to the contention he has raised. The section deals solely with cases where there has been a sale of goods upon which duty may have been imposed, after an agreement has been entered into between the seller and the purchaser. The section has nothing to do with the relative positions of merchants and the Government of the Commonwealth. The real ground of complaint which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> has made arises from the effects of a provision which has been discussed both by the House of Representatives and by the Senate. It was a. provision- that I myself intended to allude to once more this afternoon. If the honorable senator had been present while the second- reading debate was taking place upon- the Customs Tariff Bill, and when the Senate was in committee upon that measure he would have remembered that this matter was then debated. I myself brought it forward, and cited several cases in which great hardship had occurred in consequence of the law proposed, and since acted upon by the Government. The subject was again debated in committee- when the clause was under consideration, but; beyond getting the assistance of Senators Charleston and Matheson, &gt; I ' received no help. The Government pointed out that it meant a matter of something like £100,000 - a very large sum of money - which would have to be repaid, if it were decided that when a duty was lowered any amount of money that had been paid under the- higher rate of duty should be refunded-. It was also pointed out that to give refunds would lead to a great complication of accounts. The letter quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> is dated the 10th May. The subject was raised in the Senate on the 15th and 16 th May ; but in&gt; consequence of the attitude taken up by honorable senators; I did not feel justified in submitting a proposal. The amendment which I desired to move would have gone exactly in the direction that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> desires-. I mentioned several, cases- of hardship. I have one in mind at the present moment, where- on certain goods that were imported a duty of £5 per ton was charged bv the Government and paid by the importers. The goods were such that they could not go into a bonded store, in consequence of their dangerous- character. Duty was paid' to the amount of something like £300 or £400. But when the House of [Representatives came to deal with the item of the Tariff affecting these commodities; they struck off the duty. In that case a refund was refused, and the Government justified the refusal under the clause of their Bill which affected the matter. </para>

The Customs house officers could, therefore, have identified the goods easily. </para>

                <para class="block">Seeing, that that clause was allowed- to stand part of the Bill, it is quite impossible - unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> is prepared, to move for a recommittal, and succeeds- in, making an amendment - to discuss the matter from the standpoint of asking the Treasurer to give the money back to the importers. The Government are bound by the clause I have quoted. It is true that they are responsible for that clause, but Parliament has accepted, the responsibility itself. Again, I would point out that the people of the country generally, and, in this case, the merchants in particular, have, shown themselves to be too lax altogether. The practice complained of has been in vogue for a period of four or five months. The people affected should have been up and doing in the earlier stages of the operation of the Tariff, and should have brought the matter directly under the notice of the representatives of the various States. Had that been done in the cases mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey,</inline> it might have been possible to effect an alteration in the measure. At one time I. contemplated moving for a recommittal of the clause in question, when- we reached the present stage. But I found, from inquiries I made, that it would be quite futile to endeavour to carry an amendment. I found that I could not expect the assistance of the majority of honorable senators, and I did not want to take up a large amount of time in discussing a subject when it was impossible to carry an amendment securing substantial justice. As far as I am concerned, I desire to enter my protest against the practice that has been pursued. That is all I can do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> has pointed out that in Queensland the practice has been entirely different from that laid down in the Customs Tariff Bill.. The practice in New South Wales has also been different. There, if a merchant paid duty upon goods while Customs duties were under the consideration of Parliament, and the duty was afterwards lowered, a refund was made. </para>

                        <para>- In New South Wales and Queensland the practice has. been what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> stigmatizes as unfair. But, to my mind, it appears that it is the alternative practice that is unfair. Of course, from the expediency point of view there may be something to be said. I quite recognise that the practice to be pursued under the Customs Tariff Bill will save an immense amount of trouble, and will enable the Government to keep money which they have illegally collected, and the collection of which Parliament has refused to ratify except by a side wind such as the present clause. We must always remember that when duties are collected under a Tariff which has not been ratified by Parliament they are illegally collected, and until Parliament ratifies them the collection remains illegal. Parliament, of course, can do as it likes. But the Government have brought down a Bill which declares that duties so collected, though illegal, shall be retained. Under a clause like that, the position of the Government is unassailable. But the position of Parliament is assailable for ratifying such a provision. This Parliament has done so, and I recognise that the majority have a right to their opinion., Notwithstanding the strong views I entertain, it is open to other honorable senators to entertain strong views in the opposite direction. What Parliament has done has been done correctly. But I do protest against it as strongly as I can as an injustice to the merchants of this country, though to other persons it may seem perfectly fair. I feel that I have discharged my duty so far as this particular provision is concerned, in entering: a protest against it in the strongest terms possible, and in pointing out the way in which it has operated unjustly towards persons who have in consequence of it been compelled to pay duties which Parliament has ultimately said should never have been levied under any circumstances whatever. </para>

                    <para>- I very heartily agree with many of the earlier remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould.</inline> I emphasize the honorable and learned senator's contention that it is now altogether too late for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> to bring this matter before the Senate; I am in complete accord with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> in indicating to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> that section 152 of. the Customs Act has absolutely nothing whatever to do with the case. It is a case solely as to the agreements which have been entered into between buyer and seller, and as to the variations of those agreements which shall take place by reason of any' alteration in the Tariff. Of course the proper time to move in the matter was when the particular clause referred to was before the committee of the Senate. As a matter of fact the whole subject was then discussed, and the overwhelming voice of the committee was against the principle now contended for by Senator Glassey. With respect to the later remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> as to the illegal collections made under this and similar measures, I may remind the honorable and learned senator that it is also too late to attempt to discuss that now. While technically these collections may be illegal, the practice followed is sanctioned by precedent extending over the last 80 or 100 years in Great Britain itself, in Canada, New South Wales, and most of the States. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that there are two cases of the kind in Victoria, but if I remember rightly in those cases the session of Parliament had expired. The courts have always waited until the expiration of the session, and if no measure has been enacted to legalize the collections, judgment of course has gone to the plaintiff. The practice is one which has been sanctioned for many years by precedent in all the States, and it is, moreover, a practice which is in the highest and best interests of the mercantile community, as well as of the community generally, and one which has been found on the whole to secure the nearest approach to equality. I should like to point out, by reference to a concrete case, the difficulty of adopting a different course. Let us assume that the Government say - " Cottons are now free, but we propose three months hence to impose a duty of 10 per cent, upon cottons." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> will at once see that the result of that would be that the market would immediately be flooded with cottons, and the duty would become' inoperative for perhaps years; It is in consequence of the exigencies of the situation that we are obliged to resort to this practice. </para>

                        <para>- The retailer will have sold again to the consumer, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> says, it is, of course, the consumer who will have paid the duty. But the whole question was discussed last night, and this is simply a repetition of the arguments then adduced. The overwhelming voice of this Senate has been expressed against entertaining for a moment the idea of a present being made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth to certain merchants, which is what a refund of duty under these circumstances would actually amount to. The merchant will have sold his goods at a price plus the duty, and a refund of the duty to him under the circumstances would mean that he would thereby be made a present of the amount, while the consumer who paid the duty would get no refund whatever, because it would be simply impracticable to enable him to do so. I am aware that inequalities and hardships arise, but in this matter all the members of the mercantile community are placed practically upon the same footing. They are all aware of the possibilities in connexion with a Tariff, and, as a result, they keep their clearances from bond within the lowest limits, and in that way the minimum of risk is undertaken, and possibly the minimum of hardship is suffered. I admit that in a limited percentage of cases hardship does occur. I venture to say that if it were possible for the Government to relieve those cases, they would gladly do so. But I can appeal with the utmost confidence to my honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood,</inline> and to other honorable senators of commercial experience, to admit that it is impossible to grant complete and satisfactory relief in all cases, and, consequently, a broad general principle that there shall be no refunds is laid down, and in that way, on the whole, justice is done. I feel that the Government have really had no reasonable alternative but to act in the manner they have done. On the whole, greater justice has been done all round to consumer and to merchant than could have been secured by reverting to the practice urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey.</inline> I have no doubt that there have been some cases of hardship, but in those cases, under the practice adopted, the revenue - in which we are all interested - and not individuals, has benefited, and the hardships have thereby been more or less minimised. Before I sit down, I should like to say a word or two upon a matter which I believe to be of very great interest to the Senate. It refers to clause 2 of the Customs Tariff Bill now before us, which provides that the Customs Act of 1901, No. 6, shall be incorporated and read as one with this Act. Honorable senators will be aware that section 55 of the Constitution Act provides - </para>

It is a machinery measure, enabling the Government to do just as well, without its being referred to in this Bill at all, everything they can do as a result of its incorporation with this Bill. In other words, I claim that if clause 2 were not inserted in this Bill, the Customs Act of 1901, No. 6, would operate in precisely the same manner. </para>

If the other House is allowed to send up a measure of this kind, incorporating extraneous matter as it has done by clause 2, we may on a future occasion have extraneous matter introduced in a similar measure, and this case quoted as a precedent against us. Honorable senators should pause before they become parties to the introduction of extraneous matter in a Bill of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- Speaking now in reply I wish to refer in the first place, to the matters mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey.</inline> I listened very carefully to his clear explanation of the grievances of the writers of the letters he read, and it appears to me that they all come well within the principle which has already been decided on grounds very succinctly stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best,</inline> who spoke not only with the confidence of one who apprehended the subject thoroughly, but with the authority derived from the actual administration of a Customs Act for a number of years. I think it was the general opinion of the Senate, with very few exceptions, when we were discussing this matter before, that although the application of the principle might result in hardship in particular instances, there must be some hardship in the introduction of a new state of things such as this, and that the lesser of the two evils was the adoption of the course which has been adopted. I do not wish to repeat any of the reasons which were given for the adoption of that course at any other time or to-day. The Government do not intend to reconsider any of these cases. They have come to a decision as to the principle to be observed. It has been followed in a large number of instances, and that decision cannot be disturbed. With regard to the other matter, I would suggest to the Senate whether it is worth while to raise these questions as constitutional questions unless there is something substantial in them. </para>

                        <para>- I shall point out by-and-by that it cannot. I think it is a sound principle to adopt that the Senate ought not to be too ready or eager to find out, with a microscope almost, any little point which by an acute rendering of the -section might be deemed to be in some possible circumstances unconstitutional. I take it that we have to look at the real meaning of the objection which has been raised, and see whether there is really any thing substantial in it. It will be admitted that the Customs Tariff Billon the face of it deals with only taxation, and it contains a clause which is a very common one in Acts of Parliament, and which I venture to say has been passed here in Bills before. It is a rule of interpretation laid down for the judicial authority who has to interpret the measure, and it is nothing more. It is a rule of interpretation expressed on the face of the statute which in its absence would be applied almost to the same extent. It is a well-known rule of law that two statutes dealing with the same subject-matter must be read together, and if any light can be thrown <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> one statute f rom . another statute dealing with the same subject-matter the Judge will refer to that other statute. Necessarily, Acts of the same Parliament dealing with the same subject-matter are read together. All the clause does is to direct the attention of any judicial authority to the fact that that rule of interpretation must be applied to this measure in connexion with the machinery measure with which it is intended to work. </para>

                <para>SenatorO'CONNOR. - Certainly not, because the machinery measure would contain a different set of provisions from the taxing measure. What I am pointing out is that this clause does not enact the machinery provisions in any way. </para>

                        <para>- That does not mean physically incorporated, but it means read in connexion with. It means that the rule of interpretation which, without the clause, would be applied, will be specially applied, with that direction to the judicial authority. It cannot mean anything else. It would be impossible to say that, because the word incorporated is used, therefore some force will be given to an enactment in the Customs Act by reason of this Bill. The enactments of the Customs Act get no force from this Bill. Any force of enactment which the Customs Act has is self-derived. This clause is merely a direction that the two Acts are to be read and interpreted together, that one may throw light on the other, and it is necessary that that should be so. What is the purpose of the Customs Act <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is to collect the duties which are imposed by the Customs Tariff Act. </para>

                        <para>- But this clause does not introduce into the Customs Tariff Bill any section of the Customs Act any more than it could be introduced by a Judge in the interpretation, of it. It may be asked, whether, if the interpretation would be just the same, with or without the clause, there is any necessity for its insertion ? The necessity for its insertion is that it is an indication and a direction to the judicial authority identifying this Bill as one of the Acts to be administered in connexion with the other. I do not see any reason why the practice in the drawing of Acts of Parliament which has been followed in the States and in the Commonwealth should not be followed in this instance. The point has absolutely nothing of substance in it. This is not an enactment which effects substantially anything, lt carries the law no further than it would otherwise go, and it only serves the purpose of identifying this Bill as one of the Acts which are to be applied in the interpretation and working of the other Act. </para>

                        <para>- It has been the practice. It is true that at an early period of the session honorable senators expressed a desire that that practice should be altered, and the Standing Orders Committee have framed new standing orders in order to give effect to that desire. But we are carrying on business under the standing orders which are now in print, and in my opinion there is no doubt whatever that the reply of the mover concludes the debate. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator must not only read the particular words of any particular standing order, but he must read them with the context, and with the other standing orders. If Standing Order 131 be read with the other standing orders, it will be seen that it means that before the mover of a motion, replies, any honorable senator can speak. Perhaps I may be permitted to say that as President I looked into the question as to the Customs Act 1901 being "incorporated and read as one with this Act," and I came to the conclusion that there was no breach of the spirit of the section of the Constitution. That section was inserted to provide against a tack. This cannot be said to be a tack. Whether the word remains in or not, it does not seem to me to make the slightest difference, either in the matter of a Bill or anything else. It seemed to me to be such a trivial matter that I did not think it desirable to bring it up. </para>

                <para class="block">Last night some question was raised as to the suspension of the standing orders, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> and several other honorable senators, indicated that they would probably suggest the postponement of the third reading of this measure until the Customs Tariff Bill had been returned to the Senate, and was being dealt with finally. I presume that some honorable senators will again take up that attitude, and it is just as well that I should deal at once with the objection. I hope that the Senate will pass the third reading now, so that the measure may become law at the earliest possible moment. My reason is this : We know that some of the most important provisions of this measure deal with the sugar industry. One of those provisions, which is most important, and of immediate application, gives a right to a rebate of £2 per ton to the grower of sugar by white labour. It is provided in the Bill that the rebate shall take effect from the time that the excise begins. The excise is to be - </para>

                <para class="block">It is quite clear, therefore, that this part of the settlement of the sugar question in Queensland cannot come into immediate operation, so far as the grower of sugar by white labour is concerned, until after this Bill has been passed and regulations have been framed. The position is that the cutting of the cane began a little before July. It is now in full swing, large quantities of sugar grown by white labour are coming forward, and the growers are being told day after day that as soon as the Excise Bill has been passed they will have the right to their rebate, but not before </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. The constitutional practice enables the excise to be charged, as I have said, on the lines provided in this Bill, and that will be ratified subsequently when the Bill passes. But the rebate cannot be given except in accordance with certain regulations to be prescribed under the Bill. Even if it be assumed for a moment that the rebate is something which is deducted from the excise - which it is not - and that it can be allowed without passing an Act of Parliament, we cannot fix the amount of the rebate until the Bill has been passed, because it provides - </para>

                <para class="block">Therefore, even if it were possible to allow a rebate out of the duty - and it is not - the amount to be given in each case depends upon the saccharine strength of the cane which can be ascertained only when the regulations are being prescribed in this way. My right honorable friend the Minister for Trade and Customs - as all will believe <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> know him - has been endeavouring to find some way out of the difficulty, in order to be able to make payments at once in respect of the rebate, but he has not been able to do so. He has regulations ready to be issued, and everything arranged with regard to the allowances to be made on the cane in each district, but he cannot move a step further in authorization of the payment of this money until this Bill has been passed. As a preliminary to a statement of the interests involved, I would say that perhaps honorable senators will be aware that the condition of the industry, both in Queensland and in New South Wales, is very unfortunate owing to the drought. I am informed by the officers that in one district in Queensland which it was calculated from previous experience would produce this season something like 16,000 tons of cane is not likely to yield more than l,S0O tons. I refer to the Maryborough district. I understand that in portions of New South Wales where the drought has been severely felt cane has been cut for fodder ; but notwithstanding all allowances which have been made in that way, we estimate that there will be some 20,000 tons of cane grown by white labour in Queensland, and some 12,000 tons in New South Wales, so that practically the whole of the New South Wales cane will be entitled to the rebate. All that cane, which will produce something like 20,000 tons of sugar, is waiting for this rebate. The cane is coming in and the growers are waiting for their money. The total amount to be distributed in that way is something over £60,000. When we remember the condition of the sugar industry, and of the farmer, both in Queensland and New South Wales, we ought to hesitate in the interests of the whole Commonwealth before we delay making this measure an Act of Parliament instead of a mere proposal. Under the provisions of this measure a large amount of duty is being collected in excise from breweries, distilleries, and tobacco factories. The machinery of collection is continually going on, but at present without legal sanction, under the constitutional usage according to which we have been acting all through. It is a truth that cannot be gainsaid that we ought not to continue to act under that constitutional principle, and without legal sanction, any longer than is absolutely necessary. Therefore, in regard to all those industries and as to the collection of all this excise, unless there is some good reason for delay, this Bill ought to be made law. But there is another and a more important reason still. If there is one thing more than another which we hear from the whole commercial .community of the .Commonwealth, and which is over and .above the cry -of free-trade and protection, it is "Let us have a settlement of this Tariff question." What is wanted is certainty ; and when we can give certainty, we ought to do so in the interests of the whole Commonwealth, and that certainty ought not to be delayed simply for the purpose of holding this Bill as a lever, or <inline font-style="italic">im terrorem,</inline> over the other Chamber. I -do not accuse any honorable senator of wishing .to do that ; but there should be no such thing as appearing to use the .powers &lt;&gt;f this Senate to delay the payment of money to people who are entitled to it, and the settlement of the question for the benefit of the whole Commonwealth, merely for the purpose of holding in reserve .a weapon which may be used in conflict with the other House. This is one of the occasions on .which the consideration of the interests of the whole community should stand above any consideration of the success of one House over the other. What is the position in regard to this Excise Bill ? It has passed through .the ordeal of discussion in the Senate. Attempts have been made to amend it. Those attempts have failed. After the fullest discussion it has passed through committee without amendment. Is there any reason to suppose that the Senate desires to amend it? Is there any justification for suggesting that it should be. amended ? What does it deal with ? It deals -first of all with the excise on beer. An attempt was -made to alter the duty, but the motion was defeated b)' a large majority. In the Customs Tariff Bill a suggestion has been made to decrease the duty on beer, bottled and bulk. Can any 'honorable senator say that -the relation between .the Excise Tariff Bill and the Customs Tariff Bill is of such a nature that -whatever the decision may be in regard to beer, it will be necessary or desirable or expedient to alter the Excise Tariff Bill ? The next item, spirits, has not been touched. There are thousands of pounds being collected from spirits. As the duty has not been touched in the Customs Tariff Bill, it cannot be touched in the Excise Bill. Is it likely to be touched if we delay the passage of the measure? Coming to sugar, I have already given a strong reason why the excise rate should stand as it is. Dealing with tobacco, it will be remembered that attempts were </para>

                    <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem</inline>
                    rate to a specific rate of something like the same amount in the case of cigars and cigarettes. The suggestion involves a very -slight difference in .the rate. Under these -circumstances, is it likely that the tobacco duties will be affected under the Excise Tariff Bill, whatever may be the effect of the Senate's suggestion in regard to cigars and cigarettes ? When we look at the actual position of affairs I ask whether the Senate is really giving up any substantial right of dealing with the fiscal system, taken .as a whole, by sending this Bill down to the House of Representatives so that it may become law at once ? I therefore appeal - and I think I shall appeal successfully - to .the public spirit of the Senate, to pass this measure at once in order to ,give finality and settlement to all the commercial interests which are affected by it, and .especially to enable the measure of justice -which is promised to the growers of sugar by white labour to be meted out to them at the earliest possible moment.

                    <para>- I have listened with a great deal of attention to the remarks of the Vice-President of the Executive Council in objecting to the retention of the Excise Tariff Bill. I fully recognise the weighty arguments that he has adduced in connexion with the matter. But I desire, also, that honorable senators should bear in mind that there are rights and privileges pertaining to the Senate, and we ought to see that they .-are safe-guarded. We can readily understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> would like to get this Bill out of hand and done with. It is only natural that he should take up that attitude. But on the face of the Bill itself there are reasons why we should' hesitate. It has been shown to be necessary that a certain clause that has been taken exception to shall be read in conjunction with another Bill, .and that very fact shows that it is intended that the two Bills shall go hand in hand. When .the measure was originally introduced, it was shown by the way in which the two were taken together that they were intended to go hand-in-hand. Let me direct attention to the position that would have occurred if we had made even one amendment in the Excise Tariff Bill. If we had made only one . amendment, however small or trifling, that Bill would have been in exactly the same position as the Customs Tariff Bill, and would have had to go through the same procedure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> will reply, of 'Course, that no amendment has been made in this Bill. But we have made amendments in the Customs Tariff Bill affecting articles that' are dutiable at the Customs, and which, if manufactured in the country, are subject to excise. There is consequently a close relation between the two measures, and between the duties that are proposed. Take the item, beer. Under the Customs Tariff Bill we have reduced the duty on beer in one case to1s. 3d. a gallon, and in the other case to l0d. a gallon, as against the proposals of the Government, which were1s. 6d. and1s. We have passed the Excise Tariff Bill as it stood. There is a certain relative proportion between the reduced duty proposed in the Customs Tariff Bill and the duties proposed in the Excise Tariff Bill. Suppose for the sake of argument that the other Chamber were to say - "We think you have made a mistake in your request to reduce the duty on beer from ls.6d. to1s. 3d." The Senate would then have the right to say - " If we assent to your duties, we are going to lower the excise rates so as to maintain the same proportion as now exists between the duty on the colonial-made article and that on the imported article." We might say that there should bea difference of 3d. per gallon between the two. If the House of Representatives say - " We but ask you to make a greater difference between the excise and the customs duties,"will honorable senators contend that we should not have a right to reconsider the Excise Bill in the light of that proposal? The Senate in its own interest, and for the protection of its rights would be putting itself in an extraordinary position if it said - "We send back the Excise Tariff Bill as you sent it to us without alteration, but we have made certain suggestions for alterations in the Customs Tariff Bill, which we hope you will accept." If we took up that position we should have lost the opportunity of going in for give and take, or there would be less chance of effecting a suitable compromise than there would be if we withheld the Excise Tariff Bill until we got back the Customs Tariff Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Assuming that that answer is perfectly correct, why could not the Government say to the sugargrowers - " We cannot pay you this money to-day, but as soon as we get our Bill passed we shall be able to pay you that to which you are entitled." If this Government is going to be in a hurry to pay money that is due it will be the first example of a Government in Australia that has done so. The Government will require returns and all sorts of particulars before they pay the rebate. I venture to say that not a penny will be paid to the people who are entitled to it if this Bill is passed now, sooner than it will be paid if we wait until the Customs Tariff Bill is received back from the House of Representatives. Therefore, I say it is moonshine to speak to to us in this way. Another argument is that it is necessary that the regulations should be passed in order to fix the rebate, but the Bill itself provides that a rebate shall be granted under certain conditions, and that regulations are to be passed - what to do % Not to make any fresh legislation, but simply to carry into effect the legislation which has already been determined by Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- They are all prepared and ready, and they can be acted upon subject to their being confirmed at a later date. Otherwise the honorable and learned senator is simply trying to lead us into a trap, and the Government will be able to say - "Here is our Excise Tariff Bill, we have managed to get this through untouched. We have now got you in our hands, and we shall pass our regulations." It is just as fair to the Government as to honorable senators generally, that this measure should be allowed to stand over for a certain time. It is not a fair thing to propose that our rights, and we have rights in this matter, should be set aside in the way desired by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I say that honorable senators will not be true to themselves or to the Constitution under which they occupy seats in this Federal Parliament if they part with this Excise Tariff Bill under the present circumstances, and under the conditions indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline> I do protest against this being done. I say that if the suggestions we have made for alterations in the Customs duties are not agreed to by the other House, and if we are unable to come to an arrangement with regard to them, we may require to reconsider our position with regard to the excise duties. As a reasonable protection for ourselves, and the rights we are bound to vindicate and maintain if we are true to our principles and to the Constitution, I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> will not insist upon forcing the third reading of the Excise Tariff Bill through at the present time. I suggest that the debate should be adjourned until, say the 20th of August, when we shall re-assemble, and when we shall be able to see what position we are in with regard to the requests we have made to the House of Representatives. It may be that when these requests are considered, and the matter comes back from the other Chamber, the proposals made may be such as we shall be able to regard as a fair compromise between the two Houses. But if they are not, and this Bill is now passed, we shall have prejudiced our position. Honorable senators may say that the matter is not of much importance, but I remind them that in every act of legislation we are laying down the foundation of our powers, duties, and privileges in the future, and we should be careful that we do not whittle away any of them which may be of very great value to us later. If we are going to give away first one thing and then another, we shall find later on that we shall be unable to maintain the position to which we are entitled under the Constitution. We may say that legally we can do it, but we know that Members of Parliament, like every one else, regard precedent, and are prepared to construe Acts of Parliament in accordance with precedent. Having spoken to the motion, it is not competent for me to move the adjournment of the debate, but I hope that some other honorable senator will deem this matter of importance, and will move the adjournment of the debate for three weeks, so that we may have an opportunity of reconsidering the whole position. The delay involved can cause' no injury or harm to any body. I see no reason why the two Houses should not come to an agreement in connexion with the suggestions we have made, and the delay should not extend, at the outside, to more than three or four weeks, when the regulations could become law. </para>

                    <para>-I confess myself in a state of some uncertainty. I am uncertain whether the remarks just made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> indicate a new-born enthusiasm to make amendments in the Excise Tariff Bill, or display a too late repentance, because of amendments which the honorable and learned senator prevented his party from making. In any case, so far as I am personally concerned, I intend to support the Government in this matter. My efforts to make alterations in the Excise Tariff Bill have failed, and so far as I am concerned the fight is over, and I have not the slightest desire to have a single item reconsidered. This is to rae a satisfactory reason for supporting the Government in this instance, but there is another reason, and I am very glad to be in a position to mention it. It is at least a month ago since the leader of the Government in the Senate spoke to me personally upon this question, and in words almost similar to those which he has used this afternoon the honorable and learned senator pointed out to me the desirability of enabling the Government to pay this rebate. I not only privately told him that I agreed with what he said, but on the floor of this chamber I gave ray assurance that I would offer no opposition to the payment of this rebate at the earliest moment possible. However I may be bound by party considerations, I am, and shall always be, first of all bound by my word, and if I had no other reason for supporting the Government in this instance that would be ample for me. </para>

                    <para>- The excise duties are necessarily consequential upon the customs duties, and it appears to me that having dealt with them in that light and in that order, until we know the fate of our requests in connexion with the customs duties, it is desirable that we should not tie our hands absolutely in connexion with these consequential duties. For that reason, and without making any further remarks, I shall support the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> in favour of a postponement of the third reading of the Excise Bill until the matter of the customs duties has been adjusted with the other Chamber. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to point out to honorable senators who are anxious to hold this Excise Tariff Bill up as a whip, and who desire to have something up their sleeves, that they will have every power which any one could desire to deal with the Customs Tariff Bill. We have the power to reject the Bill, if the House of Representatives will not accept the suggestions sent down from this Chamber, and surely that is power enough. I am very anxious that this matter of the excise on sugar, and the rebate proposed, shall be settled as soon as possible in the interests of the planters in Queensland. They want to know what Parliament has decided to do with regard to those who employ white labour? We should set their minds at rest, and their minds will not be set at rest if this Excise Tariff Bill is held up. If it is hold up nobody knows what may happen. We have no reason to suppose that everything in connexion with the Customs Tariff Bill will be settled in three weeks' time. If this Bill is held up those matters may not be settled in three months' time or in six months' time. </para>

It appears that the sugar-growers in Queensland are beginning to produce a sugar crop with white labour, under circumstances which would entitle them to the rebate, if that rebate were completely authorized according to !a\v. The Minister for Trade and Customs finds it necessary now to prepare regulations to put the matter in such definite shape that the sugargrower producing sugar grown by white labour shall know exactly what his position is. It is thought, therefore, to be desirable, if possible, to have some indication of the view of the Senate before the regulations are completed. It is only in regard to that particular question that any difficulty has arisen. I have not yet determined what course will be taken, but I shall probably intimate it to the Senate to-morrow.

                <para class="block">There is the whole matter in a nutshell. The honorable senator desired to know whether there would be any difficulty raised on the subject of the rebate. He has had assurance upon the subject a thousand fold. And I apprehend there is no necessity arising from the mere matter of this rebate on sugar for the passing of the third reading of this Bill this afternoon. I have no hesitation in saying that it is desired now to pass the third reading of this Bill in order to weaken the position of the Senate in regard to the arrangement of the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid I find myself differing from my honorable and' learned friend. I do not wish to make any charges-, but I think it might very fairly be argued that it is to some extent a breach of faith to take this Bill out of the Senate at the present moment. The Tariff Bills hang together. Before we can decide what duties ought to be imposed in one Bill, we have to look at the duties imposed in the other, and every item in one Bill has a corresponding item in the other. I can quite understand that there may be reasons why in the interest of another place the Excise Tariff Bill should remain on our table. I can quite understand that some honorable members in another place may say - " We object to the increase of duty which the Senate suggests, but if they had increased the excise duty we should not have minded it so much." Supposing two or three honorable members in another place do take that view, why should the hands of the Senate be tied ? Why should the area for compromise on these items be decreased? I anticipate that the members of each House will do their duty, and that there will be no trouble if we are reasonable in settling up everything. If the two Bills are in the Senate, we shall be more likely to arrive at a settlement. We shall be able to act more elastically than can be' done if this Bill is allowed to go back. It is quite within the bounds of probability that honorable members in another place may say - " We object to the suggested increase in the customs duty, but we should not have minded so much if it had' been accompanied with a suggestion to increase the excise duty." </para>

If he says that a right we have is a. weapon, let us retain it in our hands: What are we here for ? We are here to practice constitutional government, and to enforce all the rights and powers of. the Senate in a reasonable manner, and it does not at all follow that we are unreasonable if we refuse to send back this' Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> desires to see the Queensland planters paid at once. So far as I understand the matter, consistently the rebate cannot be paid until both Bills are assented to. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot see how the Treasurer can permit the money to be paid, because the three measures embody the liberal terms which we have been compelled to give to the planters. And when my honorable and learned friend says that the money can be paid before the duty on sugar is fixed, I would point out that' this Bill may never' come back to the Senate, and that there may be formed a new Government who will bring down a Bill with totally different provisions in relation to the sugar-industry. If these arguments can begot over, I shall. vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> ; but until they are; it is my duty on behalf of Tasmania, to vote as I am going to do. </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that the difference between the excise duty and. the customs duty is the measure of protection which will be given to particular industries. That being so, there must be a starting point somewhere; and so far as the measure of protection is concerned, it does not really matter which Bil is first passed. The Senate might just as well have declined to consider the Customs Tariff Bill until it knew finally what shape the other was to take, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versd.</inline> , As regards the attitude which has been taken up by many honorable senators to-day, let me point out that if the other House declines to accept our suggestions relating to the Customs Tariff Bill, and the Senate is not strong enough to insist on those suggestions being carried out, it will not be strong enough to insist on alterations being made in the Excise Tariff Bill. The position for the Senate to take up is to stand to its suggestions. The' two Bills as they stand here represent' the Tariff- as it has been approved of' by the Senate. An alteration can only take place by the rejection of our suggestions in regard to the Customs Tariff Bill' by the other House. Let us stand to our suggestions. We have that measure of difference between tho two Bills of which the Senate has approved. Something has been said about the possibility of trouble with the other House. Speaking as a party man, the passing of this motion is absolutely the best thing we can do, although I am not supporting it on that ground. If the Excise Tariff Bill is passed into law, and there is any trouble about the Customs Tariff Bill, how are the Government to pay the rebates <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> A most awkward position will confront them. From a party point of view, it  will be an excellent idea to pass the Excise Tariff Bill at once. I need hardly say that I hope that there will be no trouble between the Houses, but, so far as the Customs Tariff Bill is concerned, if we do adjust the differences between the Houses in an amicable way, there can be no objection to the . Excise Tariff Bill going through. If there is going to bc any crisis between the two Houses, there will be quite enough trouble in dealing with the question which will then arise to keep us both busy without troubling about the Excise Tariff Bill. </para>
