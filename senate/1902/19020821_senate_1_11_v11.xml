                    <para>- Before the Postmaster-General makes the statement which has been suggested, I should like to draw the attention of the committee to the very unsatisfactory way in which Bills returned from the House of Representatives are presented to us. I have not received a copy of the Bill with the amendments printed in it. Copies have been handed to us just now, but this is a very late stage at which to be favoured with this information, and it has not been the practice of the Senate hitherto to have Bills presented in this form. It is the most convenient form in which we can be asked to consider amendments. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know whether I should be in order in speaking upon the amendments generally. What I had proposed to do was to postpone amendments 1 to3 - that is to say, all the amendments made in the preliminary part of the Bill. It will depend on what is done by the committee afterwards whether it will be necessary to agree to those amendments or otherwise. The postponement of the first three amendments would save time. I have no objection to making a short statement if it will not lead to a long debate upon the amendments generally. Strictly speaking, however, I think it would not be in order to do so, and that we should address ourselves only to the particular amendment before the committee. </para>

                    <para>- The Postmaster-General has given a very excellent reason why we should have a general statement from him in regard to the amendments made by another place. He has told us that some of them deal with important questions of principle. There can be no question that a number of them are of very great importance, and it would assist the work of the committee if the Postmaster-General would indicate the course of action which the Government propose to take and their reasons for doing so. No lengthy debate is necessary at this stage on the unimportant amendments, but there are a number of important ones. For example, in regard to the way in which petitions against the return of honorable members are to be dealt with, the line of action proposed <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> the House of Representatives is entirely dissimilar from that taken by us. There is another most important proposal in regard to the electoral provisions. </para>

                        <para>- I think that is an amendment of very considerable importance, and I should like to hear from the Postmaster-General the reason why it is necessary to allow a divisional officer to take any action outside his division.

                    <para>- I do not think the amendment can be regarded as unimportant. It would be interesting to learn from the Postmaster-General how 90 electors - or any number less than 100 - living at any place for which it is proposed that no assistant returning officer shall be appointed are to record their votes. In many divisions there are places in which there are less than 100 electors, and if assistant returning officers are not to be appointed for these places, the electors will either have to vote by post or travel some considerable distance in order to reach a polling place. I do not wish to see a district with, perhaps, 90 electors disfranchised. </para>

                    (New South Wales).The Postmaster-General's explanation makes it apparent that the amendment has merely been introduced by those who are not prepared to trust the administrators of the measure in a simple act of this kind. The Bill leaves those charged with its administration free to appoint such officers as may be deemed necessary, but the House of Representatives practically says by this amendment : " While we are prepared to allow the administrators to have that power, we are not prepared to trust them to say where an assistant returning officer shall or shall not be appointed." The amendment may be harmless, but it is a very serious reflection upon those who will have to administer the Act. I shall not take action to strike out the amendment, but I should prefer to see the Bill passed without it, because I am prepared to believe that those who will have to administer the law, will have sufficient common sense and integrity to enable them to appoint only those who may be necessary.

                    <para>- At first I was rather inclined to oppose this amendment, but upon consideration I think it is really an improvement upon the old State law. I refer particularly to the law in Queensland which provides for a returning officer for every electoral district, whose duty it is to look after the rolls during the year, and at election time to appoint presiding officers to take a poll at various localities. A presiding officer is appointed by the returning officer to take the poll at each polling place proclaimed. He makes a count of the votes polled at his polling place, and sends a return by wire, or some other means, to the returning officer for the electorate. A number of us contended for some years in that State that, under that system, the secrecy of the ballot was practically destroyed, and that there should be no count made except that by the returning officer. It should be remembered that many polling places are appointed at stations, and the manager of the station is often the presiding officer. There may be only from half-a-dozen to ten voters at the place, each of whom would be known to the presiding officer, and, if he takes the trouble, there is no doubt that he will be able to discover how each elector has voted. </para>

                        <para>- No, it would not. I do not believe in any sectional count, or in any count of votes but that by the returning officer. I think the Bill should be amended in such a way as to provide that the whole of the ballot-boxes shall be returned to the central polling place, and the count of the election carried out there by the returning officer and his officials. It has been contended in Queensland that such a system as that would lead to a great deal of delay ; but I do not think that the delay involved would be any greater than that which takes place under the present system. </para>

In order to prevent that delay, we provided in this clause for the appointment of a certain number of assistant returning officers, who would be able to make separate counts in the different districts. This amendment is proposed in order to prevent the appointment of assistant returning officers having the bad results which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> has foreseen. On that account a limit is prescribed, and it is proposed that an assistant returning officer shall not be appointed for any place in which there are less than 100 electors. </para>

                    <para>- I am still of the opinion that the amendment made by the House of Representatives is not a desirable one. If honorable senators will read the clause as we passed it they will see, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has already pointed out, that every provision is made for the appointment of assistant returning officers, and this amendment introduces only an arbitrary limitation. No honorable senator can say that it is desirable that an assistant returning officer should not be appointed at a place at which there are 90 electors, and that one should be appointed at a place where there are 101 electors. We left it to the returning officers to make such appointments of assistant returning officers as they' deemed necessary. It might for many reasons be extremely desirable that an assistant returning officer should be appointed for a place where there are only 90 voters, and it might not be so desirable that one should be appointed at a place where there are 120 voters. The mere number of voters at a particular polling place is no criterion of the advisability of appointing an assistant returning officer. </para>

                    <para>- I object to the limitation proposed by this amendment, because I see a practical difficulty in the way of it. Under this amendment, there would probably not be <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> single assistant returning officer appointed in the whole of the north-west of Western Australia, because the population is limited, and is scattered over an enormous area, and there would scarcely be one locality in which 100 electors could be got together. The consequence of that would be that there would be no separate count of votes in the whole of that district, and the ballot-boxes for all the polling places would have to be carried down to Coolgardie. I know that in the case of the last Senate' elections, we had to wait for nearly six weeks to get the returns from East Kimberley. If the whole of the ballot boxes from polling places in the north-west of Western Australia had to be carried to Coolgardie, the expense to the Commonwealth would be enormous, because there will necessarily be a large number of polling places scattered over a vast area, and the boxes would have to be carried by camels and other means, involving very considerable delay. Under these cir circumstances, an election in Western Australia would require to be held two or three months before the date upon which the return of the candidate was desired. I submit that this is a matter which should be left to the discretion of the chief returning officer. If we except Geraldton, Peaks Hill, Kew, and one or two mining centres north of Perth, in Western Australia- o </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that in the districts to which I refer there would be from 5,000 to 10,000 electors scattered over an enormous area, equal to about one-third of Australia. Is there to be no assistant returning officer for the whole of that area, and are people to be obliged to come in with ballot-boxes from every polling place proclaimed within it? I may tell honorable senators that ballot-boxes have disappeared in Western Australian elections from these back-blocks places, and have never been found to this day. That is a difficulty which would be infinitely exaggerated by the adoption of an amendment of this kind. The ballot-boxes would be sealed up, there would be no record of the votes they contain, they would be carried about the country under disadvantageous circumstances for weeks and weeks, and if one happened to be lost the whole election might be invalidated. All these are reasons why we should place this discretion in the hands of the chief returning officer, who will be a person competent to exercise it wisely. </para>

                    <para>- The most perfect system undoubtedly is that under which only one count is made, and that by the chief returning officer for a division. We have adopted that system in South Australia. We have experienced the difficulty which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> has referred to as existing in Western Australia. We have in one division, for in- stance, from Fowler's Bay to Port Lincoln, the centre of the district, a long stretch of 400 or 500 miles, over, which a ballot-box has to be taken before the result of the election can be made known ; but we have, so far, thought it better to put up with the inconvenience than to make any alteration. Now, in this clause, we proposed to meet that inconvenience by allowing a special count by an assisting returning officer in the outside parts of a district, from which it would take a considerable length of time to get a ballot-box brought iri to the- chief returning officer ; but the House of Representatives has introduced a provision which is the height of absurdity. They have proposed that an assistant returning officer shall not be appointed at any place at ' which there are less than 100 voters ; but the very places in ' which we require a separate count to be made are those where there are the fewest voters. It would be far better to adhere to the clause as we passed it, and to leave it to the returning officer to appoint a deputy wherever he thinks such an appointment absolutely necessary. </para>

                    15231 one count for an election, and that that should be made by the principal returning officer for a district, as has been the practice in South Australia. I do not think that is necessarily an advantageous practice. I will say that the evils we are led to believe would flow from the clause as it left this Chamber are not evils which honorable senators from Tasmania will be likely to anticipate. We cannot, therefore, be said to be speaking in a State-interested fashion. The various centres in Tasmania, which is more densely populated for its size than any of the other States, are in closer communication with the remoter parts of the electorates than is the case in any of the other States. It seems to me that with a system under which the votes recorded at every polling place are counted, and a return transmitted by telegraph, or the quickest means available, to the chief returning officer of the district, and subsequently the papers are sent in and counted in the general count of the division, we have one great advantage which

                        <para>- Of course the boxes are sealed, but the chance of tampering with the ballot-papers is increased if the boxes may be kept until the first available opportunity for sending them on to the returning officer. On the other hand, if there be power to open the boxes and count the votes, sending the result on by wire, and the papers are subsequently forwarded, there are two counts, each of which is a check upon the other. Under such circumstances the opportunity for violating the secrecy of the ballot is at any rate not intensified. The practice in South Australia has been to send the boxes to the principal centre, and there count the votes, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> has pointed out that in Western Australia many parts of an electorate may be far distant from the chief centre. It is not merely the matter of distance which has to be considered, but also the means of communication. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said that the system which has given most general satisfaction is that of one main count, and one count only. No doubt that is a system eminently applicable to a small country with a large number of very populous centres and good means of communication ; but in Australia we have a large territory. It is only in later years that Western Australia has been developed, and that State is now being further developed day by day, and many of the polling places are far distant from the chief centres, where the divisional returning officer is located. A clause of this character is not wanted in the case of a small State like Tasmania, where the centres are in close touch, and the evils spoken of by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> will not be so evident as in a larger country. But we have to take into consideration the desirableness of as early as possible giving the result of the voting, always bearing in mind the possibility that those intrusted with responsible functions may tamper with the ballot-papers or otherwise misconduct themselves. In my opinion the amendment will only intensify the possibility of those evils. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> says, it is the small, remote centres which should be considered, and the arrangements of the polling places may very wisely be left to those charged with the administration of the Act. Under the Tasmanian Electoral Act there is power for the Governor in Council to appoint, almost up to the last moment, polling places within an electorate, if movements of population demand such a' step. That discretion has been exercised in the past with due regard to the requirements of the people generally, and surely the appointment of assistant returning officers where they are required may be similarly carried out. I do not think that the number of electors in any particular locality should be the only consideration. Regard should also be had to the means of communication with the main centre, and to the physical features and boundaries of the division itself. More particularly should attention be paid to the means of communication by road, rail, telegraph, or otherwise; and I earnestly hope that the Senate will insist on the principle that those charged with the administration of the Act shall be given discretion to fix polling places at which returning officers may be appointed. To allow such discretion is better than to fix any arbitrary rule which depends on the number of electors. </para>

                    <para>- I intend to support the amendment of the House of Representatives. I have listened with very great interest to the speeches delivered by Senators Playford and Keating, but it appears to me that they altogether failed to apprehend the reasons of the House of Representatives for making the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> especially, argued all round the subject, but never once touched the kernel. We are all, I suppose, exceedingly anxious that every elector in the Commonwealth shall have the fullest opportunity of recording his vote, and that as many polling places as possible shall be fixed. But something more is wanted than the mere opportunity of recording a vote. There must be opportunity to vote without intimidation or fear on the part of the elector that he may lose his billet. </para>

                        <para>- I wish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> would listen while I give him a little straight talk. If the squatters of Australia had not the blood of tyrants in their veins there would be no necessity for placing a provision of this character in the Bill. It is disgraceful that we should be compelled in this way to defend unfortunate men who are compelled to earn their living in the employment of the squatters. We know perfectly well what happened in Queensland at the last election. If there be a dozen men on a station the political opinions of every one are known, and the word goes round before the election day - " If you do not vote for the Government candidate you will not be required on this station after the polling." </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> contended that the appointment of the assistant returning officers, or rather the formation of divisions in outlying places, would lead to a great deal of unnecessary delay and expense. We have found that in the outlying portions of Queensland a deal of intimidation is resorted to, because the managers of stations know, or think they know, how each individual elector votes. If there are twelve men on a station, and eight vote for the Government candidate, and four vote for the Opposition candidate, the four are often quite well known. But if there are eight ballot-boxes coming in with twelve votes in each, and the ballot papers in these boxes are dumped down together, I defy any one to say which votes were recorded at any particular polling booth. We want to do away with intimidation, and to promote the purity of elections ; and I am satisfied that the proposed addition to the clause will help to purify our electoral system. </para>

                        <para>- The proposed amendment simply means this : At a number of places where there are only a few electors the ballot-box will be sent by the presiding officer to the nearest assistant returning officer, or to the principal returning officer. I think there are few districts in Australia where there would not be at least 100 electors enrolled. At every place where there- are 100 electors there may be, under this amendment, an assistant returning officer, and the votes at the other small places will be sent to a centre where there is an assistant returning officer. </para>

                        <para>- It may be so, and it is very undesirable that in those places there should be an assistant returning officer, and a separate count. What is proposed is that the practice of appointing an assistant returning officer for every little place where there are half-a-dozen electors shall be discontinued. In some places this practice' has been adopted to such an extent that an assistant returning officer has often been appointed where there has been only a score of voters. The disadvantage to the elector is considered to be that in a small place where every voter is known, and where, very likely, his predilections are known, an assistant returning officer will have an opportunity of guessing how a particular man has voted. At all events, there is a feeling in the minds of some electors that in certain cases there are means by which the way a vote has been recorded can be known. That is one objection to the undue multiplication of assistant returning officers. </para>

                    (Queensland).- The speech of the Postmaster-General has made it clearer to me that it is absolutely necessary if we desire to promote the purity of elections, and to free electors from, the fear of intimidation, that this amendment should be agreed to. If the matter is left to the discretion of the divisional returning officer, he will be troubled about getting the election result known at the earliest possible moment, and will appoint an assistant returning officer at every little outlying polling booth. That is the very thing we want to guard against. Iri some places each man's political opinions are known, and very often if he votes against the candidate whom the " boss " supports he finds himself out of a billet. I know we cannot do away with that absolutely, but we want to minimize it as much as possible, and by supporting the amendment we shall minimize it to some- extent. I agree with
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline>
                    that a provision of this character is not necessary where the population is fairly dense. Where a thousand men are recording their votes at one polling booth, it is absolutely impossible to . say how any particular man votes, and to visit him with punishment for voting against the wishes of his employer. We give people votes, and we ought to secure that they shall exercise the franchise with as little danger to themselves as possible.

                    <para>-I must confess that I am in a difficulty in regard to this amendment, as there is so much to be said on both sides. I agree that every effort should be made to safeguard the secrecy of the ballot, more particularly in scattered and remote localities such as stations and small sugar farming districts, where the electors have suffered materially in this respect. I have known a district on the very coast of Queensland to be cut up for electoral purposes in such a way as to render it necessary for the labour candidate to send a number of voters from Cairns, to vote at one particular booth, in order to protect local residents who supported him. But while we are making efforts to safeguard the secrecy of the ballot, I think we should be careful that we do not provide something which will be more injurious in its consequences to people residing in scattered districts than is the present system. Those administering the Bill might take advantage of this provision and fail to provide polling places for districts with less than 100 electors. </para>

                        <para>- Because we had a painful experience of that kind in Queensland, at a time when the honorable and learned senator was a member of the State Parliament. Surely the Minister will recollect the occasion when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> McDonald - now a member of the House of Representatives - was the labour candidate for the representation of Cloncurry in the State Parliament, and asked that a polling place should be provided on the Leichardt, the nearest polling place being 95 miles distant. There were some 40 or 50 miners working there. It was fairly well known to the Government of the day that they would vote for the labour candidate, and they point blank refused to provide a polling place. But be it said to the credit of the men, <inline font-style="italic">they</inline> were so public spirited that they ran the risk of losing their claims and rode 95 miles into Cloncurry in order to record their votes. We have no right to call upon the electors to make such sacrifices. </para>

                    <para>- This amendment involves rather an important question. If it has been made only on the score of economy, I am afraid it may prove to be false economy. In dividing a State into electorates, the commissioner has to consider community or diversity of interest, means of communication, physical features, and existing boundaries of divisions, so that there are many matters which require his attention. In one of the adjoining States this work has always been done by three gentlemen, and I should like to hear some reasons other than those which the Postmaster-General has advanced in favour of the alteration. As the amendment relates primarily to another place, I do not feel that I should make a stand against what the House of Representatives desires to be done. Of course, whatever may be done in regard to the distribution will have to be submitted either for the approval of both Houses, or as suggested by the House of Representatives, of one House. </para>

                    <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> might be given many excellent reasons in favour of the amendment. In addition to the ground of economy, it is desirable that the amendment should be made because it provides an infinitely fairer way of carrying out the work. The Bill as it left this Chamber provided that two commissioners should form a quorum, and that when there were only two in attendance the chairman should have a casting vote. It was pointed out at the time that that was an absurd anomaly - that when there were only two present the chairman would be the absolute master of the situation, and that the other man would be like a fifth wheel to a coach. The clause was simply absurd as it left us, but we could not secure an alteration of it. I think that all the amendments in clauses 13 and 14 are most desirable. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment made in this clause is one about which there has been considerable difference of opinion. What I have to say upon it will apply equally to the amendments proposed in clauses 23 and 24. The question raised is whether the report and proclamation of divisions shall be submitted to the House of Representatives, the House more immediately concerned in the divisions, or whether they shall be laid before both Houses. </para>

                        <para>- I see that one honorable senator is prepared to express an opinion already. From an electoral point of view, this is a matter relating solely to the House of Representatives. Of course I am not going to take up the position that it is not the duty of both Houses of the Federal Parliament to carefully scrutinize all legislation that affects either of them. But I think that in elec- . toral matters the business of each particular House should be left more particularly within its own purview. I think the principle has obtained in all countries having a bicameral system of legislation, that in electoral matters one House will not unduly or unnecessarily interfere with the affairs of the other. We do not give up our right to deal with legislation because we are asked here to assent to these amendments ; we take our part in this legislation, and before the Bill can become law it must be agreed to by the Senate. But the question is whether a matter like the division of a State into electorates, solely for the purpose of the election of members to the House of Representatives, is not one which belongs more particularly to that House. The position taken up is that the House of Representatives should have control of all matters connected with the election of its own members. From that point of view it seems to me that the dividing of a State into divisions for the election of members of the House of Representatives is primarily and almost exclusively a matter belonging to that House. Of course there are other questions which will crop up by-and-by, and which I have no doubt honorable senators have in their minds. But I think that in connexion with these proposed amendments we might recognise that they deal with a matter which may be left entirely to the House of Representatives. I therefore move - </para>

                        (Tasmania).- If this were a question dealing only with the form of electoral machinery affecting the other House, I should say at once that we should accept their wishes and decision, but I put it to honorable senators that this is rather a question of the franchise. It is certainly a matter which affects the House of Representatives, but it is not merely a matter of electoral machinery. It is a question as to the electors who shall elect each representative of the other House, and not a question as to the method in which they shall record their votes. That is where I draw a clear distinction. I say that in matters relating solely to the machinery of elections we should, out of mere courtesy, if for no other reason, leave members of the other House to settle their own affairs. But we are here dealing with a question of franchise, and Parliament, and not one House, should decide it. Under the circumstances I think the Senate would not be justified in abandoning its position. I can quite understand that there are occasions on which we ought to extend courtesy to the other House, but this is not such an occasion. ' I am sorry to disagree with the House of Representatives, but for constitutional and other reasons we are bound to maintain our position.

                    <para>- I think we ought to oppose the amendment. Sp far as I can understand there are two positions : either we must hand over the making of these divisions entirely to a commissioner, beyond the interference of any portion of Parliament, or it should be subject to the control of the whole of Parliament. According to the amendment of the House of Representatives the divisions are made by a commissioner, whose report is laid on the table of the one House in which the States are not adequately represented - a House in which the division of the whole of the electorates can be controlled by two States of the union. The House of Representatives has power to disagree with the commissioner's report, and refer it back to him for further investigation, pointing out to him what are considered to be errors. But we find, further, that clause 24 directs the commissioner to comply with the instructions of the House of Representatives, so that we are not even in half as good a position as that in which we were placed under the Bill originally. Although an attempt was previously made to leave this matter in the hands of the House of Representatives, and not in the hands of the Senate, a discretion was vested in the commissioner. Now, however, by clause 24 that discretion is vested entirely in the House of Representatives. Western Australia or Tasmania might, under the amendment, be divided for political purposes in accordance with the desire of the majority of members who have come from the States of New South Wales and Victoria. I do not for one moment say that is likely to be done, but it was to prevent any such possibility that the States were given equal representation in the Senate. The senators for the smaller States are expected to safeguard the interests of all the State-0, and one inducement held out to the people of Western Australia and Tasmania to enter federation was that they could not be dominated by the larger States. That being so, the representatives of the smaller States would be failing in their duty if they handed themselves over to the tender mercies of the representatives of the larger States. The basis, so far as numbers are concerned, might be varied to a very material extent ; and, therefore, the representatives of the smaller States should see that the protection, of which they were assured, is preserved. The amendment of the House of Representatives will take away from the smaller States a constitutional power, which not only in this, but in other instances, is regarded as the very basis of their protection, and it is our duty to see that no injustice is done. So long as I remain here I shall give up none of that protection. The powers possessed by the smaller States are absolutely necessary to-day, and will be necessary in the future. I am ready to say, however, as a member of the Senate, that I should be very slow indeed to interfere with the electoral divisions for the House of Representatives. Such interference could be justified only by a glaring injustice or manifestly improper conduct; but that is a vastly different thing to giving up the right to protect the interests of the States when necessity arises. </para>

Parliament, consisting of the House of Representatives and the Senate, have it in their power to prescribe the method of choosing senators, and I should not be at all surprised if, later on, a Bill were introduced into the House of Representatives with the object of cutting up the States into divisions for Senate elections. I cannot understand what prompted members in another place to attempt to restrict the powers of the Senate in this direction.

Nor do I object to the House of Representatives taking the commissioner's report into consideration, and approving of it or recommending certain alterations ; but, as in the State Legislatures, m division of electorates should have any effect until an Act has been passed by both Houses. There is no objection to the machinery provided for ascertaining the best form of divisions for the election of members to the House of Representatives, but I object to one House, by mere resolution, having the power to redistribute districts. There is no precedent for such a power in any British possession under responsible government. </para>

                    <para>- Amendment No. 24 is of a different character ; therefore it is not consequential. The House of Representatives has inserted at the end of the clause the words " in accordance with the requirements of any such resolution." It seems to me to be reasonable that when a House of Parliament has passed a resolution in favour of a fresh distribution, the commissioner should make his arrangements in accordance with such resolution. </para>

                    <para>- I am sorry that I cannot support the proposed amendment. If honorable senators will turn to that part of the Bill regulating elections they will find that it is possible for nearly two months to elapse between the issue of the writ and the polling day. Many things may happen during that period, lt has often been found in Queensland that a number of electors were compelled to go down the bay from Rockhampton discharging cargo on polling day. Perhaps they did not get very long notice that they would be required on that day. Under this provision those men would have to choose either to lose a da}''s work or to lose their vote. Under the Queensland law, which is certainly not the most perfect in the world, it was possible to appoint a ship a polling place. That has been done on various occasions. Then men were not inconvenienced by being called upon to work on the day of the election. But this provision will disfranchise a large number of persons. I see no necessity why that should be the case. No injury can be done by the appointment of a particular place as a polling place within a few days of the election. </para>

                        <para>- I have been in politics for six years, and have had a great deal of experience as to the difficulty of getting new polling places appointed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> must not only consider the State from which he comes. New South Wales is a State in which there is very little movement on the part of the population. It is a settled State. The people have their several occupations, and do not shift about to any large extent. But in Western Australia the conditions are entirely different. There we have a very large population that is not fixed to any given spot. Nearly every man amongst that population may be entitled to vote. When there is ho election in view, nobody bothers much about polling booths and their situation. It is no one's business, and no one asks the electoral officials to appoint a polling place at a certain spot. But directly an election is announced and the writs are out, and people find that they cannot vote where they are living, there is an application for polling booths. Under this clause, as amended, even though the Government might be willing to give a number of electors facilities for voting they would be unable to do so. This is a matter which we could safely leave to the returning officer as it stood in the Bill originally. That officer should exercise his own judgment. I do not see that any inconvenience would arise to anyone if that were done. Every candidate is as anxious to give facilities for voting as the voters are desirous of obtaining them, because he thinks that the greater the facilities for voting, the greater chances he has of their voting for him. Candidates always assist as much as they can to obtain polling places. They think it makes them popular. It is very desirable that every elector should have every facility for voting, and in a State where the population moves about, as if does to a large extent in Western Australia and Queensland, it is most undesirable that the power to appoint new polling places should be limited. Another matter I would point out is that the proviso in clause 28 should really follow clause 26: </para>

                    <para>- T cannot understand what object is to be gained by adding the proposed proviso to clause 26. Surely if the matter were left to the discretion of the Governor-General in Council, no new polling place would be provided unless it was absolutely necessary. I know of cases where a great injustice might be don to a number of electors under this provision. Some weeks may elapse between the issue of a writ and the time appointed for its return. Imagine a case where a big contract is being carried out, and where a number of men are suddenly taken to work upon harbor works or railway works. </para>

                        <para>- Under the Bill, an elector may vote at any polling place in .his division, or he may vote by post. That being so, we think no ill-effect is likely to result from limiting the time during which a fresh polling place may be appointed. I admit the force of a great .deal of what has been said as to the needs of a shifting population, but I can see that it would be a positive evil to leave it open to an Executive to appoint fresh polling places right p to the day of election. Pressure would e brought to bear by candidates, and it would be thought that an invidious distinction was being made if the Executive said - " We will appoint a polling place here, but not there." We think it better that the time for the appointing of polling places should be strictly limited to the date of the issue of the writ. That would be fair to all parties, and do no injury to the electors. </para>

                        <para>- It would be impossible for us to vote on such a proposal, as we are divided on the question of whether or not any .polling booth should be closed after the issue of the writ. We merely wish to strike out the word "appointed," so as to substitute the word " closed." If a motion to that effect is submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> we shall be able to test the question of whether clause 26 is the best place in which to make this amendment, and whether we should make any provision to limit the appointing of polling places. In common with a number of other honorable senators, I am in favour of allowing polling places to be appointed after the issue of the writ. At the same time we contend that the provision declaring that no polling place shall be closed after the issue of the writ should be inserted in clause 26, and not in clause 28. </para>

I do not think it is desirable that polling places should be closed after the issue of the writ, but I can conceive a position in which it would be very desirable to create fresh polling places after the issue of the writ. The first intimation which the public receive as to the polling places is given by the issue of the proclamation. </para>

In the old centres of population there were numerous polling places, but in newly settled districts the Government carefully omitted to provide them. The issue of the proclamation was the first intimation that I received of this. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the committee will not agree to this amendment, because it is a very unfair proposal, and is calculated to do a great deal of harm. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> statements about the sitting member having an undue advantage in being able to keep secret, up to the eleventh hour, any movement for the appointment of a polling booth does not apply, because even if a polling booth is appointed at the eleventh hour on a station, surely the whole of the hands employed there will know of it before they are called upon to exercise the franchise? The extreme danger is that the writ for an election and the proclamation appointing the polling places are issued on the same day. In the selection of polling places the old polling places are considered, as well as the recommendations of the returning officer for the creation of any fresh polling place, or the closing of any old polling place. </para>

Many of us have had occasion to bring up the question of the partiality of returning officers in the State Parliaments, and I have a recollection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> taking a part in the debates upon such occasions. The honorable and learned senator has severely condemned the partiality of some returning officers in the course of his political career. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the honorable and learned senator assisted myself in connexion with a Charters Towers case ; he assisted the present leader of the labour party in Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Browne,</inline> in connexion with a Croydon case, and the present member for Kennedy in the House of Representatives in connexion with the case to whichl have previously referred. A strong conservative like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would probably under all circumstances be prepared to trust the Government, though I would not do so. We have to consider that even the most honest Minister administering the Electoral Act will be dependent upon the old polling places recorded in the office, and the recommendations of the returning officer. It does not always follow that the returning officer for one election will be the returning officer for the next. It must be remembered that this does not apply only to scattered districts, but to the larger electorates and big centres of population. I know of a case of this kind : The centre of an electorate containing a large number of voters was, of course, appointed a polling place, and another place only 3 miles distant from the centre was also appointed a polling place, and it was found to work very well. When the writ for a new election came out, the place 3 miles distant from the centre was not appointed a polling place, though there were 500-odd electors at that particular place. It is easy to say that they could go the 3 miles to the main polling booth and record their votes there, but when it is considered that they had to work from eight o'clock in the morning till five o'clock in the evening before they were given an opportunity of recording their votes, it will be seen that they could not be expected to go that distance to record them. In addition to that, an extra 500 voters coming to the central polling booth would cause such a rush that they could not all record their votes in the stipulated time. In the centering of a large number of votes in a few places, the time within which the votes have to be recorded is another element which requires to be taken into consideration, and in large centres of population it may be necessary to have three or four polling places instead of one central polling place in order to facilitate the recording of votes. If we lay down a hard-and-fast rule, such as is here proposed, it will not matter what new facts come to light for the guidance of those in authority : the Act will expressly provide that no alteration to meet them can be made. It is possible that facts may be brought before the notice of the authorities which would cause them to appoint additional polling places if they were known before the issue of the writ and the proclamation of the polling places, but no discretion is allowed under this proposal. In addition to the power of the authorities to proclaim any polling booth after the issue of the writ, I should like it to be provided that, even if the returning officer or the candidates contesting the election do not recommend the creation of 'a fresh polling place, a petition from a certain number of electors should be considered sufficient to secure the proclamation of a fresh polling place. In the conduct of elections the aim and object of the authorities should be to suit the convenience of the voters and the candidates. I do not say here that I do not care anything at all about the candidates. I think they should be considered as well as the electors, and the object should be to give such facilities for the recording of votes as will suit the convenience of electors and candidates. </para>

The Minister in charge of this Bill must know that that has been found to be a most valuable provision in Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- Voting by post can only be done at a post-office, and electors may in many cases be 20 miles from a post-office. One of the difficulties connected with our legislation here is due to a want of experience in some quarters of the back-blocks of the different States. Fortunately for me, I have travelled a good deal in the back-blocks, and I have represented a place 1,300 miles from the seat of Government, where electors would in many places have to go 20 or more miles .before they could get to a post-office. Honorable senators, of course, speak from a knowledge they have of their own States, and the facilities there afforded to electors to record their votes. I am sorry to say that in many instances adequate facilities were not afforded to the electors of Queensland. We have cases of townships springing up rapidly where 40 or 50 voters may be gathered together a long way from their homes, and from .older settlements. In order to deal with such circumstances it is wise that we should retain a provision under which candidates or electors concerned may apply to the Government for the appointment of a polling place which will give them facilities for discharging their citizen rights. I am at a loss to know how these matters could have escaped the attention of honorable members in another place, many of whom must have had some experience similar to my own. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> and some other honorable senators are prepared to take a reasonable view of this matter, and to be guided by the statements of those who have experienced these difficulties in the past. I have had again and again at election times to apply for the proclamation of certain places as polling places. </para>

                    <para>- Honorable senators seem to fear that if the Government of the day are allowed to appoint polling places after the issue of the writ very great harm will be done. My experience is that the appointment of polling places after the issue of writs has always been in the interests of the general community. To allow the Government of the day to fix in camera the polling places to be proclaimed throughout the various States, and to allow no opportunity for revision is much more likely to lead to unfair practices. If any injustice is done by the Government, they can always shield themselves behind the Act, and say - "We are not allowed to appoint any fresh polling places now, because the writ has been issued." If in the absence of this provision a manifest injustice were pointed out by the Government, they would refuse to appoint a polling place at the risk of the rejection of some of their members. The Elections Act in Queensland is not a very democratic measure, but there is a clause in it which appears to me better than this. It provides that- - </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable senators will notice that the Governor in Council is authorized to appoint polling places "from time to time," and the reason for that is, that from time to time it is found that injustice may be done to bodies of electors if certain places are not appointed as polling places. If the Governor in Council were in Queensland, compelled by law to issue his list of polling places, and to abide by that list as published with the issue of the writ, very great injustice would be done in many cases. Honorable senators may point out that under this Bill, provision is made for voting by post, but many electors may not care to go to the trouble of going through the formula necessary to vote by post. </para>

                    (Queensland). - I should like to know the position of the Minister in charge of the Bill. Does the honorable gentleman consider himself bound absolutely to the amendments of another place, or is he amenable to reasons which may be offered in opposition ? In answering those who are opposed to the amendments of the House of Representatives, the Postmaster-General's only argument . was that in the event of sudden changes taking place provision had been made for voting by post. But voting by post does not cover numbers of cases which have been cited this afternoon, and no effort has been made to cover them. In connexion with voting by post, there is sure to be considerable delay. Changes in population are very rapid, particularly on gold-fields where gold is easily won. Sometimes thousands of people will move from one electorate to another in the space of a week or less, and under such circumstances voting by post would not be allowed. In this matter a certain amount of discretion will no doubt be exercised, and those intrusted with the duty of issuing certificates will be careful to make due inquiry, and satisfy themselves that an applicant cannot possibly vote in any-other way. That, of course, all means delay, and the only persons who will benefit from the system will be those who are permanently resident in a certain place, but who, owing to special circumstances, will not be able to personally record their vote on the day of election.

The object of appointing polling places is to enable electors, as easily as possible, to record their votes, and those places must be arranged in a way absolutely fair to all parties. The polling places are fixed on the advice of the returning officer, who is supposed to be - and who, we all hope, is - absolutely impartial. </para>

                        <para>- In Queensland, after the writ has been issued, candidates generally approach the Government and ask for further polling places, very often in the interests of one candidate or the other. Is it likely that under pressure from importunate candidates, the allotment of polling places will be any fairer than it is when made on the issue of the writ ? If not, the disadvantage must be with those who are least likely to get the ear of the Government, because if there is any impartiality the scale is likely to be weighed in favour of the Government candidate. It is much fairer that the recommendation of the returning officer, when the writ is issued, should be regarded as final. A candidate ought not to be encouraged to ask for the appointment of fresh polling places. A Government who desired to be absolutely impartial might grant polling places wherever they were asked, thus involving a great deal of unnecessary expense. The Government think that as such liberal provision has been made for providing polling places, and as electors have the alternative of voting by post, it is not so necessary as formerly to arrange for extra facilities after the issue of the writ. </para>

                    <para>- It is impossible to discuss the proviso to clause 26 without also discussing that to clause 28, and in those two provisos we have the nearest possible approach to actual justice and fairness. I have had some experience of elections, and it is easily conceived that it is much better to provide the polling places before the actual hour of conflict, in which party and personal feelings run high. We have heard only one side of the story as to the inconvenience, but, on the other side, I can see great inconvenience which may arise through wrong being done. The provision supplies a fail basis for honorable dealing between candidates. </para>

                    (Queensland). - I regret very much that the Government are stubborn in this matter, and that they are encouraged in their wicked way by prominent members of the Opposition. It is, indeed, a pleasant thing to see so happy a family, but how long that happiness may last
                    <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline>
                    will reveal in the future. This is a question of much importance, and a little discussion will not be wasted. The remarks of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline>
                    do not at all answer my objection, and the reply of the Postmaster-General is also inadequate. To say that the party in power may be partial in the administration of the Act, if there be not this proviso, is to say something with which we can all agree. At the same time it must be remembered that if a Government act in an unjust - or dishonest manner their conduct may be criticised on the floor of the Chamber, and that before any benefit can be derived from the dishonesty, the indignation of the electors may find a vent. According to the proposal of the Government, new polling booths cannot be appointed, no matter what fresh reasons or facts may be laid before the returning officer; no alteration can be made, although, it. may be, 20,000 voters are inconvenienced. That, in my opinion, is a perfectly absurd state of affairs. The only information to guide the authorities in the fixing of the polling booths is information gained some three years previously, and, of course, that is ridiculous in a growing community such as that of Australia. I have mentioned several classes of workers who are likely to be disadvantaged, and I may add that large and useful body of men who are engaged in supplying the goldfields with timber. They generally make one trip each day, and on the day of election they are probably miles distant, and simply because of a fear that the party in power may act unfairly, these men are to be deprived, of their votes. In Queensland not long ago, as the Postmaster-General may remember, a railway contractor, shortly before the elections, removed employes into another electorate ; but after the issue of the writ further polling places were established and. these men were able to record their votes. I hope the good sense of the committee will cause the proposal of the Government to be rejected.

                    (Queensland). - When this question was discussed by the House of Representatives,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline>
                    moved an amendment providing that facilities should be provided at any point 20 miles distant from a polling place, on receipt of a petition from ten electors residing within 10 miles of the place where the additional voting place was desired. That proposal the Acting Prime Minister met by stating that the Government would lay on the table, some time before the general election, a list of places at which it was proposed to have polling booths, so that the members might place this list before their constituents and find out whether there was any disability. That is all very well so far as this Government is concerned. They might intend to do that, and honorable members might know weeks or months beforehand where the polling places were to be all over Australia. But an Act of Parliament must be read according to its provisions. Tha legal members would tell us that we must take what a section says, and not what we think the Legislature meant. This clause states that the Governor-General in Council shall issue a list of polling places, but it does not say that he shall issue that list any time before the election. He might issue it only at the time of the issue of the writ if the Government desired that to be done. There should be some elasticity about the clause, so as to enable a number of electors to get a polling place fixed in a certain locality if they so desired. Otherwise a group- of electors might be overlooked by the chief and the assisting returning officers, and by the Government itself.

He thinks that the polling places would not be named until the writ was issued. I take it that the ordinary course that would be followed would be that as soon as the divisions were proclaimed the Government would issue a proclamation stating what were to be the various polling places in the division, and would appoint such places as were con- ' sidered necessary. That would be done some time before the issue of the writ, and there would be an opportunity to apply for ' other places to be appointed.

                        <para>- No ; after the proclamation of the polling place. I believe that every electorate in Australia contains a large number of polling places that have already been determined upon, and 'will be the polling places at future elections unless they are cancelled in the meantime. Whatever is done must be done openly. But we are told that it will be very inconvenient for a number of people if they cannot get a new polling place fixed even after the writ has been issued. It seems to be forgotten that the electors have the power to vote by post. It may be said that it takes some time to vote by post, but it also takes some time to fix a new polling place. I am sure it. would not be contended that if the polling was to take place on the 15th of the month it should -be possible to establish a new polling place on the 14th of the month. That would be unreasonable, because it would not give sufficient time to the electors generally to know that the new polling place had been established, and would be the means probably of playing into the hands of one candidate. I quite agree that every possible facility should be given to electors to record their votes, but we cannot go to the length of requiring a returning officer to go round and ask every elector to vote as a favour. There is too much of the feeling that it is a trouble to go any distance whatever to record a vote. We cannot have a polling place for every individual elector. There is at present a sufficiency of polling places, but if they are not sufficient, let them be increased before the issue of a writ in any particular constituency. If I thought the balance of advantage was in favour of the amendment, I would support it, but I think the disadvantages, preponderate, and that there are sufficient means afforded for every elector to record his vote if he so desires. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline>
                    (Western Australia). - We have just listened to a speech from one who has lived for many years in a quiet suburb of one of our largest cities, and whose mind has become so crystallized into that line of life that he is unable to grasp the nature of the life of a great many people in the far distant parts of Australia. The honorable and learned senator very often talks about the importance of the primary industries of this country. On this occasion he is going to inflict a grievous injury upon a great many people who are engaged in one of our great primary industries, namely, mining. I could take the honorable and learned senator to a town that has had a population of 1,000 people, but within a week or two a new gold rush has broken out 50 or 60 miles away, and the greater number of the people have left. In such a case perhaps there is no polling place for 50 miles from the scene of the rush. But Senator Gould would say that the miner sought to have sufficient patriotism and energy to walk to record their votes. Let it be remembered that these are the men who are making this country. The best class of people we have - whether they be farmers or miners - are the men who are opening up the back country. Yet
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline>
                    says that because these men have the hardihood and pluck to go out into the back districts 50 or 60 miles from a polling place, they should be put to all sorts of trouble and inconvenience if they want to record their votes at election time. There can be no possible means of corruption if we carry this amendment. Who is going to commit a corrupt practice under this provision? What can the candidate do ? All he can ask is that a certain place shall be declared a polling place as soon as circumstances have brought a given number of electors into that particular locality. How can there be any corruption in that ? Nor can there be any corruption on the part of the electors. They can only say that they desire to have a polling place near to where they are living. If there is any corruption on the part of the Government in fixing such polling place, a charge will be brought against them in Parliament, and they will be answerable for their actions. Who, then, can carry out the corrupt practices that have been hinted at? Certainly not the Government, nor the candidates, nor the electors. It seems to me that those who are opposing the amendment do not understand the conditions that exist in some parts of this Commonwealth and the inconveniences to which men are put. When a new agricultural area has been thrown open by the Government in Western Australia, we have had there a population of 100 people within a few weeks. That might be the case after the issue of a writ. Will it be said that, because so many people have gone to a particular area between the time of the issue of the writ and the day of election, they should have to travel 40 or 50 miles on election day if they wish to record their votes Those who oppose this amendment ought to show where the corruption can come in, and who can suffer any inconvenience by making it possible for new polling places to be declared. I cannot see a single objection to it. Take the case of men employed on public works and on railway construction. There may bo a railway camp consisting of 400 or 500 men at a certain place. In a fortnight's time that camp may be 40 or 50 miles away, and as many miles from the nearest polling place. Yet, because these men are engaged in such work, they are to be deprived of a vote unless they are prepared to travel 40 or 50 miles. This Bill is well designed to meet the convenience of city and suburban people, but why should we not also meet the convenience of men who follow migratory occupations? I hope the committee will make the alteration proposed.

                    asks me whether I would be a party to the Government having power to proclaim a polling booth right up to the eve of an election. I certainly would not. But there is a difference between giving them that power and the power to proclaim a' polling booth after the issue of the writ. The time between the issue of the writ and the polling may be two months, and a great deal may happen in that time. The case put by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                    is a forcible one in regard to men engaged in migratory occupations. It seems to me that the Government, in order to solve the great unemployed problem, would say to those who are worrying the State Treasurer, and finding active employment for
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fleming</inline>
                    - "If you want to vote you will have to remain in the army of unemployed. If you go to the mallee country we will disfranchise you." It would also operate in another way. It is well known to those who are acquainted with the mining industry, that gold-fields rise and fall from time to time. Charters Towers may be prosperous to-day, and Croydon may be depressed, with the result that a large number of men leave Croydon for Charters Towers in order to follow their occupation there. At some other time the position may be' reversed. These travelling miners would be disfranchised in the event of an election, simply because they had gone from one electorate to another in the same State.
                </para>
                <para class="block">Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has noticed that under this Bill an elector cannot vote outside his own division, and can he not imagine a case in which after the issue of a writ, a large section of the population might move, say, from Flinders into the neighbouring electorate of Kennedy ? Some hundreds or thousands might shift in that way according to the inducements offered. Under this provision. the Government would have no power to create a fresh polling booth, and these electors would not be afforded a proper opportunity to record their votes. I have already pointed out a case - and I could give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> many others - in which polling places used for one election were removed on the issue of the writ for the next. Such changes have been made, not because of any lack of population in the districts affected, but because the returning officer has not considered the booths necessary ; sometimes they have, been due to the dishonest practice of the person in authority, who, for party purposes, has not thought it desirable that certain booths should remain. In many instances, notification of the change has been made only upon the issue of the writ. In some cases we have succeeded in getting the old booths restored, but under this provision we should not have an opportunity to do so, because it is distinctly set forth that under no circumstances shall the Government have power to appoint a polling place after the issue of the writ. It is absurd for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to say that an elector knows before the issue of the writ where the booths will be situate. It is only when it is too late that he learns that a change has been made, and that the privilege which he formerly enjoyed has been taken away. I hope that the good sense of the committee will lead them to reject the amendment made by another place. </para>

                    <para>- I see no necessity for the course proposed by the Postmaster-General. I should imagine that in every case an honorable senator will reside in his own State ; and why should he be allowed to remove his name from the roll for the division of the House of Representatives in which he resides to the roll for some other part of the State <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> There is no necessity for it. There is no object to be gained, so far as the Senate is concerned. Of course there is something to be gained so far as the provision relates to members of the House of Representatives, because by causing his name to be removed from the roll of the district in which he resides to that of the electorate which he desires to represent a member would be able to vote for himself. I do not know why the House of Representatives have asked that such a privilege should be allowed, but as they have done so, I have no objection to it. I think the words " senator or " should be struck out of the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- That is a point I had overlooked. It appeared to me that the clause was intended only to meet the case of a man representing a particular division, and desiring to have his name on the roll for that division, although he resided in another division. I see that the clause goes a little further, and enables him to keep his name on the roll. There is, however, this awkwardness about it, that it only enables him to have his name, placed on the roll in a division in which he has ceased to reside, and it does not enable him to have his name retained on the roll in the place where he does reside. The clause is exceptionally badly drafted, if the intention is to carry out the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> If we get our names placed upon the rolls for divisions which we represented before, we shall be entitled to have them retained there ; but that provision is absolutely impossible so far as senators are concerned. A senator cannot shift "from one State into another, and in the majority of instances he will represent the whole of the State in which he has been in the habit of residing. If we desire that honorable senators and members of the House of Representatives, who are compelled to live for a considerable portion of the year out of their divisions or States, shall not be disfranchised, we must insert words which will clearly indicate that that is our intention, and it is certainly not clearly indicated b}7 this clause. </para>

The first object is perfectly clear to every honorable senator.

                        <para>- I wish the honorable senator would suggest the plain words. With regard to a member of the House of Representatives, presuming him to be living at present out of the division which he represents, we say in this clause that his name may be placed on or retained on the roll of the division which he represents, instead of the division in which he lives, and that is perfectly clear. When we come to deal with the case of a senator, we find that he represents the whole of a State, and supposing him to be living in some division outside of that State, we have to provide that he may have his name upon the roll of the State. There is, however, no one roll for a State, but a roll for each division of a State. Who is going to decide the division upon the roll for which his name shall appear, if not the senator himself? Who is going to put his name upon any one particular roll ? Supposing the State is divided into 20 or 30 different divisions, and we provide that the senator is to be upon the roll for one of those divisions, in order that he shall not be disfranchised as a senator ; who is to say upon which of those rolls his name shall appear1 ? If there is no one to decide that, is it not better that we should leave it to the senator himself ? That is what this amendment proposes. The wording of the clause may perhaps be a little complicated and involved, and while I admit that it might possibly be expressed more plain]}-, it is to me clear enough .that it says, with regard to a senator, that he may have his name placed upon the roll for some division in his own State. An honorable senator attending here from Western Australia is entitled to have his name enrolled as an elector of Western Australia, and no ' one has a better right than himself to say upon which roll in Western Australia .his name shall appear. It is provided in .this clause that his .name shall be placed or 'retained on the roll for any one division in Western .Australia instead of the roll for the division in which he lives. </para>

                        <para>- This amendment covers two rather distinct sub jectsWhat we are at present discussing is really the second portion of the amendment, dealing with the privileges to be given to senators and honorable members of the other House. The first portion of the amendment proposes to omit the word "reside" and insert the word" "live." There must be some reason for that, and I should be glad if the Minister would inform us what it is. The word " reside " is more nearly related to the word "domicile" than the word " live." Perhaps the Minister, as a legal member of the committee, will explain the reason for the amendment. </para>

The immediate reason is that the term "live" has been substituted for the term " reside " in the Franchise Act. We must of necessity have the same word in the Electoral Bill. </para>

The proper time to have raised that question, was when the Franchise Bill was before us. We used the word " live " in the Franchise Bill which has now become an Act, and we must adopt the same term here. I am not prepared to give an exact definition of the word " live." I believe there have been several definitions of the word "reside," but I am not prepared to express an opinion whether the word "live" means exactly the same as the word " reside." It may be a subject for litigation by-and-by, "but I think we are now committed to the use of this new term. </para>

                    (Western Australia).I wish to raise another point upon this very interesting clause. I raise it for the purpose of allowing the Federal Parliament to be consistent. We have provided for woman's suffrage in our Franchise Act. The exigencies of our public life compel honorable senators representing distant States not only to live here for twelve months, but to bring their wives here also, unless they are prepared to live apart. "Under "this clause it is proposed to allow a senator to retain his right to vote, but his wife will be disfranchised. I think that to be fair to the opposite sex, and to be consistent, seeing that we are giving women a vote under our franchise law, if an honorable senator is allowed to vote in his own State, though public business necessitates his residence in some other State, his wife should be given the same right for the same reason.

                    <para>- We will not contemplate that difficulty until it arises. At present the husband is the senator, and if we are to have sessions such as the present, the wife will be disfranchised. I think that a simple amendment inserting the words "or their wives" would meet the case. I see no reason why the wife of a senator or of a member of the House of Representatives should be disfranchised simply because the exigencies of public business necessitate her living away from the State in which she would have the right to vote if she resided there. </para>

                    <para>- I had intended to pursue the question raised by the alteration of the word " live " for the word " reside," but I feel that the Postmaster-General has raised an objection which is almost insuperable in explaining that both Houses have committed themselves to the term "live" throughout the Franchise Act. I should like to say briefly that, in my opinion, the word " live " is a most undesirable word to use. "Life "is used in contrast with "death," but that is not our difficulty here. What we require is a word that is in contrast with "absence," and for that reason, if for no other, we should use a word like "reside." I do not think we should use the word " domicile," as there are one hundred and one decisions upon that word. " Live " is certainly an inappropriate word. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> were to waive the question of harmony with the Franchise Act, and use the word " reside " in this Bill, it would improve it. </para>

                    <para>- I have had some difficulty in coming to a conclusion as to what will be the position of members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives under this clause. I understand that it is proposed that absence upon public business, such as that in which we are at present engaged, shall not debar us from becoming candidates for our States in the event of a dissolution of Parliament. I find that under the Constitution, until Parliament otherwise provides, the qualification for a candidate for the House of Representatives or for the Senate is that he shall be an elector, or be qualified to be an elector. In the first place place, we must be qualified to be electors, and according to the Franchise Bill, we cannot be so qualified unless our names are on the electoral roll. Representatives of Queensland are to all intents and purposes living in Victoria, but I do not want to put my name on the Victorian electoral roll. </para>

                    (South Australia). - A clause ought to be in such plain language that " he who runs may read ; " and when I read this clause I did not gather the meaning as it has now been explained. I had an idea that the clause was intended to help some members of the House of Representatives who represented a district in which they did not reside, and who wanted an extra vote in case of a close election ; but, of course, I saw the absurdity of regarding the position of senators from that point of view. "What we desire is to meet the case of a few members of both Houses who, owing to the fact that they represent distant States, are practically resident in Victoria, and desire to have their names retained on the rolls of the States or divisions which they represent. It would be better to make this clause express clearly what we mean, by simply providing that any senator or member of the House of Representatives who lives out of his State shall, if he so desires, have his name placed on the rolls for that State.

                        <para>- The federal franchise is founded on residence in a particular place, and it is clear that the representatives of a distant State cannot comply with that condition. Under the proviso such a senator will have to establish residence before he can be placed on the rolls, and I see no necessity for the words which I have suggested should be omitted. </para>

I am not aware that municipalities have police, statistical, or electoral officers in their employ. . The officer of a municipality whose services would be most useful is the clerk, and he is not specified.

As the clause left the Senate the places mentioned were "police stations, post-offices, and other places within the division as the Commonwealth electoral officer directs." The House of Representatives has inserted the words "State schools." That means that the lists must be exhibited at State schools, and does not leave that matter within the discretion of the officer. </para>

                        <para>- Clause 40 has regard to the constitution of the court of revision. It requires that a returning officer must be a member of the court, and that a police, stipendiary, or special magistrate must sit with him, or, failing such a magistrate, that two or more justices of the peace are to sit as members of the special court. The difference made by the amendment of the House of Representatives is, that instead of all justices of the peace having the right to sit as members of the special court, certain justices will be selected and authorized by the Governor-General.

                    <para>- I strongly object to this amendment. It is a most invidious thing that the Governor-General should be empowered to select certain justices to sit as members of revision courts. The Governor-General can know nothing about the qualifications of a justice of the peace, and will have to be guided by the members of his Cabinet who come from the State affected. Justices of the peace are placed upon the bench by State Governments, and, except for misconduct, are scarcely ever removed. Consequently we get a sprinkling of all parties and classes among them. Now it is suggested that the Governor-General shall make a selection of those particular justices who are favoured by the Ministry in power, and that those are to be the only justices empowered to sit upon the bench. If justices are good enough to administer justice for a State, they are good enough to sit as members of courts of revision. </para>

                        <para>- It must be borne in mind that we are now dealing with Commonwealth matters. In this case justices are to be asked to exercise functions directly in connexion with the 'Federal Parliament. It is necessary to have justices in all parts of Australia to sit upon these courts, and it is not reasonable that the Federal Executive should not have a say in the selection of the justices authorized to discharge these functions. Otherwise "the justices authorized to discharge Commonwealth functions will have been authorized to do so by a power other than that of the Federal Executive. </para>

                        <para>- Seeing that the justices will be discharging purely Commonwealth functions, I think that the Governor-General in Council should have the right to select them to perform the duties committed to them under this measure. It is well known that justices of the peace are appointed in the States for a variety of purposes, and to discharge a variety of functions. Many justices of the peace never sit upon the bench, whilst others give up a great deal of time to this particular branch of their public duties, and perform very useful service. It does not seem unreasonable, therefore, that the Governor-General should have the right to select the justices who may be regarded as specially fitted to act as members of the court of revision. </para>

I am glad that my view has been supported by the eminent legal members of the House of Representatives. There is no doubt that this paragraph is rendered absolutely necessary by the Constitution, and that the Bill would have been unworkable without it.

                    (Western Australia). - I would point out that clause 67 gives the right of transfer up to the date of the issue of the writ only, and I suggest that we should insist upon this clause in a modified form. The reason why the House of Representatives objected to transfers being given up to within three days of the election was that in the case of an election in a city constituency the rolls might be swamped by the transfer of electors from adjoining constituencies in which no contests were taking place. We might reasonably provide for registering transfers up to the date of nomination. This would prevent the manipulation of votes in such a way as to transfer party support from electorates in which no contests were taking place into others where keen party fights were being conducted. If, on the other hand, we go to the extreme of preventing electors from having their transfers registered after the issue of the writ we shall limit their convenience too much. We have provided sufficient safeguards against electors recording their votes more than once, and we should afford every facility for the transfer of votes after the issue of the writ - when interest in political matters is in many cases first aroused - up to the date of nomination. What possible harm can accrue if we give an elector the power to transfer his vote up till the date of nomination

                <para>That the committee agree to the amendment inserting the following new clause : - " 98a - No person who is at the date of nomination, or who was at any time within fourteen days prior to the date of nomination, a member of the Parliament of the State shall be capable of being nominated as a senator or as a member of the House of Representatives." </para>
                <para class="block">This is a provision which imposes certain restrictions upon persons who may be nominated for election. I am informed that some of the States have enacted legislation providing that members of the Commonwealth Parliament shall not be eligible to become candidates for the States Parliaments. I do not say that this provision has been inserted as a sort of reprisal ; I merely mention the fact that such legislation does exist in several of the States. No doubt, under ordinary circumstances, it would be almost impossible for any individual to efficiently discharge the dual duties which would attach to him as a member of the Commonwealth and State Legislatures. I presume that the object of providing a disqualification of this kind is to ensure that a candidate shall not be a member of a State Parliament when he is nominated for a seat in this Parliament, in which case he would have the option of sitting in either. Very few individuals, however, would attempt such a task. There has been considerable discussion upon the clause in another place, and I hope that my proposal will be accepted. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that is the opinion of some Victorians, but I do not know that Queenslanders hold the same view. I believe that four out of five of the ex-members of the States Parliaments who now hold seats in the Commonwealth Legislature would have declined to become candidates had they been compelled to risk their seats in the States Legislatures. This provision is liable to give outsiders the impression . that members of the Commonwealth Parliament wish to diminish the opposition which is likely to be shown to them when they next have to face the electors. As far as the Senate is concerned, I hardly think that any candidate will have a chance of being returned to it unless he has had parliamentary experience, and it is too much to ask a State member to resign his seat before he can become eligible for election. I know a State in which if a member of the Opposition resigned his seat in order to contest an election for this Parliament, the writ to fill the vacancy thus created would be at once issued. If, on the contrary, a Government supporter desired to run for a Commonwealth electorate, the issue of the writ would probably be deferred till after the election had taken place, thus giving him an opportunity, if defeated, of retaining his position in the State Legislature. </para>

The elections may take place seven days after nomination, so that a period of about three weeks would be covered.

                        <para>- But there is at least a month allowed. My view is that this clause will, if carried, restrict the choice of the electors. If we do our duty to the electors and desire to seek reelection we should have sufficient confidence to face any opposition, whether it be that of a Minister of the Crown or of an ordinary member of a State Parliament. I believe that some honorable senators are under the impression that certain State Ministers of the Crown will attempt to secure seats in the Federal Parliament, but that they would not do so if it were necessary for them to resign their seats in the States Houses before becoming candidates. I think the fear is groundless. I do not know of any member of the Queensland State Ministry who is patriotic enough to come down here and do his duty as a member of the Federal Parliament. When the first Federal Cabinet was formed, the greatest difficulty was experienced in securing a member of the Queensland State Government to join it. Some of the prominent men of Queensland, including Ministers of the Crown, who were most indefatigable in their efforts to induce the people of Queensland to enter the Federation, were not prepared to assist in the work of the Federal Parliament after the inauguration of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Then I venture to say that they will not be prepared to neglect their business in order to take part in the next federal elections. Therefore, the opposition, if any, from this quarter will be confined to ordinary members of the States Parliaments. Although there are excellent members of this Parliament who have had no experience in the States Legislatures, I hold that a man is far better equipped for the performance of his duties here if he has served an apprenticeship in a State House. If we pass this clause, a State member will be called upon to resign his seat before becoming a candidate at a federal election. A State member might be induced to come forward by the presentation of lengthy requisitions, only to be defeated. He might be misled by his enthusiastic friends. It might suit certain persons to endeavour to get rid of a State member by such a subterfuge. They might induce him to stand, knowing that his seat in the State Parliament would be filled, and that he would have no chance of election to the Federal Legislature. We must ask ourselves plainly what is the object of this clause. What can it be but a desire to make the Federal Parliament a close corporation for those who already constitute it ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think we are likely to have another session of such length. I believe that we shall probably be here for six or eight months at a time, and I do not think that any member of a State Parliament will be able to undermine the position of a member of this Legislature who does his duty. Surely there is a certain prestige attaching to the position of a member of this Legislature which should assist him "in his return if he desires to seek re-election. Some honorable senators have an idea that, while they are away from their States attending to their parliamentary duties in Melbourne, certain State members are undermining them - that by various means they are currying favour with the voters in a way that will lead to the dethronement of more than one federal legislator and to the return of ex-State members. Perhaps it may be so in regard to members of the House of Representatives. A State member may be making himself popular in a ' particular electorate, with -a view to become a candidate for the Federal Parliament. " But it would . be impossible for him to secure the expenditure of Government moneys on roads and bridges throughout the whole of a State, and as the State is polled as one electorate for the Senate, we need have no fear in that respect. There is a principle at stake in any event, and that is that if we pass this clause we shall restrict the choice of the electors. This matter may not be particularly interesting just now to the general public. Probably those interested in it consist only of State members who desire to become members of this Legislature and members of the Federal Parliament.' But I understand that quite a number of people have been laughing at the position of the State members. To use the words of the Victorian Treasurer, this clause is one of the chickens that have come home to roost. Certain State members were quite willing to vote against Federal members becoming members of the State Parliaments, but when the next election comes round, I venture to say that the general public will find that it is a disadvantage to be confined in this way in their choice. If I had been called upon to resign my seat in the State Parliament before contesting the elections for the Senate I should not have done so, and honorable senators would not have had the benefit of my world-wide experience, and of my speeches on the Tariff. That is one reason why honorable senators should not pass this clause. I do not think that the course proposed is a dignified one to adopt. As a matter of principle the clause is wrong, and I shall vote against it. </para>

                    <para>- I was one of those who, when the Bill was last before us, opposed an amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> which was much the same as this. I think that the clause goes too far, aud that some modification might well be accepted. If it provided that no member of a State Parliament should be capable of sitting as a member of the Federal Parliament it would go quite far enough. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> that we should be wanting in dignity if we passed this clause, and that it would have the serious effect of restricting the choice of the electors. I speak as one who is not a member of a State Parliament, and therefore I cannot be charged with bias. I recognise that the electors have rights which must be considered just as well as those of members, or intending members, of this Parliament. The clause savours too much of a desire to guard the interests of members as against those of the electors. While we should make it impossible for a man to hold a seat in the Federal as well as in a State Parliament, we should do all that we can to widen the choice of the electors. If the clause were altered in the way I have suggested, I should support it', but as it stands I am opposed to it. I believe the electors should have a right to bring, out any candidate they desire, whether he be a member of the State Parliament or not, and that a. State member should not be asked to resign his seat before contesting a federal election. This Parliament should not have laid itself open to the charge of retaliation. If the clause applied only to members of the State Parliaments, for which members of the Federal Parliament are debarred, from standing, before resigning their federal membership, it would not be so bacl. </para>

                    <para>- I feel that this is a most illiberal clause. Of course there can be no doubt that it is an act of retaliation against the States Legislatures which have passed a similar provision. I understand, however, that members of several of those Parliaments propose, if possible, to rescind, the provision which de bars members of this Legislature from standing for State Houses; but whether they do so or not, I uo not think we ought to condescend to retaliate in this way. When the measure debarring a Federal member from standing, for a. seat in the State Parliament came before the Western Australian Legislature I opposed it strongly, but without success, and although I am afraid this clause will be agreed to, it will not have my support.

                    <para>- I quite agree with previous speakers who have said that this clause is illiberal in its present form. I had an amendment drafted to the same effect as that moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson.</inline> The position I take up in the matter is that, the intention expressed by five of the Legislatures of the various States has been to the effect that it is undesirable to have federal members struggling with State members in election contests. Seeing that Western Australian representatives are supposed to be returned to the Federal Parliament, and particularly to the Senate, first of all, to safeguard the interests of their State they should live at harmony with the members of the State Parliament. That, so far as I can understand, is the only reason why the members of- the State Parliament of Western Australia prohibited members of the Federal Parliament from standing, for their seats. They think it is not desirable .that members of the Federal Parliament should be entering, into political conflicts with their colleagues in the various States Parliaments, if I may so term them. I think the Western Australian Parliament has been right in that. The moment a. federal, member desires to enter into conflict with his colleagues in a State Parliament he should follow the principle that has recently been approved by five of the States Parliaments of the Commonwealth, and should cease to be a member of one Parliament before he -seeks election for another. The same principle is applied as being desirable as between members of the House of Representatives and members of the Senate; If I disagree with the action of one of my Western Australian friends in the House of Representatives the Constitution says, that I shall not oppose him unless I am prepared to resign, my seat here first. In the- same way, if he disagrees with me he cannot oppose me until he has resigned his seat in the House of Representatives. Then, in 'the Constitution of the various States, the same principle is in force. It is, at all events, in force in Western Australia, where a member of the Upper House cannot stand as a candidate for election to the Lower House.  </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator must see that I am not dealing with this clause, but with the principle that underlies it, and that principle is one which has been followed for a very long time past. It is admitted to be highly undesirable that members of one Parliament should be struggling, at the polling-booths with mem1 bers of another', while they still retain their seats. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> that the clause as it stands is illiberal. It is an endeavour to introduce into this Bill a principle which has never been approved before. It is an endeavour to make these gentlemen, resign before they nominate, and until they nominate they are not candidates. I think, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment ought to be carried, and I am prepared to vote with him to remove the words compelling members to resign fourteen days before the day of nomination. That will leave the provision just as it has been left in. all the various States Constitutions ; just as it has been approved of by the people of Australia in the Commonwealth Constitution, and just, as I believe, the various States in the Commonwealth have approved of it in their recent legislation. I do not believe for a moment that they have passed such a provision for the purpose of preventing competition for their own seats. They have done it simply because they have thought it undesirable to have a conflict of this kind. I think it right so long, as I am a Member of the Federal Parliament that I should attend to my own business as a Member of this Parliament, and should not meddle with the State Parliament in connexion with local matters. The moment we, as federal members, begin to put our fingers into the State pies we shall have trouble unlimited. I think it wise that a Member of the Federal Parliament should endeavour to divorce himself as far as possible from interference with merely local State affairs. The Constitution contemplates that, and affirms that it is undesirable that we should be interfering in the same sphere. Therefore, in carrying out the provision of this clause, subject to the amendment to which I have referred, we shall be carrying out all that the Constitution contemplates, all that the various States Constitutions provide for and approve, and all the principles that recent State legislation in five out of the six States of the Commonwealth has affirmed. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - There is only one remark which I should like to make in regard to the proposed new clause, which I intend to support. It has been said that it will limit the choice of the electors. I would remind honorable senators that there are several limitations upon the choice of electors in this Bill. The very qualification of a candidate is a limitation. But so far as this limitation is concerned, it seems to me to be a very proper one. We have a limitation, whether in law or practice I am not prepared to say, which is that a civil servant who wishes to become a candidate for Parliament must first resign his position in the civil service.

                        <para>- No; but because that which is proved to have worked well for a long time is justified. I do not propose to occupy time in dealing with the absurdity of permitting public servants, without resigning their positions, to become candidates for Parliament. A member of a State Legislature is a servant of the electors in the same sense that we are, and if he wishes to seek another position which may bring him into conflict with the Parliament of which he is then a member, he should first of all resign the position which he occupies. It has been stated that five of the States have passed legislation of this kind. I am not prepared to believe for a moment that in doing so they were animated by anything but a sound regard for the principle I have stated. I should not like to think that they were animated merely by a desire to protect the seats of their own members. I think that, as has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing,</inline> there lias been sound principle underlying their action, and they have considered that it is extremely undesirable that a member of one Parliament should become a candidate for a seat in another, just as the Constitution of every State Parliament recognises that it is undesirable that a member of one House should become a candidate for a seat in the other. I do not know whether it has occurred to honorable senators that,' unless this or a similar clause is adopted, it will be possible for any one holding the position of a Minister of the Crown in a State Legislature to become also a member of the Federal Executive. Of course there is a provision in the Constitution that within three months after accepting office here he is required to find a seat, but within that three months, unless some such clause as this is adopted, he could be at the same time a State and a Federal Minister. There would be nothing to prevent him being the Premier of a particular State and at the same time a member of this Chamber or of the House of Representatives. Are honorable members prepared to say that that would be desirable, or that it is an unfair limitation upon the choice of the electors if we say that such a state of affairs shall not be brought about <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If the principle is a sound one as applied to a Minister of the Crown in a State Parliament, it is equally sound as applied to an ordinary member. With regard to the restrictions placed upon us by the States Parliaments, I do not know whether honorable members have taken the trouble to look them up. I do not propose to read them, but there is a remarkable unanimity, both in the language employed and in the directness with which they have stated their wishes in this matter. Tasmania does not appear to have gone quite so far as the other States, but the difference is a nominal one, and the State Parliaments of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania may be said to have prohibited a federal member from becoming a candidate for either of their legislative Chambers. It should be stated that these laws passed by the various States have not been arrived at hastily, or in any ill considered manner. I know that, in my own State of New South Wales, the principle has been affirmed in the State Parliament on several occasions. I cannot, in accordance with my views of my duty as a State representative, conceive that I am called upon here to fly in the teeth of the opinion expressed so frequently in my own State, and registered on several occasions in the Parliament of that State. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily, but I think that in this case it is very desirable that honorable senators should adhere to their previous decision. I think that another place, in agreeing to an amendment of this character, must have been motived to a certain extent, either consciously or unconsciously, by the fact that in several of the States Legislatures a disability has been imposed upon federal members who might desire to represent constituencies in the States Parliaments. I do not think it is our duty to indulge in anything that may be characterized as reprisal. Whatever may be the strict letter of the Constitution, and of the powers vested in us, as to imposing disabilities on certain persons in elections for this Parliament, we should do nothing that will in any way derogate from the right of every elector to have the widest possible range of choice. Let the States Parliaments impose what disabilities they may on Federal members, that is no argument why we should indulge in anything which savors of reprisal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has referred to the possible case of a State Minister of the Crown standing for a Federal constituency, and has pointed out that such a candidate would have a great advantage over others. The advantage may be admitted, but I do not concede that the position of a representative in a State Parliament affords any analogy to the position of a man who is in the permanent service of a State. I see no analogy in this connexion between a State Minister and a civil servant, a man who holds an executive, though not a legislative position - who occupies a position of a permanent character, either during good behaviour or under the terms of a Civil Service Act. A legislator derives his position simply from the choice of the people, and he occupies it for one, or it may be several Parliaments. At any rate, the position is occupied not as ordinarily a permanent one is, but only during the concurrence of two circumstances - his desire to remain in the position, and a simultaneous desire on the part of the electors to keep him there. We must not deny to electors the right to select any elector who chooses to present himself as eligible for the position of Commonwealth representative. The whole scope of the Constitution is that every person who has the right to vote for the more numerous. House in the Parliament of any State shall have the right to vote for both Houses of' the Federal Parliament, and, further, that every elector shall be eligible for election to. the Commonwealth Parliament, not necessarily for the State in which he resides, but for any electorate throughout theCommonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That is the spirit of the Constitution. I am not professing to quote literally, but that was the principle which the Convention intended, to, as far as. possible, imbed in the Constitution. If we now agree on a proposal such as that submitted by the other House we shall be 'departing from the principle which has been recognised throughout the Commonwealth, and indulging in a reprisal that is unworthy of the Federal Parliament. The restrictions which have been imposed on Federal members by certain of the State Legislatures have already been referred to, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was good enough to say that Tasmania had, perhaps, not gone- sofar as some of the other States. Most honorable members will, I think, be willing to admit that in most of the little matters which have involved friction between the States and the Federal authorities, Tasmania has always "played the game." It would be very undesirable to pay too much regard to the particular case which has been cited as an illustration of the evils which may arise, owing to the absence of such a provision as is now proposed - the particular case of a Minister of the Crown. If a man occupies a Ministerial position in one of. the States, why should he be asked to resign, and relieve himself of the discharge of his duties simply in order to ask the electors to say whether, in their opinion, he is desirable or eligible to represent them in the Commonwealth Legislature <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It may be that the electors would think him fit to represent them in the Senate or the House of Representatives, but at the same time be of opinion that his energies and ability could be better employed in the State Legislature. Why, under these circumstances, should a man be asked to resign his position in the State Parliament? When the Senate considered this matter previously, attention was drawn to the attitude of some of the States Legislatures, and the result of the discussion was that the Senate almost unanimously opposed anything in the nature of imposing disabilities on electors simply because for the time being they happen to occupy responsible positions in the State. The circumstances have not in any way altered, or, if they have, it can only be to the extent of causing us to indulge in reprisals ; and the Senate would do well to maintain the attitude assumed when the question was last before us. </para>

Of course he is still a member of the Queensland Parliament, and I do not think that a very desirable position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferguson</inline> cannot do his duties here and also in the Queensland Parliament. By agreeing to the amendment of the House of Representatives we are not limiting the choice of the electors. The clause does not say that a member of any State Parliament shall not be elected to either of the federal Houses, but provides only that a member of the State Parliament shall resign his seat on becoming a candidate for the Federal Parliament. One honorable senator after another has described the proposed clause as most illiberal. No doubt the trading public regard the Minister for Trade and Customs as very illiberal because he will not allow general smuggling, though other people regard such illiberality as very desirable at the present time. If a State member who becomes a federal candidate were allowed to retain his seat he would enjoy an unfair advantage over other candidates. He holds a particular position, and would risk nothing, seeing that in every one of the States there is payment of members, and in that way his expenses would be paid by the taxpayers. </para>

                    <para>- We have in the proposed clause excellent evidence of how far the most democratically minded individuals become conservative when they enter Parliament. We have heard a great deal from several senators about the great principle which underlies this clause, but to my mind there is only one principle discoverable - namely, that of self-preservation. We want to erect round ourselves a ringed fence. . We do not want any intruders in the field, but to keep this Parliament a close preserve for ourselves. In that, I am sorry to say, we appear to be following the bad example set by the States Parliaments. What was the motive which actuated the States Parliaments ? It was the fear of federal members - the fear of the higher prestige obtained by members of the Federal Parliament and that the latter would prevail when met in the arena Honorable senators say that this clause has not been inserted in a retaliatory spirit. It appears to me, however, that that is the. spirit displayed, no matter how much honorable senators may protest. We stand on the apex of Commonwealth Government. We are the supreme legislative machine of Australia, and we ought to show the inferior machines a good example, and be above all narrow-minded littleness. We should not give way to the prevalent conservatism. As the Commonwealth Constitution has granted the franchise to all the people of Australia, so we ought to throw open representation in this Parliament as freely as possible to every person. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> has dealt very fully with this question as a principle which has been long established. Where has it been long established <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We have not had a federation in Australia until .now, so that it could not have been established here. Great Britain is not a federation, so that there is no precedent there. I do not know what is done in Canada, but I hope they have not adopted this narrow-minded idea of debarring certain persons from standing as candidates for the Dominion Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> has mentioned that unless a State member resigned his seat he would be in the position of having his railway pass, and the State would be paying a portion of his election expenses, while he was contesting the federal election ; and in that way, it is \irged, he would be in a superior position' to his opponents. My idea is that the State ought to pay the travelling expenses of candidates for Parliament. When a man offers his services to the public as a representative, if he can get a sufficient number of electors to support him, the State should pay his travelling expenses by rail during the period of his candidature. This should be done, not in the interest of the candidate, but in the interest of the State itself. 4.3 h 2 </para>

                <para class="block">If the cost of elections be increased, it is made more and more difficult for poor men to enter Parliament. Instead of raising barriers .against poor citizens, we should try to level them down. Instead of taking a backward and reactionary step like the present, we should try to go forward, improving our political machine, enlarging our ideas, liberalizing our views, and placing ourselves in line with modern notions. I condemn -what is proposed on democratic principles. This is the very same style of conservatism as we find in Great Britain. Members of Parliament there object to payment of members for the very same reason as this clause has been inserted in the Bill - because they know perfectly well that nine-tenths of them would be swept away as by a tempest if payment of members were instituted. Being desirous of saving their own skins, they object to payment of members. Why have many of the electors hitherto objected to the franchise being lowered, and to others than themselves being empowered to vote <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> For the very same reason again - because they were afraid that the new power that would be created would operate to their disadvantage. We perceive the very same kind of conservatism operating in this case, and I very much regret that it is as rampant in this Federal Parliament as in the States Parliaments. I had hoped that we should rise to -a level higher than anything previously achieved in Australia. I regret that, instead of that, we are falling lower. We are levelling down rather than levelling up. We ought not to adopt this dog in the manger clause. Nothing but fear of their own skins animated the House of Representatives in putting the provision in the Bill - nothing but a  desire  to retain their seats. There was no consideration for the public, or for the common good, or for what was desirable in the interests of the elector. The electors appear to have been ignored- altogether in this connexion. The whole trouble appears to be about what is going to happen to the members. My conception of government is that it ought to be . conducted in the interests of the people. What is best for the people ought to be done in every instance. How can it injure the electors if a member of the State Parliament is permitted to stand as a candidate for the Federal Parliament without resigning his seat ?

If he succeeds, he can proceed to the higher Parliament, and vacate his seat in the lower. If, on the other hand, the amendment inserted in the Bill be passed, the choice of the electors will be restricted. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> to say that this clause would not prevent any man from becoming a candidate ibr the Federal- Parliament. I wish to ask the honorable senator this question : If he had had to resign his position in the Queensland Parliament before he could become a candidate for the Senate, would he have done so ? I do not think he would. I am certain that I should not. " A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." That operates all round. I trust that in the interests of the public, and of the electors of the Commonwealth, this clause will not be agreed to. I hope that the Senate will treat it as it treated a previous attempt to graft the same idea upon our electoral law, and will throw it out. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline>
                    I should like to point out that this is the first Federal Parliament, and is in an entirely different position from any subsequent Parliament. When I was elected there were different circumstances operating than will operate in regard to any future Parliament. I can ease the mind of the honorable senator to this extent - that had it been the law at the time I was elected that I should resign my seat in the State Parliament before I could become a candidate for the Federal Parliament, I certainly should not have done so. It so happens that I had ' no desire whatever to become a candidate for the Federal Parliament, and my experience since becoming a member of it has convinced me that my original impression was the correct one. I have had about as much of Melbourne as I want, and about as much of federal politics as I care to have. I know now .that I should have been better in health and better off in pocket if I had remained in Queensland. But what I want to know is : where does the disability -to the elector come in, and where is he limited in his choice by the adoption of the proposal before the committee
                    <inline font-style="italic">t</inline>
                    We do not prevent the electors from selecting any man who is qualified to become a candidate for federal honours. AH that is demanded of him is that he shall start from scratch the same as any one else. Let there be fair contests between candidates, and do not let us create a special set of circumstances for the benefit of certain candidates.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline>
                    knows perfectly well that candidates for election to State Parliaments are not encouraged to come out unless they have a reasonable prospect of success. The law is that a deposit has to be lodged by a candidate.

                        <para>- Of course it is. It is an intimation to the intending candidate that he must satisfy himself that he can command a certain amount of support to justify his candidature or otherwise he will be penalised. That is not wrong, because elections cost the State money, and it is in order to safeguard the Treasury that a deposit is ' demanded from the candidate to guarantee that he will have a -reasonable amount of support to justify his candidature before he offers himself for election. It is on precisely the same principle that we ask the State member to take some risk. It would be quite easy for a State member, having his seat in the State Parliament reserved, to come along for any sort of reason and offer himself as a candidate, if only to harass or embarrass another candidate, unless some such guarantee as this were required. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> says that he believes in the Government paying the travelling expenses of candidates. But he is not proposing that all candidates shall have their travelling expenses paid, . but that a particular little coterie, simply by the accident of occupying a certain position at the time, shall not only have their travelling expenses paid, but shall also be receiving a salary at the same time. In the State of Queensland, during the months when an election contest is in progress, a State member would be receiving £25 a month to assist him in carrying on his candidature. I say that that is monstrous. Even if the committee believed that it was a correct principle for the Federal Government to pay the travelling expenses of all candidates seeking federal honours, still it would not be right not to pass this clause, because it only provides that certain candidates shall not be placed at an advantage in comparison with others. </para>

                    <para>- I do not care to give a silent vote upon this question. Sent here, as I am, to assist "in representing an entire State, I do not feel I should be justified in voting against a principle which has been deliberately enacted by that State through its Parliament, the principle that a member of one parliament shall not become a candidate for a seat in another. In New South Wales a limitation as to candidature for seats in the State Parliament by members of the Commonwealth Parliament has been placed upon the statute-book, and although an attempt was made last night to reopen the matter in the Legislative Assembly in Sydney, it seems to have proved . a most melancholy failure. Attention was directed to the question, on a motion for the adjournment of the House, by a gentleman who has not been a member of any Parliament for more than three months. The only supporter of his proposal appears to have been 'a gentleman who was an unsuccessful candidate for a seat in the Federal Parliament. The New South Wales Parliament has decreed that a certain embargo shall be placed upon members of this Parliament, and I do not think that I should be justified in voting against a provision which is the counterpart of that contained in the State Act, I think there is a great deal of truth in the proposition that it is undesirable to limit the choice of the electors ; but this is done b3'our Constitution, and honorable members are showing rather an excess of virtue in making a great deal of fuss about the limitation proposed in this Bill. The provision for a money deposit by candidates is quite as severe a restriction as that now proposed. It is a restriction upon- the whole community, and not upon a small number of persons. We place restrictions upon some of the most eligible men in the whole of the Commonwealth, namely, the members of the public service. With the greatest respect for the members of the various States Parliaments, I think it is quite possible to find in the public service gentlemen as highly fitted in every way to become useful members of the Commonwealth Parliament as are members of the States Legislatures. I was rather struck with the cheerful virtue of my honorable friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> who stated that he intended,, as he had done on a previous occasion, to raise his voice against the proposal. But I cannot find in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> any record that the honorable senator ever opened his mouth on the subject, and I hope that the honorable gentleman, when he finds that he did not pledge himself during the former debate, will be prepared to vote now in a direction opposite to that which he has indicated. </para>

                            - I did not run away. I am not in the habit of running away. I think it is sufficient to say that I shall support the new clause. I am not doing this by way of retaliation, and if those honorable senators who are opposed to the motion have such splendidly virtuous grounds for their action, it is hardly worth their while to throw mud at those who take a different view. The Commonwealth Constitution, which was most elaborately prepared, enacts in the most emphatic manner that a member of one House shall not be eligible as a candidate for a seat in the other Chamber. That is a restriction' on the choice of the electors. It might be very desirable for some members to exchange places at times, but the Constitution prevents this. Why was that provision ' inserted

                            There must have been some good purpose in view. There, was no question of reprisal, or fear, or anxiety to " save their own bacon," to induce the framers of the Constitution - not one of whom had a certain knowledge that he would be elected to this Parliament - to insert that clause. There is no reason why the provision now under discussion should not bear equally good fruit.

                        <para>- I think it is generally admitted that there would be something objectionable in the. spectacle of Members of the States and Federal Parliaments entering into an electoral contest. It would not be calculated to promote that harmony which we hope will continue to exist between the Federal and States Parliaments. This feeling may have animated the members of the States Legislatures in providing that members of this Parliament should not be eligible as candidates for election to the States Parliaments, and they should regard our action as the natural complement of their own. I cannot help thinking that the provision that any person who was, within fourteen days prior to the date of nomination a member of a State Parliament, shall not be capable of being nominated for a seat in the Federal Legislature is more far-reaching than similar Legislation by the States. If the provision is allowed to remain in its present form it might be looked upon as a reprisal by the members of the States Parliaments, who might be tempted to further extend the disqualification of members of this Parliament. I am inclined, therefore, to accept the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson.</inline> We shall then bring ourselves into line with the legislation in five of the States. As has been pointed out, the remaining State has had no opportunity of indicating what view it will take of the subject. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care what motives actuated those who framed the Constitution.- We have to deal with it as it stands, and I contend that it was distinctly contemplated that members of the States Legislatures should - be permitted to sit as Members of the Federal Parliament. Section 44 expressly provides that the receipt of salary as a State Minister shall not disqualify any person from sitting as a member of the Federal Parliament. It is perfectly clear that clause 98a would limit in the most undesirable way the freedom which is expressly extended by the Constitution. I have satisfied myself by looking at the Constitution, that we have power to make this provision, but, if we do so, we shall take a step which will be regarded as retrograde in all parts of the world. I do not care to assist in bringing any such reproach upon this Chamber, and I shall, therefore, vote in favour of retaining the freedom which at present exists. </para>

                    <para>- It may be pointed out that most gentlemen who have had experience in State Parliaments will be able, by nomination day, to judge whether or not they had any chance of election to this Parliament. If they thought they had no chance they could retire instead of nominating. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has referred to me as a democrat, and I hope that I always shall be one. At the same time my democracy is rather different from his. He speaks of this as a conservative proposal. I hold that it is of an exactly opposite nature. The honorable member seeks to handicap all outside applicants for a seat in this Parliament by compelling them to compete with those who have a great advantage over them, not because of their superior ability, but because of other circumstances. His assumption is that all political talent is concentrated in the States Parliaments. I hold a different view. There are many able men who would never think of becoming candidates for the Commonwealth Legislature if they had to oppose those who possess great advantages because they hold positions in the States Parliaments. In future elections members of this Parliament will labour under a further disability, particularly in States which embrace large areas. For example, in Queensland the State member is in a position to canvass the federal electorates whilst Commonwealth members are attending to their parliamentary duties. </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that we very frequently talk about the interests of the public when we are thinking about our own personal interests. It is very singular to find a number of gentlemen anxious to deny to members of the States Parliaments all the privileges which they themselves possessed when they were candidates for this Parliament. Evidently their action is prompted by motives of self-preservation, which is the first law of nature. Why, only two of the representatives returned to the Commonwealth Parliament by South Australia were at the time of their candidature outside of the State Legislature. I am quite willing that the members of the States Parliaments shall enjoy the same advantages that I possessed when I was a candidate for the Senate. I fail to see why we should interfere in this matter. Why should we not give the electors the widest possible choice? We should never have heard a word about a proposal of this sort had it not been that a great many members of this Parliament are afraid of the opposition of members of the States Legislatures. With them, it is purely a question of self-preservation. I say, let the electors make their own choice. The disqualification proposed was certainly not contemplated by the Constitution. If the States Parliaments have been so foolish as to pass a law preventing members of the Commonwealth Legislature from contesting seats for the States Parliaments - a thing which is not very likely to occur under any circumstances - that does not justify us in copying their example. I should prefer to see the clause in the form in which it is proposed to amend it, but I shall vote against the entire provision. I trust that the committee, which upon a former occasion was unanimous, will not give way in this matter to the other Chamber, and thus restrict the choice of the electors. </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment embodies two new provisions which are intended to deal with possible contingencies not previously dealt with in the Bill. One of those contingencies is that of a candidate dying after nomination. In this connexion clause 108 a provides that if after the day of nomination, and before polling day, any candidate dies, and the candidates remaining do not number more than those required to be elected, they shall be declared to be elected. The other is to provide for the case of a partial or total failure of an election. That is to say, it provides that where, for some reason or another, no candidate is nominated or returned, or an insufficient number of candidates is nominated or returned, a writ shall issue forthwith for a supplementary election. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that I cannot agree to the proposed new clause 108a. It appears to be satisfactory on the surface, but when it is examined it will be discovered that under it a very great wrong might be committed. Take the case of a constituency for which two members have to be returned, and for which three 'candidates, each candidate belonging to a different political . party, are nominated. If the candidate put forward by one party died, the candidates of the other two parties would bc declared elected without the third party having an opportunity to replace their man. I do not think that is fair. As I heard an honorable senator say to-day, the clause holds out a direct inducement for people to poison a candidate, or drown him, or spirit him away in some fashion. I trust the committee will not agree to it. </para>
