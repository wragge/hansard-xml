                <para class="block">I desire to bring the clause into line with the provision in the Queensland Act. The proviso is intended to meet a case, and they are. very frequent in some parts of Australia, where a licensee has erected a hall for public purposes alongside, probably on the same plot of ground, but not connected in any way with, the hotel. It is conceived that there could be no greater objection to a building of that kind being used than there would be to the use of a building which was next door to a hotel, so long as there was no direct communication between the hotel and the room. </para>

                    (Tasmania). It seems to me that this proposal will suit neither parties in the committee, owing to the use of the words "as a committee room." The arguments which were directed against the original clause, were that it would be distinctly inconvenient to many candidates, because in small country villages it is not possible to obtain a hall or place of meeting which is not attached in some way to a hotel. The question in their minds always was the necessity to hold meetings. It is now proposed that these premises, or any part of them, shall not be used as a committee room, leaving it perfectly open to a candidate to use any part of a hotel for the purpose of holding a public meeting and addressing the electors. I indorse that part of the proposal, because it meets my view very fairly. But to the second part of the. proposal I take strong exception. I believe that in innumerable cases the hotel is not disconnected with that part of the building which- would be of service and use to a candidate by means of a separate entrance or exit. The modification which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline>
                    proposes to insert meets the case of paragraph (a), but is utterly irrelevant to the case of paragraph (6). Who can conceive that any part of the premises used by a club, society, or association is detached from the hotel? I know hundreds of cases in which they are not detached. The proviso is simply ludicrous as applied to paragraph (6), and the effect of its insertion would be that it would be absolutely impossible to use as a committee room any part of the premises of an ordinary club, which was not, and which no one could expect to be, detached.

                <para>SenatorCLEMONS.- No. While with regard to those buildings which are attached to hotels there may be a separate entrance or exit, in some cases it is absolutely impossible to find a separate exit or entrance in connexion with the premises of a club. I submit that the proposal is bad in two directions - bad in so far as it does not meet the objection of those who do' not wish licensed premises to be used, inasmuch as the limitation is solely in regard to committee rooms, and bad so far as paragraph (b) is concerned, because it absolutely bars any part of the premises of a club, society, or association from being used at all. </para>

                        <para>- The intention of the proviso is to prevent candidates from making hotels their head-quarters. I think we are all agreed on that point. If honorable senators would think of the opportunities for corruption, bribery, and all sorts of malpractices which the use of a hotel as the head-quarters of a candidate would provide, they would be very chary about allowing the use of committee rooms in hotels, or permitting, meetings to be held there. If a candidate is allowed to use a hotel as his head-quarters it will mean that a committee will be sitting there during election day, and that voters will be pouring in and out. </para>

                        <para>- I had committees, as I believe that most other honorable senators had. We do not legislate for exceptions, but for the . general rule, and nearly all candidates are supported by organizations of some kind. Let us imagine the position as it would be on the day of election. You have your committee sitting in a hotel. You have electors pouring in and out during the whole day. The large majority of the men who went into the committee room would expect to be treated, and would be treated there. If one candidate did this, the others would also be expected to do it. Those who refrained would be called mean, and would probably lose a large number of votes ; so that the election would not turn upon the important issues before the people at the time, but upon the meanness or laushness of the respective candidates. If committee meetings are permitted to be held in hotels, hotel-keepers all over the country will be angling to have committee rooms on their premises, so as to gather business to themselves. We ought to do everything in our power to prevent the use of strong drink at election time. I was under the impression that the tendency of public opinion was in the direction of shutting up public-houses altogether on election days, instead of throwing them wide open, as apparently is now proposed by another place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> says that it would be very hard if he could not hold election meetings in a club. Imagine a town large enough to make it worth the honorable and learned senator's while to address a meeting there, which had no place where a public meeting could be held. It is preposterous to suggest, such a state of affairs, which, so far as my observation goes, does not exist in Australia. What virtue is there in addressing meetings from the balconies of hotels? During my election campaigns I have always kept as far away from hotels as possible - for economical reasons, as well as others. If you talk to a crowd from the balcony of a hotel, at the end of the address the speaker is thirsty and the crowd is thirsty. They all gravitate to the bar, and refresh themselves at the candidate's expense. </para>

                        <para>- That is the worst of it. In the interests of economy, as well as of the purity of elections, we ought to .keep as far away from public-houses as possible during election times. I have been in a great many portions of the back country of Queensland, but have never found a place where I could not get accommodation to address a meeting. I have addressed meetings in private houses, in sheds, and in the open air. We were not allowed to use hotels in Queensland, and a very good thing it was, as I have found on many occasions. I trust that some clause will be passed to prevent the use of hotels foi1 election purposes. I consider that it would be a dreadful evil if the door were thrown open to their wholesale use at such times. </para>

                        <para>- The clause as it stands will hardly do. I trust that we shall stick to the clause as it stood originally, with a proviso to the effect that a candidate may employ a hotel room for an election meeting, if it is not absolutely connected with the hotel and has a private entrance. I should have no objection to that, although I think that it would be a mistake to go even so far. Honorable senators have spoken of the difficulty of finding accommodation. That difficulty appears to me to exist solely in their imagination. I cannot understand any man going to a place where there is a sufficient number of electors worth addressing at which there is no school or cottage or ' place where a meeting can be held. I do not believe that any person in the whole Commonwealth would find the slightest difficulty in addressing the electors or meeting them for business purposes, even if we drew the clause as strictly as it could be framed for the purpose of divorcing hotels from elections. We absolutely make the giving of a glass of beer to an elector with the object of influencing his vote a criminal offence, yet we propose to permit the use of hotels for election purposes, although we know that the sole object of the licensed victualler is to sell drink. </para>

If a more stringent clause can be framed to prevent the holding of election meetings in hotels, it will find in me a warm' supporter. It is all very well to say that there is no clanger in holding meetings in hotels, but every one of us knows otherwise. Every one knows that beer plays a very important part in elections. Elections have sometimes been won and lost according to whether candidates were prepared to adopt tactics of that description. </para>

                        <para>- On several occasions I have noticed the evil influence of hotels in connexion with elections. I have contested five Parliamentary elections in my life, and perhaps I shall contest more. In one constituency where I was fighting an election there was only a right-of-way between a polling-booth and an hotel. One of the candidates made use of the public-house. Electors were given a ticket with which they could go in, and, by presenting it, could get a sixpenny drink. The candidate who refused to do that sort of thing was placed at a disadvantage. I lost the election by 100 votes, but I am certain that if I had adopted the tactics of the other side, I should have won. As to the hardships which it is said would be inflicted on candidates if hotels could not be used for election meetings, I thoroughly agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> have said. If a candidate cannot hire a hall in a small township where he wishes to address a meeting, he can go out into the open air, and by getting a box, or a lorry, or something to stand on, can deliver his speech. This is one of those matters about which we should make a firm stand. We have limited the election expenses of candidates, and 'have talked a great deal about making elections purer. It seems to me that this question of the use of hotels strikes at the root of electoral purity. I should be prepared to close all hotels on election day, although I think that would be better for the whole community, and would be in the interest of honest representation, </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared to address meetings from hotel balconies, and to encourage persons to drink. In the Bourke electorate, which I contested in 1S94, I had to canvass a large scattered district, the length of which was about 120 miles, and the breadth about 100 miles. It consisted largely of a number of small mining townships - and miners, generally speaking, are not disinclined to frequent public-houses, and take their beer. There was only one hall in that vast electorate. I had to address meetings from balconies, waggons, and carts, and utilize other means of making my views known to the electors. I know that it is nonsense to say that a candidate cannot get on without the use of public-houses. To allow meetings to be held in such places is simply to play into the hands of wealthy and unscrupulous men. Unscrupulousness is practically the order of the day at election times, and the honest and straightforward candidate is handicapped and often beaten by surreptitious means concocted in public-houses. I have no prejudice against publicans. Some of my warmest friends are hotel-keepers, and there are many honorable publicans who would not do a mean tiling under any circumstances. Although I see no objection to holding public or committee meetings in halls owned by publicans, but having no connexion with public-houses, I would prohibit candidates from addressing meetings from hotel balconies, and from speaking in rooms of public-houses as well as in some of the clubs which have been referred to by certain honorable senators. In order to purify elections, and to give men of limited means a reasonable opportunity to contest an election on fair grounds, the further we remove election meetings from public-houses the better it will be. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with many of the sentiments which have been expressed by the two or three honorable senators who have addressed themselves to this question. I believe that when the clause was previously before us I voted for its retention, and I am strongly in agreement with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> describes as the desirableness of divorcing the drink question from elections. But some honorable senators do not appear to have grasped the difficulties in the way of this amendment. Since the clause was first discussed I have come to view it in a rather different light, and I am prepared to show by experience that it would place many difficulties in the way of candidates in some parts of the Commonwealth. I would point out to Senators Glassey, Stewart, Pearce, and De Largie that they come from States where they may safely rely upon having five mild nights out of six, so that they can address meetings from a stump or a waggon if a public room is not available. In Tasmania the climate is very different, and if a candidate desires to address a meeting in a township where it is impossible to obtain a public room except at a hotel, what is he to do ? Although all these difficulties are said to be imaginary, an ounce of fact is worth a ton of theory. During the Senate elections, I addressed something like twenty meetings, and I can assure the committee that in six instances I found it impossible to obtain the use of a hall or public room of any kind. On five out of those six occasions the weather was so inclement that I should not have had an audience of a dozen if I had spoken in the open air, but at each place I was able to obtain the use of a large dining room in one of the hotels. Where there is only one hall or school-room in a township, and that building is occupied by the Salvation Army or some other local body, or perhaps by another candidate, what is a man to do? Personally, I should prefer open air meetings on the score of cheapness, but when the weather is so bad that people cannot be expected to listen to a candidate speaking in the open, the only course open to him is to go to the landlord of the largest hotel and ask to be allowed to address a meeting in the largest room he has available.

                        <para>- The vision of some honorable senators does not extend beyond the confines of their own States. In order to overcome the difficulties of candidates in places where fine weather cannot be relied upon, and where a man cannot obtain the use of a schoolroom or some public hall, I wish to leave it open to them to use the largest room of a hotel, in the absence of a temperance hotel or coffee palace. I have placed my experience before the committee, because some honorable senators, including one from Tasmania, have said that these difficulties are quite imaginary. I agree that we should do all that we can to separate the drink traffic from elections. I should like to see legislation passed compelling every hotel to close on election day, and, if it were possible to include such a provision in this Bill, I should support it. </para>

It is for the convenience, not only of the candidate, but of those who wish to hear him, that we should do something in the direction I have indicated. If the honorable senator were standing for a district where, on the average, <inline font-style="italic">ii</inline> rains two nights out of three all the year round, and where there is no public room available save the dining room of a hotel, what would he do "with this clause in operation ? In many country hotels dining rooms will be found capable -of holding 100 persons. I cannot see my way clear to vote for the reinstatement of this clause, although I am anxious to do everything that I can to meet the difficulties of my honorable friends who support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- NEILD (New South Wales). - I think the speech just delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> is eminently practical, and that it has shown us that the fair weather conditions, so largely relied upon <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> honorable senators from Queensland, are not reproduced in the sister State of Tasmania. The drought conditions of Queensland are not always reproduced in the State from which I come, or in Victoria, and it is most necessary, both for the convenience of candidates and electors, that in every place there should be the possibility of securing a roof to cover the heads of the speakers and their hearers. The suggestion that a candidate should travel round with a tub or a barrel as part of his personal effects, and stand upon it when addressing the electors, seems to me to be ridiculous. I should imagine, from some of the speeches we have heard on this question, that some honorable senators would even desire to prohibit the use of tubs or barrels which had held intoxicating liquor, on the ground that theY might contaminate the candidate. We might go further, and insert a provision that no meeting should be held except in a water tank. If we provide that no meeting shall be held except in one particular description of building, we shall place a very heavy burden upon candidates,' for the rental of that particular class of building will go up to almost prohibitive rates. If the public-houses are to be closed upon polling day, how are electors - who in some instances have to travel many miles in order to exercise the franchise - to obtain meat or drink or even feed for their horses ? How can ' they possibly be expected to attend the various polling places for the purpose of recording their votes? T would further point out that in some of the States the public schools cannot be used for the purpose of holding political meetings. I believe that in Victoria their use for that purpose is permitted, but in New South Wales it is not, and no law which we can enact will remove the embargo which at present exists in the latter State. . There are a thousand good reasons why the public schools should not be used for the holding of political meetings. </para>

In the first place, the holding of an electioneering meeting, even of the most placid character, would materially upset the whole paraphernalia of a school-room. Moreover, people will expectorate at meetings, and as a result the building would not be fit for use by the pupils on the following day. </para>

NEILD. - I would further point out that very often a candidate who is travelling rapidly from one town to another does not reach the place at which he is to speak till perhaps dusk. I have frequently arrived in towns even after the time advertised for my meeting. If we absolutely prohibit a candidate from holding a meeting in any place connected with licensed premises, he will have to send an advance agent before him - a sort of political John the Baptist - to make the necessary arrangements. Moreover, in the case of elections for the Senate, candidates do not have committees. I have heard it asserted that every candidate has a committee, but I do not know of one out of the 50 candidates who contested the Senate elections in New South Wales who had a committee. </para>

                        <para>- How is it possible for a candidate' to have a committee at each of 2,200 polling places in New South Wales ? He cannot even have scrutineers. It is impossible to deal with States, which in some cases are larger than European empires, from the parish pump politics point of view. What is the. difference between a candidate speaking from the balcony of an hotel, with the whole of his audience in front of it, and addressing a meeting from the balcony next door, with half his audience in front of it <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> In New South Wales, for some years past, the law against treating electors has been so strict that any candidate who would attempt to further his prospects by adopting that line of conduct would be little short of a lunatic. We all know that candidates are closely watched to see that they do not commit any breach of the Act, and therefore any man who would lay himself open to certain attack would be a fool. I know. that some of the New South Wales senators did not spend £50 upon their election. How can such a limited expenditure represent the consumption of any liquor <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Under the provisions of this Bill, candidates for the Senate are limited to an expenditure of £250. How far will such an outlay permit of the realization of the extravagant views of certain honorable senators who speak of candidates "treating" the electors. Personally I am as strongly opposed to the introduction of liquor into any political contest as is the most stringent teetotaller. At the same time, I recognise that we live under conditions which make the use of hotels an absolute necessity of our daily life. The strictest teetotallers, when travelling, reside at hotels. </para>

                        <para>- Of course in Queensland candidates make use of the public schools, but as I have already pointed out, they cannot do so in New South Wales. I agree with the necessity which exists for a candidate having a cover over his head in wet weather. The idea of clambering up a gum tree and spouting from a fork in it is simply ridiculous. Some of my honorable friends from Western Australia know perfectly well that there have been very nice little, <inline font-style="italic">contretemps</inline> connected with addresses delivered by candidates from carts in the road. In some instances, the props have been taken away and the candidates have been upset - very much more upset than when the result of the polling became known. But we all know that candidates frequently have to address meetings under peculiar conditions. As a matter of fact, during the last campaign I addressed a meeting from a vehicle in the middle of the day alongside a railway refreshment room, where the train stopped for twenty minutes. </para>

                    <para>- The last speaker seems particularly anxious that candidates, when addressing' political meetings, shall be under cover, and, therefore, he advocates that the balconies of hotels should be made available to them. But he does not appear to have given much consideration to his audience, because, while the candidate is to be upon the balcony his hearers are to be left in the open. There are very few places in Australia where there is not a sufficient number of people settled to support an hotel in which there is some sort of hall available for public purposes. If a township, is so small that there is no such meeting-place, very few candidates will visit it, for the simple reason that there are no votes to be canvassed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> wishes to know why a candidate should not be allowed to address his audience from the balcony of an hotel, seeing that if he goes next door, only half his audience will attend.  His  observations in this connexion suggested to me an aspect of this question which has not yet been touched upon, namely, that we have recently enfranchised the women of Australia. Every woman, therefore, has a right to hear the views of candidates equally with male electors. If a candidate thinks fit to address an audience in a hotel, I apprehend that he will have very few female electors to listen to him ; and that seems a very strong argument in favour of the clause. I am afraid that the clauses limiting the expenditure of candidates will have very little effect ; that was the view I took originally, and it is the view I still take. "We have heard a lot about the little tricks and dodges resorted to at election times in order to evade the responsibility incurred by candidates and their authorized agents in expending money for treats. I have no doubt that at the next federal election large sums will be spent in this way, and it is the duty of both Houses of Parliament to place every obstacle in the way of evasion. There is one method of expending money on behalf of a candidate to which I have heard no reference made.  A candidate may have amongst his staunch supporters some very wealthy men, and without any authority being given or any words exchanged, one of those supporters may " shout " for a whole crowd of electors. What is 'there in the Bill to prevent that? </para>

                    <para>- An extraordinary variety of arguments of the advanced moral type have been used in reference to this amendment. The fact is, we' are not merely seeking to enact a grandmotherly sort of legislation, but seeking to import into an Electoral Bill the highest principles of total abstinence. I support the Government in striking out the clause, but I intend to vote against the provision which it is proposed to substitute for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> used some arguments which, at first sight, seemed entitled to weight. We have conferred the franchise on women, and the honorable senator suggests that if the meetings are held in a hotel, female voters are not likely to be amongst the audience. But my experience is that female voters very much prefer cover in some room, whether in a hotel or otherwise, to standing in the open, either with or without the risk of having their best Sunday bonnets spoiled by a passing shower. We shall be drawing a good deal upon fancied disabilities of the female voters if we place a ban on, perhaps, the only place in a town or locality where there is a convenient room in which the electors can be addressed. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. It must be remembered that these large rooms of hotels are not used for political meetings,- but for meetings of all kinds. I have no objection to the room used being detached from the hotel, but there is no earthly reason for putting a ban upon a particular building simply because the landlord is licensed to sell intoxicating drink, the main purpose of the licence being- the accommodation and comfort of travellers. We are apt to forget that hotels are not provided primarily for the bar trade, but for the accommodation of the travelling public; and where there is a room suitable for meetings it seems grossly unfair that a ban should be placed on the establishment and on the occupier. </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying that the object of the clause is to place a ban, but undoubtedly that is the effect. It is said that people must not attend hotels in order to hear the views of candidates, because of the drunkenness and mischief which may result. I take great exception to the proposed amendment, because it is limited to the use of an hotel as a committee room. When the original clause was under discussion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> moved that the limitation should be struck out, on the ground that the effect of its remaining would be to permit of committee meetings being held on licensed premises. It is now sought to re-introduce the limitation ; and, therefore, the evils which have been' most strongly dwelt on as likely to flow from the holding of meetings in hotels, will flow from the clause which it is now proposed to enact. When the original clause was under discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> pointed out that if the limitation were struck out no meetings could be addressed from the balcony or in any other part of a hotel, and on a division, the voting being equal, the limitation was omitted by virtue of our constitutional provision. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely pointing out that we have returned to a provision which promotes the mischief so much feared by honorable senators. I agree with the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor,</inline> on a former occasion,, that this is theoretical, and not practical, legislation. It is possible that the supporters of a candidate may spend money in treating null]bers of people, but I never found any of my political friends enthusiastic enough to spend £5 on my account in that way. </para>

                        <para>- Or we should legislate that from the time of the dissolution of Parliament until after polling day every hotel must be closed. Such a proposal would be childish and driving teetotalism to the most extreme length. I am reminded of a clergyman in one at the Midland counties of England who was a fanatic teetotaler, and who, in addressing a meeting, expressed great regret that our Lord and the apostles had done so little for the cause of temperance. There is not a man in this Senate, or in the country, who would not wish to exclude from election contests - from every thing in fact - the disastrous effects of intoxicating liquors. We should do this as far as wo can, undoubtedly ; but in a case where we are merely legislating according to theory, it is well for us to consider whether we shall accomplish any good practical results. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> is perfectly consistent, because he objects to the clause in whatever shape it is put. The Senate in the first instance approved of a clause of the most stringent character, to which the House of Representatives objected, and we now have to consider the best course to take in order to include in the Bill some provision of a similar kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and others who think with him believe that it will be best to adopt a provision similar to that in the Queensland Act. Those who believe that the use of licensed premises for election purposes should be restricted should concur in sending the clause back to the House of Representatives in a modified form. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles</inline> has overlooked clause 190a - a new clause, which makes it an illegal practice for any person without the authority of the candidate to spend money on his behalf. </para>

But I wish to point out that when the members of the labour party have referred to the closing of public-houses at election times, they have only intended to indicate the trend of public opinion. We do not propose that public-houses shall be closed on election day. An amendment of the law in that direction at one time formed a plank in the political I platform of the labour party in Queensland, but it was concluded that it would fall far short of accomplishing its object, because it would be impossible to prevent candidates or their agents from having barrels of beer on draught in their committee rooms or. tents. Honorable senators have not sufficiently recognised the fact that those who are advocating this clause have had experience of its benefits in Western Australia and Queensland, and that the opposition comes from those who represent States in which no such law has hitherto existed. </para>

                        <para>- It will be remembered that one or two clauses which refer to the method of trying disputed elections were postponed. We have now come to a proposal of the other House to alter the heading of Part 17 from " Court of Disputed Returns" to " Committee of Elections and Qualifications," and it will be convenient now, I presume, to have a general discussion on the question of whether disputed returns shall be settled by a court or by an Elections and Qualifications Committee. I anticipate that there will be a very great difference of Opinion, and that, as usual in similar discussions, we shall find each honorable senator leaning somewhat to the practice which has prevailed in his own State. I have noticed that in a great many cases we are rather inclined to adhere to the method in vogue in our own State. I know that many honorable senators have their own views as to which is the best system to adopt, but I submit that at this stage we should consider the desirability of deciding on some method. There is apparently a difference of opinion between the Houses, as well as a difference of opinion between individuals ; and it is absolutely necessary, if we are to get the Bill passed, to decide on the plan which is to be adopted. I know that one of the arguments which are used in connexion with the ordinary Elections and Qualifications Committee is that partisanship cannot be excluded from its decisions ; that whether it exists or not, there is always a suspicion that questions have been decided according to the political predilections of its members. In Queensland, after a great deal of discussion, we adopted an elections tribunal, consisting of a Judge of the Supreme Court and six assessors who were members of the House concerned. In choosing the assessors indifferently from both sides of the House, it was hoped that we should get a jury, if I may use that expression, who might be considered to be fairly impartial. In the first session, after the passing of the Act of 1887, it became the duty of the Speaker to lay his panel of twelve assessors on the table. The law provided that from this panel each of the parties should be entitled to strike off three, which would leave six to try the petition. It was found that the Speaker had taken seven members from one side and five from the other, giving a majority of two to one side. The position taken up by the , Government party - of course, the stronger party - was that in proportion to numbers seven from the Ministerial side was relatively equal to five from the Opposition. It was necessary that there should be seven members chosen from one side and five from the other in order to preserve the proportion between parties. Then. - apparently it had not been noticed in the first place - each party struck off the panel the names of the three who were most likely to be opposed to its views. That left a jury consisting of four members from one side and .two from the other, so that there were exactly two to one in favour of what may be regarded as the stronger side. Eventually we found that the undesirable element of partisanship was more pronounced than it had been before. It is true that the method introduced a Judge and judicial ways, but it did remove the element of partisanship. The general .feeling was that from that point of view we were in no better position than we were in with the Elections and Qualifications Committee, when seven members of the House were chosen indifferently from both sides. </para>

                        <para>- Not at aU. What I am showing is that, by the adoption of that election tribunal, we did not arrive at a better result than we did when we had an Elections and Qualifications Committee. The committee was constituted of seven members chosen from both sides of the House. If the first seven members who were selected by the Speaker or the President, as the case might be, were not satisfactory to the House, then his nomination could be objected to from time to time until he had nominated seven who really were the choice of the House. </para>

                        <para>- I have not said that I am. Originally the Bill provided for a reference of election petitions to the High Court of the Commonwealth, which of course has not yet been constituted. The Senate amended its provisions so as to provide for a Count of Disputed Returns, and the other House now proposes that we shall have an Elections and Qualifications Committee, which at all events is the ancient method of settling election disputes. </para>

                        <para>- This amendment involves seven printed pages of new clauses. Surely it is due to the other House that .we should state the reasons which prompt us to decline tt&gt; accept their new clauses ? I do not believe that there is such unanimity in the committee as some honorable senators seem to think. I give the members of the other House every credit for believing that in their opinion the new clauses are in the interests of purity of elections and purity of Parliament. At the same time I think that the Senate takes the right view when it proposes that election disputes should be decided by a court. Experience in the Senate, as well as in the States Parliaments, has shown that in the case of a disputed election the members of the House concerned are likely to be biassed, unconsciously it may be, by party interests. Disputes are decided on that very unfair basis. In Queensland we have had considerable experience of courts of disputed returns composed of Members of Parliament, and I am sure that if the Queensland people had an opportunity of expressing an opinion, it would be in favour of the establishment of a court outside Parliament. Some honorable members of another place fear that if election disputes are to be decided by the Supreme Court, the law's delays and legal quibbles will interfere with a just decision. But I would remind them of a clause in this Bill which says that the Judge must decide such cases according to the merits, and as a matter of equity and good conscience, without regard to legal forms and technicalities. Therefore, the interests of members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate will be protected by a court of disputed returns outside of Parliament. </para>

                    <para>- Although my experience of election disputes has been comparatively small, such experience as I have gained is rather in favour of having a committee than a court to settle such matters. No doubt most of us have in mind a certain disputed return in connexion with the Senate. I will admit that that case had some unpleasant aspects. But, notwithstanding that, I am convinced that it is better to settle such disputes by means of a committee. Some reference has been made to partisanship. My opinion is that no matter how we frame «, clause dealing with this sort of thing we cannot get away from prejudice and partisanship. The mere fact of a man putting on a gown and wig and sitting in a court does not alter his character. I fail to see how a piece of silk and a horsehair wig make any difference. A man who is actuated by proper motives in one instance will be just as much subject to them in the other. There is more safety in numbers than in submitting cases of this kind for settlement by one individual. We have in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> a man whose legal ability gives him as high a place in the ranks of his profession as is held by any lawyer in the Commonwealth. But even his best friends - even he himself - will admit that he is subject to prejudice at times. </para>

                    <para>- We should not be adopting a wise course if we allowed . this matter to go by without discussion, because the House of Representatives should be furnished with some reasons as to why. we disagree with its amendments. I think we can easily furnish those reasons. I am strongly of opinion that we ought to reject the amendments made by another place. Some of those who advocate the establishment of an Elections and Qualifications Committee do so on the ground that to remit such cases to a court involves heavy expenditure. But some such- "cases have been dealt with by committees of the Federal Parliament. In one of those cases - which concerned the other House - I know, as a matter of fact, that the expenses cost the individual affected £180 for one legal bill only. It is idle, in the face of such a fact, to say that a parliamentary tribunal is cheaper than a court. In regard to partiality, I admit that a committee of Parliament might be impartial if one party were in a majority, but when the parties are equally balanced, and one vote would make all the difference to one party or the other, where would the impartiality come in? Have we sufficient confidence in parties to say that we shall be likely to get unbiased decisions- from them <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is true that our Judges are to a large extent chosen from the members of political parties. But I have sufficient confidence in the bench to believe that when they leave the political arena they leave party spirit behind them. We have to choose between political partisans who are still in the political arena, and persons who, having left the political arena, are no longer responsible to any political party. I think a strong expression of opinion should go forth from the Senate on this subject. I am somewhat surprised that some of the older parliamentarians do not express their views. It is they who should lead in this matter. </para>
