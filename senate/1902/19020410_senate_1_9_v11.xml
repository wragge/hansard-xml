They were allowed to land in Melbourne, as it was their intention to return to the ship. They, however, decided to stay in Melbourne. They have since gone overland to Sydney and Brisbane. It was ascertained . that they were gentlemen travelling under the auspices of the Japanese Government for the purpose, among other things, of making inquiry into the system of sugar growing in Queensland, with a view to the utilization of that knowledge in the Island of Formosa. They were reported to be cultivated gentlemen, here on a short visit only, and with no intention of establishing anything like permanent settlement in the country. The whole of the circumstances were reported immediately to the Prime Minister, who decided that it was not a case in which the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act should be applied. I would refer the honorable senator to section 3, sub-section (e), of the Act. </para>

I think the debate ought to be continued in order to give medicine to a sick mule. Even although we may be almost unanimously in favour of enfranchising women, what we do will have an effect in other places. Only two out of the six States have female franchise, and we are endeavouring to compel the other four to adopt it. </para>

                            <para>- In some States they have, but not in all. In Queensland, for instance, it has not been adopted by the Legislative Assembly simply because we have a very bad franchise, and the popular will is never given effect to. Notwithstanding the fact that there is apparent unanimity in favour of the Bill, there is an undercurrent of antagonism manifested by several honorable senators, notably by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> the leader of the Opposition, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney.</inline> While they were quite willing to agree to the Bill, they took particular pains to point out the evil results which would follow from its acceptance. On a big question which involves very large interests, which concerns fully one-half of the population of each State, a public man is not justified in assuming a " yes-no " attitude. There can be no question that Senators Symon and Harney assumed that position; whether they believed in it ' or not we do not know. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> said that the Vice-President of the Executive Council had only "dug up" this Bill for the amusement of honorable senators ; and, presumably, for the readers of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and those who sit in the gallery. I absolutely deny that the enfranchisement of women is a matter of amusement to anyone. It is one of the most serious questions we have to deal with. It ought to be treated here, not as a matter of amusement, but as a serious matter of public business. Judging by his speech there is no .doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> did feel that it was .only a kind of theatrical entertainment. He believed that it was not right that woman should get a&gt;. vote, and yet he was going to give her one. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney,</inline> he believed that if we gave the franchise to the band-box woman - the little butterfly who is to be put under a glass case on the mantelpiece - she would be denied, degraded, and dishonoured. At the same time he manifested his affection for that woman by giving. her a vote ; and it followed, as a natural consequence, that she was to be defiled, degraded, and dishonoured. The question has been asked - Why all this hurry about the introduction of the Bill1! The enfranchisement of women is a matter of very urgent necessity. It is a measure of justice which has long been delayed. There is no particular pressure of other public business. We have a breathing spell in which we can afford to turn our attention to the doing of justice to half the population, and that the better half. Why should not the Government take advantage of that opportunity to introduce the Bill ? If, after the Tariff or any other big question had been dealt with, they were to try to force this Bill through without full and free discussion, there would be some reason to growl and complain. But they have taken the most opportune moment available to bring forward the Bill. It has been urged that the necessity for the Bill has not been proved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> - that all he set out to prove was that it was desirable. If a Bill is desirable, why is it not necessary? If anything is desirable, certainly it is necessary ; and this Bill is urgently necessary. We must not forget the fact that before very long federal elections must bo hold. At a certain time one-half of the members of the Senate will have to retire, and a new House of Representatives will have to be elected ; and those who are to represent the manhood and womanhood of the Commonwealth must be elected on a federal franchise. We do not usually pass a Bill one day, and hold an election under its provisions the next day. Quite a number of things have to be done before an election can be held. Persons, both male and female, have to qualify in order to get votes or to become candidates, and the sooner the necessary machinery is set in motion to give every adult person the opportunity to exercise the full rights of citizenship the better it will be. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> is to be congratulated on the fact that he lias taken the earliest opportunity to provide the necessary machinery to have the federal elections worked harmoniously and to the best advantage of the electors. I propose now to deal as rapidly as possible with some of the objections which have been urged against the Bill. I must give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> great credit for his straightforward attitude and his outspokenness. He does not believe in female suffrage. He believes that it will not only work harm to the Commonwealth, but will not be conducive to the best interests of women, and therefore he is quite prepared to vote against the Bill. While Senators Symon and Harney agree on the main proposition with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> they are going to help to pass the Bill into law. In other words, while they love the woman they are going to injure her. It has been urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> and others that it will be an infringement of State rights for this Parliament to pass the Bill. It will be no infringement of State rights. All that we propose to do is to fix the franchise for the election of those who shall represent the Commonwealth in its Parliament. We do not propose to interfere in the slightest degree with the franchise that governs the representation, of the people of the State in the local Parliament. The Bill has no more to do with the State franchise than with the municipal franchise. All it does is to settle b}' what means the people of the Commonwealth shall be represented in its Parliament. It has nothing at all to do with the State Parliaments. But, even supposing it had, to urge that we should refer this question back to the State Parliaments is to my mind a most absurd proposition. Take the State of Queensland. What possible chance has the great female population of that State of getting the vote there, through the action of the local Parliament ? I am one of those who, with the assistance of my colleagues - the present Postmaster-General was the leader of our party at first on this question - tried to get women's suffrage acknowledged by the State Parliament of Queensland, but without avail. If the public will had been able to operate, there can be no doubt that female franchise would have been secured in Queensland long ago. What blocked it <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> We have a franchise system there that is absolutely a disgrace to any civilized community. A few little commercial centres dominate by the plural vote the whole of the residential vote ; and it is the conservative party, taking every advantage of their privilege through a bad Electoral Act, that has prevented the accomplishment of one-man-one-vote and the exercise of the franchise by the female citizens of the State. To urge that the question should be allowed to be settled by a Parliament that is dominated in that manner is one of the most absurd propositions that I have ever heard in the whole course of my political existence. We might as well ask the unemployed to demand work from the employers of labour as. ask the females of the State of Queensland to demonstrate, by an overwhelming majority - the phrase used, I think, was to make an " unmistakeable demonstration" - that they want the vote. I do not require an overwhelming majority, or any unmistakeable demonstration to convince me of the necessity for conferring the franchise upon women. What we are providing for in this Bill is the recognition of the right of the female portion of our community, who are over a certain age, and are neither idiots nor criminals, to have the right to get their names on the roll ; and they can please themselves afterwards whether they exercise the franchise or nob. </para>

                            <para>- As men do- exactly. It has been said, during the course of the. debate, and I notice that a very respectable, undoubtedly able and' illuminating newspaper in Melbourne, in commenting upon the debate last evening, has pointed out, following <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> that the female vote would create a kind of domestic tyranny, and that as the husband voted, so would the wife, the mother, the daughters, and the sister or sisters-in-law vote. It is argued that this would aggravate the evil of plural voting. It is supposed that one man - say his name is McGregor - who has neither mother, wife, sister nor daughter, goes to the poll. He has only one vote ; while it is alleged that another man, his neighbour - say his name is Higgs- his mother, wife, sister and daughter, go to the poll, and consequently exercise four votes in addition to his own. . I <inline font-style="italic">am</inline> very much concerned to find the man who has no mother. </para>

If she is dead she cannot get her name on the roll. The same thing applies to a man. If he is dead he cannot vote even though his name be on the roll, unless perhaps in " The model State,", where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> who is a fine electioneering agent, may be able to plump the " cemetery " vote. That is the <inline font-style="italic">only</inline> way I can see whereby the vote of the dead mother could come in. The argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and of the pocket-book edition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> - that the one who wears the trousers is absolutely " the boss " of the household rests upon an assumption which I absolutely deny. </para>

                            <para>- It is absolutely untrue. I am glad to find, however, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> has enough energy left after his effort last night to contradict my remark. I believe that he also made the observation that we were thrusting the vote upon the women. But there is no compulsion whatever in this Bill from beginning to end. I challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> to show that there is even a suggestion of compulsion in this measure. Not that I do not believe in compulsion. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council brought down a provision making it the duty or every man and woman eligible to vote to record his or her vote, I would support him, because I believe that it is the sacred duty of every man and woman, not only to themselves, but to the rest of the community, to record the votes which the law gives to them. But all that this Bill provides for is that those who desire to exercise the full and free rights of citizenship, apart from sex altogether, shall be able to do so, and that there shall be no disability so far as sex is concerned. If some women do not like to have their names placed upon the roll, and to exercise the franchise, they will be at liberty not to put their names on the roll ; and, even if they do, they will be at liberty not to use the right - though, for my own part, I believe that the name ought to be struck off the roll if the elector will not vote. I cannot understand how a seasoned, hardened, experienced politician like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who understands English, and, I presume, has read the Bill, can say that there is any such provision of compulsion in it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney,</inline> in the beginning of their addresses, elevated woman into a goddess. She is, according to them, an angel of light and love. She can do nothing wrong. She is a being especially created by God to come down upon earth and redeem degenerate man. But afterwards woman was represented to be everything that was evil and vicious and unreliable ; and though she might be trusted with our honour, our reputation, and, more than all, our banking account, they feared that she could not be trusted to wield a little pencil and strike out the name of a man she did not want to represent her in Parliament ! The two positions seem to me to be absolutely at variance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> particularly, seem to me with the left hand to lift up woman and caress her on the cheek, and then to crash her to the ground with a blow on the point with the right. </para>

He is not compelled to do so on that ground. It is desirable that we should have uniform electoral laws, but the Vice-President of the Executive Council has not invited any honorable senator to do violence to his conscience or his convictions, in order that that may be secured. If an honorable senator honestly believes that by granting the franchise to women we shall not only do her harm, but militate against the progress and prosperity of the whole community, it is his duty as an honest man to vote against the Bill, notwithstanding any desire for uniformity in the electoral laws of the Commonwealth. I come now to a question which in my opinion deserves serious attention. It will be remembered that' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> in that lofty style of which he is a past master - and which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> makes great efforts to imitate - gave us a lecture last night on the noblest function of womanhood. I am sure that every honorable senator listened with rapt attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> eloquent words, to the pathetic tone of voice, with almost a sob in it, and to the beautiful language with which that sentiment- was expressed, and feebly imitated later on by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney.</inline> He told us everything that was likely to happen to a woman if she got into the turmoil of politics, and picked up the defiling pencil to scratch out somebody's name on a ballot paper. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney,</inline> who lifts up a woman with his left hand and knocks her down with his right, has just arrived. In these high flights of oratory we were told of the great mission for which woman had to live ; she was particulary designed to minister to the wants of mankind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> followed as an echo by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney,</inline> said that woman's mission was wifehood and womanhood ; that she should not bother about anything else, that her duty was to become a wife, and then to become a mother. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Her duty. <inline font-style="italic">It</inline> may be her pleasure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> is an older man than I am, and he may know more about the matter than I do. This, however, was the fine "hifalutin" sentiment expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney.</inline> I think both of them struck a very important point in relation to this Bill. The question of wifehood and motherhood is a somewhat delicate one, but it has to be faced, and understood, and thoroughly threshed out. The conditions of life to-day in all our large centres are such that the more intelligent, the more experienced, and more educated, women are afraid to accept the responsibility of wifehood. Even when they do so, many of them dread to take upon themselves the responsibilities of maternity. If we look closely into the statistics of the States, we shall find that the population is gradually falling off, that the marriage rate is decreasing, and that this is a subject of complaint, not only on the part of our statists, but also on the part of priests and parsons. The reason of it is, that the women of to-day who have an opportunity of education, possess intellects, and they refuse to hamper themselves or become hacks to anyone. They absolutely refuse to accept responsibilities which they see they are not likely to fulfil in a proper manner, in view of the conditions that operate around them. What is one of the suggested remedies for this ? It is, that we should allow a woman - an educated woman, who can pass the necessary test of intelligence, just as a man can do - to have a voice in the legislation of the country ; that, whatever her profession, occupation, or art, may be, she should have a voice in the affairs of the country, which will carry just as much weight as that of her brother or her son. I think that that is one of the means by which we shall be able to bring about a better understanding. I fail to see how it is that sex should be a disability. I have always understood that an ideal representative government is a collection of persons possessing a knowledge and experience of life, and wisdom enough to use it for the benefit of the general community. Can any one say that all knowledge and experience is concentrated in the male being '( As a matter of fact, there is a certain amount of knowledge and experience, which in the nature of things it is impossible for a man to know anything about. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> said last night that if we granted the franchise to women, it would really amount to nothing more than an extended roll. I deny that. It is because woman lives in a different domestic and social atmosphere week after week and year after year, and has an environment different from that of man, that we must give her the right to vote if we desire to have ideal representation. </para>

When the amendment indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> comes before us, I shall have more to say on this subject. I sincerely trust that, notwithstanding the jeers and jibes which have been hurled at the devoted head of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, he will persevere with the measure, be it late or early, and cany it into effect. I trust that when after the next Commonwealth elections the representatives of the different States attend here, honorable senators from Queensland, at all events, will be able to say, as those from Western Australia and South Australia can say now, that they represent the whole of the people of that State, and not merely one section. </para>

                        <para>- I did not intend at first to speak on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, but I do not wish to give a silent vote or to hide my views in any way. I always have held the opinion that the extension of the franchise to women would not benefit them. I hold that opinion still, although I agree with a good deal of what was said last night by honorable senators in relation to various matters affecting this question, and I do not think that the extension of the franchise to women will result in any harm. I agree also that possibly there may be no apparent change in politics. </para>

Municipal government is only a co-partnership in the management of cities, towns, and boroughs. It is to some extent of the same nature, but it is on an entirely, different plane from political government. We are not justified in forcing a franchise upon women which will not benefit them, and to which we know the majority of them are opposed. </para>

                    <para>SenatorFRASER.- No, I would not, but I used that as an argument to show that we cannot extend the franchise indefinitely. Woman has very many other duties to attend to. She naturally expects to be married, and very properly, because if she did not marry, the race would come to an end. If she is married she has to attend to her household and to her little ones, and if she does her duty as mothers do - as, at any rate, 99 per cent. of them do - she has her hands pretty full from morning until night. These are her duties, and they are very important duties, and if she performs them as the majority of mothers do, I say she ought not to be dragged unnecessarily into politics. </para>

                            <para>- I agree that to some extent they have not done it. There is nothing perfect upon the earth. While men, or women either, live upon the earth there will be imperfection. But so long as they do their duty honestly and according to their lights we cannot blame them. There is nothing perfect on the earth - not even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> though he is very near perfection. I say that to drag woman from her proper sphere into the turmoil of politics, which is very often not what it ought to be, is to drag her into a position which will not be to her advantage. In this State - to the credit of the State be it said - we have passed laws which are greatly in favour of the protection of women. A boy of 16 years of age is liable to imprisonment here if he tampers with a young woman of 18 or 19 years of age. </para>

                            <para>- I have said many a time that we ought to protect the boy in a case like that, and I say so here again. This is heaping up protection with a vengeance. I do not hide my views upon the matter, and I know that every honest woman will agree with what I say now. But this legislation only goes to show that man is prepared - and poor and miserable is the man who is not so prepared - to extend every possible protection to womankind. </para>

                            <para>- Woman naturally and properly clings to man. Naturally and properly, by an instinct born in her, she seeks the advice of man, and looks up to him for assistance and guidance. She looks to man with confidence, and man does not, as a rule, disappoint her. If he does, then he is a miscreant. I say that woman should not enter into the arena of politics, the turmoil of it, and the chicanery of it. I say that if she enters into the arena of politics herself ; if she is a unit, as has been contended here ; if she uses her own judgment and discretion in politics, she throws away all the advantages which have been extended to her from time immemorial. I say the one thing involves the other, and were </para>

What has been said with respect to the divorce laws is only a cry. Woman is the very first to forgive and forget all the past misdeeds of man if he is at all a decent sort of fellow. When men are not at all decent, when they knock unfortunate women about, and spend their earnings in public-houses instead of doing their duty to their households, the women are then naturally thrown upon their own resources, and are not the creatures that nature intended them to be. This Franchise Bill will not benefit woman, and she does not want it. It is casting difficulties upon her, and when it is passed, as I believe it will be, will this nation be any the better for it ? I deny that it will. How will the passage of this Bill bring any more comfort to the home ? I say that the passage of 50 such Bills would not bring one atom of benefit to the home in this or in any other country. On the other hand, in my opinion, it may create discord. I do not say that it will have that effect, to any great extent, because in 99 cases out of every 100 the wife will vote with the husband, the daughter with the father, the sister with the brother, and the effect will be only to multiply the family vote. In my home I shall have ten votes under this system instead of one. </para>

Uniformity is not an advantage in many cases, and it will not be an advantage here. The franchise in South Australia is an adult franchise, and the people have sent as representatives here good men and true. The franchise of New South Wales is the same as the franchise of Victoria, and the people of New South Wales have their representatives here, the same men whom they would have sent if the franchise had been extended to women. Where then is the advantage in the proposed change, and why all the anxiety to push this thing through <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I do not object to it because of the harm it will do.

                    <para>SenatorFRASER. - Women are not starving anywhere in the British Empire. In a British community, here or elsewhere, women have only to let their condition be known to be rescued from their troubles. If, unfortunately, a woman of noble nature will not let her case be known to any institution, she may suffer, and we admire a woman who suffers in that spirit. In Australia and other countries there is generosity to women. In this country there is abundant generosity to all who require assistance. It is not true that women are starving at home. Sometimes the man to whom a woman is tied makes her starve at home. It will be the same hereafter as heretofore, so that the Bill will not relieve such cases. It will accentuate the evil rather than otherwise. If the Bill is passed women will have the right to enter the Senate. That will be a very improper thing, and it will not conduce to the national advantage. </para>

                        <para>- Like the last speaker, I did not intend to address the Senate. The question has been pretty well thrashed out, and as there is only one dissentient to the Bill I do not know the reason why any speeches are delivered. I cannot understand why speeches are required unless it is because we wish to let our constituents know that we are in favour of giving the suffrage to women. Senator Fraser has raised the objection that a woman has not time to record her vote; that it will take her away from her household work. That is one of the old stale parliamentary platitudes we have heard expressed until they are quite endeared to us. Women vote at municipal elections throughout Australia, and it takes just as long to put a vote in the ballot-box for a municipal councillor as for a senator. One of the favorite reasons advanced against women's suffrage is that it will create dissension in the household ; that husband and wife, brother and sister, will disagree as to the candidate for whom they ought to vote. But the honorable senators who urge that reason tell us that there will be no dissension in their own household. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Eraser,</inline> for instance, said that not only will members of his family vote as he does, but that all his servants will follow his lead: Many honorable senators have congratulated the Government on the introduction of this Bill. I do - not intend to follow their example. I shall congratulate the Government when it becomes law. I do not know that a man is to be congratulated for doing his plain duty. It was certainly the duty of the Government to introduce the Bill this session, otherwise they would not have been obeying the wishes, and I think the expressed will, of the great majority of the people of the Commonwealth, or carrying out the Maitland speech. I can understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">Pulsford's position. He is consistent right through. He said - " I would not give any woman a vote, and I am not afraid or ashamed to say so." <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> was, to my mind, rather severe upon Senators Symon and Harney. The position they take <inline font-style="italic">\rp</inline> is quite consistent. They are lawyers, and no one knows better than a lawyer that laws are made to be obeyed. They break them, when they can, on behalf of their clients, but I do not know that personally lawyers are law-breakers. I believe they are more strict in the observance of the laws than is any other section. It seems to me that Senators Symon and Harney are quite consistent. They do not like to fly in the face of the will of their State Parliaments. They are here to represent their respective States, and they say - "Although we do not approve of a woman being enfranchised, still, in deference to the will of our State Parliament, we shall vote for this Bill." </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned senator may have made, that clear to some honorable senators, but he did not make it quite clear to me. Ever since I began to speak in public I have advocated that women should have the suffrage. I was amongst the first advocates of the principle, and I shall do all in my power to secure its enactment. Two dear old bogies, which I thought had been laid to rest for all time, have been trotted out again, but yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> in answer to an interjection of mine, said that although 34,000 women attend the polls in South Australia on one occasion, he was not aware that any woman had cause of complaint against the male electors. In season, and out of season, it has been advanced as a reason why women should not have votes that they would have to mix in all the turmoil of elections. That would have been an objection half a century ago ; but in these enlightened days, whoever hears of a row at a polling booth ? He may hear of a bit of fun at a public meeting, but there are no rows at polling booths. Another reason, advanced here time after time, is that, if enfranchised, woman would be carried away by her emotions - her likes or dislikes - to such an extent that the chances would be that she would vote for a young, handsome, plausible man.

That was proved to be the ease in South Australia by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> when he said that women's suffrage had made no difference ; that since its enactment the same men were returned as had been returned before, showing that the women indorse the sound common sense of their male friends.

                            <para>- I apprehend that the members of the Legislative Assembly knew the wishes of the women of the State. We must accept the members, of the popular Chambers as the exponents of the popular will. In Queensland it has never been introduced. Queensland has a nominee Upper Chamber ; New South Wales also has a nominee Upper Chamber. The other two States that have not women suffrage have elective Upper Chambers. The whole number of electors returning the members to the four Upper Chambers is only 143,000, while, on the other hand, the representatives of the people in the Lower Chambers have 716,000 electors behind them. These same electors have, time after time, elected members who have desired to give the franchise to women, but the Upper Chambers have thrown out the measures introduced for that purpose. I wondered once or twice, while listening to the debate yesterday, that the gasa.liers in this chamber did not fall on the heads of some of the speakers. I took good care not to sit under one of them myself. There has been nothing short of sacrilege in the speeches delivered in a place that was once the abode of the Victorian Legislative Council. I wonder that the ghosts of departed councillors did not appear, to protest against the utterances of my honorable friends who have supported the Bill. It is <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> inconsistency that a woman, should not have a vote, although she may employ a large number of people, and have a considerable stake in the country, whilst a Chinese gardener has the franchise. The woman may contribute as much to the taxation of the country as 50 Chinamen, yet she has no voice in making the laws which she obeys, and which, the Chinaman evades on every possible occasion. The Chinaman does not spend more than a few shillings a year on his clothing, and - if I may use such an expression - will live upon a bag of rice and the smell of an oil rag for six months. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that I do not know them. I should not be at all proud of the acquaintance of any coloured aliens. There is another matter to which I should like to refer before I sit down, i I cannot understand the inconsistency \ of any honorable senator who would shut out coloured aliens from Australia, and yet would confer a vote on those who are already here. It is true that under the Constitution we cannot deprive any one of a vote which he now possesses. That we must admit. But if I had my will I would not allow any coloured man who might come to this country to have a vote. I would not permit any more rights to be issued to any coloured aliens. </para>

                            <para>- No, I would not. So long as they obey the laws of the country I would treat them fairly ; but I would not give them a voice in the making of laws which they do not understand, especially as they have no voice in the making of the laws in the countries from which they come. I am glad that the Immigration Restriction Act will exclude nearly all of these coloured aliens in the future ; but I say again that if I had my way not one of those here now should be allowed to exercise the franchise. It seems to be a little bit inconsistent, when the Constitution tells us that in counting the population for the purpose of deciding upon the quota for the representation of the country in the other House, aboriginals are not to be included, that we should give votes to them. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is an important point. The Constitution declares that aboriginals shall not be counted, and yet under this Bill we are not merely going to give votes to aboriginal men, but to black gins. I hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will see his way clear to alter that. Those who are in favour of excluding coloured races from Australia do so on the ground that they believe in a white Australia. We have heard that phrase used so many times that it has become a little stale. But the very same gentlemen who advocate a white Australia do not mind giving Australia a piebald ballot-box. That is a matter that is worthy of some consideration. </para>

I happened to give offence to the honorable senator some time ago, and cannot withdraw that; but I do not wish to have any sort ©f ill feeling, and it is not worthy of any honorable member of this Chamber to keep up feeling about a little petty-minded thing of that kind. At all events I do not wish to be severe upon him. I know his little weaknesses. I have known him ever since I was a boy, and am aware that he has some good points. I have now said all 1 have to say about the measure. I shall vote for it, : and I am only sorry that the vote was not taken directly after the Vice-President of the Executive Council made his speech. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well for the previous speaker to express the opinion that the division might as well have been taken after the Vice-President of the Executive Council had made his second reading speech, especially as the honorable senator himself has occupied the time of the Senate in giving his own opinion on the measure. If others had shown an inclination to put into practice the principle of voting without speaking at an earlier stage of the debate I should have been content to follow them, but under present circumstances I feel compelled to follow the example that has been set by so many previous speakers. I congratulate the Vice-President of the Executive Council, not only upon the introduction of this measure, but upon the manner in which he submitted the motion for its second reading. The form of the debate that has taken place has fully justified the attitude that he took up. He did not enter into any discussion of the comparative intelligence of the sexes, or the capability of women for exercising the franchise, nor did he dwell at any length upon the inherent political right that a woman has equally with a man to register a vote in the selection of the persons who are to be intrusted with the government of the country. "What we have to consider is whether we are going to have a perfectly symmetrical law throughout Australia with regard to the franchise, or whether we are going to leave the varying franchises of the States as they are at present, with the possibility that they may be modified by the State Legislatures for State purposes, and thus affect the franchise of the Federal Parliament. I, for one, am of opinion that, apart altogether from what the State Parliaments have done in. the past or may do in the future, it is desirable that for the Commonwealth Parliament we should have one unvarying franchise throughout the whole Commonwealth. Otherwise it would be quite competent for any single State Legislature to modify its franchise to such" an extent for purely State purposes that the result would be that those elected to the Commonwealth Legislature for the various States would be elected on different principles altogether. Being in favour of an uniform franchise, I conceive that it is most desirable that we should level up the franchise rather than level it down. We have two States, Western Australia and South Australia, where woman suffrage has been in existence for some time. ' </para>

                            <para>- I used the phrase "level down" in the sense of restricting the franchise, and the phrase "level up" in the sense of extending it. My opinion is that we should extend rather than restrict the franchise. We should adopt the broadest suffrage that we find existing in any State. The broadest suffrage exists in Western Australia and South Australia. If we are agreed upon making the franchise uniform, we should adopt the broad suffrage 'that exists in those two States. </para>

                            <para>- Apart altogether from what seems to me to be the obligation . that devolves upon us, I most cordially support the principle pf female suffrage.

                            <para>- There was no necessity on the part of other honorable senators to come into conflict with the honorable and learned senators in question with reference to their attitude. "We have heard for many years the argument used, that to give women the suffrage would create, in many instances, at all events, dissension in the household in reference to political questions. Experience and observation on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> and of others who have had the same opportunities of witnessing the effect of the reform, have convinced them that that argument can no longer be used with truthfulness. The opponents of the reform are now driven to the extremity of saying that the result of conferring the franchise on women is not to create political dissension in the household, but only to duplicate or triplicate the vote of the "head of the household. Whether that be so or not, I do not think it is an answer to the proposal to confer the suffrage on women. I should think that the truth lies really between these two statements, between the argument that it would create dissension, and the argument to which opponents of the Bill are now compelled to resort, that the effect of granting the franchise to women will be simply to duplicate Or triplicate the votes. I cannot understand how, lifter listening to a debate of such length as we have had on this subject, some honorable senators who have also had an opportunity of discussing the question in this Chamber before, and who have given a vote upon it, should still resort to the arguments which imply that we are now about to enact that which would compel women to do something which the)' do not desire to do. We are asked - " Why should we force the franchise upon women? Why should we drag them from the domestic hearth to engage in the turmoil of politics ?" I think that honorable senators who have used that argument have done so simply by force of habit. There is no intention on the part of those who support this measure to force anything upon an unwilling woman. It is intended only to give her an option which she may or may not exercise at her own sweet will. It will be competent for her to register herself as an elector in the division in which she resides. It will be equally competent for her to disregard that option altogether. If we are satisfied that as a matter of justice a woman has an inherent right to a voice in the selection of the representatives of the people in Parliament, then I am of opinion that we should give her that right, and leave it to her absolutely whether she shall avail herself of it, or exercise it in any case, or in all cases. If only one-fifth of the womanhood of the country were desirous of exercising the franchise I do not think the want of any such desire on the part of the remaining four-fifths should prevent the one-fifth from attaining that right to which they are entitled by every principle of justice. I cannot agree with the honorable senator who spoke last in regard to the position of coloured aliens. I think that if we are going to admit the coloured alien into Australia under any terms or conditions, and if we are going to allow him to become a naturalized subject of the King, we must confer upon him all the rights of citizenship so long as he remains with us. So long as he remains with us he must have the same rights as a citizen of Australia. For that reason I shall not support the amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> has indicated he will move at a later stage. There are just one or two other matters in the Bill to which I should like to refer. I think that the leader of the Opposition, in an exceedingly hypercritical mood, intended yesterday to do with this Bill what some kind critics have been good enough to say he did with another measure that was before us - to knock it out, lock, stock, and barrel. He started with clause 5, and took exception to it because it provides that - </para>

As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon's</inline> criticism of clause 6, I think it was based either upon a misconception of the provisions of the clause, or was due to an entire failure to advert to the circumstances which now arise foi1 the first time in Australia.

                            <para>- The fact remains that the Postmaster-General has had his. name struck off the roll in Queensland, so that he is a senator for that State, although he is not,' at the present time,, an elector for it. He was an elector in the State of Queensland when returned for the State, and the object of this provision is to prevent occurrences of that character,, which might be very frequent. It is not. put in, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> suggested, simply that any honorable senator, or any honorable member of another place, shall continue to have some connexion with? the electorate for which he has been returned,, in order that he may help himself at any subsequent election. I have no further remarks to offer. I regret that the debate,, which was started by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, was not confined within the limits laid down by him in his terse and excellent speech. I hope to see the Bill pass through the Senate without any dissentient voice. The fear that, if it were allowed to pass without discussion, it might be said subsequently in another place, or outside the Legislature, that the measure had been put through the Senate hurriedly, before honorable senators had had time to think it over, is, I think, the best justification for the long debate which we have had on the motion for the second reading. </para>

                        <para>- It is not with the intention of flogging the dead horse to which reference has been made that I rise to make a few remarks on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, but rather with the idea that the discussion which has taken place here may have an influence beyond the Senate itself. We know that in the different States the fossilized remains of the opponents of adult suffrage are still endeavouring to exercise their influence ; consequently it is the duty of those who have always advocated the principle to do what .they possibly can to destroy that influence. Adult suffrage has been a plank in the platform of the party with which I am connected from the inception of that body, and every member of it has been gratified, not only by the number of conversions they have made, but by the number of partial conversions, a number having been almost compelled, if not induced, to go half way in the acceptance of the principle. I was rather amused to find that a number of half-converted honorable senators were prepared to speak with all the force and eloquence they possessed against this Bill, although for some reason or other they declared that while they were not going to vote for the Bill, they were not going to vote against it - that they were not going to call for a division. It is very kind of those honorable senators, who have maintained this desperate struggle so long, to take up that position. I am sure .that those of us who have been fighting so long in what we consider to be a right direction, must feel obliged to them. I once heard that many hundreds of years ago a general, who was going into battle, called on all those of his soldiers who would rather stop at home to do so, and ordered them away. He also adopted another test, by which his forces were reduced very considerably. I am satisfied that those who support this measure to-day would rather carry it without the assistance of those honorable senators who give only a qualified support to it. Some honorable senators who have spoken against the measure have declared that Western Australia and the State from which I come represent only one-fifteenth of the whole Commonwealth. I always understood that South Australia itself was more than one. tenth of the Commonwealth, and surely Western Australia must be counted as something, although these States may not be so populous as are others. It has been contended here that the women of Australia do not want the franchise ; in fact, we have been told that if they were appealed to 99 per cent, would declare that they did not desire it. In contradiction of that statement, I desire to give the experiences of South Australia. Senator Symon supplied us with a set of figures which I consider were very misleading, and had nothing to do with the subject. I wish to point out that in South Australia the result of the extension of the franchise to women has been that there are 75,000- women on the roll as against 83,000 male voters. What does that mean <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It must mean that some very strong influence has been used on the women of South Australia to make them get their names on the roll to such an extent. When I tell honorable senators that in South Australia the applicant for a vote has to fill up a claim and sign it, they .will see that it was impossible for any one to put this large number of female voters on the roll without their own consent. I am sure that the women of South Australia are not so chicken-hearted as to attach their signatures to any document without thoroughly understanding* what it means. I can point to four out of the 27 districts that were in South Australia before the recent amendment of. the Constitution, on the roll of which there were more female voters than male voters. I can also say that two of those districts were not metropolitan or suburban districts, but exclusively country districts. So that all the arguments that have been used with respect to the difficulty of getting women to put their names on the roll entirely fall to the ground on the experience of South Australia. Then again, the electors for the more numerous House in South Australia were asked whether they would have adult suffrage for the Legislative Council,. and by nearly three to two they declared in favour of it. What better evidence than that do honorable senators want? I have not the least doubt that the people of other portions of the Commonwealth have exactly the same feelings, inclinations, and aspirations as the people of South Australia. It has been said in the characteristic speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> - and that reminds me that in 1889 that honorable senator, although he did not speak against women's suffrage in the Legislative Council of Victoria, interjected against it and voted against it. But in the year following that, he interjected against it and he did not vote at all, and I am hoping from this gradual process of melting down, that this time, instead of abstaining from voting, he will vote in favour of it. He will then only be following out the tactics he has adopted in the past. First he voted against it, and then he did not vote at all. </para>

                            <para>- People pair from a great many motives, and it is true that the honorable senator mav have been absent. That; is what the prophets of the Lord said to the prophets of Baal, that their god was probably asleep, or was out. hunting. That was very likely the case with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser,</inline> as the god of the anti-franchise at that time. From that experience, seeing that in one year the honorable senator voted against the female franchise, and in the next year he did not vote at all, the natural sequence will be that this year he will vote for it. </para>

                            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> wishes me to deal with his arguments I can only tell him that they were of such an insignificant character as to be hardly worth mentioning. I wish to point out the position of the suffrage question in South Australia, so that there shall be no misunderstanding or misconception in the minds of honorable senators or in the minds of 'the members of the Parliaments of the States. It is for that reason I rose, but I think I have a right to point out to honorable senators the position which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> occupied in connexion with this matter. From what he has said here, the honorable senator does not seem really to know where he was. He does not know whether he paired or was absent when the question was being decided, and I hope that on this occasion his full senses will have returned to him, and he will vote in favour of this measure. I should like to say a word on the change of front that has been presented to the supporters of this movement by those who used to oppose it so earnestly. What were the arguments used in the days that have gone by? I have listened to them very often, and I am sure that Senators Pulsford and Fraser recollect them very well. The arguments were that women would be better at the wash-tub or mending their husbands' stockings. </para>

                            <para>- If a woman has the time and the inclination to attend political meetings why should she not do so ? Again, I point out that the experience of South Australia has taught a lesson in that respect. There was a time when political meetings were not all that they ought to have been. They were not the creditable gatherings that civilized people should look to for the selection of those whom they wished to represent them in Parliament. But, since the women of South Australia have secured what is really their right, they attend these political meetings, and the character of those meetings has been changed. The people listen to what the candidates have to say, and, from what cause I am not going to say, the meetings are much more largely attended, and are of a much more satisfactory character than ever they were before. Then, with respect to the polling booths, to which, it is said, we ought not to bring the women of Australia. There may have been a time when the conduct of males at polling booths was not all that it ought to be. But in South Australia that is entirely changed, and at every polling booth I have attended the conduct has been more like the going to church of the people than anything else. They go there earnestly and eagerly, to do what they consider to be their duty. And the influence of woman has brought all that about. Notwithstanding what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> has said, I would like to ask honorable senators, is that not one of the good things that have been brought about by the advent of women into politics? Then, there is the cry that in those States in which women have secured the franchise, the expectations of its advocates have not been realized. I say that the anticipations of those who have always supported adult suffrage have been more than realized. If we go back to the early history of the colonies, from the time when men were first put upon the roll until we had manhood suffrage, we will find that, after 30 or 40 years, the percentage of men on the roll and going to the poll was not nearly as great as the percentage of women on the roll and going to the poll when they had enjoyed the right for only four or five years. Then it is said that the influence of women is not yet apparent. A couple of <inline font-style="italic">days</inline> after the vote which established the Commonwealth, I often heard people saying - " Now you have got federation, what good has it done you ? " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Eraser,</inline> only half-an-hour ago, uttered an expression of a somewhat similar character. He told us that federation is not so popular now as it was twelve months ago. </para>

We have had manhood suffrage in some of the States for 50 years, and its influence has only grown gradually. It is exactly the same with the admission of women into politics. We are not going to notice any drastic change after the first, second, or third election. We must give them the same time to enable their influence to work. I hope that honorable senators will look at the question in this manner. There should be no necessity to repeat the arguments used in this debate, in support of women's suffrage. I hope we shall never hear again the clap-trap which has been talked in opposition to this measure. Look at the position. Senator Fraser tells us that his vote is to be increased tenfold, and many others are in exactly the same position. It is against human nature to imagine that the man who is afraid to give his wife or daughter a vote, and so double or treble his own voting power, is sincere in opposing the Bill. </para>

Senator Fraser is afraid that some other influence may be exercised over the ten women under his control, and that they will not vote in the same direction as he does. Honorable senators have no compunction in asking women of the Commonwealth to do almost everything that is necessary towards securing their own comfort.

He will not take me on, because he knows that what he says is not according to the experience of the past. Again, we are told that we should look to the sanctity of the home - to the influence that women have to exercise in home life. Is not the woman who taught her boys, and gave them the cue to all their future actions as worthy of recording a vote at the ballot-box as are her sons? If honorable senators would only look at the question from the common-sense point of view they would see that the right of woman to the franchise is incontrovertible. They all acknowledge that her influence in home life has been for good. This is only a question of extending that good influence to the larger family of the Commonwealth. When honorable senators look at the question in that common-sense light they must - even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> himself must - who is as fossilized as a log 1,000 years old - recognise that the extension of this good influence is in the interests of the whole community. It is farcical to hear honorable senators talking of the benign influence that a woman exercises in the home life, and yet denying her the opportunity of extending that glorious influence to the national life of the Commonwealth. I hope that no honorable senator will have the temerity to call for a division when the question is put. </para>

                            - I have but very few words to say, principally because my anticipations with regard to the acceptance of the measure have been fully realized. It cannot be doubted that, though we have had some very bold speeches against the Bill, we have had other speeches giving what may be described as a grumbling assent to its enactment - speeches from honorable senators who admit that they are forced to retire by the overwhelming tide of public opinion from the position which they have occupied. Many of them have gracefully retired without so much as wetting their feet, but others of them - Senators Fraser and Pulsford - stand there until the overwhelming wave of public opinion washes them high and dry. I honour them for their action. What I have to do here is to put forward as much strength and argument as are necessary in favour of the measure which I have submitted. Honorable senators may be well assured that if I had not known well what the condition of opinion in the Senate was, and the reception of the measure was likely to be, I should have used, although perhaps not with anything like the same force or strength, many of the arguments which have been urged so admirably by some of its supporters. I hope it is not going to be taken as a test of a man's sincerity or earnestness in proposing a reform of this kind that he has said only a few words in its support. I expressly cut down what I had to say, because I did not think it was necessary to speak at length. I said, and I repeat, that I profoundly believe in the justice of this reform. I have the utmost faith in its efficacy, and I feel sure that the arguments which have been used, from the experience of the past, to the effect that women will not use this privilege, are based on an absolute misconception of the facts, and fail to take into, consideration an element which we must all consider, that in public affairs woman is now only undergoing the first stage of a. process of education which cannot fail to last for some years. It is a little over 30- years since Mill wrote his great work on
                            <inline font-style="italic">The</inline>
                            <inline font-style="italic">Subjection</inline>
                            <inline font-style="italic">of Women</inline>
                            - a phrase which properly described the condition of women at that time. If honorable senators will cast their eyes back over the intervening period and compare the condition of women, not in political affairs only, but in social and industrial life, they will see that woman in those days was treated as one of God's creations, it is true, but as designed altogether for a different purpose than that for which the lord of creation was designed, and to occupy for ever an inferior position in the scheme of the universe. It has only taken 30 years to make an immense difference in that respect. During that period woman has been educated, and it is impossible to affirm what the result of this reform will be until the education of woman in public affairs has been completed. "We cannot too often or too earnestly remember what has been very well put by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline>
                            that it is a good thing that the children who will become the men and women of the community ought to be educated into an intelligent grasp of public affairs. So it is most important that the mother, who more than anybody else has the control of all education, should be invested with that actual interest in public affairs which the right to exercise the franchise alone will give, which will enable her to bring up her sons, not only with strong arms and sinews, and well educated to take their place in the world, but with a sense of responsibility in public affairs, and a public spirit and patriotism, without which we never can breed true Australians.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline>
                            has accused me of digging up this measure. It was one of the earliest pieces of legislation prepared by the Secretary for Home Affairs. For many years he has taken a deep interest in the question of electoral reform, and particularly in the question of extending the franchise to women. It was his earnest desire to introduce the measure in the other House. It was only upon his recognising that it was in the interests of the business of the Government and in the interests of the measure itself that it should be introduced here that he gave up what was to him, as honorable senators can well understand, not only a duty, but a privilege. I cannot allow the debate to close without expressing my sense of the public spirit which has actuated my honorable colleague in giving up his right to introduce into the legislature a measure which he had taken so much trouble to prepare in order that it might be dealt with at the earliest possible moment. I think honorable senators will recognise that not only the Senate but the Legislature generally has become alive to the necessity for the passage of this measure. This and the Electoral Bill which has been sent from the Senate to the House of Representatives is necessary to cany out a reform of our electoral franchise, and I sincerely hope that the measure will become law at a very early date, if not this session at all events very early in the next session. Some other matters of interest have been referred to, which perhaps will be dealt with in committee. I allude specially to the matter brought under notice by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles,</inline>

                            and concerning which that honorable senator has given notice of an amendment which the committee will consider later on. I have now to express my gratification that although perhaps there may have been no necessity, for the purpose of informing the Senate, for the speeches that have been made in support of the Bill, yet that so many admirable expositions of it have been given from our side of the question, which will enable the public and our honorable friends in the other branch of the Legislature to realize the strength of the arguments and of the opinions which undoubtedly prevail in favour of this reform of our representative system.

                            <para>- The point of order raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> is very important in one aspect. He has very properly directed attention to section 41 of the Constitution. But I submit that the question raised is a constitutional question, and that if he is right the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> would render the measure unconstitutional, and inoperative to the extent that it is unconstitutional. But I submit that it was never intended that a constitutional question of this kind should be decided as a question of order in either House of the Parliament. It would be a very serious thing indeed if the Legislature were prevented from discussing a matter simply because of the provisions of the Constitution. It will be within the recollection of honorable senators that this point was raised some time ago, when a discussion was initiated in regard to section 51 of the Constitution, which contains the 39 articles or subjects for legislation by the Commonwealth Parliament. There was a motion before the Senate in regard to State assurance, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> raised the point that the matter could not be discussed because the terms of the motion travelled beyond the legislative power's given to the Commonwealth Parliament. The ruling of the President was invoked, and he decided. - if I may say so, with absolute correctness - that it was a constitutional question, and not a question of order, and that it was never intended that these constitutional questions should be ruled upon as questions of order. There are provisions of the Constitution' relating to the contents of Bills, and other matters of that sort, in regard to which some question may be raised. I do not profess any opinion about that. But I submit that in regard to this section of the Constitution, the validity or invalidity of a proposal has to be determined, not as a matter of order by the presiding officer in either House of Parliament, but is a question in the first place for the Senate itself to decide upon, and in the next place if the Senate comes to a wrong conclusion it is for the High Court of the Commonwealth to decide it. Of course, effect can be given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs'</inline> view by a vote of the committee. But 1 suggest that it would be a very dangerous thing for a matter of this kind to be decided upon a point of order. </para>

Little has been achieved beyond a monster petition ; despite the platitudes of vote-catching Ministers, the Bill was relinquished in the lust Parliament amid ribald laughter, and this session it has been dropped with a silence which is even more contemptuous. </para><para>I know that the statements that I have made and will have to make will not be welcome to many honorable senators, but I intend to show beyond all doubt that this measure is being forced upon us against the general feeling and against the general tendency of legislation in Anglo-Saxon countries. We heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> a little while ago about the wonderful way in which the women of South Australia had placed their name* upon the electoral rolls of that State. He told us that the names of 70,000 - practically all the women of that State - appeared on the rolls, but he did not enlighten us in regard to the way in which the electoral rolls of South Australia are prepared. I believe the truth is that, as in New South Wales, the police in South Australia obtain the names of those who are entitled to vote. A policeman call3 from house to house and, in South Australia, also carries with him the forms which have to be signed. That is the way in which practically the names of all the women are got together, yet the fact that so many women in South Australia are on the rolls has been presented to us as a proof that they are at one in desiring to have the suffrage. I should like to give the committee some idea as to the extent to which women in the United States have shown their desire for the suffrage when they have had an opportunity of doing so. The <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopedia</inline><inline font-style="italic">qf Social Reform,</inline> a comparatively new book published in New York, and which some honorable senators, may know, gives the following quotation from a tract entitled "Tested by its. Fruits " :- </para><quote>
                        <para>How small is the proportion of women who really wish the ballot mav be inferred from the "referendum" upon the question of municipal suffrage for women, taken in Massachusetts in 1895. The opportunity was given to women at that election, without any expense, or any trouble beyond that of registering and voting,, to say whether they wanted municipal suffrage. Out of about 575,000 women entitled to vote, only 22,204 expressed <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> desire for the ballot. In Massachusetts, therefore, where the suffrage agitation has been as active as anywhere in the Onion, less than 4 per cent, of the women want to vote. Assuming that this ratio holds generally, the suffrage proposition is that the ballot should be forced upon the 96 per cent, of indifferent or reluctant women, because the 4 per cent, wish it. </para>

                        <para>A European cannot spend an evening in an American drawing-room without perceiving that the attitude of men to women is not that with which he is familiar at home. The average European man has usually a slight sense of condescension when lie talks to a woman on serious subjects. Even if she is his superior in intellect, in character, in social rank, he thinks that as a man he is her superior, and consciously or unconsciously talks down to her. She is too much accustomed to this to resent it, unless it becomes tastelessly palpable. Such a notion does not cross an American's mind. He talks to a woman just as he would to a man, of course, with more deference of manner, and with a proper regard to the topics likely to interest her, but giving her his intellectual best, addressing her as a person whose opinion is understood by both to be worth as much as his own. </para>
                    </quote><para class="block">It is a remarkable thing that in the country which, by universal consent, holds woman in the utmost reverence, womanhood suffrage has made the least progress. In view of that, and of the additional fact that the population of the United States is now well on to 80,000,000, it is idle for us to be told that we are depriving women of their rights ; it is idle to say that we are inflicting upon them an injustice by withholding the franchise from them, and great strength is added to my contention that the passage of such a measure as this will place a burden upon woman, and that it is not to their interests or to the interests of the State that they should bo asked to carry that burden. Strength is given also to my contention that the ultimate result of bringing woman into political strife in which men alone should take part, is not calculated to be a great and lasting good to the Commonwealth. We were told last night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that women suffered under many disabilities. If he had drawn aline between the States in which female suffrage exists and those in which it does not exist-if he had been able to say that in Western Australia and South Australia various disabilities under which women suffered had been removed, </para><para>And that in States in which woman suffrage is not in force they are oppressed with disabilities of any kind', there might have been some force in that argument. But there is no force at all in the argument as it has been brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and other honorable senators, that women have no voice in public affairs. Such is the competition between public men that any representation made by any large body of women could not fail to be completely considered, and if the views put forward were just and right it could not fail to have at an early date a marked influence upon the legislation of Parliament. I recognise that members of the committee do not see this question as I see it. I regret that that is so, but I am willing to believe that other honorable senators are actuated by principle, as I feel that I am actuated. I do unhesitatingly state that I believe the proposal put before us is not warranted - is not wanted - and that in no shape or form is it calculated to be beneficial to the State or beneficial to those in whose behalf it is specially put before us. </para></speech>

                        <para>- I wish just to point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> himself recognises that it is impossible for him to carry any amendment of this kind in the clause. In the first place, the power given us by the Constitution is to make a uniform electoral law. Section 9 of the Constitution is plain enough upon the point. We must make a uniform electoral law, and the law could not be uniform if the women of South Australia were to have votes and the women of Queensland were not to have votes. I do not see that we can consider the amendment for a moment. I do not intend to take up the time of the committee, because we see, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> sees himself, that he is almost alone. Indeed, it is a fortunate thing that he is. The honorable senator belongs to that type of politician who has opposed the progress and advancement of the rights of women ever since women's rights have been spoken of. I dare say that at the time when it was customary for a man to be able to sell his wife - and that is not so many hundreds of years ago - there were men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> who stood up for that privilege, and when a husband had the privilege of beating his wife provided he only gave her a few sharp strokes with a birch, there were men like the honorable senator who supported that. I have not done so before, but I now congratulate the Government upon bringing this measure forward, and upon having the privilege of placing Australia so far in advance of every other nation on the face of the globe in this respect. </para>

There is no man in this Chamber who would be less willing to promote or assist in the passing of any measure which he thought would be likely to act injuriously either to woman or man than myself. I do not consider the conferring of a vote upon women as giving them anything that will be of advantage to them. I look upon it rather as the infliction upon them of a burden. I am desirous that; they shall not be burdened with what I consider to be an "obnoxious duty. Because of that I am not to be slandered as a man who approves of wife-beating or wife-selling.

                            <para>- I think that in South Australia there is no such provision, but in all the other States there is a provision of this kind. I have drawn the clause in this form, because it appears to me that it is altogether beyond the grounds of what is right and practicable that the inmates of a public asylum living upon the charity of the Government or of the public, and unable to take any part whatever in public affairs, should have their names registered and be allowed to vote. I presume that in many of the States, as in New </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">South Wales, there -are large numbers of persons who are unfortunately obliged to seek relief in these public asylums, and I do not think it desirable on any ground to allow them the right to vote. If we once go beyond that, and provide, as is provided in some State Acts, that no person in receipt of charitable relief from a public institution, shall be allowed the right to vote, we embark upon a very wide field. Every one will admit that the receipt of an old-age pension is not a matter of charity, but something to which a man is entitled from the State in which he has lived for a certain number of years, which should not place the recipient in a position of mendicancy, and s':ould not deprive him of the right to a vote. In the case of a man who is getting this relief, and at the same time supporting his home, and discharging his duties as a citizen as well as he can, it would be unjust to deprive him of all political privileges. Again, it unfortunately happens, owing to the fluctuations of prosperity amongst all classes in the community, that persons temporarily receive relief from the Government, or from public institutions. It is hard to believe that those persons should be prevented from being put upon the roll as voters simply because they are in receipt of charitable relief for a time. The difficulty is to find a reasonable way between the extremes. I think that those who are unfortunately reduced to the position of living in a public asylum, and being dependent entirely upon public aid for subsistence, and who are withdrawn absolutely from contact with ordinary life and public affairs,' should not be in a position to exercise full political rights. It seems to me that the only way to arrive at a fair settlement of the difficulty is by such an amendment as I propose. </para>

                        properly says, there is no reason why we should deprive a person of this right because he has obtained an old-age pension. True, he obtains the money from the State; true, he may be living entirely on that money, but he is not a criminal nor is he of unsound mind. Why then are we to deprive persons similarly situated of the same privilege ? Is it because they happen to live in an institution instead of wandering about the streets?

                        will see that in clause 5 he recognises that in the case of a criminal it makes no difference whether he is within the walls of a criminal institution or whether he is wandering abroad under the same ban. A person who is out on a ticket-of -leave or a license, has to be treated, while his sentence continues, in all respects in the same way as if he were within the walls of a gaol. Why not carry out the same principle in reference to persons having poor relief ? Some of them obtain State support by following certain rules within an institution, and others get from the State a weekly stipend which they spend as they think fit. What distinction is there between the two classes ? The only distinction we now recognise, as excluding a person from the suffrage, is that he is not an adult ; or, if an adult, that he is not of sound mind, or that he has shown a moral unsoundness by being in gaol. Do one of these things apply with greater force to a person who is resident within the walls of a charitable institution than to a person who is obtaining charity and is walking about the streets ? I think
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline>
                        will see that it is a distinction which ought not to be maintained, because it is illogical.

                        <para>- I entirely agree with everything that has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney.</inline> Any attempt to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has suggested is really a contradiction of the principles of the Bill. When we attempt to do these things we always get into the mud. The amendment distinctly refers to public institutions. Why should an aged man - or an aged woman - who has fulfilled all his duties in life up to the time when he was incapacitated and compelled, because there was no legitimate system of old-age pensions, to go into a public institution, be deprived of the right to vote?With respect to the qualification for a vote, what difference does it make whether a man is in a public or a private institution?' Are not private institutions, in which old men and women are taken care of by benevolent people, apart from the State altogether, in exactly the same position as public institutions, which have the special care of the poor, infirm, and destitute? I know a great number of aged persons who cannot be looked after by their relatives on account of distance, and very often a person subscribes an allowance to a public institution for the maintenance of a relative. One section of these men is in exactly the same position as the other, but this amendment will enfranchise the one and disfranchise the other. In South Australia, an inmate of a destitute asylum whose maintenance is borne by his friends in England or America, has as much right to a vote as has a man whose board at a lodging-house in Hindley-street is paid for by his friends. In that State we have extended the franchise to all unfortunate people. We recognise their past services in the development of the State, and they are still entitled to exercise the suffrage, and we do not classify them with either lunatics or criminals. I hope that honorable senators will see the difficulties with which we shall be confronted if we endeavour to tamper with the main principles of the Bill. We do not know the adversity and misfortune which may have led many a man into a charitable institution. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> will not persist with his amendment. I feel convinced that if he does, it will be defeated. </para>

                        <para>- It is not very surprising that in a country where the golden calf is so idolatrously worshipped as it is in Australia a provision of this kind should be sought to be enacted. In the eyes of some persons, to be poor is the greatest crime it is possible for a man to commit. I hope that this excellent measure will not be disfigured by the amendment. Senators McGregor and Harney have pointed out clearly its inconsistency. In Victoria an old-age pensioner is to be free to go about wherever he pleases and to record his vote like any other citizen, but a poor unfortunate person, who is so frail or infirm or friendless as to be provided with a refuge in an asylum, is- to be disfranchised. Where is the difference between the two individuals supported by the State? 1 agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> that it would not be fair to withhold the franchise from those who are temporarily receiving State assistance. But in the case of two men receiving assistance for the term of their natural lives, we are asked to enfranchise one and disfranchise the other. Why do we give very large pensions to our Judges when they are no longer able to satisfactorily perform their .duties ? Simply because we recognise that they did good service to the country while they had the ability and the capacity. We are attempting to carry the same principle right down to the bottom of the ladder. The man who breaks stones on the road is just as necessary to the well-being and progress of the community as is the mau who sits on the judgment seat. We do not look down upon a Judge because on his retirement he receives a pension. On the contrary, we say - " This man' did his duty well while he was able, and now the country provides for his wants." Very few working men are able to provide for their old age. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> said that the recipients of State relief are separated, so to speak, from the social and political life of the country. Why should not a man, although he is an inmate of a charitable institution, be allowed to take an interest in the affairs of his country? I know a number of inmates of charitable institutions in New South Wales who take a very keen interest in its politics. In many cases they had been ardent politicians and hard workers in the army of reform, and now, when they are no longer capable of taking their part in the work outside, they take a keen interest in the government of the country. I know that these men will be greatly disappointed if, by an amendment of this kind, they are deprived of the suffrage. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> will withdraw a portion of the amendment. No one objects to the provision that a person of unsound mind shall not vote, although I known considerable number of madmen who take part in politics. I move - </para>

                            <para>- The amendment which I have moved follows the terms of existing Acts, except that of South Australia. I admit at once, as I intimated when moving the amendment,- that it is difficult to draw the distinction which is the only one that can be drawn in order to carry a clause of this kind. An interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has pointed out another difficulty which to my mind is insuperable in the carrying out of the amendment. That is, that even if there is only one State which confers the franchise upon people in the condition mentioned, those people cannot be deprived of the vote ; and it would be a most unsatisfactory proceeding to give the franchise to those persons who happen to have it at the present time, and deprive others who are in the same position of it. Therefore I do not think it worth while to press the amendment in its present form, and I am agreeable to accepting the amendment upon the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline></para>

                        (Western Australia.) I would point out that no definition is given of the word " adult." Has the word a legal definition? We know the literary definition, but on turning to some legal books I find that the use of the word is doubtful. I find that Wharton's
                        <inline font-style="italic">Law Lexicon,</inline>
                        instead of defining " adult " as a person who has attained his majority and reached the age of 21, mentions many legal periods. So that 21 is not necessarily the age at which the adult stage is reached. My honorable and learned friend will know, from his legal experience, that there are many occasions when persons are treated as adults although they have not attained the age of 21. In some cases the age of eighteen is specified as that at which a# person is of full age for certain purposes. It would lead to confusion if the Bill were left in its present state.

                        <para>- I do not rise to oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart's</inline> amendment. Poverty .should be no bar to any person exercising the right to vote. But I wish to point out to some of my friends from Queensland that the carrying of the amendment would place in the hands of the Government of a State a weapon which might be used very unfairly. There are a considerable number of old people who are inmates of one or other of the benevolent institutions of Queensland. A Government might turn the votes of these people to considerable advantage to itself, by means of its officials, by manipulating them against the interest of a candidate to whom it was opposed. I should not dream of opposing the conferring of the suffrage upon any person who is in the unfortunate position of being placed in one of our eleemosynary institutions. No man should be debarred from his right as a citizen in consequence of his poverty. I, myself, have suffered from poverty on many occasions. I might say that I have been cradled amidst poverty. My whole sympathy goes out to those who are poor. But it is just as well to look at this matter from every point of view. Some of us have had to oppose the Government of Queensland on many occasions owing to intense conservatism. Might not that Government, through the officials of the benevolent asylum, endeavour to use the votes of the inmates against a candidate whom they did not wish to see returned <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I find from the annual report of the Benevolent Asylum of Queensland for the year 1900, that the men in the in'stitution numbered 845, and the women 163. If any Government were able to use the votes of these people, or if any rich man, by inducing his wealthy friends to spend money amongst them, prior to election, were able to influence their votes, it might be a dangerous weapon to use against any candidate who was not wealthy enough to adopt the same- methods. It may be said that in consequence of the fewness of the numbers of the inmates of these institutions, it* is not worth while to quarrel about the point. But, at all events, I thought it right to call attention to it. I repeat that I have no desire to deprive any man of a vote through poverty, but at the same time I do not want, if it can be avoided, to put into the hands of any State Government, a weapon which might be used by them to further their own particular ends. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to try to allay the fears of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> on this subject. The only point of view from which we should consider it is whether what is proposed to be done is right or not. AVe must come to the conclusion that the amendment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> agrees to accept is right, and, therefore, we cannot hesitate to accept it. If there were only an individual case in question, I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> would say at once that the person receiving relief should not be deprived of a vote. If he looks at the matter all round he will see that the same, principle applies to persons in benevolent institutions. This question was discussed in England many years ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey's</inline> observations bring to my mind a passage from William Cobbett's <inline font-style="italic">Advice to a Citizen.</inline> Cobbett, of course, was one of the old-time radicals of England, a man who did not fight with kid gloves on, but who spoke what was in his mind, and suffered because of the manner in which he expressed his very strong opinions. History has proved- his views to have been right. ' In the old country, 60 years ago, Cobbett inveighed against the proposal to deny the franchise to those who were receiving charitable relief. In the charitable institutions of Melbourne there are men who have occupied high positions in the land, and who have helped to make this country. They have lost hundreds of thousands of pounds, and in their old age have to find relief there. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has 'said so forcibly, we give our Judges handsome pensions, because we believe their services entitle them to that reward ; and what are we to say of men who have helped to make the country, and who through no fault of their own are to-day in these institutions ? I know of men who were formerly among the foremost of our legislators, who are now in these asylums. It is no crime for a man to be forced to take relief in his old age, and therefore I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> suggestion will commend itself to the committee. I am glad that we have got away from precedents, and that the Commonwealth is going to set an example. </para>

                            <para>- I know that this right to vote has been given to the inmates of charitable institutions in South Australia, and I would allow them to retain that right, but to provide that all those who are in charitable institutions in the rest of the Commonwealth shall enjoy this right would be to make a most terrible blunder. Do honorable senators of the labour party desire to see the Commonwealth, governed in accordance with common-sense principles ? Some of them seem to care for nothing but the glorification of giving every one every possible power. We have one institution in Tasmania in which there are 500 men and women. I do not suppose that 2 per cent, of them ever see a paper, or that 10 per cent, of them know what is going on in the Commonwealth. They are between 60 and 90 years of age. Some of them are relics of the old convict days, who have been in gaol again and again ; others have been in gaol only a few times, while others, again, may have no blot against their character. It would be a farce to allow canvassers to go with cabs to an institution such as that and drag out the inmates to do something about which they know nothing. I object to the principle altogether. The most that we ought to do, if we are to do anything in this direction, should be to make a distinction between those who are receiving outdoor relief - who are able to walk about the streets and learn what is going on - and inmates of institutions who are neither physically nor mentally fitted to vote. I happen to know the head of the charitable dep6t in Hobart. When an election came round for which I was a candidate, I might telephone to him, and ask him to submit my name to the inmates, while another candidate might do the same thing. Then our cabs would be sent there. In two or three cases out of five, a kind of conference would have to take place between the doctor, the matron, and the manager to determine, whether a man or woman should be lifted into the cab to go to the poll. The clause as it stands is, in my opinion, absolutely right. Are we going to say that the Government of our country shall depend as much upon ignorance as intelligence ? </para>

What is the use of bothering about men who have done their work in life, for whom homes have been provided, and who are unfit to vote? I believe the time is coming when there will be a reaction, and we shall probably exclude the ignorant vote. I am willing to stand anywhere and say that no man or woman should be allowed to vote who has not the education and intelligence to enable him or her to write out an application to be placed on the roll. This proposal seems to me to be democracy run mad. I hope that if this amendment is agreed to by the Senate we shall find a little more common sense prevailing in another place, and that it will be struck out there. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> imagine that we are legislating only for Tasmania in this matter, or for conditions which have existed there for the last fifty years? Does he not know that we are legislating for a time when we hope to see every man and woman in Australia, whether in destitute asylums or in the palaces of the cities, educated and able to express their views intelligently at the ballot-box? Because there may be a few ignorant individuals in the destitute asylums of Tasmania at the present time, we are asked to deprive the thousands in the asylums of Victoria and other States of the right to vote. It was only a short time ago that some honorable senators who oppose this principle denied the franchise to the police and other officers. This principle exists in South Australia, where it has done a great deal of good, and I hope it will be carried. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to say a few words in reference to the aspect of the position which was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey.</inline> In Queensland there is an institution called Dunwich, where there are something like 1,000 or 1,200 men and women receiving charitable relief. As Dunwich is situated in a federal electorate, it would be possible for a candidate to go to that asylum and endeavour to secure the votes of all the inmates. A candidate who adopted that method would probably be one who had opposed all increased assistance to old and indigent people, and I venture to say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> went to that asylum and pointed out to the inmates that he and the party to which he belonged had for years endeavoured to secure increased allowances and old-age pensions for them, he would probably receive as strong a vote from them as would any one else. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> seems to take exception to this rebuttal of the case put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey.</inline> No doubt the honorable senator's chief fear is that the people at Dunwich and similar institutions would not vote for the conservative party, but for the party which has been doing its level best for ages to improve the condition of the poorer people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey's</inline> fear is the other way, and inasmuch as there are people of all classes, and of all kinds of education and political beliefs, I feel sure their votes would be as much divided as the votes of any other section of the community. There are people unfortunate enough to be in Dunwich who have had as wide an experience of affairs as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson.</inline> Some of the best men in Queensland are in Dunwich, and some of those men have helped to build up that State through adversity, drought, and misfortune ; through the failure and swindling of banking institutions ; and in spite of the devious ways and practices of some people who are well off now, and able to exercise the franchise in perhaps half-a-dozen different constituencies. I do not think that very much harm can come of allowing these people to have a vote. That has been proved by the experience of South Australia. Then there is the constitutional point raised that as this is the law in South Australia, and we must have a uniform franchise, we cannot prevent these people in Queensland and in other States from having a vote. </para>

                    <para class="block">I said a good deal upon this subject on the second reading of the Bill, and there is no necessity to speak upon it at length now. Having regard to conversations that have taken place outside the House, I should like to impress upon the committee that the object of the clause is not to take away any rights that exist in any State at the present moment in respect of the aboriginals of any country. Those rights are preserved by the Constitution, but, in order to avoid any misapprehension upon the subject, honorable senators will observe the proviso in the amendment I propose, that it shall not apply to those entitled to the right to vote under section 41 of the Constitution. I call special attention to that point because of the position in which aboriginals have been placed in South Australia. It appears hardly credible, but apparently it is a fact, that in South Australia any aboriginal is entitled to be placed upon the roll, and so far as I can judge any lubra or gin is entitled to the same privilege. I cannot say whether advantage has been taken of the privilege in that State or not. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> says, advantage has been taken of the privilege only in the case of a few natives who have acquired a property qualification and have been educated. Perhaps it would be as well for me, at this point, to explain what the rights of State electors under the Constitution are in order that there may be no misapprehension as to the effect of my amendment. Whatever franchise we pass for the Commonwealth we cannot either now or hereafter deprive a person entitled to vote at a State election of the right to vote at a federal election. I know that some honorable senators think that as soon as this Bill is passed we in some way restrict the rights of those who, in a, State, may become entitled to vote eight or ten years hence. I shall deal with the aborigines in South Australia in order that this matter may be made perfectly clear to the representatives of that State, who are afraid that the South Australian aborigines will suffer some damage from my amendment. In that State an adult aboriginal is entitled to have his name placed on the rolls as soon as he attains the age of 21 years. I understand that in certain mission colleges there are a number of young, and, I am told, intelligent aboriginals who are growing up, and who, in the course of three, four, or five years will attain that age, and will thus be entitled, under the State law, to vote at State elections. Every one of those men will by that fact be entitled to vote at a federal election, and I defy any lawyer or layman to dispute that fact. Section 41 of the Constitution is quite distinct on that point - </para>

                        <para>No adult person who . . . acquires a right, to vote at elections for the more numerous. House of the Parliament of a State shall, while the right continues, be prevented by any law of the Commonwealth from voting at elections for either House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. " While the right continues " is the only limitation in the section. It means that, so long as the Legislature of South Australia leaves that right to the aboriginal, he can exercise that right at State elections, and he will be able to vote at federal elections, quite irrespective of any provision in this Franchise Bill. Why go out of the way in our federal legislation to give rights to aboriginals which they do not possess to-day in certain of the States? South Australia is the only State in which such rights exist. Surely it is absolutely repugnant to the greater number of the people of the Commonwealth that an aboriginal man, or aboriginal lubra or gin - a horrible, degraded, dirty creature - should have the same rights, simply by virtue of being 21 years of age, that we have, after some debate to-day, decided to give to our wives and daughters. To me it is as repugnant and atrocious a legislative proposal as any one could suggest. The legislation which is passed by the Federal Parliament will be taken as a pattern by the State Legislatures. Our Constitution will be the pattern on which the State Constitutions will be remodelled by-and-by. The democratic party of each State is increasing in strength, and it will naturally turn to the most democratic Constitution when a new Constitution is being framed for the State. I propose to show that not only is it repugnant to the individual that such a legislative proposal should be suggested, but that it is absolutely repugnant to the Constitution. I hope to be able to prove that when it was framed its framers never for an instant contemplated, and I doubt whether they were aware, that in any State the right to vote should be given to the aboriginals.

                        <para>For the purposes of the last section, if by the law of any State all persons of any race are disqualified from voting at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of a State, then, in reckoning the number of the people of the State or of the Commonwealth, persons of that race resident in that State shall not be counted. </para>

                    <para>All you have to do is to apply the reason given in that section to section 127, and you find logically the ground why the latter was inserted. Obviously the feeling of the draftsmen was that the aboriginal native was disqualified from voting. Take the reverse case - Why were they not to be counted? Because they were disqualified from voting, and in section 127 the Constitution says emphatically that in reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth aboriginal natives shall not be counted. </para>

                            <para>- We are not dealing with any State law, but with the Commonwealth law. We are not dealing with State law, but with Commonwealth law. I frankly admit that in some of the States the right to vote is given to aboriginals, but under restrictions so great that an aboriginal has rarely exercised the right. I say, without fear of contradiction, that in no State except South Australia is there any aboriginal on the roll. Why should this Parliament force a measure which is absolutely repugnant to the greater number of the people of the Commonwealth on those States which have hitherto kept themselves clear from this slur - because I consider it is a slur. Of course, the matter affects Victoria to a very small extent. It does not affect Tasmania at all. It affects New South Wales in a very modified degree, as there are only 3,000 aboriginals in that State, with 3,793 half-castes. But in the north-western district of Western Australia it is estimated that there are something like 60,000 aboriginal inhabitants. No reliable data can be obtained, but we know as a matter of fact that there are 5,000 odd aboriginals in actual touch with civilization, and it is estimated that there are in addition- 55,000 in a wild state. The whole of that western portion of the State is very sparsely populated with whites, it is in the hands of squatters, and even in the coastal towns the white population is exceedingly few. Every squatter maintains a gang or tribe of aboriginal natives. Sometimes there are forty or fifty people in a tribe. The squatter gives them what is vulgarly called in Australia "tucker," and a few wads of tobacco, in return for which they chop his wood, look after his cattle, and perform all the other menial occupations about his station. In many cases no white labour is employed upon the station, not even to the extent of a white cook. What will be the position if this Bill becomes law as it stands ? Those squatters will be able - and undoubtedly they will do it - to put every one of these savages and their gins upon the federal rolls. We shall possibly have three ov four thousand aboriginals put upon the rolls instantly, and the entire representation of that part of the country in the Federal Parliament will be swamped by aboriginal votes. Does any honorable senator suppose that these blacks will vote on anything but the instructions they receive from their masters? These squatters are real old crusted conservatives, who have no idea of anything but the immediate matters which concern their own interests. They never regard anything from the point of view of public policy or of the advancement of the State or the Commonwealth. They simply consider how they may put the most money into their pockets by the sale of their fleeces and their beef, and how cheaply they can get their work done. If the Senate persists in maintaining the position which this Franchise Bill lays down, it will put into the hands of these men an incalculable power to do harm to the Commonwealth, and to the State of Western Australia ; because the effect of the mischief will undoubtedly be reflected upon the State. We shall have a position of affairs there which makes me absolutely tremble when I consider it. The electorates will be flooded with aboriginal voters. What I have said in respect to Western Australia applies with equal force to the northern district of Queensland, and to the Northern Territory. The Territory in its northern parts swarms with the most active aboriginals, who are employed upon the stations, and will undoubtedly be put upon the roll by the station owners. Their votes will be used for the most improper purposes at an election. But I cannot speak from absolute knowledge about Queensland and the Northern Territory. My absolute knowledge only applies to the effect of this Bill upon Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It applies to some extent, but that does not affect the question. Existing State rights, whatever they are, are safeguarded. The position in the Northern Territory is that no British Indians imported under1 a certain Act are qualified to vote, and all persons, except natural born British subjects and Europeans and Americans, who are naturalized British subjects, are disqualified from voting. So that as a matter of fact all Asiatics, all inhabitants of the Polynesian islands, all Africans, and people of many other races, are disqualified from voting whether they are naturalized or not. That is one of the most remarkable things in connexion with South Australian democracy and legislation. A Chinaman may be entitled to vote in Adelaide, but if his business takes him to Port Darwin, he is debarred from voting. The South Australians themselves do not pretend for an instant to apply a law which they consider good in the temperate regions to the more tropical districts of the Northern Territory. That materially strengthens the position I am endeavouring to put forth. Now I turn to the question of Asiatics, Africans, and inhabitants of the Polynesian Islands. It will be said that many of these people are British subjects, and should be given the right to vote if they are allowed to come in. But I wish to point out what the effect of that would be if applied generally. We are all opposed to the introduction of Chinese. If there is one race that is picked out for special abuse whenever two or three white men meet together in Australia it is the Chinese. There are in Hong Kong, which has been a British possession since 1841, 240,000 British Chinese. Every one of them is a British subject from the point of view of the Federal Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- They have not votes in Hong Kong, but, under this Constitution, if one of these Chinaman came into Australia he would be entitled to vote. It may be said that he could not obtain entrance. But we heard this morning of three Japanese of gentlemanly appearance and manners, and apparently of perfect education, who were allowed to land. We are told that they had no intention of remaining, but what proof have we of that? What I wish to emphasize is that the Chinese in Hong Kong, however beautifully apparelled or well educated they may be, have not the right to vote. They probably speak more languages than does any honorable senator. Nearly all of them can speak Spanish, every one of them can speak English and Chinese, and the chances are that a very large proportion of them speak French and German. With the exception of Russians, they are the most perfect linguists in the world. But they do not have a vote in Hong Kong. There is no representative Government there. </para>

Many of these, although not in the same proportion as the Chinese of Hong Kong, are equally as well educated, but they do not possess the right to vote. They have no share either in the State or municipal Government. The Straits Settlements is a Crown colony, with a few independent people appointed by nomination to the council, in which they are in the minority. Yet we propose to give these people, if they comedown here, the right to vote after six months' residence and provided they have attained the age of 21 years. We propose to do so simply for a fad ; simply because they happen to come under the classification - a misnomer - of British subjects. They are not British subjects ; they are the subjects of the British. Undeniably we govern them to their advantage, but we do not give them any right to interfere with matters of State, nor do we give the natives of India such a right. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and our despotism has been the most successful in the world. But that is no reason why we should call these natives British subjects, and under that misnomer allow them to come here and take a hand in governing us, the conquering ruling race. There is no doubt that it has been to the advantage of India, Hong Kong, and the Straits Settlements, that the native races have not been allowed to interfere in the Government of those countries. The position is shortly this : There are something like 80,000 of these coloured people in the Commonwealth, a very small proportion of whom are entitled to vote. If this Bill is passed in its present form there is no doubt that 50 per cent. or something like 40,000 of these people will immediately be able to obtain the franchise. I consider that the Senate would grossly neglect its duty if it permitted any such situation to arise. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has made an interesting speech dealing with an important question, but it seems to me that the difficulty which has arisen cannot be settled in the off-hand and high and mighty way that he assumes! 1 would first of all ask the committee to remember that the question cannot be settled only from the point of view of the experience of Western Australia. We have to deal with Australia as a whole, and with the rights which exist already so far as these people are concerned. Although no one could be more staunch than I am in the maintenance of the policy of a white Australia, I think we ought to carry out that policy with a certain amount of reason, humanity, and common sense. We ought to leave out of consideration what I may describe as the jingoism of the music halls in regard to the greatness of the British Empire, the position of the servile races in India, our career in the Straits Settlements, and matters of that kind. We have to deal with a simple question : Certain persons being inhabitants of Australia, are we to grant or withhold from them the right to the franchise? The number of aboriginals that we have to deal with is a very important element. I find from the latest available statistics given by <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> that at the census of 1891, only 38,789 aboriginals were enumerated, of whom 8,280 were in New South Wales. 565 in Victoria, 23,789 in South Australia, and 6,245 in Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I have not the figures for the last census ; but we know that the aboriginal races are decreasing, so that the probabilities are that the figures at the last census were much smaller. It is well to point out that in" Western Australia the number of aboriginals as shown by these figures is comparatively trifling. The aboriginals in that State are not anything like so numerous as they are in New South Wales, and they represent only a fraction of the total in South Australia. How do we deal with these people ? In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania an aboriginal has the same right to vote as has any other inhabitant. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; this is the policy in four States out of the six. In the. remaining States of Western Australia and Queensland, where the largest number of what are generally described as wild blacks exist, the right to vote is given to an aboriginal, provided that he is the owner of property to the value of £100. Why was that right given ? Every one was aware at the time that there were numbers of these aboriginals who, perhaps, would not understand very much about political questions. But I think it occurred to those who were framing these laws in the States, that it would be a monstrous thing, an unheard of piece of savagery on our part, to treat the aboriginals, whose land we were occupying, in such a manner as to deprive them absolutely of any right to vote in their own country, simply on the ground of their colour, and because they were aboriginals. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is utterly mistaken. Certainly in New South Wales and Victoria, and I believe in many places in South Australia, there were numbers of these men at work earning their living just as other persons earn their living, by labour. In several places also they were collected by Governments and benevolent institutions into what were called missions, not. for the purpose of administering any eleemosynary aid to them, but for the formation of little settlements in which they could be educated, and in which they paid over and over again for any .expense entailed in their education by providing produce which was sold by the institution in charge of the mission. There were scores of men in these institutions who, by reason of their intelligence and education, were quite as fit to exercise the right to vote as many white men. It is altogether a mistake to suppose that the aboriginal of Australia is to be classed in every State as being a person supplied by the Government with a blanket. No doubt a great number in all the States are aided by the Government, but many of them are earning their living as ordinary members of the community. The rights of those people are preserved for them under the Constitution. The right of every aboriginal native of New South Wales is to be put upon an electoral roll, and to "be able to record a vote, and nothing can take that right from him. </para>

                            <para>- Of course I am referring only to this Parliament. With respect to their own affairs, the State Legislatures can do what they like. We must look into this question narrowly, and see that we are doing justice. Under the Constitution as it stands, the only right preserved is the individual right of the elector, and the aboriginals in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia, and those holding property in Western Australia and in Queensland, cannot transmit their right to vote in any way whatever. Although the aboriginals in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia, had the right to vote through all these years, when they were more numerous and more savage, now under the Commonwealth, with the liberal views we are supposed to entertain and to bring into the legislative field, we are asked to take away from the sons of those, people for ever the right to vote. Why are we to do that ? Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> given any reason <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The honorable senator has said that in Western Australia a number of these men are in the employ of the squatter, and he indulged in a diatribe against the squatting community in that particular State. I do not know anything about that, but I presume that the squatter looks to his own interest as the miner looks to his. I suppose it is by this conflict of interests that we get at what the real interest of the community is. I point out that we have had the same condition of things in Queensland and Western Australia and in other States for years past, and every one knows that the aboriginal vote, except in the case of the few aboriginals sufficiently educated to use it properly, has been a negligible quantity. That is probably because we have machinery which is put in force before any man can get upon an electoral roll, and be allowed to vote. He has to make - an application, and send in a claim which must be signed by himself. His name must be upon the roll, and it may be objected to, and he has to go through certain processes for the purpose of voting, and really when the matter is put into practice, it is found that all these things are so impossible and so inapplicable to the ordinary wondering blackfellow that he never comes within the purview of these Acts at all. I say that that is practically the way in which this question is working itself out. As we have in the past been liberal and jealous for those decaying races that owned this continent, and as at no time any harm or wrong has resulted from that liberality, surely we are not going to apply this doctrine to a white Australia, not only with irregularity but with a savagery which is quite unworthy of the beginnings of this federation ? What will be the position of things if Sector Matheson's view is carried out ? In four of the States, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia, we will have a class of blackfellows who will have the franchise, and may exercise it. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has taken up this question and is evidently an enthusiast about it, and I do not expect to be able to satisfy him. I desire to satisfy the committee, and I say that if this amendment is carried it will bring about this condition of things that, in all the States to which I have alluded, we shall have a class of aboriginals who will be entitled to be put on the roll, and entitled to vote under the existing laws, and those very men will have to tell their sons who are becoming more civilized, and perhaps as civilized, and as worthy of the franchise as the white men among whom they are living - "Although your people owned this territory for centuries before the white man came here, although you are his equal in intelligence, it has been prescribed by the Commonwealth that you shall not have the right to vote at all." I say it would be a monstrous and a savage application of this principle of a white Australia. I do not believe this committee will consent to go back upon what has been the policy of Australia ever since the white man came here. Now I come to the other question of the coloured races of Asia and Polynesia. In the first place I would call the attention of honorable senators to the fact that we have lately passed an Immigration Restriction Act, which, if administered as it is being administered now, and as it ought to be administered, will practically prohibit the entrance into Australia of any of these people. Some reference has been made in a rather bantering vein by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> to the three gentlemen who have been travellking here for a certain public purpose, for which they are accredited by the Japanese Government. I do not know if he remembers that a section of the Act excepts from its application persons travel! ing on a special mission and accredited by the Government of their country. This case seemed to the Government to come within that exception. Surely we are not going to degenerate into a condition in which we are not to allow any person to enter the Commonwealth who happens to have a black skin, no matter for what purpose he may come, or how he may be &lt; accredited by his Government, or what the object of his mission may be ! If we are going to take up that attitude, I shall be exceedingly surprised. The Prime Minister's explanation, which I gave to-day, shows that he acted within the law, and I feel quite certain that honorable senators generally .will recognise that there has been no departure from the determination to carry out the expressed intention of the Legislature, and that is to restrict and practically to prohibit the admitting of these Asiatics and coloured races into Australia. I have mentioned that to show that from this time out practically no persons coming under the definition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> has used will enter Australia. When he drew a picture of the few coloured British subjects who might come down here - the educated Chinaman from Hong Kong, who can speak a great many languages, and the educated' Chinaman from the Straits Settlements - he seemed to forget all about the fact that we have an Immigration Restriction Act, which would prevent their entrance. The Immigration Restriction Act applies to British' subjects as well as others ; therefore, all these persons from Hong Kong, the Straits Settlements, and any other part of the British dominions could be prohibited from entering, just as coloured aliens could be excluded. So far as the future is concerned, the number of persons who would come under the provision he suggests would be a negligible quantity, and therefore, it would apply to only those within the Commonwealth. </para>

The others are made up of the different coloured races which come from India and other countries of the East, including, of course, the kanakas. In the first place, not one of these persons is entitled to vote unless h§ has been naturalized. Those who have the right to vote, because they have been naturalized here, cannot be deprived of that right. While they live they are entitled to vote. With regard to those naturalized persons who are here already the new clause will have no effect. With regard to the future, there will be none coming here to be dealt with, and that covers the whole ground. </para>

The honorable senator need not be afraid of any reactionary Government getting into power, which will be likely to relax its administration in any way. From those persons who are here already no rights can be taken away, and as to those who are coming, their quantity is negligible. </para>

Those who are natural-born subjects of the' King are those who are bom here or those who are subjects of the King elsewhere. Those who are naturalized are those who are naturalized by the law of some British territory, or by the law of Australia, or by the law of a State of the Commonwealth. The number who can claim the franchise as being natural-born subjects of the King in other parts of the British dominions who have got in here before the passing of the Immigration Restriction Act, is comparatively small. The number of those who are naturalized here is very small, because in very nearly all the States, since 18SS, Chinamen have not been naturalized. Since that year, in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia, letters of naturalization have not been issued to Chinese. The influx of Chinese during that period has been very small, because the Chinese Restriction Acts have been rigidly administered. </para>

                            <para>- There may be some there. The proposition which I laid down when I moved the second reading of the Bill, and which has been assented to by several honorable senators, seems to be unanswerable, namely, that if you grant letters of naturalization, you should give the whole rights of citizenship; that it would be altogether an untenable position to allow persons to have the right of holding property, of trading, of exercising every privilege of a citizen, and then to put him in an inferior position by depriving him of the right to vote. Therefore, in regard to these Chinese, or other aliens, the position is that there are comparatively few of them who have come here as naturalized subjects from other British territories. As to the others, there are very few who have been naturalized, and of Chinese very few indeed since 1888. It would be altogether unworthy of the broad and liberal policy of this Bill to take away the franchise from those comparatively few persons, to go back upon the liberal policy of the States hitherto in regard to the aboriginals, and take away their franchise. The only way of dealing with this matter consistently with existing rights, and with a due regard to our own position as a Commonwealth, is to give the right to vote to every natural-born or naturalized subject of the King, and to trust, as we are entitled to trust, to the operation of that law throughout the whole community to insure the best possible results in the forming of a Legislature. I hope that the amendment will be rejected. </para>

                        (Western Australia). - A good many points which are worthy of consideration have been raised by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline>
                        and, although I cannot support his amendment, I consider that some of the observations he made from a constitutional point of view are worthy of comment. I agree with him that a great number of the aboriginals are entirely ignorant of our institutions, have no knowledge of our methods of thought, and are quite as incapable as idiots of exercising the franchise intelligently. But, on the other hand, we must remember that they will every day improve, and that this law is not made for the year 1902, but, as I hope, for 30 or 50 years to come. Personally, I' agree with the - sentiments expressed by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor.</inline>
                        All of us, however circumscribed our ideas may be with regard to the policy of a white Australia, must sympathize with the original owners of the soil of this country. It is their country. They are more familiar with its physical attributes than we are. It is little enough for us to say to them - "If you are able to join with us in the rights of citizenship we will cordially welcome you." But apart from that view, there seems to be a constitutional point, and that is the matter to which I particularly rose to address myself. Section 127 of the Constitution very distinctly says that -
                    </para>
                    <para>In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth or of a State or other part of the Commonwealth aboriginal natives shall not be counted. </para>
                    <para class="block">In other words, in determining by population the quantity of our representation, we are to take no heed of aboriginals. Is it not anomalous, therefore, if in contradiction of the spirit of that section, we say to the aboriginals - " You shall have no voice in determining the number of representatives, but you shall have a voice in determining the character of a particular representative." Representation depends quite as much upon the number of persons who voice the opinions of the locality as upon the particular individuals chosen. "We are told that there are 60,000 aboriginals in Western Australia, and that if they were counted for the purpose of determining the number of members sent to the House of Representatives by that State, an additional member would be returned. When the Legislature says : " You 60,000 aboriginals shall not be entitled to an additional member," surely it intends also to say, " The reason you are to be so disentitled is that we regard you as ineffective as parts of the political machine." That is the only logical way of looking at it. Here I may say frankly that I shall support the Government, but I think it is only fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> who, not being a lawyer, has given us a very lucid and lawyer-like speech on the subject, that I should make these points clear. Section 25 of the Constitution says very distinctly - </para>
                    <para>For the purposes of the last section, which deals with how the quota is to be ascertained, if by the law of any State all persons of any race" are disqualified from voting at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of the State then in reckoning the number of the people of the State or of the Commonwealth, persons of that race resident in that State shall not be counted. </para>
                    <para class="block">That section says unequivocally that those who are disqualified from voting shall not be taken into account in reckoning the number of representatives to be returned. Transpose the converse of those words - "Disqualified from voting" into section 127, and it reads in this way - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth or of a State, or other part of the Commonwealth, aboriginal natives shall not be counted as persons who are qualified to vote. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That is the only way in which we can read the two sections. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> sees the force of this point, as not only the legal, but the common-sense interpretation of sections 25 and 127. We must read them as enacting that the Legislature declares that aboriginal natives shall not be taken into account, not merely in the calculation as to the number of persons to be returned, but as persons who are qualified to vote. What was the reason for inserting section 127? Why did the Legislature say that aboriginals should not be taken into account in the reckoning ? The reason is given in section 25. It says that they are not to be taken into account, because no persons are to be taken into account who are disqualified from voting. That brings me to another interesting point which was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson.</inline> I am sorry to say that, notwithstanding the vehemence of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the respect I have for his opinion, I prefer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mathee</inline> son's interpretation of section 41. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has said that section 41 preserves the rights of aboriginals and other persons, but that from the moment this Bill becomes law it will be impossible for them to acquire similar State rights, or to continue in possession of the State rights they have now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> says that the true meaning of the section is this - that, notwithstanding the passage of this Bill, any State can, for all time, unless some other Constitution is made, give any rights it thinks proper, for its own. State Parliament; and section 41 says that the rights given in respect of State Houses shall also be exercised in reference to the Commonwealth Parliament. The section is very distinct - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is what the section means. The language of it is beyond controversy. I do not know whether it is a wise provision or not, but it is a provision that exists in fact. It is not a section that leaves anything in doubt. The propositions implied in it may be stated with absolute clearness. Proposition (a) - Any person who in the future acquires a right to vote for the Legislative Assembly of any of the States will be entitled to vote for the Commonwealth Parliament. If a person acquires such a right, what happens? If that right be more extended than the right given by this Franchise Bill, the individual possessing the right takes up section 41, and says : " I claim the right to vote for the Commonwealth Parliament, although I am outside the Commonwealth Franchise Act, because your Constitution says that if I have a right to vote for the Parliament of the State of Western Australia or South Australia, nothing that the Commonwealth Parliament may do is to prevent me also from voting for elections for the Commonwealth Parliament." It is said that the effect of the amendment would be to deprive sons of the rights that the fathers now possess. I maintain that that would not be the effect of it, because the same property qualification that gives the father the right to vote to-day, will continue to give the son the right to vote to-morrow. Section 4 1 of the Constitution says that all these persons shall have the right to vote for the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- What is the meaning of the words in section 41 ? Why are we to give a different meaning to the word " acquires " than that which is ordinarily given to it ? What is there in the Constitution which says that the passing of a Franchise Act by the Commonwealth shall limit the operation of the word " acquire " ? We have to remember that we have two systems of franchise - the State and the federal franchise. The question is whether those persons who come within the Commonwealth Franchise Bill have alone the right to vote for the Commonwealth Parliament. The Constitution goes out of its way to say that persons shall have the right to vote, notwithstanding that they may be excluded from the Commonwealth franchise law. I think, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment is not open to the criticism, that if it were passed it would prevent aboriginals who have now the right to vote from continuing to enjoy that right or prevent other aboriginals, who have, now no right, from acquiring subsequently the property qualification, which would give them that right. On the amendment itself, so far as aboriginals are concerned, I have no hesitation in saying, that I believe the true intent of the framers of the Constitution was that aboriginals should not have the right to vote. I believe also that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment were carried, it would place aboriginals in the future in no worse position than they are to-day. But while I believe that, I have also to remember that it is desirable to have uniformity, and since the number 'of aboriginals is so small, and since our sympathies in their favour are so great, it is just as well not to mar the general symmetry of the Bill by making an exception in their case. With reference to the other branch of this subject, I follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor's</inline> classification in dividing Asiatics and Africans into two classes : those who have not festered the Commonwealth and those who are here already. In regard to the former class, we certainly cannot forget that we have passed a very stringent Immigration Restriction Act. The effect of that measure is that the Custom-house officer who so to speak stands at the portals of the Commonwealth, can let in or keep out exactly whom he pleases. The only possible grounds upon which any person can pass through that narrow gate is that he has satisfied the gate-keeper - the Customs-house officer - that he is in every way worthy of associating with the citizens of Australia that he is proficient in their language ; that there can be no objection to him personally, and that he has all those qualifications and habits and methods of life which render him a fit companion for us. Why then, when we have this strict and stern scrutiny at the gates of the Commonwealth, should we disqualify one when he does get in? Very few will get in. Those who do will merit to the full the right to all the privileges that the Australian nation can confer. As to those who are here already, I must say that a different consideration arises. If it were not for my love of symmetry, and my desire for a uniform franchise, I should certainly be disposed to propose some amendment, or to cut down <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment in such a way as more or less to disfranchise them. It would be anomalous, however, to say that those who come from outside in the future should be al lowed to obtain  votes once they get in, and at the same time that those who are here already - who have been here, perhaps, for years, and who have all the advantages of greater experience in the country - should be excluded from the franchise. Although it may be answered that those who come in in future will have passed the test under the Immigration Restriction Act, and will have shown their fitness for citizenship, while those who are here already have not done so, still there would be something of injustice and cruelty in saying that the hundreds of Afghans, Indians, .Japanese, and other coloured people who have been here for years should be in a worse position than one who comes in to-morrow. 33 c 2 </para>

                    <para class="block">When we come to consider their numbers, we find that it is really a matter of very small moment. It is said there are some 70,000 or 80,000 of them ; but we must remember that they are not all entitled to vote. They must be naturalized or natural-born British subjects. In many of the States those who are naturalized already have the right to vote, and the British subjects who are here and who have not been naturalized are certainly very few. The great race to be feared, and to which we most object, is, I think, the Chinese. Unless a Chinese is naturalized he will -have no right to vote, and the tendency in the past- has been not to extend the rights of British subjects to these people. Therefore all the objections to Chinese being given the right to vote under the Bill as it stands are narrowed down, because, perhaps, only two or three in every hundred will have that right. </para>

                            <para>- The logical direct inference from my remarks is this : that aboriginals should not have votes, and that British subjects from Hong Kong and Singapore and every other British possession who are in the Commonwealth already will be given under this measure a right that they ought not to possess. But I think that we should not destroy the completeness, the thoroughness, and the exhaustive character of this Bill merely for the sake of a few hundred residents who can have very little influence by the exercise of their votes. By doing so we should create very invidious distinctions. The aliens who are admitted in the future ought to be treated as citizens, and it would be unfair to those already within the Commonwealth to put them in a worse position than such persons occupy. </para>

                            <para>- I think it has only to be stated to show the hollow absurdity of it. It makes ducks and drakes of our legislation. Instead of our being the highest power in the land in the making of law it would subordinate us to the States. Yet there is another section in the Constitution, section 109, which says that if any law of a State shall conflict with a Commonwealth law, the State law must give place to the law of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harney</inline> strained the meaning of the words " has or acquires " in section 41 of the Constitution, and suggested that the words "or acquires" means for all time, and that- the States are able at any time to ' give a special right, and it must then become the. law of the Commonwealth. The thing is absurd. What was intended by the framers of the Constitution is exactly what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> has told us, that in the interval between the enactment of the Constitution by the Parliament of Great Britain and the time when the Commonwealth Parliament deals with the subject, the States may alter their franchise and give greater franchise -facilities, and those facilities must then be taken into account up to the time when we, as a Commonwealth, deal with the matter. Directly we deal with it, and pass a uniform f franchise for the whole of the Commonwealth, no State can interfere with it in an)' way whatever. The only way in which the franchise can then be altered so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, is by the Commonwealth Parliament itself. Coming to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment, providing that no aboriginal native of Australia shall be entitled to a vote, I quite agree with the position taken up by the leader of the Senate. This Parliament can do no such thing so far as a majority of the States are concerned ; but I contend that it would be a heartless thing to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> proposes, and it is absurd that we should say we are so frightened of the original inhabitants of this continent that we dare not allow them the right to vote. In the past the States have given that right, and to what extent have the)' exercised it ? On) y to an exceedingly limited extent, and they are likely to exercise the right in future only when they come within the limits of the civilized portions of Australia where a white population is settled. What is the result of the contact between them and the white population <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Disappearance and death. I suppose that when the 30,000 or 40,000 natives in Western Australia - they cannot be exactly enumerated - come into contact with the white civilization they will pass away as others have passed away before them in all the other States. In Tasmania, I believe, there is not one left. I recollect when I landed first in South Australia that we had there what was called the Adelaide tribe, which consisted of over 300 natives, and the last of them died ten or fifteen years ago. At Encounter Bay, where Flinders and the French navigator met, we know that the natives were at one time exceedingly troublesome. They committed many murders there, and we had to punish them very severely for a time. I do not think there is a single Encounter Bay native left north of Adelaide. An odd one may be seen here and there, but we must go to the wilds of Australia, where there is no white settlement, to find any number of them. We need not, therefore, fear any injurious results from following the practice of the majority of the States, and allowing the aboriginal natives to vote. Dealing with the next part of the amendment, there is a point that deserves consideration. Of the races mentioned, the only one that is likely to trouble us is the Chinese race. We have already passed a clause in this Bill which says that, subject to the disqualifications hereafter set out, all adults in the Commonwealth may be placed upon electoral rolls if they .are natural-born or naturalized subjects of the King. We have a considerable number of Chinese in various parts of the Commonwealth. In many of the States they have been prevented from voting, except in cases where they have been allowed to become naturalized. That has been allowed only to an extremely limited extent, and for many years it has practically been stopped altogether. We have a few naturalized Chinese in the Northern Territory of South Australia and a few in Adelaide, but we have never acknowledged as a State their right to vote if they happened to be natural-born subjects of His Majesty. </para>

                            <para>- It is a very singular thing that they have never been allowed the right. In many parts of Australia there are thousands of Chinamen who are undoubtedly natural-born subjects of His Majesty. In the Northern Territory there are 3,000 Chinamen and only 500 whites, and a great many of these Chinese are natives of Hong Kong, Singapore, Malacca, Penang, and the Straits Settlements. When I stopped at Port Darwin in 1890, there was a young Chinese boy, whose name was Toby, told off by the landlady of the hotel to wait upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Playford</inline> and myself. I put a good many questions to him, as he was a highly-intelligent young man. I asked where he came from, and he said he came from Hong Kong, and was born in Hong Kong ; but I know that Toby had no vote. </para>

                            <para>- I know that there was this special law but under the Bill those Chinese will have the right to vote, and out of the 3,000 I believe that over 1,000 will be able to claim the right as British subjects. What will be the result if they do ? They are highly-intelligent and well-educated men, and if any hanky-panky tricks are tried to prevent them getting upon the rolls, they will appeal to the courts, and the courts will give them the right. The result will be that the 500 whites in the district will be swamped by the Chinese. I suppose there are from 25,000 to 30,000 Chinese in Victoria, and, perhaps, the same number in New South Wales, and there are a considerable number in Queensland. Of these there is a certain percentage which it will be very difficult to estimate who will, under this Bill, claim the right to vote, and we shall not be able to prevent them from exercising that right, because on appeal the courts will see that the law is administered fairly, so long as the appellants can prove that they are naturalized subjects of the King. Now comes the question whether, for the sake of making the law uniform, it is wise to run this risk. In the Northern Territory the risk is unmistakable. What it is in Western Australia I do not know. A number of Malays are engaged in pearl fishing, and there are a number of Japanese and others in the State. Very few of them are British subjects - the Singapore Malay is a British subject- - but the result would be that to a certain extent we might be swamped by them. It is a serious question, requiring grave consideration, whether it is wise to pass such a law without any qualification. A large number of these Asiatic and alien races will enter if the door is left open, and in the Northern Territory they will become a very serious menace and a domineering faction at elections. I should like to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Connor</inline> say a little more on the subject. By interjection I tried to explain to him what I was driving at, and he discussed the point up to a certain extent. When he was speaking to the second reading of the Bill, I interjected that this clause would allow a nigger from Jamaica, if he were in the Commonwealth, to be registered as a voter. Since we can keep out the nigger from Jamaica under the Immigration Restriction Act, there is no danger from that source so far as the future is concerned. The danger is  to be apprehended from those whom we have here, and who are British- born subjects. To what extent they are I do not know, and I suppose we have no means of ascertaining. I should think that to a very considerable extent these Chinamen have been born on British soil. I do not like to vote for the amendment as it is. I am inclined to vote for the portion which relates to Asiatics, Africans, and Polynesians, but I shall not. vote for the portion relating to aboriginal natives. </para>

The whole question at issue was to prevent women from being deprived of the suffrage by any law which might be passed in the Federal Parliament. It was not a question of the Chinamen or the aboriginals. It was simply a question of preserving the liberal franchise in South Australia, and its delegates took a most active part in providing in section 41 for its preservation. I should be very sorry indeed if it could ever be said of a British' community that they went into a country like Australia, which was very sparsely populated by what might have been called at the time a savage race, but what was really a harmless race- </para><interjection>

                            <para>- In some parts of the continent there may have been cannibals. There is any amount of proof that in the far distant past our forefathers were cannibals, but we do not cast that up at one another now. Why should we cast it up at the unfortunate aborigines who may happen to possess the franchise? In the majority of the States those aborigines who have shown that they are intelligent enough to exercise the franchise are entitled to do so, but they have only availed themselves of the right to a very limited extent, and no evil consequences have resulted. None of the wicked squatters in New South Wales or South Australia, or even in Victoria, ever attempted to stuff the rolls with the names of aboriginals, because they knew very well that if there was no more tobacco or flour there would be no more votes. In Queensland and Western Australia such abhorrent practices have been carried out by some people in authority that the aborigines have every reason to be suspicious. They may have reason still to be suspicious, but in the future the Commonwealth will be able to protect all the States from such abuses. I should be very sorry if we took away a right from a declining race like the aborigines, but with respect to Chinese, Japanese, Africans, and other aliens, who are much more dangerous than the aborigines, I should be quite willing to take some step. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has said is absolutely correct with respect to a great many of the Chinese in Australia. In New South Wales, the senatorial party scarcely entered a hotel in which two or three Chinese were not knocking about the kitchen. That is the reason why there are nearly 8,000 Chinese and Japanese employed in that State. I do not wish that these aliens should be allowed to exercise power to the injury of the white population. I should like the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> to be confined to all coloured races except the aborigines. Therefore, I move - </para>

I admit that until this debate arose I did not full)'- realize the significance of his interjections. In all the State Acts except one, the words of enfranchisement are exactly those which are used in this Bill. The persons who are entitled to the franchise are natural-born and naturalized subjects of His Majesty. The expression is varied in different cases but the meaning is the same. In the South Australian Act an exception is made in the case of immigrants under the Indian Immigration Act of 1882. The Electoral Code of 1896 first of all gives the right to vote to all natural-born and naturalized British subjects and then it provides that - </para>

                    </quote><para class="block">That really reaffirms that every natural-born or naturalized subject - that is persons from countries other than those coming under the Indian Immigration Act - is allowed to vote. I have looked carefully through all the Chinese Restriction Acts, and there is no provision in any of them depriving a Chinaman who is a natural-born subject of His Majesty in any other part of the world from voting if he is here. There are a number of Acts which impose restrictions on Chinese coming here, but being here, there is no provision which deprives them of their right to vote. I have not only had the matter inquired into for me, but I have examined the Acts and that appears to me to be exactly what the position is. </para><para class="block">We find that in all the States a naturalized British subject of His Majesty the King, whether he comes from Hong Kong, or the Straits Settlements, or anywhere else, has the right to vote now. In Queensland he can only vote with a property qualification. In South Australia he is deprived of the franchise if he comes in under a certain Act, but otherwise he can vote'. That being so, the present condition of things is that these natural - born and naturalized British subjects who are here now have the right, and we cannot take it away from them. This is a very important question, and can only be thoroughly understood by looking at the Acts. That I have done. The committee, I am sure, have no desire to pass this measure in a form which is unconstitutional, and will therefore remember that, as far as concerns persons who already have the vote, the only question really is that in Queensland and Western Australia that right is subject to a property qualification. Shall we remove that qualification from those persons? Is it worth while to put this exception in the Bill for the sake of altering the position of a few coloured aliens in Western Australia and South Australia who are now entitled to vote by virtue of property, and who, under this measure, will be entitled to vote without regard to property <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It is not worth while to make a blot upon a liberal measure . of this kind for the sake of doing that. </para></speech>

                            <para>- But that is practically a prohibitive law in Western Australia. Most of these men are pearl-divers or vegetable-growers in the north-west, and possess no property qualification. I can understand a representative of Tasmania not feeling any sympathy in regard to the matter, because there are practically- no coloured people in that State. But there are parts of Western Australia where there is more coloured than white labour. In Roebourne, Cossack, and Broome the coloured men outnumber the whites. It is the same in Cairns. Since the passage of the Pacific Island Labourers Act the coloured population of Cairns is absolutely boycotting the white population, and is likely to drive the whites out of the town. The white population in the northern portion of Queensland, therefore, do not want to enlarge the scope for voting to British subjects simply because they happen to have been born at Singapore or Hong Hong. Why give a vote to a Chinaman who happens to be born in Hong Kong and not to one who happens to be born in the interior of China ? The one man is quite as objectionable as the other. I trust that the Senate will recognise the desirability of passing the amendment. </para>

                    <para class="block">Assuming that there are not as many as 70,000 aboriginals in Queensland, it can readily be seen what a far-reaching effect their enfranchisement will have upon the representation of that State in the Federal Parliament. The passage of the Bill as it stands would be antagonistic to the sentiments of public opinion in the State I represent. We have inserted provisions in our Mining and Railway Acts and in other legislation providing that these persons shall not be employed in competition with white people. Yet the Government of the Commonwealth, against the wish of Queensland, proposes to enfranchise the aboriginals. What are the facts as to the other coloured races? There are something like 24,000 coloured people, including kanakas, Chinese, Cingalese, Japanese, and others, in Queensland. There are very few women and children amongst them. It has been shown that every possible device will be resorted to in order to naturalize these people with the view of keeping them in the State. Is not that a danger to be apprehended so far as Queensland is concerned ? Certainly it is, and a very serious danger, and therefore I cannot sit by and allow the proposal to be carried without entering my protest against it. It is a matter that deserves very serious attention, but I am afraid that at this late hour it will not receive that calm consideration which would be given to it if the matter were postponed until tomorrow. I shall certainly vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment, and I regret that the Government should have introduced a proposal such as this, which will undoubtedly create a hostile feeling in the minds of many people in the State from which I come. </para>

                            <para>- My experience compels me to come to the conclusion that not 1 per cent, of them would be qualified in the sense I have indicated. How will this measure operate in Queensland if it becomes law? There blacks are employed on a number of stations according to the size of the stations. A station-owner, like other people, is anxious, to get as much political power as possible, and he would take care to put on the rolls these opiumeating blacks, these ignorant aboriginals, these people who do not care two straws about the government of the country so long as they can get their daily tucker and their allowance of opium. He would muster them up at every election and they would inevitably vote for the squatters' candidate. If the Government is going to expose the working people of Queensland to this sort of thing, I am not going tq be a party to it. The only conclusion I can come to is that the Government can know nothing about the aboriginal question in Australia. I am going to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson's</inline> amendment, and I trust that the majority of honorable senators will support me in trying to save the people of Queensland from anything of this kind. </para>

                            <para>- We are going to guard against even the appearance of evil. We have honorable senators from Queensland and Western Australia, which are the States most seriously affected, unanimous on the point, and protesting strongly against aboriginals being permitted to vote. For that reason I appeal to honorable senators from other States to be guided by us in this matter. With regard to other coloured people we are in a most serious position in Queensland. ' Three out of every five adults in Northern Queensland are white, and two are coloured. If we give the coloured people the franchise in that part of the State we may alter the whole basis of representation, and instead of having democratic representatives in the Federal Parliament representing the' ideals and desires of white men, we may have representatives whose whole concern will be to operate against the idea of a white Australia. Who would the Chinese vote for ? Does any one imagine that they would vote for a candidate, a plank in whose platform was a white Australia ? Then, again, Thursday Island is almost in the possession of the Japanese, Manilla men, and others from various parts of Asia. If these people had the right to vote, the whole character of Queensland's representation might be altered. I am very glad that two of the States at all events have had the wisdom of limiting their rights. It appears to me that we are most generous. If a Chinaman went from Hong Kong to Great Britain, does any one imagine that he would be granted the franchise immediately, on the ground that he was a British subject? Do the millions of natives in India have a vote amongst them ? Yet, under this extremely liberal Constitution of ours, we would give them votes because they are British subjects. I consider I am as good a democrat as is any one, but lam not prepared to go that length. I do not allow any sentiment to govern me. when the preservation of our political institutions is at stake. I am opposed to these people coming here, and I am opposed to the franchise being extended to them. They know nothing about our institutions ; they have no sympathy with them ; they do not understand our language, and they cannot by any possibility assimilate with us. Therefore, I trust that the committee will support </para>

If he were an intelligent man, I should be the last to refuse him the franchise, but he is not. We provide for the education of the white man, and presume that he has sufficient intelligence to vote. The blackfellow, however, does not avail himself of any such provision that has been made for him by the State, and he would only be used by employers as a tool.

                        <para>- It is a little novel to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> assuming a role which we have been absolutely unaccustomed to regard him as filling. I have been quite surprised to find the honorable senator, instead of being the democrat we all believed . him to be, such an absolute conservative in a matter of this sort. He tells us that in certain parts of Queensland there are a number of coloured aliens who do not at present exercise the franchise. With a great deal of vehemence he asked us if they were enfranchised to-morrow, for whom we imagined they would vote. The attitude he takes up is that he would not like to see these men enfranchised, because he objects to their politics, and he is afraid they would not vote for him, or for the party to which he belongs. I agree with those who have already said that we are here to legislate for the Commonwealth as a whole. It may be argued that because in some of the States we have not so many aliens or aboriginals as they have in the western State, we do not approach this question in a proper spirit. </para>

                            <para>- We have had numbers of coloured aliens in Tasmania, and probably at times far more proportionately to, the population than there was in the State of Western Australia. Our eastern mining fields have often been extensively populated by Chinese and others coming from Asia, and yet the only qualification for the position of a voter has been that the applicant shall be a natural-born or naturalized subject of the Crown, irrespective of his place of origin or his colour, and shall have been resident a certain time in Tasmania. So that, to put a hypothetical case, if any of those aboriginals of Western Australia, though disqualified to vote in that State for the members of the State Parliament, should leave that State and find themselves in Tasmania for a period of six months, it would be competent for them, being natural-born subjects of the King, to get upon the electoral roll in Tasmania. The same thing would apply in other States where there has been no restriction of the character now sought to be imposed. If the amendment is carried, it will destroy the symmetry and uniformity which characterize this measure. As we have decided to carry out the long contemplated project of having a federal franchise upon the basis of which this Parliament shall be elected, I hope that uniformity will not be destroyed by this amendment which has not been put forward in the interests of the Commonwealth regarded as a whole. For the reasons I have given, and in view of the fact that we have taken steps to prevent any further immigration into Australia, of those whom we consider undesirable aliens, I think that in passing this Bill, we should recognise, as we" have done, the necessity of establishing a uniform system of franchise covering the widest franchise existing in any of the States. It is upon that principle, as well as upon general principles, that I have supported the proposal for woman's suffrage, and it is upon that principle that I support the proposal now put forward by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I would urge the honorable senator to withdraw the amendment. We have already tested the question. There is another Bill in course of transmission between this House and the House of Representatives in connexion with which it is possible the question may be raised, and we shall have a further opportunity of dealing with it. In the meantime I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> not to prejudice honorable senators on the question. </para>
