            <para>-  May I say - and I think I shall be borne out by some of my fellow senators who have been members of the House of Assembly in South Australia. - that it has never been the practice in that House that a petition should be certified to by the  Clerk  before presentation. The practice has always been simply for the honorable member to sign the petition, and note on it the number of signatures attached. That has always been the practice under the standing orders which govern the Senate. I do not know whether it, was an oversight or not, but I have presented two petitions to the Senate, and neither of them was certified to by the  Clerk. </para>

            <para>-  The rules with regard to petitions are comprised in Standing Orders 86 to 114. They lay down clearly certain conditions which must be complied with before a petition can be received, but there is no condition which makes it necessary that the  Clerk  shall certify to the accuracy or to the respectful contents of a petition, or that he shall certify at all. I quite agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> has said, and I submit that the standing orders should be amply sufficient to govern the procedure of the Chamber. </para>

            <para>-  The invariable practice in South Australia was for an honorable member to rise in his place and say - &#34; I have a petition to present from so and so ; it is respectfully worded, and concludes with a prayer.&#34; The statement that the petition is respectfully worded would be unnecessary if the standing orders contemplated any certificate to that effect. </para>

            <para>- It is entirely for the Senate to decide whether it wishes the practice to be continued or not. I quite agree that there is no standing order which renders it obligatory for a petition to be lodged with the  Clerk  ; but as  a  matter of experience - it is my experience anyhow - it has been found that the practice of leaving  a  petition with the Clerkis a good one, because errors are corrected if theyexist, and petitions which are not in order are not presented. That has been the practice  of  the Senate. I believe it to be a wise practice, and I shall adhere to it unless the Senate desires me not to do so. </para>

            <para>-  May I make a suggestion which perhaps  will  enable us to  lay  down some rule ? I take it,  sir, that  your ruling is  not  to establish a custom so binding as a standing order, demanding  that  this certificate shall be given,  but that  there  has  been a usage in  the  Senate to require a member&#39;s statement  that  a  certificate has been  given, so as to  get rid  of  a  statement as regards compliance with  a  number of formalities. The standing orders really  put the  responsibility  for the  form  of the  petition on  the  honorable senator  himself.  Standing Order 102  says - </para>

I take it  that  this usage  has been  adopted really in order to save honorable senators  the  trouble of going through a petition before presenting it to see whether it complies with  the  standing orders. It  has been found convenient to allow the  Clerk  to do so on his behalf. </para>

          <para class="block">I think the appointment of an appeal board by which civil servants can have their grievances properly looked into is absolutely necessary if we wish to create a proper <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps</inline> and have an efficient public service. If we wish to guard against bias, unfairness, or neglect, which- is sometimes shown by superior officers, and also to counteract the baneful effects Of the exercise of social influence, we must have a provision of this kind. In speaking on the second reading of the Bill, I mentioned that I thought that for one case of political influence we should probably find there would be at least ten cases of the exercise of social influence. That is, I think, rather a-n under estimate of the probable results, without such a clause as I propose. We have provided very elaborate and expensive safeguards against the exercise of political influence in this Bill ; but there is nothing which I can see except an appeal to Caesar in the shape of the commissioner himself when any injustice is done to a civil servant. Every petty officer throughout the service has his favorites. Every postmaster may have certain clerks whom he favours, and there may be others against whom he may have some grudge. He may have relations under him or there may be some friend of his or influential man in the town who desires to have his son promoted as rapidly as possible. There is always a great danger of those who have influence getting the preference over those who are equally capable, but without the influence to push them ahead. The appeal board which I suggest will, I think, counteract the evil exercise of social influence in the service, and under it the service may be worked more satisfactorily. Unless some such course as I suggest is adopted, I am quite certain there will be a great deal of dissatisfaction throughout the service. We must bear in mind that shortly we shall have a reclassification of the whole service, and we know that altered conditions always create some dissatisfaction. In connexion, for instance, with the Tariff, where people have lived in a certain State under a certain system for a number of years, they consider that system the best in the interests of their State, and they necessarily feel a certain amount of annoyance at having a new system thrust upon them, though it may be considered best in the interests of the whole of Australia. A similar change is taking place in connexion with the public service. We are abolishing the Public Service Acts which have been in force in the different States, and substituting for them one Act, which is to apply throughout the Commonwealth. In the reclassification which must be made, though the officers will, no doubt, endeavour to be fair in every recommenda*tion they make, it is certain that some injustice or supposed injustice will become apparent. It is quite certain also that unless we have a satisfied civil service the public interests will suffer. My proposal is for the appointment of a board of appeal, consisting of the permanent head or chief officer in each State, the inspector, and a third man appointed by the civil servants themselves, in order that their case may be fairly brought before the board. I do not propose that the decision of this board will be final, but that the board shall have the power of recommendation. Their recommendation, along with copies of the evidence taken in each inquiry, will be placed before the commissioner, whose decision will be final. This system has been adopted in other places in Australia, and has proved eminently successful. I find that in December, 1900, the New South Wales Government Railways Act was amended to make better provision for the hearing and determining of appeals by the employes. The powers of the commissioners to hear and determine appeals, except with regard to the right to promotion, were transfered to a board consisting of the secretary to the commissioners, the chief accountant, the chief mechanical engineer, the engineer-in-chief for existing lines, the chief traffic manager, and an elected representative of the employes. Three of these members formed a quorum, and every decision of the board was final and conclusive. I find, also, that in New Zealand in October, 1894, an Act, entitled the Post and Telegraph Departments Act 1894, was introduced. This Act established a board of appeal, to which is referred all appeals relating to any question of classification, status, or salary, arising under the Post and </para>

It reports to the Minister, whose decision is final. </para>

            <para>- They are asking that the board shall give a decision instead of merely a recommendation. In South Australia the Civil Service Act, read a first time on August 28th, 1901, prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Castle,</inline> and settled by the Right Honorable C. C. Kingston, Q.C., provides for a railway appeal board of five members, four appointed by the Government, and one selected by the railway servants, to which any aggrieved civil servant can appeal. Each member of the board is to hold office for five years, and effect is to be given to the decisions of the board. The Bill also provides that where an officer of the public service has been suspended, if he denies the truth of the charge madeagainsthim, another board shall be appoin ted, such as is provided for in clause 45 of this Bill, to hear, receive, and examine evidence, and report to theMinister. It is evident that this system has been introduced comparatively recently in two of the States of the Commonwealth, and also in New Zealand, and in each case there have been very few complaints. I believe that formerly in the New South Wales civil service they had an appeal to the commissioner, and some of the appeal cases were two years in arrears. That is certainly a very long time for a civil servant to be suffering under injustice before his appeal can be heard. 1 believe that by the creation of such a board as I suggest all the grievances, or alleged grievances, may be carefully gone into. There will, under this proposal, be an appeal board in each of the States; they can give their decision upon cases brought before them and send on their recommendations with the evidence taken to the commissioner. The proposal will take an enormous amount of work and trouble off the shoulders of the commissioner, and will avoid the necessity of lengthy correspondence between aggrieved civil servants and officials in various parts of the Commonwealth. It will be observed that I also propose that a deposit shall be lodged with the commissioner in connexion with each appeal in order to prevent frivolous cases being, brought beforethe board. </para>

            <para>- What is the deposit? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline> SMITH.- I propose that it shall be prescribed by regulation. If that suggestion is adopted it will prevent the bringing, forward of frivolous charges which might otherwise occupy the time of the Government officials, and more important grievances will thus be more readily dealt with. The subjects of appeal, as I propose, will embrace complaints from those who have passed the civil service examination and who have not been admitted into the service in their proper order ; those whose promotion has been wrongly refused ; those who are not receiving the salaries to which they are entitled; and, what I think is of more importance, those who have been transferred to outlying places and have been left there for a number of years. It is not necessary forme to give many illustrations of the last phase of this question. But I may say it is in my experience that those civil servants who have powerful friends behind them, and can exercise social influence, are very seldom sent out into the back country where there are none of the concomitants of civilization, and where life is not nearly so pleasant as in the great capital cities. Officers who have no influence are fixed upon to go out to these places, and their only option is to resign or to go into what is, in some cases, almost a life&#39;s exile, and in other cases a living death. I received a letter only by the last mail from a friend of mine in Western Australia who is not connected with the civil service in any way. He tells me of a civil servant who, with his wife and family, has been for five years without a change in one of the way-backsettlements of that State, hundreds of miles from any railway station or from civilization. My friend says - </para>

I think it is a shame to keep him, his wife, and family for year after year where his children cannot get any fresh food, fish, or milk.

        </quote>
        <para class="block">There are many cases like that in the State I represent. There are many civil servants who have been sent out to places like Broome, Eucla, and Lawlers, hundreds of miles from a railway station. It is done in many instances, as it is a matter of some difficulty to get any. civil servant to go to such places voluntarily. The consequence is, especially if the Government adopt a <inline font-style="italic">laissez faire</inline> policy, that these officers are allowed to remain there from year to year. In some cases great injustice has been done in this way to useful and intelligent civil servants. A board such as I propose would be able to consider these cases impartially, and to send their recommendation with the evidence to the commissioner for his decision. I will quote another case. In an inland town in one of the States an officer was dismissed. The grounds alleged for the dismissal were that he was incompetent. But it was stated on the other side that the real ground was that the dismissal was a personal matter. The department sent up an officer from the capital of that State to inquire. The department was perfectly sincere in the matter, but the civil servants employed under the local head, who was a little tyrant, were afraid to give . evidence that would incriminate their chief. One of them wrote to me saying that if he were asked to give his reasons and ideas of why the dismissal took place he would be afraid to divulge the whole truth about the case. He said, &#34; If I state what I really think one of two results will ensue to me. Either I shall be dismissed on a mere frivolous charge or I shall be relegated to some out-back place for years to come. I do not mind so much for myself, but I am a man with a wife and a young family whom I have to think of.&#34; Very great cruelty is being inflicted on civil servants by means of a system of terrorism. Ifthere were an appeal board such as I propose, those civil servants would be able to say exactly what they thought and believed, without fearing that a charge would subsequently be trumped up against them by the same head against whom a complaint was made. They would know that they would get a fair trial. The board would be independent. It would arrange and classify the evidence, and report the facts to thecommissioner. We should by its means have a more efficient civil service, and better and more economical management than we have now. Consequently the public would be better served. I could give many illustrations of injustices that have occurred under the present system, but I do not wish to take up the time of the committee. I ask honorable senators to consider the matter carefully. </para>

          <para>- The position is perfectly clear. So far as I can gather from the papers which have been circulated, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> originally gave notice of his intention to move a new subclause upon clause 44. He intimated to me that he did not intend to proceed with that proposal, but had decided to move an amendment upon clause 50. Quite irrespective of that, it was competent for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> not to go on with his proposal in regard to clause 44, but to move an amendment on clause 50. What he now proposes is to strike out certain words after the word &#34; officer,&#34; with a view to substitute other words. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> has also given notice of an amendment, I propose to conserve his rights in that regard, in accordance with the usual practice. That can be done by testing the scheme proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> on the striking out* of the word &#34; feeling &#34; which is the third word in the clause. If that word be struck out it will be an intimation that the scheme as submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> is acceptable to the committee. But if that word is permitted to remain, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will in due time have an opportunity of proposing the amendment of which he has given notice. </para>

He proposes that any officer affected by a report under the Act shall have the right of appeal. Supposing that an officer who has been living in the centre of Australia for years is not affected by any report under the Act, but is suffering under a great injustice. My proposal is that, if he asks his superior officer that he may be removed, and his request is refused, he can appeal to the board against such decision. Nothing can be wider than my proposal. </para>

          <para>- I think we have got ourselves into a tangle, and that what you proposed to do, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> has been departed from. You proposed to test the feeling of the committee by submitting an amendment as to the word &#34; feeling.&#34; Instead of that being done, I find that the whole clause has practically been struck out. That is the result of springing a surprise on the committee by applying a notice of an amendment to a clause other than that in relation to which it was given. After this experience it is evident to me that it will be infinitely wiser for honorable senators to give no notice whatever of their amendments, but to spring them on the committee, and make as much confusion as possible. Of course, if any honorable senator wishes to have his amendment in print, he can give notice of an intention to move an amendment on one clause and apply it to another. It seems to me that would be the wisest course to adopt in future in order to save the committee from getting into a ridiculous position like that in which we are placed now. By a process of verbal changes - something being proposed at one time, and something at another - I find that the clause has been so altered that I cannot move the amendment of which I have given notice, and which I ought to be entitled to move. I am not finding any fault with any one, but  it will be an object-lesson to us. </para>

As soon as the amendment that has been circulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> is put to the committee I shall feel bound to move an amendment upon it for the omission of the words relating to the board of inquiry, and for the insertion in lieu thereof of the very words proposed to be struck out now, namely, &#34; commissioner in such manner and within such time as may be prescribed.&#34; I do not want any question to be raised subsequently as to our  competency to re-insert these words in the clause after they have been struck out. </para>

            <para>- There are several matters that I object to in the amendment as it stands now. It is exceedingly inconvenient to be called upon to discuss a clause of a complicated nature like this, which has not been printed and circulated. I have been trying to follow the matter with the help of a shorthand note, but I think it is exceedingly likely that we shall find, after we have discussed the matter at some length, that nobody knows what the amendment is. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline> amendment has been considerably altered since it was first printed. The amendment which he proposes requires that a deposit shall be lodged by any officer who desires to appeal. That is very objectionable, unless the honorable senator contemplates that the deposit is going to be &#34;graduated according to the amount of the officer&#39;s salary. To require a deposit to be lodged would have the effect of debarring officers with small salaries from appealing, and leaving the remedy open only to officers with large salaries. </para>

            <para>- That isa power which the commissioner would not  care to  exercise. I object entirely to a deposit being required, whether it is graduated or not. If a man has a good case for appeal, he ought to be allowed the right to appeal, whether he has any money to back it up or not. The reason for this proposal is obvious. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has -put forward a very complicated form of appeal which would involve a great deal of delay, and some expense. In order to prevent time and money being wasted by frivolous appeals, he proposes that in all cases a deposit shall be required. It -is very much better to give every, man the freest possible opportunity of appealing if he has a grievance, and we should allow the tribunal to which he appeals to be the simple and proper one of the commissioner. There we come to the principal point of the amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> is not satisfied with the right of appeal to the commissioner, hut wishes to interpose between him and the aggrieved servant, an inquiry board different from those said by him to exist in some of the States. He has worded his amendment in such a way that it will be necessary for some one to say how the board shall be constituted. First of all, he provides that one of two persons is to be on the board - the permanent head, or the chief officer. </para>

If not it will mean that in every case of an appeal somebody or other will have to decide whether the permanent head or the chief officer shall sit as a member of this board.

There may be three, four, or six inspectors, and the same difficulty will arise. Who is to decide which inspector shall act? Under this amendment there must be some person authorized in each State to constitute the board. It is not clear under this clause, but it may be intended that the Commissioner shall do this because the report of the board has to come to the commissioner, who is finally to decide. With regard to the member of the board who is to be the representative of the class of officers to which the person whose case is being inquired into belongs, there is no machinery provided in the clause for his selection. </para>

            <para>- I am quoting from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline> amendment, which is entirely foreign to anything put into the Bill up to the present time. Under the honorable senator&#39;s proposal any officer who is aggrieved at anything done by the commissioner, or apparently at anything ever done before, may appeal to this board. Every officer in the service who is not satisfied with his position, his location, or his pay, or anything else, may demand a board of inquiry, and somebody has to constitute that board. The board, when constituted, hears the case, and sends a report with a recommendation to the commissioner, whose decision is to be final. Senator-Smith said there were between 11,000 and 12,000 members of the Commonwealth civil service, and we all know that in such a great body of men there will be found a large number who are dissatisfied, not with what may be done under this Bill, but who have a whole list of past grievances, and every one of them can ask for an inquiry under this proposed clause. The honorable senator says that it would not involve much expense, but civil servants having the right of an inquiry before this board must have the right to bring their witnesses. A man is dissatisfied with his position in the service because he thinks he should have been promoted instead of another man, and he may insist upon getting witnesses from all over the country. </para>

            <para>- What a farce it is to ask for an inquiry before a board, if it remains for the board to say whether they will hear a man&#39;s witnesses or not ? If the officer aggrieved is to have the right to call witnesses, he may call his fellow officers from the same department, or officers from the various States. A clause such as this would simply invite dissatisfaction and appeals, and put the whole service into a state of disorganization. The proposal of the Bill is that an appeal may be made to the commissioner. I know that some members of the Senate do not like the idea of a commissioner, and anything seems good enough to substitute for him. But if we adopt the principle of the Bill, and agree to an appointment of a commissioner, what we shall have to do will be to get a throughly reliable man, make the appeal to him as simple and as easy as possible without any deposit, and trust him to do justice to the members of the service. The proposal, of the honorable senator will be so cumbersome that it must br ak down of its own weight. It could have no beneficial effect at all, and I cannot agree with the honorable senator&#39;s amendment. </para>

          <para>- The policy of leaving  everything to  the commissioner was tried in the Railway department of Victoria many years ago, and the commissioners themselves raised objection to it, for the all sufficient reason that a large portion of the time which should have been devoted to the management of the Railways had to be devoted to the hearing of appeals. The upshot of it was an amendment of the Railways Management Act by the Government, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Best</inline> was a member in 1896. Under that amended Act an appeal board is constituted, and every man who feels himself aggrieved in any way can go before that board. If the offence with which he is charged involves dismissal or reduction in rank or grade he is given the right to appear by counsel. The appeal board is formed of certain officers who are named - the accountant, the engineer for existing lines, the chief mechanical engineer, and the secretary for railways, and added to these there is a man nominally appointed by the Governor in Council, but in fact selected by election by the employes themselves. This board is sitting frequently at the Railway offices. If the charge made is an important one the officer accused may ask that all the evidence be taken upon oath, and that right is frequently exercised. It is quite true, as the Postmaster-General has pointed out, that men have to come from different parts of the Railway service to give evidence, and properly so, too, if we desire to get at the truth of the matter. I do not see that that is any objection at all. The appeal board goes into the charges made exhaustively because they are practical men, and know what they are dealing ! with. I remind honorable senators that that board has to deal with a service consisting of 12,000 people, which is 1,000 more than the Commonwealth service. When this appeal board has&#39; given its decision, if the officer still feels himself aggrieved and thinks he has not had justice done, he has a further appeal to the commissioner himself. The commissioner in hearing the appeal may take evidence upon oath, and from his decision there is no appeal. The working of this board has given a good deal  of satisfaction, but in this particular matter it seems to me that there is a good deal of force in what the Postmaster-General has said as to the difficulty of deciding who is to form the board. That is the weak part of the amendment, as I believe every member of the committee agrees with the principle of it. I should like to point out in connexion with the railways appeal board in Victoria, that if, for instance, an officer charged with dereliction of duty  appeals to this board, and belongs to the department in charge of the chief mechanical engineer, the chief mechanical engineer does not sit upon the board, but leaves the matter to be dealt . with by the other members of the board. I think it will be necessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> to specify in his amendment the officers who are to form the board. </para>

          <para>- If the honorable senator&#39;s intention were to enable persons to get a local hearing of their ! complaint I could quite understand it, but the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> goes beyond that. If the honorable senator desired that a person in a State should be able to take all the evidence, and then that that evidence should be submitted to the commissioner, and the commissioner should give his decision upon it without the permanent head giving any expression of opinion, there would be a good deal of force in the suggestion. Both sides should give their evidence before the officer appointed for the purpose of taking the evidence, but the evidence should then be sent to the commissioner unbiased by any expression of opinion on the part of the permanent head in the locality, so that, the commissioner might decide for himself. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> the danger of his suggestion. Say, for instance, a dispute arises between the permanent head of the Postal department in Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sholl,</inline> and some of his officers. Under the honorable senator&#39;s proposal, a trial takes place upon which the permanent head sits. Not only do the board take evidence on both sides, but the permanent head, together with two other members of the board, express an opinion upon the evidence taken.Surely it would be better in the interests of the officer himself, that the evidence should be taken before some person and sent on to the independent commissioner, who is without local bias, to give his decision - as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> intends he should do ultimately - without any recommendation involving an expression of opinion by the board of appeal. I suggest to the committee that the local recommendation is not at all desirable. The local taking of evidence for convenience sake may be very desirable indeed, but when the commissioner has to come to a conclusion he is better without such a recommendation. Again I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> that he does not state what is to become ofthe deposit which has to be made. There is absolutely no provision for its forfeiture in the event of an appeal being dismissed. </para>

            <para>- The amount of the deposit can be prescribed, but we could not put in the regulations what was to become of the deposit. That should be provided in the clause itself. If the clause were remodelled so as to make provision for the hearing of evidence on both sides locally, and then for that evidence being submitted without being coloured by the opinion of the permanent head in the locality, the honorable senator would achieve his object very much more effectively than by means of the amendment as drawn. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>NEILD (New South Wales). - We have got to a point where we can again see the inadvisableness of starting on a certain track and then going on to another. The amendment before the committee is quite understandable if read in the light of the clause to which it was originally intended to apply, namely, clause 44, but it is altogether out of place as attaching to the clause before the committee. This is an amendment that will enable appeals in respect of certain matters, but not of all. If some decision is given affecting the status of an officer and his future prospects, involving a censure or dismissal, it cannot be made the subject of an appeal under this amendment. Under the clause as it stood, it was intended that all decisions affecting an officer adversely should be subject to appeal. But we have taken away that right of appeal except in certain directions, and are now asked to establish a board, one member of which is to be the very officer whose decision is appealed against. In some of the Supreme Courts of the States there has been special legislation prohibiting Judges from sitting to hear applications for appeals against . their own decisions. In New South Wales a J udge is not allowed to sit to hear any application for a new trial in a case which he has tried. That is a sound principle which it is sought to throw aside in the present case, where it is proposed to allow an appeal &#34; from Philip drunk to Philip sober &#34; - or the other way about. The permanent head having given a decision, if an appeal is lodged against it he will sit in judgment on himself. I cannot conceive that that is a wise thing. I believe in an appeal court of some kind. Incidentally, I may remark that my proposal was that the appeal court should consist of the commisssioner, a representative to be elected by the officers in the division in which the officer appealing serves, and having the Minister as  chairman.  But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline> proposal is of a different character.  His  appeal board is to consist of the permanent head, whose decision is appealed against, an elected representative, and an inspector. &#34; The inspector &#34; and &#34; the commissioner &#34; under this measure will virtually be interchangeable terms. As to the deposit, it is a principle with Englishmen that justice is not to be sold. In the case of an appeal against the working of the civil service, I do not think that any deposit ought to be asked for. If a man seeks justice, he oughtnot to have to pay for it in advance. Then, what is to become of the deposit? Under this proposal nothing can be done with it. </para>

When petitions are presented against the return of Members of Parliament a deposit is required, *md that fact may be used as an argument against what I have just said about the sale <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> justice. But in that case it is quite competent for the appeal to be dismissed, and for a refund of the deposit to be made. Here there is no stipulation for that. </para>

            <para>-Col. NEILD. - The amendment had better be amended in that direction. I am in favour of an appeal board, but I am not in favour of the permanent head, whose decision is appealed against, being a member of the board. Then again, if, when the appeal is dismissed, the money is to be refunded, the reverse should be the case if the appeal is sustained. The appellant should then be paid a similar sum of money to recoup him for the expenses to which he has been put. If an alteration is made with regard to the deposit, and also with regard to the  permanent  head not being a member of the appeal board, I will see if I cannot vote for the amendment. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has brought forward a matter which is worthy of great consideration, and, like -many others, I have some sympathy with the desire to establish some kind of board, by means of which a civil servant who feels himself aggrieved - and who in some cases may be justly aggrieved - may have the right of appeal. But as the clause is drafted it takes no notice of the principle and purport of the provisions we have already passed. The amendment provides for an appeal by any person who feels aggrieved by a decision of his -superior officer. But the most important matters affecting civil servants will not be regulated by either the chief officer or the permanent head-, but by the commissioner. The grading of the civil service is to be done by the commissioner, all the duties specified in clause 41 are to be in the hands of the commissioner, and questions of status and salary to be decided by the commissioner. Therefore the amendment ought  to read - &#34; Aggrieved by the decision of the commissioner.&#34; </para>

            <para>- No, the commissioner is the person who is placed over the whole service, and has control of its grading and classification. Does my honorable friend think that the permanent head will, where an office has to be filled, absolutely recommend the identical man, say John Jones, whom he thinks ought to fill that office <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Nothing of the kind. He will realize his proper functions, and, knowing that he is practically a nonentity in these matters, will make his reports to the commissioner meaningless and colourless. He will never go out of his way to tell the commissioner - &#34; I think clerk A should be appointed to that billet.&#34; He will probably mention half-a-dozen names, and leave the final decision with the commissioner. Therefore it appears to me to be useless to have a clause giving an appeal from a superior officer, when the appeal will really be wanted from the commissioner. The whole scope of the amendment&#39; is absolutely at variance with the Bill, which retains in the hands of the Governor - General - who is the Cabinet - control even over the commissioner. If the Cabinet object to what the commissioner has done, and refuse to appoint a certain officer to a place as the commissioner recommends, they have to dissent and lay their reasons on the table of each House of Parliament. Throughout the Bill it is the Governor-General in Council - the Cabinet - to whom civil servants have to appeal. Therefore, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has any hope of passing his amendment, he will absolutely upset clause 8, clause 41, and a number of others, and create chaos. I have no love for the commissioner, because it- appears to me that he will have such a difficult and delicate duty to perform that he must make some mistakes. To rectify mistakes which may be apparent the moment they are inquired into, I have <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> rooted objection to some kind of appeal board, but let it be something in accord with what we have passed. I object altogether to this Bill, because it takes away the proper responsibility of Ministers, and I am not going to vote for taking away the small shred of that responsibility which is left to them. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> kindly tell me whether he means. by the words &#34;the decision of the commissioner shall be final &#34; to supersede the power of the Governor-General ? </para>

Would it not be peculiar for the Minister to sit on the board, and for the officer to appeal to the commissioner against its decision?

            <para>- Yes ; but the  chairman  would have a casting vote. In the Railway department of Victoria six members comprise the board of appeal, and it frequently happens that only four of them sit. A  chairman  is elected for each case, and he has a casting vote. If my suggestion were adopted there would be on the board two officers belonging to the department in which the appellant was employed. The other two members would be pretty well informed after listening to the evidence, and practically they would decide the case. If there is to be a board in every department in each State, the Commonwealth will be full of boards. Surely one board for each State will be sufficient ? Its decision should be sent direct to the commissioner. </para>

          <para>- In nineteen cases out of twenty the commissioner would be the person against whose decision the officers would appeal, and yet the Government proposed that he should be the judge as to whether he had done his duty. That was wrong in principle, and therefore I voted against it. I prefer to have a board, but not the board which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has proposed. I do not prefer a board which includes the permanent head of a department, because very likely he will be the officer who has made the recommendation, and the commissioner will have agreed to make a certain appointment or overlook certain claims, and therefore he will be implicated in the case. I think the majority of the committee will agree that a board is preferable to the commissioner. It is impossible for us on the spur of the moment to frame a good, intelligent working clause, but if the Government will accept the decision of the committee, the draftsman could frame a clause, doing away, of course, with the deposit, constituting a board in each State, with the right of appeal for final decision, not to the commissioner, but to the Governor-General in Council. Do not take away the Ministerial responsibility. </para>

          <para>- I am very glad to see that a majority of the committee are in favour of an appeal board. As to its constitution, I am not particular what amendments are made so long as it is a board which will carefully hear the cases. It was my intention that such a board should exist in each State, and my reason for using the words, &#34;the permanent head or chief officer,&#34; was that if the case arose in Victoria it would be the permanent head, or if it occurred in Western Australia or South - Australia, the chief officer. I desired the evidence to be taken locally, and the recommendation of the board sent on to the commissioner. If it is to be sent on to the Governor-General in Council, political patronage will be introduced. Influence may be brought to bear on the Minister or the Governor-General in Council by persons in the public service, and the Minister will practically be the one to settle a dispute right over the head of the commissioner and the permanent head. I think it is inadvisable to let the Minister decide the appeal. &#39;I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> is in favour of Ministerial control, and therefore is in favour of an alteration to that effect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> raised no arguments against the appeal board, but simply confined himself to one or two quibbles as to what the amount of the deposit should be. The amendment provides that it shall be fixed by regulation, but he considered that it would be a great undertaking for the Ministry to say what it should be. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> is going to propose the deletion of the words in my amendment requiring that a deposit shall be lodged. I shall support that proposal. The Postmaster-General simply opposes this amendment because it makes an alteration in his Bill. He seems to look upon this measure as a kind of inspired collection of laws that no one should alter - a sort of modern Koran, which none but the faithful should touch. When an amendment is proposed on a clause, the PostmasterGeneral says at once that the clause as it stands is the best. The only reason which he has brought forward  against the passing of my amendment is that it would be a very great hardship to impose on the Ministry the duty of determining what the amount of the deposit should be. I shall be glad, therefore, to relieve his mind of that trouble by supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild&#39;s</inline> amendment. As the Postmaster-General has raised no other objection, I presume he will be satisfied with the clause in that amended form. I think that the clause can be passed in that form, and the Minister can agree that, if desired, the clause will be recommitted, so that an alteration may be made if required. There is a general desire that there shall be a board, and in order that we may push on with business, I would ask honorable senators to vote for my amendment, as proposed to be amended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> upon that understanding. </para>

            <para>- I am always so good-natured in giving way to every one and obtaining nothing in return. I must play my own hand just as well, as other honorable senators do. I think the omission of the words I have named would make the proposed clause much more workable. There are many subjects other than those named in the amendment upon which an officer may desire to appeal, and if we specify with too much preciseness the subjects on which an officer may appeal we shall limit the right. The right of appeal was wider under the clause as originally presented. </para>

          <para>- This clause will preclude any officer transferred to the Commonwealth from the public service of any of the States from compulsory insurance. I have had a return prepared which shows that less than 1,600 of the 11,000-odd civil servants taken over by the Commonwealth have any right to pensions or superannuation allowances. We are deliberately proposing by this clause that the rest shall not be compelled to effect assurances on their lives, but that only those who have been directly engaged by the Commonwealth shall be compelled to take out premiums. I think that is a very great mistake. Every one agrees that it is right that civil servants should be assured. If that is so, why should nine-tenths of our employes be left out of this provision, and only those directly employed by the Commonwealth required to assure ? Some alteration should be made in the clause whereby officers transferred from the service of any of the States to the Commonwealth will be forced to assure their lives, provided that they are under a certain age and are not entitled to any insurance pensions or superannuation. </para>

        <para class="block">Legislature, had his money returned to him, the Legislature compelling him to take his money back. That was the case in Queensland. Would it be just, after that officer had endeavoured to make provision for old age, and the Legislature, without consulting him, had compelled him to take back his money, to transfer him to the Commonwealth service, and compel him to assure his life ? The object of the clause is to make sure that young men who come directly into the service of the Commonwealth, and voluntarily under the laws of the Commonwealth, shall assure their lives. It is considered that there would be an element of injustice in compelling men taken over with the transferred departments, without being consulted in the matter, to assure their lives, without regard to their age. </para>

          <para>- I think some provision should be made to bring within the requirements as to insurance the large number of civil servants taken over with the transferred departments. The objection that there are a number of old men in these departments is met by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline> proposal that a certain age within which an officer shall be required to insure shall be specified. A subsequent clause provides that all those who enter the service henceforth shall be insured. We are told that there are only some 600 of the civil servants taken over by the transferred departments who have any right to pensions or superannuation allowances. The great bulk of them have no policies over their lives, and I cannot see what penalty will be inflicted upon them in applying to them the rules which apply to all who enter the service directly. It may be said that to require a civil servant to insure his life amounts really to a reduction of his salary, but the compensating advantage is that it provides a pension for his old age. I do not think that there will be any opposition to this proposal on the part of civil servants, unless it is provided that an officer who cannot pass the medical examination shall leave the service: With such a proposal as that I would not agree, but any officer who can pass the necessary examination should assure his life under the clause subsequent to this. </para>

            <para>- If any individual officer has no objection to assuring his life, how will this clause stand in his way ? If he does not object he can assure, and there is nothing in the clause to prevent him from doing so. The only object of the clause is to compel a man to do something which he is not willing to do. I would ask honorable senators to look at clause 58, which provides that where an officer was compelled in the State service, from which he was transferred, to assure his life, or to contribute to a superannuation fund, he shall be required to continue his payments. </para>

If we say to them - &#34; You shall not retain your position unless you do something that you have never previously been required to do,&#34; we shall certainly interfere with the integrity of section 84 of the Constitution Act.

I have been appealed to again and again in such cases to induce Parliament to make some monetary grant. In Queensland, some years ago, the young members of the public service created a tremendous stir, and were sufficiently strong to induce Parliament to repeal the superannuation sections of the Civil Service Act, and return the money which had been contributed under them. I venture to say that if numbers of those persons were to-day asked to alter their decision, they would admit that it had been an exceedingly unwise one. I gave a&#39; vote on that occasion for altering the law and giving, back the money contributed, and 1 have never ceased to regret that vote. </para>

            <para>- It may have been of some value to the State, but I venture to say it was of not much value to the civil servants or to their dependants. The object aimed at by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> in insisting that there should be some provision in this Bill under which civil servants would be compelled to make provision for those dependent upon them is an extremely wise object. The Postmaster-General says that these public servants have the right to assure if they wish to do so, but there are numbers of persons who will neglect this duty, and it is not wise that Parliament should stand on one side and allow them to continue to neglect it. It is the duty of Parliament to step in and prevent the terrible calamity of poverty overtaking the dependants of these civil servants when they are gone. Women have . come to me and . have said - &#34; My husband was in the public service for many years, but the salary he drew was altogether inadequate to make provision for his family, and we are now in a state of destitution. Will you help us <inline font-style="italic">1&#34;</inline> I have given a willing ear and a willing hand to induce Parliament to make a grant in such cases, but we do not want these appeals to be continued. We now have an opportunity to insist upon public servants making some provision for their dependants, and such a clause should be inserted in the Bill. </para>

          <para>- I should like to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> that we are not considering at the present time the expediency of civil servants insuring their lives. The Bill itself says that it is an expedient thing to do, and that it shall be done. But it also says that this provision shall not extend to officers of the transferred departments. That was the distinct understanding upon which the Constitution was passed, and 1 it is embodied in the Bill. The transferred departments were taken over with all their liabilities. The superannuation allowances accruing from day to day to civil servants are to be preserved and continued. If we have most industriously provided that the transferred departments shall be transferred just in the condition in which they were, and that the officers in them shall continue to have all the rights they had before, will we not be doing an act quite inconsistent with that understanding, and with the provisions of the Constitution if we say to those officers - &#34;The Government will now put a burden upon you which did not exist in your service before your transfer1}&#34; That would be distinctly unfair, and it is admitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> in reply to an interjection made, that an officer transferred might he of an advanced age, and might be absolutely ruined if required to affect any substantial insurance. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH (Western Australia). - My suggestion was that only persons of a certain , age, who were not insured, or were not entitled to a pension or a superannuation fund, should be placed on the same footing as new officers joining the Commonwealth service. I know that the rights of transferred officers are conserved, and I have no wish to interfere with any of their rights. We should be abrogating no right which they have by saying that they shall be compelled to assure their lives. Honorable senators might just as well say that they should remain under the same Civil Service Act as before, and should not be obliged to come under the Bill we are now considering. The people of Australia have established rights, hut it is quite competent for this Parliament - and I hope it will be done - to establish compulsory insurance. I believe that the objections raised are only quibbles, and that the intention is to prevent the establishment of a system of State compulsory insurance except upon a ridiculously small scale. We know that the new officers brought into the Commonwealth service number only a few hundreds, and we are going to establish a system of Commonwealth assurance, or compulsory private assurance, in the case of those few, while pver 11,000 transferred officers will not be affected. </para>

        <para>In this amendment I am not asking the Commonwealth to inaugurate any experimental legislation or any new system that has not been tried and approved in other civilized countries. It is a principle that has been&#39; almost universally adopted in the countries of Europe, and especially by Great Britain and its dependencies. I believe that we are practically agreed that the lives of civil servants in the Commonwealth departments should be assured at the expense of the civil servants themselves. The point that arises is whether we should force those officers to assure with private companies, or whether the Government should assure them. If the Commonwealth is to assure its officers, undoubtedly now is the time to do it, when we are inaugurating a civil service system for the Commonwealth. If we decide now that civil servants are to be assured in private companies, it will be difficult for us to retrace our steps, and we shall afterwards find greater difficulty in inaugurating a system of Government assurance than if we started at once. I wish to read one or two extracts as to the systems adopted in some of the leading countries of the world : - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In Germany old-age State insurance was inaugurated in 1889. Half of the premiums were paid, by employers, half by employes, to which the State added to each paid annuity a yearly subsidy of 50 marks. </para>
          <para>In France there is a national fund for old age established in 1850, of which all employes of the Government receiving a certain salary must become members. In 1862 there were 37,500 of these enrolled. The minimum annual deposit is 1 franc, the maximum 500 francs. The rate of interest in 1890 was 3J percent., but the rate varies with the state of the funds, and is fixed by annual decree. </para>
          <para>In Great Britain provision&#39; was made b3&#39;&#39; the Government for superannuation allowances as far back as .1809. In 1859 it was provided that, after ten years service, a retiring allowance was made of ten-sixtieths of the salary, with an increase of one-sixtieth for every year of service up to 40 years. </para>
          <para>In the Indian civil service 4 per cent, is deducted from the salaries of the officers. The public servants compulsorily retire at the age of 55 or 60 years, and draw pensions varying in </para>
          <para>Amount according to the positions they occupied. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>In Cape Colony a gratuity may be granted to any person whose service for pension purposes is at least a year, but not less than ten, amounting to not more than one month&#39;s salary for each year of service. Any person who has served ten years receives on retirement ten-sixtieths of such salary, and a further addition of one-sixtieth for each year up to 40 years. The rate of contribution is 3 per cent of salary or wages. </para>
        <para>In the Canadian Superannuation Act of 1886 it states that any one in service ten years or upwards, or who has attained the age of 60, or is incapacitated by bodily infirmity, is entitled to a superannuation allowance based on his average&#39; yearly salary  during  the then lust three years. If&#34; he has served ten years, he is entitled to an allowance of ten-fiftieths of such average salary, and for eleven years to eleven-fiftieths, and so on up to 35 years of service. A deduction towards, making good the superannuation allowance of 2 per cent, per annum shall be made from the salary of every civil servant receiving 600 dollars or upwards, and lj per cent, if less than G00- dollars. </para>
        <para>In <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> Zealand an example has been set in State insurance that we might well follow. They not only insure the lives of their civil servants, but of the general public as well. This was instituted iri 1870. They have received &#163;8,000,000 in premiums, have pud &#163;1,260,000 in bonuses, and though the <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> Zealanders are the most heavily insured people in the world, where insurance is-&#34; not compulsory, the Government hold 39,366 policies out of the 75,692 in existence, or morethan one-half of the total life insurances held. </para>
        <para class="block">These particulars are taken from official books. It will be seen that in the principal civilized countries of the world, and especially in Great Britain and her dependencies and colonies, the Governments have inaugurated funds to be used either for superannuation or assurance. Many of the1 systems I have mentioned have been in&#39; force for twenty years or more, and in nocase has there been a failure. It may besaid that some of these are assurance and some superannuation funds. I contend that&#39; there is no fundamental difference between an  assurance fund  and a superannuation fund. In each case the assurer pays regularly intoa certain fund and receives back his premiums with compound interest accruing at a certain period. The only difference i&#187; that in the one case he receives the stated amount for which he assures, and. in the&#62; other case he receives either at death or retirement the actual accumulated amount of his instalments and interest. The great principle is the same. It is that the Go=vernment itself controls the fund which is intended to secure to its officers a means of livelihood in their old age, or to allow a sum for the relatives of those who diewhile in the service of the Government. Surely Australia, and its Parliament which boasts of the progressive legislation it enacts, are not going to be behind th&#233; countries of Europe and the colonies of Great Britain in establishing a pension for the old age of our civil servants ! Surely it is not necessary for us to shrink from what little responsibility there is, and toreverse the policy that has existed in (Australia. In &#34;Western Australia any civil servant who has been employed for ten years gets a retirement allowanceof tensixtieths of his average salary for the preceding three years. In Victoria a pension is given to officers appointed before the 24th of December, 1881, of onesixtieth of the salary for each year&#39;s service up to 40 years, and officers not entitled to pensions must assure their lives. In New South Wales civil servants pay 4 per cent, of their salaries to a superannuation fund if they desire to do so ; if compulsorily retired they can withdraw the premiums paid, with 3 per cent, interest added. </para>

            <para>- That is just the point I wished to make. I quoted the honorable senator&#39;s remarks in Parliament to show that the fund has not been conducted on a proper actuarial basis. Not only have three States in Australia established a superannuation fund, but very many companies in Australia - private companies, banks, commercial institutions, and others - have themselves made provision for the old age of their employes. I am not asking for any experimental legislation. I am merely asking that the Commonwealth shall do the same with its employes as private companies are doing, as Great Britain and many of her colonies are doing, and as the leading countries are doing at the present time. Why should we force civil servants to go to assurance companies when we ourselves might assure their lives as has been done by other nations ? If we force civil servants into private companies, do we not incur very large moral and financial obligations ? If we force them to assure with some private company, does not the principle of compulsion carry with it the principle of guarantee ? The men who are now entering the service of the Commonwealth are, in the case of the clerical division, between the ages of sixteen and 21. Before they will be entitled to leave the service at 60 years of age, practically 40 years must elapse, and if we force them to assure in certain societies the moral obligation is cast upon us of saying that we shall guarantee their financial stability so far as those policies are concerned. I think he would be a bold man who would say that not one of those assurance societies will suspend payment during the next 40 years. There are financial cataclysms. Even an institution like the Bank of England has suffered severely in a financial panic. Are we going to say that during the next 40 years not one of these assurance societies will be unable to pay its way? I do not wish to say anything in disparagement of assurance societies. Speaking generally, I believe they are of high financial standing, and have rendered magnificent service to humanity. I believe that the amount of suffering which has been obviated by life assurance, and the thrift it has caused among the people, are beyond calculation. At the same time we must remember that these financial institutions are not absolutely impregnable, and thatsome of them may go under during the next 40 years. If that be the case, and we have required civil servants to assure with them, we shall be morally responsible for the money they have invested. If we assure the lives of the men who enter our civil service, we shall receive their premiums regularly, and as they are mostly between the ages of 16 and 21, there will be very few claims to pay for very many years to come. There will be no  necessity for any bonuses. It will mean a rapid accumulation of premiums and capital. What is the reason of the opposition that is shown to the Commonwealth undertaking this business? I think I can divide it into two heads. The first statement is that it is more expensive to the people who assure, as higher premiums have to be paid to obtain a given result, and the other . is that it places some liability on the Commonwealth. If we consider those objections we shall find that the dangers are very much over-estimated. In estimating the amount of bonuses which any company can pay, it is necessary for us to consider the expenses of its management. Hundreds of thousands of pounds are spent by the principal companies in building palatial offices, and on that money not one penny of interest is obtained, unless they have let portions of the premises. </para>

            <para>- I know they do, but if you take the balancesheet of any society you will find a certain amount locked up in buildings, and with the exception of portions which they have let that money is absolutely dead, and is earning no interest. Besides, they have to pay huge fees to the directors, to employ expensive staffs, to advertise very largely, to maintain an army of canvassers, and- to pay an immense amount of money in commissions, The working expenses of the Australian companies are 14 per cent, of their revenue and 30 per cent, of their profits. If the Commonwealth assured its civil servants it would have none of those expenses to bear. It would have no new offices to build, no directors&#39; fees to pay, and no large staff to employ. It would not require to advertise, or to employ an army of canvassers, or to pay huge commissions. It would not even have to bear the expense of medical examinations. Before a clerk enters the civil service he has to be examined, and that medical examination would also serve for the purpose of his assurance. A system of life assurance could be worked by the Commonwealth at a very- cheap rate. It could use the postoffice and the money-order office. The postmaster of any town could collect the premiums of the civil servants and remit money to the head office without exchange, and very few clerks would be required. </para>

            <para>- If the honorable senator knew anything about exchange he would not say that. I have been engaged in banking business for some years, and I think I know something about that matter. The money itself does not go ; it is merely a question of the equalization of balances. It would not necessitate the removal of money from one State to another. In a case like this, very few clerks need be employed. The system of State life assurance is a very simple one. There need not be any bonuses, and there is no expense incurred in collecting premiums. It merely requires a few clerks to enter up against the names of civil servants the amount of their premiums as they are sent in. In the inauguration of this life assurance system, no special actuarial calculations would be required; they are all at hand in the shape of those supplied by other assurance societies, and can be seen in the <inline font-style="italic">Banking Record,</inline> in the library, or in any financial journal. They show exactly the systems and the results of their investigations. Any one would be foolish to go in for a fresh investigation when these investigations are not kept private, but are made public by the life assurance societies. Therefore, I contend that civil servants would gain by State assurance ; that so far as the expenses of management are concerned, they would suffer nothing in relation to the amount of the premiums they would have to pay. We are told that there is an enormous accumulation of capital by private companies ; that they have made large profits, and are able, therefore, to exercise greater liberality than the Commonwealth, which would not be able to allow interest at a greater rate than 3 per cent. What is the average interest earned by the life assurance societies ? If we take all the societies in Australia, we find that the average interest which their accumulated capital earns is 4&#39;47 per cent. That at first sight looks very much larger than the 3 per cent, interest which the Government could allow. We must remember, however, that the companies have very heavy expenses in regard to management, amounting to no less than &#163;604,680 a year. If we deduct that from the total amount of interest they earn, namely, &#163;1,306,895, we find that the interest they earn on the whole of their &#163;29,983,282 of accumulated capital is very little over 2 per cent. It is between 2 and 2&#188; per cent. Of course we know that the life assurance societies have other means of revenue. They make a large profit out of lapsed policies, and they also make a certain amount of profit out of fines&#39; paid on overdue premiums. The average sum assured in all the Australian assurance companies is &#163;272, and the average premium paid on &#163;100 is &#163;3 3s. 6d. I will give illustrations of two policies. In one of the principal life assurance companies of Australia, the annual premium on a policy of &#163;100, taken out by a person of 21 years of age, is &#163;2 15s., and the surrender value of the policy at 55 years of age is &#163;197 17s. Another life assurance company in Australia, which had better be nameless, collected 5s. a month for ten years from a certain person on a stipulation that if thepremium were in arrears the policy should be cancelled. At the end of ten years the bare accumulation of the premiums amounted to &#163;30, and the company paid &#163;31 6s. 3d., so that the accumulated compound interest for ten years amounted to &#163;1 6s. 3d. The company stipulated further that in the event of the death of the person assured the premiums should be returned, plus a very small rate of interest. I am referring to these life assurance companies because I wish to point out that if the Government require their officers to assure their lives in private companies, they will be forced to give business to some such institutions as these. The policies of three Australian life assurance societies number 1,813, and the surplus over liabilities in one case is &#163;22,104. The annual premium income received by one society is as low as &#163;886. Half the Australian life assurance societies have less than an average of 9,000 policies. </para>

            <para>- That can be settled later on. I am giving reasons why I think the Commonwealth should undertake this business. If the honorable and learned senator can prove hereafter that we have not the power to undertake it, then my words will have been in vain. Itwill be seen from what I. have said that the enormous accumulated capital of the life assurance companies does not give the persons assured a very great advantage. Indeed, the accumulated capital of some of the life assurance societies is not so great as to render them financially beyond criticism. If the Commonwealth Government carry out the proposal in this Bill, and say that servants of the Commonwealth shall assure in some Australian assurance society, what will be the result? The financial standing of these companies go from the top to the bottom in gradual gradations. The Government, no doubt, will pick out one or two of the societies and say - &#34;These are the societies in which the civil servants of the Commonwealth shall assure.&#34; Immediately they do that the society next in gradation will say to the Government - &#34;Why are we penalized? You say practically that it is not safe for a civil servant to assure his life in our office.&#34; The societies will be continually using their influence to have their names placed, on the list of offices with which civil servants may do business, for the placing of them on that list would practically be the hall-mark of their financial standing. If the Government said to a society &#34; We will not include your office . amongst the list,&#34; it would mean that the Government did not consider them of sufficient financial standing. A great deal of influence will be brought to bear on the Government to direct their officers to assure their lives in many of these Australian societies. If that were done, I think it must be apparent to honorable senators from the figures I have quoted, that there would be great danger, in regard to the financial standing of some of these companies, in the case of a person whose policy had, say, 40 years to run. I should like to show how a system of Commonwealth life assurance would compare with that of private companies. In order to obtain information on this point I have secured a statement from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen,</inline> the Actuary of Friendly Societies in Victoria. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> is one of the leading actuaries in Australia. He placed the friendly societies on a proper financial basis, and it is admitted that the scheme which he drew out for them has worked with the very best results. .

        <para class="block">Here is an illustration from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen&#39;s</inline> figures. According to the New Zealand system of instalments, a civil servant aged twenty receiving from &#163;200 to &#163;250 per annum, would receive, on reach- &#187; ing 60 years of age, &#163;538 ; that is, with the money invested at 3 per cent. In a system of Government life assurance I presume that the premiums would be graduated according to the salaries received by the civil servants&#39;&#34; assurance. If that were done on the lines of the New Zealand system we should find it work out as follows : - In New Zealand, on a salary of &#163;150 per annum, a civil servant has to pay &#163;5 per annum ; ona salary of from &#163;150 to &#163;200, &#163;7 10s.; from &#163;200 to &#163;250, &#163;10; from &#163;250 to &#163;300, &#163;12 10s.; from &#163;300 to &#163;350, &#163;15; and from &#163;350 to &#163;400, &#163;17 10s. The scale goes on in this way until it reaches the case of an officer receiving &#163;800 per annum, who has to pay &#163;40 per annum. It would not be any great hardship to require civil servants to pay these amounts because they are graduated according to their salaries. As their salaries were increased so they would have to pay increased premiums. </para>

            <para>- The amount assured. depends upon the premiums paid. I have pointed out that a civil ser-&#39; va&#187;t twenty years of age, getting from &#163;200 to &#163;250 per annum, would, under the scale allowed in New Zealand, get &#163;538 at death or on retiring at 60 years of age. That surely would be a fair return for the premiums he paid. If these figures compiled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Owen</inline> can be relied on, and there is no better actuary in Australia, they show that a fair return can be given to civil servants assuring with the Government. </para>

If we were proposing to adopt a system of general Commonwealth assurance, many people would be afraid to support it because of its colossal proportions, but there should be no objection on the part of honorable senators to approve of an assurance scheme upon a very much smaller scale such as I propose, because it would preclude the possibility of there being any very large loss to. the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- In Government securities generally. I contend that if the Government now establish State assurance for their civil servants they will be in an infinitely better position than any private assurance company making a start. The public servants would also be in a much better position, because the Government would not run the scheme for profit, and would make the premiums as low as they could for a given result. I am not sure that I shall not get the support of the Government for this purpose, because I know they never recede from a position they have taken up, and I am going to quote now a paragraph from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> containing the remarks of the Minister for Home Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, when speaking upon a similar motion. </para>

            <para>- Then I shall quote them as well as I can from memory. The Minister for Home Affairs expressed himself as interested in the question, and he disagreed with the assertion that there was any reason why State assurance should not be established so far as the civil service was concerned. He said it was a different question altogether to speak pf general Commonwealth assurance. If honorable senators desire to read what the honorable gentleman said they will find his remarks reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> No. 7, page 1733. </para>

        <para class="block">Home Affairs, I am sure, had no desire to mislead the House of Representatives, but he was utterly mistaken in the figures he got from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fenton.</inline> In those figures the retiring age was taken as 50 years instead of 60 years, which, of course, makes an immense difference. The figures gave results in the case of men entering the service at 25 years of age, and retiring at 50 years of age. They, therefore, dealt with a term of 25 years, which was absolutely absurd as applied to the provisions of this Public Service Bill. It is upon these figures that the honorable gentleman said that he had decided to alter his mind. I must apologize to honorable senators for taking up so much time, but I have endeavoured to prove that private assurance, companies, on account of their complicated system and their enormous expenses, are not in a position to offer much better, if any, better terms than the Commonwealth could offer to its civil servants. I point out also that we cannot be certain of the financial stability of all these private societies for the next 40 years. And if civil servants entering now at the age of 16 and 21 are not to get their money until they retire at the age of 60, the Commonwealth Government must for the next 40&#39; years to come guarantee these companies so far as their policies are concerned, and under the circumstances it would be infinitely better for the Commonwealth Government  to collect the premiums themselves, and assure the lives of civil servants. The system, I point out also, would prevent the  loss to civil servants  of  an immense  amount of money which, under the system of private assurance, they have to pay in fines. If a premium falls due in the middle of the month they are often unable to pay it until the end of the month, with the result that a fine is inflicted, or the policy lapses. That difficulty would be done away with under a Government system of assurance, because the premiums would be deducted from the officer&#39;s salaries. The policy I have suggested is similar to that adopted by Great Britain and her principal possessions. It is almost the universal practice in Europe, and in the most progressive countries of the world, and it is also the policy adopted by three of the States of Australia. I would ask honorable members to give this matter the attention which it undoubtedly deserves, because if we are going to have assurance now is the time to propose it, and if we neglect this opportunity it will be very difficult at a later date to retrace our steps and start a State assurance for the public service. </para>

          <para>- I do not propose to go into the whole question of State life assurance, because I think it is very  important  that we should get on with this Bill. I do not see that any debate upon this sub- ject now is likely to have any practical advantage. The system of State life assurance may be a very good one as compared with assurance by private companies. &#39; I may add that I feel pretty confident that we have power to introduce a system of State life assurance in the Commonwealth, but I feel quite certain that, considering the condition of business in this and in the other Chamber, and the work that is before the. Commonwealth Government at the present time, it is perfectly hopeless to suppose that the Government within any reasonable time to come will be in a position to commence this business of State life assurance. That being so, it seems to me to be unnecessary to go into a discussion of the matter in connexion with this Bill. </para>

            <para>-Well, I do not wish to discuss the question now, because I think that even if we came to the conclusion that a system of State life assurance was absolutely superior to the system of private life assurance, it would not lead to any good result. With regard to the civil servants who will be required to assure, it has been pointed out that they are  comparati  ve!ly few in number, because the bulk of the Commonwealth civil servants have been transferred from State departments, and the Senate has agreed that it would be unfair and improper to force the transferred officers to assure, so that really the only scope for the proposal at the present time and perhaps for a year or two to come would be with the probationers coming into the service. They are only young fellows, and what we propose is that before their appointment to the service is confirmed they shall assure their lives in some office. Seeing that up to the present time private assurance companies have been deemed to be sufficiently good for those in the service who have assured their, lives, even if the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> were absolutely correct, no harm could result from allowing probationers now coming into the service to assure their lives with companies which have been assuring the lives of civil servants in the past. Though there may be a number of civil servants transferred from State&#39; departments who have not been compelled to assure their lives, there are a great number for whom provision has been made, or who have made provision for themselves under their State Acts. It may perhaps surprise honorable senators to learn that; of the civil servants in the Commonwealth; entitled to pensions or retiring allowances, there are in the department of External Affairs, 15 ; in the Attorney-General&#39;s de*partment, 1 ; in the Treasury, 2 ; in the department of the Minister for Trade and Customs,&#39; 402 ; in the Defence department, 18 ; in the Postmaster-General&#39;s department 3,348 ; and in the department of Home Affairs, 3, or a total of <inline font-style="italic">3,789</inline>  officers in the Commonwealth service who are entitled to pensions or retiring allow*ances. </para>

            <para>- They have brought, their rights to pensions or retiring allowances with them from the States. Then we must take into consideration the officers whose lives are already assured. We know that the bulk of the officers in the Commonwealth service at the present time1 belong to the transferred departments, so that this amendment for the present, and perhaps for a few years to come, will apply very largely to young probationers ; and flunk that we might, instead of occupying time in discussing this question now, try to get the Bill through, and as far as those probationers are concerned, we might allow the system that has obtained in the past to continue. </para>

            <para>- I do not contemplate a suspension of payment on the part of one of the assurance companies. They have been doing business previously in connexion with civil service assurance, and I have no reason to suppose that those who assure for the next few years to come would take out policies in offices that were not absolutely sound. I do not desire now even to&#39; go into the question of whether a State system would give a better security than private offices. But it must be perfectly well known to honorable senators that some of these concerns of colossal size give an excellent security. We can hardly imagine a better security than is given by some of the large assurance offices which are doing business practically all over the world, and have large reserve funds well invested. The argument of insecurity is not sufficient to justify us in changing the character of this Bill. </para>

          <para>- The Postmaster-General has stated the objection to the proposed amendment in a very fair way. The chief objection is that it is quite inopportune. The proposal is one of a serious character which should only be adopted after very great consideration. In the present state of public business it is undesirable that we should enter upon so important a matter. The tendency of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline> remarks was largely to overrate the advantages of Government assurance and to underrate the advantages which the private offices can give. To cite one instance, he spoke of the rate of interest that might be allowed by the Government as 3 per cent. All calculations were to be made upon a basis of 3 per cent. But at the same time he gaveus information showing that the rate of interest obtained by the Australian offices on their funds was considerably over 4 per cent, or practically one-third in excess of what the Government would allow. The profits of the insurance companies are made out of interest earned, and it is from the interest which they are able to obtain that they can not only offer moderate premiums but pay considerable bonuses. Therefore, the private offices have in that respect a distinct advantage over the Government. I grant at once that the Government would be able to do its business at smaller expense, but let us remember that the advantages are not quite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has claimed. In all probability, if the Federal Government were to erect a building for the conduct of an assurance business, inasmuch as they would only have a small amount of business at first, the cost would have to be added to the premiums, and would be far in excess of the expenses incurred in this direction by any of the life assurance offices of Australia. At present the volume of business that could be done by the Government would, be so small that the expense would be very considerably above that incurred at present by the majority of the big offices in Australia. As to what is said about rents, I can assure honorable senators that there are many, assurance companies that have built large premises and are able to let such parts of them as they do not use themselves, earning sufficient rentals to cover the interest on &#39;the whole cost of the buildings, including the portion which they themselves occupy. A Government could not do anything like that. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator may wish the Government to start a system of common lodging houses, but I am not anticipating that the Commonwealth Government will undertake anything of the sort. I am not wholly without sympathy for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline> proposition. In New&#39; South Wales, I have two or three times protested against the Government paying sea insurance upon goods - railway plant, for instance - which they were, importing. I have held that it was quite competent for the Government to run the risk themselves, and not pay premiums to any company. </para>

            <para>- It is folly for any State to pay such premiums, because if a company can afford to run the risk the State can do so. If the time comes when it seems opportune to go into the whole of this matter, I can assure the honorable senator that I shall be prepared to consider his proposals very carefully. I do not view any proposal for the State to run an insurance business of this character in any very adverse spirit. But at the present time I suggest to the honorable senator that it would be advantageous to the service, and to public business, and in the interest of the Senate generally, for him to withdraw his amendment. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> seems to think that the functions of the State should only he extended to those operations that cannot be performed by private firms. I know no reason under heaven why the Government should not go in for profitable as well as unprofitable undertakings. I do not know why the Government should not build offices and let them, just as they do a number of other things. There is no reason why a Government should not be a landlord, and own houses as well as post-offices and railways. &#39; If assurance companies can profitably utilize the money they receive, surely the Government of the Commonwealth could do so just as well. Therefore, so far as concerns the renting of offices and the making of profit in that direction, there is no obstacle to get over. The matter is plain sailing. As regards the Bill before us, we have to consider that there are clauses in it which insist upon civil servants assuring their lives. If we insist upon that, it is quite proper that we should provide the means of assurance, and should give the best possible guarantee of safety. I do not think there is any honorable senator who &#34;will challenge the statement that the State can give better security than any private company. There is no security equal to a Government security. That being so, when we insist upon our civil servants being assured, I hold that it is our duty to provide them with the means of assuring. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> has shown how the Federal Government could manage a business of this kind better and more economically than private firms can. Therefore I shall not traverse that aspect of the question. I agree with all he has said. He has made out a very good case. But some challenge has been thrown out as to the constitutional aspect of the question. It has been doubted whether we have power under the Constitution to pass legislation for assurance purposes. I hold that the Constitution is very clear on the point. Section 51, sub-section (14), reads as follows : - </para>

If we insert those clauses we ought to legislate in this direction.

Consequently, in fairness to those senators who are in favour of Government assurance, I hold that we should either knock out the clauses to which I have referred&#39; or legislate in the direction proposed by this amendment. </para>

        <para>SenatorWALKER. - No; it is superannuation. I see the words life assurance here, but they do not mean a State life assurance scheme. No doubt there is some force in the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> that if we give our imprimatur to certain assurance companies it may be looked upon as a moral obligation for us to see that they are solvent. As against that I take it that the probationers, with the advice of their friends, will be able to choose what office they like, and if it is an approved office, what further responsibility will rest on the Government ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> made some remarks which struck me as somewhat unfair. He takes the whole of the assurance companies assets and the total interest, and draws a conclusion as to what the average rate is. That is true up to a certain point, but surely the leading companies are not to be placed on the same basis as newly started and comparatively small concerns? I am not here to advocate the advantages of one company over those of another, but any competent actuary or accountant can form a very fair idea as to which offices are on a comparatively sound basis as compared with others. I hope that we shall not lose unnecessary time over this matter, but shall pass the Billas quickly and expeditiously as possible, consistently with justice to all concerned. I am a believer in private enterprise, and therefore I am not very anxious to see established a Government life assurance scheme for the whole community. In New Zealand, it is true, the Government life assurance scheme enters into competition with assurance companies ; but statistics could be brought forward to show that, at all events in the case of one large life assurance association, its working expenses are less than those of the Government. It is a mistake to suppose that of necessity a Governmeet life assurance scheme could be carried on more economically than the business of a private company. Then again, should it hereafter be determined to start a civil service superannuation scheme - and many civil servants have assured their lives in companies - I should recommend the Government to be very careful, in the first place, to see, in whatever company they do assure, that there is a very respectable surrender value for the policies taken out, so that, if they find it necessary to go on to the civil service superannuation scheme they may, if they so elect, be able to get a substantial surrender value for their policies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> spoke of adopting various tables and so forth of existing companies. It did not seem to him, as it appears to me, that that is very like stealing the brains of other institutions without saying &#34; Thank you &#34; for them. When it comes to starting a Government life assurance scheme in competition with them, I may, perhaps, if desired, be able to say something which may assist to put it on perfectly sound business lines. I shall have much pleasure in opposing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline> amendment, and supporting the clause as it stands, with the exception of the few words which I have suggested should be deleted. </para>

          <para>- I rise to make a few remarks about some of the interesting, instructive, and romantic assertions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith.</inline> It is well known that I have given some strong indications in favour of Government intervention in these matters under certain conditions, so that I cannot be looked upon as a very hide-bound Tory. There are a few things in which I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> rather led himself astray. For instance, he told us that the payments made to the New Zealand Government life assurance scheme amounted to about  &#163;8,000,000.  I asked him whether he was quite sure of his figures. He reasserted them, and I have no doubt he was strictly honest in his intentions. There can be no doubt that he desired to convey that which he believed to be truth, but unfortunately the sum named does not represent the payments of Government officials. We are only discussing a Government system as applied to the men and women in its own service. Probably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> is not aware of the fact that the New Zealand Government scheme is one of a general character, and that the assurance of State officials is only a small part of its business. The general public assure with the Government, and therefore no real lesson can be learned from that scheme as  a guide to us in considering the present proposal. The citation of the &#163;8,000,000 paid to the New Zealand Government scheme shows nothing, because the members of the public service can not have paid a tithe of the money. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> also told us that a Government system of assurance would involve no exchange, and further, that he had been connected with banking, I do not know in what capacity. I do not wish any honorable senator to run away with the idea that a Government could carry on a business of this kind and not pay exchange on its remittances.- I undertake to say that, during each year, the Postmaster-General pays a very considerable sum to the banks of Australia, on the remittance of Government funds. Banks do not transmit funds for the Government out of charity. &#34;When a Government wants to remit it cannot make its remittances in cash, bank notes, or documents. It cannot run coaches with an armed escort everywhere, when it wants to remit &#163;5. These things are done by banking institutions, and the Government necessarily has to pay for the service. Until some entirely new system of public finance is evolved, we shall have to continue to pay exchange, and a Government will pay just as much exchange as will a public company. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> told us about the rate which life assurance companies, carrying on the business in the Commonwealth, obtain for their investments. I think he gave the rate at 4-47, which is practically 4-Jy per cent. The rate that the Government could obtain i from the moneys of its assurance fund could not be more than the interest represented by the value of their securities - unless they went in for mortgages, which would be an extraordinarily risky thing for them to do. If the Government interest rate were 3 per cent., a life assurance fund in their hands would not be able to earn more than that percentage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> tells us that the life assurance societies of Australia average 4^ per cent. That is an enormous difference in the working of institutions of this kind - so vast, that it would only be properly appreciated by men who have actuarial science at their fingers&#39; ends. I have not the remotest interest in any assurance company beyond the payment of a few small premiums a year. I am not fighting any one&#39;s battles, but merely giving utterance to a few facts which arewithin my knowledge as a business man of some lengthened experience. SenatorSmith also dealt with the question ofactuarial examinations, and told us that* the Government scheme would not involveany expense on that score, because therewere plenty of examples to be obtained from the working of public societies, &#39;. which caused actuarial investigations of their affairs to be made from time totime. I never heard, nor did any man ever hear, of a well conducted life assurance society taking the actuarial investigation of another society as a guide for its own operations. It is impossible. Theconditions of no two companies are soabsolutely alike that the actuarial experienceof one office would be a safe guide to another. A first-class life office, makingits actuarial investigations time after time,, as all first-class offices invariably do,, would not give up that practice inorder to copy the whirligig proce-dure  of .a &#34;wild cat&#34; assurance society. A &#34; wild cat &#34; society would not dream of&#39; following the strong, careful, sedate methods of a first-class association, so that the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> on this particular point is entirely erroneous. We should never be safe in our operations, no matter* what scale of premiums we charged, unless  we had an actuarial investigation. That&#39; would be positively, necessary in order to-&#39; maintain a proper element of security in our operations. . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> waxed veryeloquent about the erection by life offices of huge palaces which return no rents unless portions of them are leased to tenants. He-! must be aware that at the end of theyear there is no difference between losing a&#39; certain amount of interest on funds by notlending them out to people who pay interest  on them, and lending &#39; out funds to earn interest out of which rents equal to the loss-&#39; in the first case have to be paid. What is the &#34; difference between a society which loses-- &#163;5,000 a year by failing to let out its., funds on mortgage, and a society that lends out all its funds On mortgage and pays&#39; &#163;5,000 a year in rent for the premises which it occupies? </para>

            <para>- It seems almost childish for me to argue the matter/ but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> was so pronounced and so entirely authoritative on the point that I feel I may be forgiven if I venture to&#34; differ from so eminent an authority. Now comes the question of whether we are ripe for undertaking the large duties of life assurance and applying them only to a small section of -the people. I seriously doubt that we are. </para>

            <para>.- It is an old phrase that the thin end of the wedge once inserted leads to untold results, and we might found a scheme that would grow beneficently. On the other hand, it is equally well known that a small leak ex-  tends sometimes to wide dimensions, and causes great devastation. Whether this proposal, in its present form, is the beneficent wedge or the disastrous leak, I am not yet &#34;in a position to say, but I think we should be taking a good deal of risk if we adopted this proposal merely as leading to something more extensive later on. There is also the question of superannuation which has been suggested. That is a matter, I take it, which will have to be dealt with before long by the Federal Parliament. This opens up a new and important aspect of the question of superannuation and life assurance. The two are linked together very closely. The one sometimes merges into the other, but the one goes short of the other. It is, unfortunately, a fact that Government systems of superannuation, or of annuities, or provisions for old age - I care not how they are denominated - have not been successes. In England, the Post-office annuity scheme lias been one of the most deplorable failures - that the British Government have ever ac- &#39;complished. </para>

            <para>- I dare say. It&#39; is a very good Government that is always per-&#93; feet. I have no pretensions to perfection &#39; myself, and I know of no institution which is beyond the reach of calamity and blunder. Therefore, I rather favour being cautious in my procedure. The Post-office annuity scheme of Great Britain has been a singular blunder. The particulars were put before the Senate at my instance some time ago, in connexion with another debate, and, being on record, are readily available. I am in favour of certain amendments of the clause, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline> proposal is not carried, there is one amendment which I shall seek to insert. I desire words to be inserted - two will be sufficient - to show clearly that the officers who are required to assure will be officers &#34;hereafter appointed,&#34; otherwise the clause, if passed as it stands, will certainly be liable to be read as nullifying the provision in the preceding clause, which was voted upon a little while ago. </para>

            <para>- That is rather a vague way of stating it. Vague words, such as these, afford scope for legal proceedings. I do not want us to be rushing into the High Court - which we are going to establish some day - in order to obtain an interpretation of these words, when we can secure an interpretation beyond cavil by using simpler language. I am not pressing that matter now, but if I did, I suppose I should have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> against me. I have often found that I have been right even when Ministers have held opinions different to those which I have entertained. Purely by way of example, I may relate an incident in connexion with an important public work in New South Wales. I was a member of a committee which investigated that work, and I was in a minority on that committee. The matter came before Parliament in the form of legislation, and I was defeated again. But when the matter had become statute law, and the money for the carrying out of the works had actually been borrowed in London, the department that had devised the undertaking had to abandon it, and I was found to be right. A new scheme had to be evolved, and a new Act of Parliament passed. In view of that case, even when an honorable and learned gentleman holding office as a Minister of the Crown differs from me, I am not always convinced that I am in the wrong. I would rather have the simpler phraseology that I have indicated than the more verbose terms to which the PostmasterGeneral has referred. The words to which he has drawn attention may achieve the same end as the result of a decision of the High Court, but not otherwise. I intend to move the insertion of the two words I have indicated, if Semitor Smith&#39;s amendment is not carried. </para>

            <para>- I have heard something about life assurance, but I was not aware of the existence of a number of &#34;wild cat&#34; assurance companies. If there are such institutions, surely the honorable senator does not want young men in the Commonwealth service to assure their lives in them. I should like to see the Government go a good deal further than this amendment proposes, do their own fire insurance business, and insure all their own buildings throughout the Commonwealth. Some years ago I had occasion to look into a matter of this kind, and if I recollect rightly I discovered that the Railway department of &#34;Victoria was paying something like &#163;20,000 a year for the insurance of its buildings against fire. I believe I. am correct in saying further that the insurance offices absolutely declined in some cases to insure up-country railway stations where&#34; there was a bad water supply. They did not object to insure brick stations in the principal centres of population, where there was an adequate water supply to deal with an outbreak of fire, but they positively declined to insure a building in regard to which there was any risk. I suppose the very building in which we are assembled is insured. In my opinion the Government ought to conduct their own system of fire insurance, as well as assurethe lives of their own officers. </para>

            <para>- I interjected just now that the Commonwealth Government wasinsuring its own buildings. I believe that iscorrect. I do not think that any of the Post-&#39; and Telegraph department&#39;s buildings in anyState are insured ; but there is a very great difference between the Commonwealth adopting that course and accepting lifeassurance business. We are our own insurers so far as our public buildings areconcerned, simply because of the fact that we do not insure with any private company. But there is no paying of premiums ; thereis no staff to adjust losses and to pay them over out of .any particular fund. We donot insure with private companies ;  thereforein  a way it may be said that we are insuring our own buildings against fire. </para>

            <para>- Exactly, and that is a system very different from assuring thelives of officers. In the latter- case a heavy staff of clerks would be required to conduct the business, just as in the case of a privatecompany. If we had a system of Statelife  asurance  for the whole community, weshould have a large volume of business and might be able to carry it on economically.. But the same expense would be involved in. assuring the lives of a mere handful of civil: servants, and that could not be done as. economically by the State as by means of established, life assurance offices. </para>

            <para>- My contention is that we cannot conduct a system of State assurance with profit, unless we have a very large volume of business. If we set up to do that, we should have to make arrangements to take proposals not only from within the Commonwealth, but probably from any place in which we could obtain them. For that we must have a very carefully devised scheme which would require an Act of Parliament that might occupy some time in getting through. From our experience this afternoon, I should think that if the Government were bringing forward a Bill providing for a scheme of State life assurance by the Commonwealth, it would take a good many weeks to get it through both Houses of Parliament. Honorable senators will see that it is not possible in the present state of business to initiate such a scheme at present, and the Government ask that in the meantime the existing system of life assurance may be available to enable probationers to assure their lives. </para>

          <para>- I regret very much that the Postmaster-General has seen fit in opposing this motion to point out that one of the chief difficulties in carrying it into effect will be in passing the necessary Act to regulate the system of assurance that would prevail throughout the Commonwealth public service. As I read the proposed amendment, it is intended to apply not necessarily to those at present in the service, but to those who may come in hereafter. We have been told many times during the discussion on this Bill that there are something like 11,000 civil servants at present in the Commonwealth service. If the Commonwealth Government exercises some of the powers vested in it under the Constitution, the number will be very considerably augmented in the course of a few years. </para>

            <para>- We cannot take the 11,000 as a start, because the proposal applies only to those  coming  into the service hereafter. But if the Commonwealth Government exercises its powers to take over the control of other departments, the 11,000 will be considerably augmented in the course of a very few years, and ere long 50 per cent, of the total will be replaced by others who will enter the service. So that -before many years have elapsed we shall have, in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie, &#34; a very good start.&#34; It seems to me that the verydifficulties referred to by the PostmasterGeneral as attendant upon&#62; the- establishment of a system of State assurance must, be intensified and multiplied as the years go on, and if we ever contemplate the establishment of a system of State assurance; and I hope every honorable senator does, now is the proper time to initiate the system. We have the instance of New Zealand, which, has gone to the length of not merely assuring the lives of those in the public service;, but of outside individuals- who are prepared to do business with the State office. We may find more than one- instance in the States of governing organizations, such <inline font-style="italic">asmunicipalities,</inline> which have established pro- vident systems. I do not say that they&#34; are absolutely on all-fours with an* assurance system, but to  a great extent, and within its own limits, the&#39; provident system is a parallel system to the system of State assurance suggested here. I believe in a system of State assurance, and that we should have it permeating the.whole of the civil service of the Commonwealth. I should like to see it extended to. the assurance of the lives of persons outsidethe public service who may prefer thesecurity of the Commonwealth to thesecurity which can be offered by anyprivateinstitution carrying on business, of this, character. I am prepared, to. support theprinciple of State life-assurance, and for the* reasons I have stated I think that now, when we should hav-e to meet the fewest difficulties, is the-time-to initiate the system,, so far as our public: service is concerned, by including in this Bill the clauses proposed as an amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith..</inline> It may be suggested that the Governmentwill have enough to do* Of course theGovernment will have enough to do, butthat is always the cry put forward when it is suggested that a Government should takeover any work of a public character that concerns the community as a whole. That has been the class of opposition which every movement of this character has had to encounter. I sincerely hope that now, when such an opportunity is presented to us at the initiation of our Commonwealth regime, we shall not fail to take advantage of it, and I think the clauses proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> moderate as they are, and applying only to those officers who. may enter the service hereafter, should receive the approval of the committee:. </para>

          <para>- I wish to say a word or two in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> whose speech, I very much regret to say, was received with considerable hilarity before tea. I do not know what has become of the gay and festive senators who saw so much to amuse them in that speech. They are not present now. I suppose it is because they have seen the error of their ways, because the speech was one which will be read with a great deal of interest and instruction by many people. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> was on the right track. It does not require <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> great deal of argument to show that the Federal Government ought to be the most successful assurance company in the world, because the whole people will be at their back if they take this matter up. Any one who wishes to assure his life will know right away, without the assistance of pamphlets or highly- coloured advertisements, that if he assures in the Government institution the money will be paid to those who come after him. We know that there must be enormous sums of  money  spent by assurance societies in the insertion of huge advertisements in the daily press, and in the publication of large quantities of printed matter, and we know also that a very great deal is spent in the way of commission to assurance canvassers. In the case of a State life assurance, this expenditure could all be saved, because any man who wished to assure his life in the Government institution would know that it was thoroughly reliable, and was never likely to become bankrupt unless the whole nation became bankrupt. I hope honorable senators will not be led to oppose the amendment because there may be only a few persons to be assured at the commencement, as only those who enter the service hereafter will be called upon to assure. The thing is bound to grow. It must be remembered also that this proposal was lost by only one vote in another place. If the Federal Parliament affirms the principle there is no doubt we shall have very little difficulty in establishing a system of State life assurance on the same lines as have been adopted by that very progressive country, New Zealand. </para>

          <para>-Before taking a vote upon the amendment I should like to refer to something which occurred to me when other honorable senators were speaking upon this question. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline>referred to an aspect of the case which was overlooked by most of the other honorable senators who have spoken. I think the position as put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> should receive most serious consideration. The honorable senator says he would advise all civil servants who were going to assure their lives to effect the assurance with companies of a reliable character who paid the highest surrender value for the policy. What did that mean <inline font-style="italic">t</inline> It means that if we do not to-day do something of the kind indicated in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline> amendment we shall be maintaining for years to come just the same position that we are in now. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has said, it is only intended to assure those who are coming into the service now, because we cannot interfere with those who are already assured with other companies. That is the great difficulty that exists. If we were taking over the 11,000 public servants of the Commonwealth, and they were not assured in any office, we should have the most splendid start that any assurance company ever had in this world. Seeing that we cannot do that, are we to maintain that difficulty by compelling every young man or young woman who enters the federal public service to assure in some other public company, so that in ten, twenty, or 100 years, when we do come to our senses and arrive at the conclusion that it is time we were doing something in this direction for ourselves, we shall have to face the same or a greater difficulty, because we shall not be able to take those public servants in then. The proper thing to do is to commence now, and have every public servant brought into the Commonwealth service at once assured on a proper basis according to the position he occupies in an institution provided by the Federal Government. Thesystem will, in the course of a very few years, grow from a public service assurance institution to a very respectable institution on its own account, and it will be one of the best foundations we could have for a Commonwealth State assurance business. I have heard honorable senators express themselves favorably, so far as State assurance is concerned. Senators Walker and Neild have said that they are in favour of it. But those honorable senators are invariably in the. position of men I have known in the State Parliament who were always in favour of something until it was on the point of accomplishment, and who then voted against it because the time was not opportune. Enough has been said to show that in establishing this system the Commonwealth will run no risk, the public servants will get greater security, and there will be far less of the &#34;leakage,&#34; whatever that may mean, referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild,</inline> in a State assurance business than in any private assurance company existing in Australia. I hope the amendment will receive favorable consideration, and that honorable senators will put the Commonwealth Government in a position to create an institution creditable to itself and beneficial to its public servants. </para>

Although the Chairman&#39;s opinion happened to be in favour of the view of the Government on this question, the point of order is so very important as affecting the practice of the Senate that it should be properly settled in accordance with the Constitution. The practice the Chair has followed hitherto in a case of this kind, where the question before the committee is whether certain wordsshall or shall not stand, and the votes are equal, has been to rule that the words do not stand. That is to say, the question is resolved in the negative. That is the practice that has been followed on a good many occasions, and it is a practice which really has the proper construction of the Constitution behind it. The Constitution says that when the votes are equal, the question shall pass in the negative. What is the negative of the question, &#34; That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the clause? &#34; It is that the words do not stand part of the clause. I therefore submit, before you give a final ruling, that that view is in accordance with the practice of the Senate, and in conformity with the Constitution. </para>

            <para>- I quite agree with the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the true reading of the situation is that the words upon which the vote is taken do not stand part of the clause, because the question was resolved in the negative. Therefore, although your ruling is against myself, as I had a subsequent amendment, I think that the ruling ought to be in that direction. The result of the last vote was to create a blank. </para>

            <para>- The amendment which has just been carried was an amendment to strike out the words from &#34; every&#34; down to the word &#34; some &#34; inclusive. That leaves the clause from the word &#34;approved&#34; down to the end of the clause remaining.

          <para>- The majority in the last division ought to be satisfied that they have affirmed the principle of the desirability of civil servants being assured with the Government. I am not prepared to say that that is not a good principle in itself. The position I have taken up is that we are not at the present time prepared to introduce a scheme of life assurance. Therefore, unless some further amendment is made in the clause, it will mean that, until a system of Government life assurance is established, there will be no means by which officers coming into the service can be assured at all. </para>

            <para>- No, because the transferred officers are in a very great number of cases assured, and in other cases have pensions and retiring allowances. It is most desirable that young men coming fresh into the service should be provided with means to assure their lives, and that is the object of the clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker,</inline> without disturbing that provision, is proposing that until a scheme is established the officers shall assure with private companies. There is a great deal of difference of opinion as to whether a superannuation scheme or a life assurance scheme is the better. But seeing that we have been contemplating life assurance before ; seeing that the majority have, by an amendment, affirmed that the provision to be made shall be that of life assurance, and not superannuation, it seems to me that a better amendment would be that, until a Commonwealth system of life assurance is established, the civil servants should assure with some assurance offices at present established. </para>

            <para>- An amendment has been carried providing that these officers shall effect with the Government of the Commonwealth an assurance on their lives. How is the clause going to work in its amended form if it becomes law? A probationer may be appointed, and the clause, as amended, provides that on the confirmation of his appointment, he must effect an assurance of his life with the Commonwealth. We have no machinery, however, to enable him to effect that assurance, and cannot provide it without passing a Bill through Parliament. </para>

          <para>- I think this would be a mistake at the present juncture. Undoubtedly the committee have decided in favour of State life assurance. I have always favoured that principle, although I am not quite sure that fire insurance should be taken up by the Government. We have had evidence from New Zealand that life assurance may. be safely undertaken by the State, especially in view of the fact that the Commonwealth now employs many thousands of officers. Originally I thought that to introduce the system proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith,</inline> in a Bill of this kind, would be to anticipate the whole movement, and therefore I did not at first vote for it ; but when I saw that a blank was created in the clause, I was anxious to come in and establish the principle that I had always upheld. We are now confronted with the question of whether we should insist upon youths who enter the Commonwealth service assuring their lives with private companies. In my opinion it would not be advisable to insist upon that. Most of those entering the service will be young people, and if we insist upon them assuring their lives with private companies we shall not be able to induce them to assure with the Government should it be decided next session to create a department to give effect to the express wishes of the committee. I think that it would be well not to enforce the provisions of this clause in dealing with those who are entering the service until the Government are prepared to introduce a measure that will give effect to the wish of the committee. I feel confident that the Government will introduce such a measure when they see their way clear to do so, and that, I believe, will not be long hence. They have quite enough to do at present, and I do not anticipate that they will undertake the organization of a Government life assurance department during the present session. But we shall get rid of very many important matters before the session closes, so that next session the Government will be enabled to give attention to this question, and to establish a department which will be satisfactory and profitable to the State, as well as to the persons whose lives are assured. I am sure that the Government as a Government are not opposed to the principle of State life assurance. We have had the assurance on many occasions that they are not. I believe that a proposal similar to this was lost in the House of Representatives by one vote only, and I see no reason why we should compel young men entering the service to assure their lives with a private company until the Government are prepared with their own scheme. </para>

So far as the affirmation of the principle of State life assurance is concerned, my honorable friends opposite have carried their amendment, and it is now provided that Commonwealth officers shall assure with the Government. I suppose it will be recognised, for the reasons that have been pointed out by the Postmaster-General, that the probabilities are that some time must elapse before a system of Government life assurance can be established. We have a big enough handful to attend to already in meeting the financial requirements. It is impossible to foretell exactly at the present time what revenue will come in under the new system of uniform duties, with the complications that may be produced by the effect of local production ; and until we know what our revenue is to be, it will be impossible to enter upon undertakings of this kind, which will involve a large financial scheme. </para>

            <para>- They are not affected by this measure in any way. It is not to be said, however, that because of that fact we are to fail to take any steps for the protection of officers who are coming into the service now. I am willing to go as far as any one in the affirmation of a principle, but it will be really carrying the mere affirmation of a principle over the work of practical politics to neglect the duty, of compelling these officers  to assure their lives with the means at hand, until we are able to establish a system of Government life assurance.

Therefore I ask all those honorable senators who, while willing to affirm the principle of State life assurance, are unwilling to neglect the interest of those who become members of the Commonwealth civil service until that system can be established, to vote for the amendment which will affirm the principle for which my friends are contending, and at the same time preserve the situation for the benefit of those who come into the service from time to time. </para>

            <para>- I am as economically minded as any person, and I would be the last to give my adhesion to any scheme which would make a demand upon the Commonwealth Treasury. The PostmasterGeneral seems to think that the scheme proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> would be something like the scheme now in operation in Queensland, where the Treasury has each year to contribute a very large sum to keep a superannuation fund solvent. If the contributions of the civil servants were not certified by proper authorities to be sufficient to give a certain return I should not support any such scheme. I say again it was lamentable to hear the confession&#39;s of the Vice-President of the Executive Council and of the Postmaster-General that they could not do it ; that it was absolutely impossible to establish a Commonwealth assurance fund. They have established such&#39; a fund in New Zealand, and why cannot honorable senators turn their eyes in that direction, to find out how these things are done in the island colony over the water. I do not profess to have the close acquaintance with these matters that members of the Government have, but I see no difficulty in the way. Perhaps it may be another case of fools rushing in where angels fear to tread, but in this case I would rather be the fool than the angel. If we are going to make any progress we must dare something. We must make a beginning, but if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> amendment is carried, it will be merely staving off the question. In the meantime young men who enter the Commonwealth service will be assuring with private companies, and the establishment of a Commonwealth assurance fund will only be made more and more difficult. The longer we delay this matter, the more difficulties and obstacles will be thrown in our path. If the Government are opposed to this scheme, why not say so outright? Why try to defeat the proposal by a flank movement ? Let the Government be honest and say straight out, that they do not believe in this sort of thing, and then we shall know exactly where we are. I hope honorable senators will not vote for the amendment, but that having said in the Bill that we shall establish a Commonwealth assurance fund, we shall carry that out in the near future, as we can if we care to do so. </para>

          <para>- I have taken no part, so far, in this controversy, but I have given a vote on two or three occasions affirming the principle of State assurance, and I think it is not at all impracticable for the Commonwealth Government to establish a life assurance fund. I mean to vote against the amendment, and I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> will agree that this is a matter upon which there is room for differences of opinion, and that though some of us may not see our way to vote for his amendment, we may oppose it in no -captious spirit. I do not view the matter in the same light as the members of the Government. According to them, it will involve the expenditure of a large sum of money, and the Commonwealth finances will not stand it. We are told that we do not know exactly how our finances may stand. That is true, but let us deal with the question practically. We are making provision for the entrance into the Commonwealth public service of a number of young men and women, and we are rightly insisting that they shall assure their lives in some way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> says that they can go to some private assurance company, and that our finances are such that we cannot make the necessary provision. How many young probationers are likely to be admitted to the service in the various States of the  Commonwealth during the next year?  Is it not lamentable to hear responsible Ministers of the Crown speaking in this way when the Commonwealth revenue to be raised, according to the best authorities, will be about &#163;9,000,000 % </para>

            <para>- Grant that. But supposing we have 150 or 160 persons entering the service as probationers in the year, does the honorable and learned senator imagine that all those young people are going to die in the course of a year <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If the Commonwealth Government allot only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;l</inline> ,000 to form the nucleus of an assurance fund, do honorable senators think that the whole of that &#163;1,000 is going to be swallowed up by the deaths of probationers who may enter the service during the year ? The statements with regard to the sum of money involved in this matter are absolutely unworthy of responsible Ministers. I think we have come to a deplorable pass if we cannot furnish a few paltry pounds to be set aside to meet an emergency that may arise in the case of some of these young officers dying at an early period. The contributions of these persons will be coming in constantly, and should be more than sufficient to meet the interest on the few pounds set aside for the purpose. I must honestly say that a more flimsy, hollow, frivolous, and useless argument could scarcely be advanced with a view to setting on one side a matter of such moment, than has been advanced with reference to this question. </para>

            <para>- I suppose the honorable senator desires that the assurance fund, when started, shall be established on absolutely sound lines. There may be one or two honorable senators in this chamber who would undertake before they went to bed to-night to prepare a scheme which they would think sufficient. But it might not prove to be perfect. I hope that when the Government bring forward a scheme, the actuarial work in connexion with it will be perfectly done, and of such a character as will stand the test of experience. But that means a little time. It cannot be done to-day or tomorrow. Every one knows that the Government have undertaken too much work already, and it will be desirable to allow them a little time in which to prepare a scheme such as this. Pending the completion of such a scheme, arrangements ought to be made whereby the assurance which it is expected that the servants of the Crown will undertake shall be undertaken. I gather that that is all which is sought to be brought about by what is proposed by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. </para>

          <para>- I hope the committee will not accept the amendment moved by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I regret very much that he has referred to what I shall call the bogy of expenditure, which it appears to me has been introduced for the express purpose of frightening honorable senators from carrying out the principle they have affirmed in the vote given earlier in the evening. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Glassey</inline> has pointed out, the object of the amendment is simply to provide that the lives of those who will enter the service hereafter shall be assured. In these matters I fancy that the Government would act as ordinary private companies act in such matters, and would find out what was the value from an insurance point of view of each life assured. It is unreasonable to assume, as the VicePresident of the Executive Council appears to assume, that during the early years of the system there would be amongst those assured by the State a larger proportion of deaths than there would be in an ordinary life assurance society. Here is the position of the State : - The State has a certain number of individuals who must assure with it, but a private company that might start operations at the same time as the State would not have that advantage, and would have to find its clients from amongst the general public, in competition with other companies. The State would have an absolute monopoly of life assurance amongst a certain class of individuals. One would think, to hear some of the arguments that have been used, that it would be necessary for the State in carrying out the principle of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline> proposal to follow on exactly the same lines as private companies have followed, and to erect great buildings such as some companies have erected. But we do not need to erect for the purposes of State life assurance a building such as the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States have put up in Melbourne, or such as the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York have erected in Sydney. What additional expense of a large character will the State be put to in order to carry out this principle ? 1  It is all very well for the PostmasterGeneral and the Vice-President of the Executive Council to talk in  vague  general terms about the enormous  expenditure  to which the State would be put in carrying this principle into practice, but I hope that honorable senators will not be frightened by such remarks as that. Speaking generally, what is the new expenditure to which the State would be put in carrying into practice this principle? Shall we have to erect new buildings, advertise extensively, or have a large staff of officers and an army of canvassers to look after nothing but the insurance business of a comparatively few individuals, or will the clerical work be of such a character as to involve a considerableexpenditure ? </para>

            <para>- The VicePresident of the Executive Council knows very well that in New Zealand the Government does not confine its operations to the lives of civil servants, but assures private individuals whether living- in New Zealand or out of that country. One may meet people even in this city who have never at anytime had any connexion with the civil service of New Zealand, but whose lives are assured with the Government of that country. Life assurance is one of the matters which the Government can very well take up. </para>

            <para>- So far as this particular proposal is concerned, it is restricted to civil servants. We cannot go beyond that by means of this measureThe expense involved in carrying it out cannot possibly be of the magnitude suggested. If the Commonwealth Government intends to ever take up the work of assuring lives as a general matter outside its own public service, it could not make a better commencement than at this juncture, because it will have a monopoly so far as certain individuals are concerned. That is to say, it will have a monopoly in respect of the livesof those individuals who enter the public service in the future. I will not say that the Vice-President of the .Executive Council has moved his amendment designedly to nullify the effect that would be produced by the passing of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s,</inline> proposal, but certainly if the amendment be&#39; carried the Commonwealth Governmentwill be able to say - &#34; We will not establish anything in the nature of a system of life assurance with regard to our civil servants, at any rate during the next five or ten years, if we can possibly avoid it.&#34; This will mean that those who enter the service during those years will be unable to assure with the Government, but will be compelled to assure with private companies, so that when we do commence this business by the State, if we ever commence it - and I takeit from expressions of opinion that have fallen from honorable senators to-night that there is a strong feeling in the Senate.- that the Commonwealth should establish sucha system - the difficulties we are now encountering will be still greater, because in the course of years the newcomers into the service will be comparatively small, and all those already in it will have assured their lives with private concerns. The effect of the amendment will be to nullify what the committee has already done, and I trust that it will be negatived. </para>

        <para>SenatorO&#39;KEEFE (Tasmania). - A radical objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> amendment is that it will be unfair to those who are to enter into the public service, for the reason that they will be compelled, when the Commonwealth establishes an assurance fund, to assure in it, whilst in the meantime many of them will have assured with private companies. Consequently their money will have been thrown away. </para>

          <para>- But an injustice will be done to the civil servants who wish to enjoy the additional advantages of assurance in the Commonwealth fund, and who in the meantime will, have paid into private companies. The question of expense is a bogy. Where is the expense going to be caused ? What is to constitute it ? If there is any force in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> argument we must believe that a large proportion of the civil servants who would be assured are going to die right off. I hope that the amendment will not be carried. </para>
