            <para>- I quoted last week in the Senate some remarks made by the Minister for Trade and Resources in regard to the Government&#39;s decision to call for interested parties to indicate whether they would be prepared to purchase the Government&#39;s interest in the Ranger project. At the same time, the Minister made it clear that the Government had not made any firm decision whether to sell its interest, and certainly not in regard to any particular person. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> now asks whether approaches have been made to overseas corporations, whether a value has been attached to the interest, how it has been arrived at and so on. I will refer those specific questions to the Minister for Trade and Resources and seek an early answer from him. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, concerns the references made in the Senate during Question Time yesterday to the present Government&#39;s achievements in the areas of keeping down inflation, keeping down interest rates and, despite world oil costs, keeping down fuel prices in Australia. How does Australia&#39;s inflation rate compare with the inflation rates in  other countries? How do Australia&#39;s interest rates compare with interest rates overseas? How do Australia&#39;s petrol prices compare with petrol prices overseas? </para>

              <para>- The fact is that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development believes it even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> does not want to believe the OECD. The OECD figures for the six months to June 1979 give an average inflation rate for all the member countries of 11.8 per cent. In the United States of America, the inflation rate was 14 per cent, for France it was 1 1.3 per cent, for the United Kingdom it was 15.7 per cent, for Canada it was 10.5 per cent, for Italy it was 1 5.8 per cent, for New Zealand it was 14.3 per cent and for Australia it was 9 per cent. Australia&#39;s efforts were exceeded only by two countries, namely, Germany and Japan. </para>

          <para>Internationally, at the end of July interest rates in various countries were as follows: The United States 10 per cent, Japan 5.25 per cent, Germany 5 per cent, the United Kingdom 14 per cent, Canada 1 1.75 per cent and Australia 9 per cent. Again, with the exceptions of Japan and Germany, Australia has the best performance of the Western countries. The third part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Teague</inline> &#39;s question dealt with fuel rates. It would be fair to say that most Australians pay for motor spirit about half the price which prevails in European countries and Japan. For example, in Australian cents per litre, the price in Japan is 48.9, in the United Kingdom it is 46.9, in West Germany it is 41.7, in France it is 49.8 and in Italy it is 5 1.6. It can be seen that we pay about half that. The price would be very much lower still if the Whitlam-Hayden government had done its job in the past. </para>

Of course, there was a flow of students to Australia attracted by that fact. It is natural, therefore, that there should be some kind of charge. The details have not been fully or precisely defined.

            <para>-My understanding is that the 1978-79 Housing Agreement removes the restrictions of the earlier agreements that only 30 per cent of the dwellings built as a result of Commonwealth finances may be sold. A State, therefore, may sell as many dwellings as it wishes to its tenants provided that such sales are at market price and that the cash proceeds of the sale are reinvested in housing. That is something with which this side of politics agrees. At present we need to bear in mind that 1978-79 was the first financial year of a new housing agreement. Some States have been slower to give effect to the new arrangements and, as well, are adopting different policies. Statistics are received by the Department of Housing and Construction on a sixmonthly interval basis, as I understand it, and at present are available only for the first six months to 31 December 1978. Sales of dwellings financed under Commonwealth-State arrangements during that period totalled 1,138. 1 take it this is the information that the honourable senator seeks. Let me give the performances of the various States. New South Wales sold 160 houses, my State of Victoria 695 houses, Queensland 173 houses, South Australia 68 houses and Western Australia 32 houses. The honourable senator who asked the question, who comes from Tasmania may be unhappy to learn that only 10 houses have been sold in Tasmania. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In 1978-79 it is estimated that as a result of sales and rental policies under the Agreement $97m is available for further housing assistance. As well, revolving funds from the operations of the house purchase scheme add about $64m to that figure. These funds, together with the wide ranging provisions of the 1978-79 Agreement, make it possible for States to undertake innovative steps to make the available funds go further by tapping the private finance market and by providing forms of assistance different from those of the past. For instance, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia have been very successful in introducing interest subsidy schemes to assist young people seeking housing finance. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator from the Northern Territory raises a particularly important question which undoubtedly has some reference to earlier questions asked on this matter. In the arrangements establishing the Ranger Joint Venturers and in the associated agreement with the Northern Land Council, there are cast iron guarantees that the elaborate arrangements for the protection of the environment will remain in force in the event of any partner disposing of its interest in the venture. Any new partner must agree with the existing partners to assume, to perform and to observe all the terms, conditions, liabilities and obligations binding upon the original partners. In addition, the Minister for Trade and Resources must consent to the transfer of any interest. It should be noted also that any such sale would have no effect whatever on the obligations the Commonwealth has entered into in its agreement with the Northern Land Council under section 44 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. Under this agreement the Commonwealth has undertaken to make provision that the Joint Venturers shall observe all environmental requirements specified in the conditions of the authority to mine or otherwise imposed by the law. The Commonwealth has also undertaken to ensure that all rehabilitation work in the Ranger Project area is undertaken by the Joint Venturers in accordance with the conditions of the authority to mine. If for any reason the Joint Venturers fail to carry out the whole or part of the rehabilitation work, the Commonwealth will carry out any part of the work not carried out by the Joint Venturers. </para>

            <para>-Can the Leader of the Government in the Senate give the Senate the reasons for the great anomalies in the Government&#39;s new taxation schemes? I give as examples the differences in effective tax increases between a taxpayer with dependants and a single taxpayer. The wage earner with dependants and earning $6,000 a year will pay an increase of 134.63 per cent in taxation, while a single taxpayer earning the same amount will pay 13.8 per cent more. A taxpayer with dependants and earning $8,000 a year will pay an increase of 17.71 per cent, compared with a single taxpayer&#39;s increase of 6.4 per cent. A taxpayer with dependants and earning $12,000 a year will pay 5.7 per cent more, while his single counterpart will pay 2.6 per cent more. I ask the Minister: Are these great differences a mistake on the part of the Government, or are they a deliberate attempt to destroy the family structure in our society? </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, relates to a call from the Victorian Employers Federation for a budget every three years instead of annually. Has the Government ever considered this matter, which would avoid the great August uncertainty and the subjection of the Australian people to speculation by the Press? If the Government has considered the matter, what have been its findings? If the Government has not considered the matter, will it look at it? </para>

            <para>- The system of annual Budgets is historically based on the idea that at one point in time the Government&#39;s outlays or expenditure for a particular year should be made public. However, adhering to a Budget effective for either one or three years may not be the most suitable means of conducting economic policy. To the extent that the Budget is also an economic policy tool, there may be merit from time to time in bringing forward particular measures which have normally been announced in a budgetary context. For example, on 24 May the Government announced a series of fiscal policy decisions which were important for the conduct of economic policy during the course of 1979-80 and had to be announced before August. This means that Budget-type announcements may be made more frequently than annually, rather than less frequently, to ensure the effectiveness of economic policy. At the same time, there is an ongoing process of monitoring forward expenditure proposals and, to the extent that it is possible, the Department of Finance maintains details of forward estimates on a rolling three year basis. </para>

If refers to a claim that was made in another place yesterday by the honourable member for Murray, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lloyd,</inline> that 30 per cent of the public servants who retired last year on medical grounds did so on spurious grounds and with fake medical certificates. The honourable member also called on the Government to take action on what he described as a racket. I ask: Will the Minister assure the House that, if the Government unwisely decides to take the action recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lloyd,</inline> it will not use the methods that it used last year in another case in New South Wales, that is, call in the Commonwealth Police, arrest people, stop payments and ask questions afterwards? </para>

I think it showed that recently more had been retired on grounds of invalidity than on grounds of age. As far as the remainder of the question is concerned, I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance. Some of the remarks that the honourable senator made were gratuitous because what was said did not occur. </para>

Is it not a fact that he did not go to gaol for this offence but was instead fined a mere $5,200? Does the Minister regard this fine as equitable when one considers the large incomes that are earned by medical practitioners and also the fact that another medical practitioner who defrauded Medibank of only $236 was gaoled for three years? Will the Minister consider a tightening of the laws concerning the defrauding of Medibank by medical practitioners, including the bringing of fines into a realistic relationship with their incomes?

Is it also a fact that many other businesses in Australia related to the tyre industry will be seriously affected by the closure, with a resultant further loss of jobs? As this company is a foreign-owned and controlled company operating in Australia, will the Government investigate as a matter of principle, or consider referring to the Industries Assistance Commission for investigation and report, the general question of foreign-owned enterprises closing down their operations in Australia and then using their off-shore operations to export their products to this country, thus further affecting job opportunities for Australian workers? Is it not time that the Government had a serious look at this general question? </para>

            <para>-The matter of whether research is being carried out in relation to lead emissions from motor vehicles does not come directly within my portfolio. I have been informed by my colleague, the Minister for Health, that the relationship between levels of lead additives in petrol, and lead in the atmosphere and in human tissues is continuing to receive the active consideration of the National Health and Medical Research Council. It is a matter of very great complexity. My understanding is that the NH and MRC review of the most recent research findings is not expected to be available until late in this calendar year. At that time, I anticipate that the Minister for Health will be in a position to indicate desirable goals and appropriate guidelines designed to ensure the maintenance of health standards. The Government currently has under consideration the value of lead catchment devices fitted to the exhaust systems of motor vehicles as a means of trapping lead so inhibiting its emission into the air. It is not possible to comment at this stage on the economic viability of this approach to preserving the value of lead additives as a means of assisting the most efficient use of liquid fuels. If there is information that I can bring to the honourable senator&#39;s attention, I will do so. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources. I refer to the Australian Government&#39;s decision to sell its share of the Ranger uranium project and the discussions which the Government has had with a number of companies concerning the sale. Without wishing to ask him to reveal any confidential information as to the price, et cetera, I ask: Under what terms and conditions is the Government offering its share of the uranium project to these companies? Specifically, is it proposed that the Government will receive a lump sum in full payment for its share of the project? </para>

            <para>- Let me preface my answer by repeating what I said in answer to an earlier question today. The Government has not yet made a final decision on whether it is going to sell its share of uranium. It has invited tenders, so to speak, from people interested in the project to indicate on what terms and conditions and at what price and so on they would be prepared to buy. Let me make it quite clear that the Government has not made a final decision one way or another. In the light of those circumstances, I believe that the rest of the question is premature. As I have said, offers of terms and conditions are being made to the Government by various bodies. Those offers are both serious and, if I am to believe what I heard on a radio program the other night, frivolous in some quarters. I feel that it is not possible for the Government to answer the question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> has asked in the detail in which she has sought at this point of time. </para>

That is the question that I asked the Minister. I am sure that he should be able to answer it. </para>

            <para>- I refer the Minister for Science and the Environment to my question to him on Tuesday, 2 1 August 1979, relating to the position of Lord Howe Island, and to his reply the following day which merely repeated known facts as to the administration of the island, which was the reason for the complaint. I was denied the opportunity to ask a supplementary question in regard to the reply. I now repeat my question and request a positive response. I draw the Minister&#39;s attention to claims by the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales that one of the world&#39;s unique beauty spots, Lord Howe Island, is in danger of ruination by wellintentioned incompetents. Is the Minister aware of the claims reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 3 August 1 979 that, unless the Island is proclaimed a national park, several species of birds on the island may become extinct? Is he also aware of the possibility that one day the island will feature on the World Heritage list, earmarked for preservation at all costs? To what extent does the Commonwealth Government regard this matter as part of its responsibility or the responsibility of its instrumentalities? Does the Minister agree that immediate action must be taken to prevent any further destruction of the island&#39;s habitat? If so, will he assure the Senate that strong pressure will be brought upon the New South Wales Government to have the island declared a national park, managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service? </para>

          <para class="block">Howe Island has been suggested for possible inclusion on the World Heritage list. As the honourable senator would know, nomination of the island requires consideration by the Heritage Commission.

The Commonwealth shares the concern of the New South Wales Government to protect endangered species and the island &#39;s habitats. </para>
          <para>The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has provided financial assistance for studies of the Lord Howe Island woodhen, one of the endangered species about which concern has been expressed.

            <para>-Senator Bonner rightly draws attention to the anguish of all decentthinking people in the world as a result of acts of terrorism against not only the Mountbatten family but also soldiers and others, and to the growth of terrorism around the world. Equally rightly, he draws attention to the need for upgraded protection. Incidentally, although one should not raise the question of VIP aircraft, one of the main recommendations of security authorities throughout the world is that national leaders should not endanger the lives of other people by travelling in domestic aircraft. That is one of the main security recommendations which some in this chamber have rejected. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. I refer to the social security frauds case which is now proceeding in Sydney against 2 1 defendants and which is expected to continue well into next year, and in particular to the prosecution of that case by the Government counsel, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Rofe, Q.C., and his litter of some seven juniors. Is it true that because of the enormous length and complexity of this case the Commonwealth has arranged for the transcript to be computer-processed and indexed, an exercise requiring the full-time services of one Commonwealth solicitor and terminals being installed in the private chambers of at least some of the prosecution team? Is it the Government&#39;s intention to deny to the defence counsel in this case access to this computerised transcript? Will the Attorney-General agree that denial to the defence of access to this crucial aid to the conduct of this case would be contrary to accepted principles of criminal law which require that so far as possible the Crown not enjoy any unfair or unequal advantage over the defence? </para>

            <para>- It is a fact that an arrangement involving computer processing of the transcript, counsel &#39;s indexing of it, notes and so on has been set up. It was set up as a result of a cost benefit analysis that was undertaken in my Department in regard to the cost of the prosecution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> has referred to the number of counsel engaged in it. Of course, they require the assistance also of solicitors. Because of the size of the transcript it was determined that we would save the cost of employing further assistants in the prosecution by having this facility. That was the reason for it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am aware that a question has arisen in relation to the provision of the same facility to the defence, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> has said. However, I must say that neither the Crown Solicitor nor the  Deputy  Crown Solicitor in Sydney, the latter having the specific conduct of the prosecution on behalf of the police, has received from the defence any formal request for that facility. I understand that one junior counsel raised the subject with the magistrate who, of course, had no power to make an order one way or the other. </para>
          <para>The matter has been brought to my attention and is being given consideration. However, I think it is fair to say that there are real difficulties in making the specific facility available to the defence because of the way in which the prosecution is using it and the way in which the defence may wish to use it. In other words, there may be some difficulty in maintaining confidentiality in both the prosecution and the defence. It may not be in the interests of either party for them to be able to use the same facility. The matter is being looked at, but I think that I would need to know more about the attitude of the defence before I go into the matter any further. I propose to give the matter further investigation. I hope that I will be able to give further information to the Senate at a later date. </para>

Further information and discussion are needed. The cost involved also must be considered.

Is it a fact that the Australian Institute of Marine Science, which is expected to be one of the beneficiaries of this increased funding, was an initiative of the Gorton Liberal-National Country Party Government; that the necessary legislation was introduced in 1972 by the present Prime Minister when he was Minister for Education and Science; and that the AIMS is not, to quote from the honourable senator&#39;s speech, &#39;a most important institution established by the Whitlam Government&#39;? If the answer to any or all of those questions is yes, will the Leader of the Government in the Senate make time available at the end of Question time for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> to apologise to the chamber for misleading the Senate and allow the honourable senator the opportunity to explain whether it was ignorance, malice or sophistry which motivated him to make his speech? </para>

            <para>-During <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button&#39;s</inline> comments some days ago upon, I think, the tabling of a document, a number of honourable senators questioned me as to whether certain statements which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> made were accurate. As a result, I have obtained information on this matter. My advice is that a number of the statements which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> made are inaccurate. My answer, on advice, to the honourable senator&#39;s question regarding the Australian Research Grants Committee funds is that the funds referred to have no relationship whatsoever to the funds provided for the Australian research grants scheme. The funds for the ARGS are set out in Appropriation Bill (No. 1), totalling $430,000, and Appropriation Bill (No. 2), totalling $12,370,000. The new allocation for the marine sciences and technologies research program is set out in division 929.01 of Appropriation Bill (No. 2) as $400,000. </para>

          <para>The claim by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> that the Australian Institute of Marine Science was, as I understand it was claimed, an initiative of the Whitlam Government is not true at all. The Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1970 created the Institute and provided for the appointment of an interim council to recommend to the Minister the functions and powers of the Institute in relation to marine science. The interim council presented its report in July 1971. Legislative action followed in the form of the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1972, which repealed the Act of 1970 and established the Institute with its present functions. It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser, the then Minister for Education and Science, presented the Bill to the House on 23 March 1972. As to the final part of the question, that is a matter for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> &#39;s own conscience and judgment. </para>

How many Australian citizens are affected by a law of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which became effective on 1 July and which stipulates that anyone with two parents born in countries that now comprise the USSR will be deemed to be Soviet citizens? Has the Minister any information on how many Australian children become Soviet citizens under a provision of the new law? Does the Soviet law have special implications for Australian citizens who come under its provisions and who may wish to visit the Soviet Union? If so, what advice is being given by Australian authorities to those who could be affected? </para>

            <para>- I have amongst my briefs some information on this matter which would direct itself to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rocher&#39;s</inline> question, which is an important one. I am advised that while the new law is clear in some respects it is obscure in others, and clear-cut answers to some of the questions which are uppermost in the minds of Australian residents who have close connections with the Soviet Union are not yet available. The law is at present under study in the departments concerned. Advice received so far suggests that the new law may represent a consolidation but not an extension of existing Soviet law. Australian citizens do not lose their citizenship should they automatically acquire the citizenship of another country under the laws of that country, whether they are residing in Australia or elsewhere. Consequently, no Australian citizen will lose Australian citizenship because of the automatic acquisition of citizenship of the USSR as a result of the laws of that country. Further inquiries are being pursued strongly in order that guidance may be given to those persons who are concerned about the implications of the new law. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the meantime, I repeat the advice given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his statement to the Parliament in May last year that the problems of dual nationality cannot be overcome by citizens simply asserting that they do not accept their other citizenship and that it is for the individual to ascertain in advance the consequences of coming within the jurisdiction of another country which claims his or her citizenship. As the Minister has stated, and as all Australians are advised when receiving a passport, in these circumstances Australian consular officers can advise but they may not be able to assist. When the jurisdiction of another country is being asserted they will take all the steps open to them. A study of any possible new problems created by the Soviet legislation is being pursued urgently. Lest there are aspects of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rocher&#39;s</inline> question that are not covered by my answer, I will refer his question to the Minister concerned. </para>

            <para>- I do not have before me the precise wording of the Lusaka declaration. I think it is interesting that the Australian Labor Party seeks to find, in a selective fashion, some major points of virtue but tries to condemn, with utter failure, the great achievements of our Prime Minister in Lusaka in the overall attempts to solve this problem. Let me simply say that one cannot pick and choose in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> is greatly embarrassed by the fact that he has to seek to identify virtue in the Prime Minister in the hope of making some point in the second part of his question.

            <para>-As at 30 June 1 979 a total of 450 handicapped people were registered awaiting placement with offices in the Australian Capital Territory. The specialised placement and counselling assistance to handicapped people is provided by certain officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service. In the Australian Capital Territory there is the Vocational Psychology Unit which can provide a range of psychological services where this is appropriate and the CES can arrange to refer any person to this Unit. In addition, there is an officer within each CES office who has responsibility to assist handicapped people with employment problems. Further assistance may be obtainable through the National Employment and Training system. Some cases of employer prejudice have been noted by employment officers. In such cases, the employment officer or counsellor provides employers with factual and relevant information about the handicapped person&#39;s potential in order to dispel any such misconceptions. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight</inline> has indicated, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> the Minister for Social Security may have something further to add in relation to her portfolio. </para>

            <para>- I wish only to add that I think we provide funds through the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act to two centres conducting sheltered workshops. Other assistance is provided through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service in association with the Woden Hospital. I recall that the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped had discussions with the Equal Employment Opportunity Committee of the Public Service Board. I was interested in that figure of 450 people awaiting placement. I will undertake to check the outcome of the discussions that I understand were held. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Perhaps the only other assistance I will mention is that which we give to ACROD- the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of the Disabled- the co-ordinating body for disabled persons. As a co-ordinating body, it has always had a very active interest in the employment opportunities that are provided for handicapped persons. I will give consideration to the matter to see whether I can provide any further information to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight.</inline></para>

As these schemes encourage Australians to participate actively in Third World aid on an individual basis, has the Government considered providing an incentive to donors by making such donations tax deductible? </para>

I think that all governments, whatever side of politics they come from, have decided not to do so for their own reasons. It is a matter of policy.

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Lewis</inline>has raised a whole series of questions. I have a brief on the general situation. I will see whether it will suffice on all of the points raised. I am advised that the Government has approved a Defence Force entry in the Parmelia Yacht Race from Plymouth in England to Perth which is being staged as part of the anniversary celebrations. By arrangement with the owner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> Grubic, the yacht <inline font-style="italic">Anaconda II</inline> will be the Defence Force entry with a crew selected from Army, Navy and Air Force aspirants. Terms and conditions governing the loan of <inline font-style="italic">Anaconda II</inline> to the Defence Force for the Parmelia Race have been documented in a formal agreement between the Commonwealth and the owner. One important condition is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grubic</inline> is the skipper during workout trials and the forward passage to the United Kingdom as well as during the race. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grubic</inline> is also to carry the full risk of loss or damage to the yacht while he is in command. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grubic&#39;s</inline> valuation of the yacht is in the vicinity of $ 1 m. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The financial arrangements are that the defence budget is to absorb all costs of the Defence Force participation subject to the owner&#39;s providing approximately $20,000 for expenses overseas and $10,000 from the crew members. The cost of the Commonwealth contribution, aside from normal salaries and allowances, has been estimated at $127,520, but final costings are to be agreed upon by the Ministers for Finance and Defence. If there any further points I will have them commented on by the Minister concerned. </para>

            <para>-I am aware of the newspaper report. Also I am able to assure the Senate that no Army Iroquois helicopters were overseeing the New South Wales Police. It so happens that on 23 August two Royal Australian Air Force Iroquois helicopters on a low level navigation exercise were returning to their base in Amberley from the Lismore area. The pilots observed the collection of police vehicles on the ground in the Terania Creek area. They circled the area once and then departed without landing. There are no prizes for poetic licence in the descriptions of the Press. I think Pooh-Bah in the Mikado had something to say about adding verisimilitude to an otherwise dull and unimportant subject. The Defence Force was not involved in any way in the operation carried out by the New South Wales Government at Terania Creek. </para>

I refer to a question asked yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> in relation to supplementary assistance and special benefit. In referring to special benefit, the Minister referred <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> to section 125 of the Act which relates special benefits to unemployment benefit or sickness benefit. As supplementary assistance is payable for a sickness beneficiary after six weeks, is it possible, under the Act, to pay supplementary assistance to a person receiving a special benefit? Further, if it is not possible, will the Minister have the matter investigated to see whether hardship is being experienced in this area by the current format of the Act? </para>

After the honourable senator referred the question to me I, on returning to my office, asked for some information. I am advised by the Department that the issue is somewhat more complex. At present I am awaiting a report from the Director-General who has sought a legal opinion on the application of the section that I referred to and another section, 1 12a, where sickness benefit may attract some supplementary benefit after the six-weeks referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston.</inline> The matter is under consideration. I will also take account of the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> as to whether consideration could be given to hardship where it is found that no supplementary allowance benefit can be paid.

            <para>- Yesterday the question of the incorporation in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard of</inline> documents relating to a matter arising out of the <inline font-style="italic">Broadband</inline> program arose and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> raised the point that such an action in the Senate might prejudice the individual concerned in any legal remedy that that individual may seek to achieve. I said that the last thing in the world that this Government, and certainly this Senate, would want to do would be to harm any person in seeking justice, and that I would defer the matter in order to get legal advice. The best advice that I can get is that there might be some possible limitation and therefore some detriment to a person seeking legal remedy if such documents became privileged by incorporation. In no way would the Government want to do that in the course of the period in which a person was seeking legal recourse. Therefore, I cannot at this moment proceed. I am bound to say that, nevertheless, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> sought to peruse the documents concerned and I very willingly made the documents available for his perusal with the clear caveat, which I made here yesterday and which I now repeat, that there is no guarantee at all as to the authenticity or quality of the documents. </para>

              <para>- Yesterday some material, the authenticity of which the Leader of the Government quite properly could not vouch for, was in the Senate. He indicated that he would be prepared to have that material incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It was material which formed the subject matter of part of a broadcast on the Australian Broadcasting Commission, I think on Monday night. I think it is common knowledge that this is a matter of considerable public interest. It is not the procedure, and it has not been the procedure in this chamber over the years, to deny a person in this chamber the right to incorporate material which, as in this case, in no way would prejudice anyone. I ask the Leader of the Government to reconsider what he has just told the Senate. If he holds to the views he has just expressed, I will seek leave to move a motion to suspend so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent the incorporation of that material in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

          <para class="block">As I have indicated, the normal practice over the years in this place, and indeed in the House of Representatives, has been that, if it is believed that a matter that is before the courts could in fact be the subject of debate in this Parliament that might prejudice somebody involved in legal proceedings, then the House and the Senate would recognise that. But at the same time we have also followed a procedure whereby, under certain circumstances, that rule is not necessarily observed. </para>
          <para>I refer to page 250 of Odgers&#39; <inline font-style="italic">Australian Senate Practice,</inline> where Odgers deals fairly extensively with this circumstance- perhaps not precisely this circumstance. Let us just consider what Odgers has to say about the position if in fact there is a question of legal proceedings. On page 250 he refers to the opinion expressed in 1937 by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Jordan, the then Chief Justice of New South Wales. I shall not read all of this, but I will read sufficient to make the case quite clear. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> said:  lt is of extreme public interest that no conduct should be permitted which is likely to prevent a litigant in a court of justice from having his case tried free from all matter of prejudice. But the administration of justice, important though it undoubtedly is, is not the only matter in which the public is vitally interested; and if in the course of the ventilation of a question of public concern matter is published which might prejudice a party in the conduct of a law suit, it does not follow that a contempt has been committed. The case may be one in which as between competing matters of public interest the possibility of prejudice to a litigant may be required to yield to other and superior considerations. The discussion of public affairs and the denunciation of publicabuses, actual or supposed, cannot be required to be suspended merely because the discussion or the denunciation may, as an incidental but not intended by-product, cause some likelihood of prejudice to a person who happens at the time to be a litigant. </para>
          <para class="block">Odgers goes on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The view is taken that matters under investigation may be of such significance, their possible implications of such legitimate public concern and the need to get to the bottom of them so overwhelmingly important, that they may feel a duty to go ahead, writs or no writs, to investigate and examine, and if need be comment purposefully upon all the facts. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Further on he quotes the then Attorney-General of 1947, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt,</inline> who in substance was saying the same thing. 1 do not want to go through all that again. All members of this Senate are surely conversant with the procedures and with what Odgers says and the cases he quotes. But the important difference is that in this case there are no judicial proceedings at all. All that has happened so far is that the Liberal Party in New South Wales, which, as we know, is torn asunder by this issue- this is the real reason why there is a refusal to incorporate the documents- has appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Spender,</inline> Q.C., to look into this matter on its behalf. In the New South Wales Parliament the State Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Walker, in answer to a question on the same matter, indicated that he would be prepared to give the matter further consideration and to provide an additional answer. I do not know exactly what has happened there, but I understand that the matter is still under consideration by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walker.</inline> Certainly no one could claim that there are any judicial proceedings. </para>
          <para>In our normal process, even if there were judicial proceedings, the question of the documents being sub judice could still be overruled by this Senate in the public interest. That is exactly what Odgers is saying. They are the rulings which have been given in the past. Yet in this case there are no judicial proceedings. Therefore the reasons why we are being refused the incorporation of these documents are all the more dubious. I did have a chance to see some of them last night. </para>

              <para>-I would have thought that anybody who has lived through this generation, the Second World War and the matters allegedly involved in this case would show concern about the seriousness of these allegations, as indeed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> himself said yesterday.

          <para>All we are asking for is that the material which was brought in here yesterday be made available. I have had the opportunity to peruse some of it. I am unable to state that in my view these documents are authentic. I do not know either. But, in reading them, one could not help but have some very real concern about the opinions which have allegedly been expressed by the person who is, I understand, a member of the Liberal Party of New South Wales. I do not believe that whatever is happening inside the Liberal Party in New South Wales should be the determinant of whether this material is incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> We should be following the normal procedures which would apply where any material which is brought into this chamber and which is of concern to the public interest, as undoubtedly this material is, should be made available to the Senate. I ask all honourable senators on the Government side, including the members of the Liberal Party, who themselves probably have a very real personal political problem now, to put that problem behind them and to keep before them the necessity to maintain the integrity of the procedures of this place. If they are going to subvert the authority of the Senate simply because of the political brawl that they are having in New South Wales, then it will be on their heads. </para>

              <para>- I rise to a point of order. I take the point that the motion is out of order. I believe that the Government would have no objection to the suspension of Standing Orders if the Opposition wanted to discuss the matter but, as I understand it, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> has moved that the documents be printed- documents which have not even been tabled in this Parliament. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> has been saying about public interest, the sub judice rule and so forth has been very interesting and familiar ground to me and to other honourable senators, but quite irrelevant to the subject before us. So far as I know, no legal proceedings are on foot and nobody that I know of is suggesting at this stage that that is the reason why the honourable senator cannot do what he is proposing. However, there is another good reason why he cannot. Perhaps we could even suspend the Standing Orders, and then vote against the proposition, but I hope that you will rule <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that the present motion is out of order.

It is very difficult to take seriously the legal concerns that have now been expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> in justification of his refusal to proceed with the tabling and incorporation of these papers- the suggestion that somehow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> &#39;s legal position will be prejudiced as a result.

The reality is that the tabling in this Senate, or the incorporation in Hansard, of material so presented cannot in any way prejudice rights of action of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> or anyone else, which have already accrued.

              <para>- It may or may not influence damages. That is entirely a matter for the particular court to decide in the circumstances of a particular case- the defamation having been made out- what is the extent of the damage incurred by the plaintiff as a result of the material &#39;s becoming public. I have no doubt at all that in this situation a court would take the view that the damage, such as it was, was unquestionably done at the time of the initial <inline font-style="italic">Broadband</inline> broadcast which encouraged not only the radio transmission to be heard by many Australians but also many newspapers to pick it up and the libel if such it was, the slander if such it was, to be spread about. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The subsequent tabling in Parliament of further papers in the matter would not appear to me, certainly not as a matter of law nor I think as a matter of likely practical outcome when it came to the assessment of damages, to alter one whit the amount of damages to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> would otherwise be entitled. Certainly, the important point to appreciate, quite apart from the question of damages, is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> &#39;s ability actually to bring an action and recover, to make out his case, could not on any view be prejudiced. That remains the central issue if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> is indeed anxious to take a legal form of redress for what has occurred. One of the interesting things about this case is that no writ has yet been issued. That is the preliminary point that has to be understood and I cannot imagine that there would be any serious dissent from that proposition. </para>
          <para>The further point that has to be acknowledged- if one is groping about for some conceivable legal prejudice that might be suffered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> as a result of this course of action being taken- is that it is true that if the motion is agreed to, if these documents are put in and become public in this way, they will of course be privileged; that any accurate repetition of them by any other media, or anyone else in the community, will equally enjoy that privilege and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> will not have a remedy in respect of any further defamatory imputation that may emerge from these documents that it is proposed to put it in, which defamatory imputation has not emerged already in the proceeding run of events. I acknowledge that. That is possible; it is perfectly true. This will be, to some extent at least it seems, new material. To the extent that it is new and has new defamatory stings about it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> will not have the right of action that he would have had if the material had been put into the public system by someone else. But that question can hardly be decisive on the issue of whether this Senate is to accept or reject the proposition that this material should be tabled. </para>
          <para>The question is as to whether this consideration should prevail against the very strongly arguable public interest that applies on the other hand; that is, that the documents in all of the circumstances as they have emerged should be tabled in order to enable the quality and quantity of the information available to the public on the matter to be much enhanced. That is the rationale that was advanced in the first instance by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline> The question that we have to consider is whether that public interest aspect is sufficient to outweigh the possible very indirect prejudice that might apply if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> were to lose some right of action that he might otherwise have had if this material were put into the system by someone else. </para>
          <para>I suggest to the Senate that in considering and in weighing up the matter- I do not skim over it or suggest that it is not a matter worth considering or weighing up- it surely ought to consider from a common sense point of view that which is the obvious reality. The obvious reality is that any defamatory damage that has been done to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> has been done already by the <inline font-style="italic">Broadband</inline> broadcast and by what was published in the newspapers following that broadcast. As was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> yesterday, if this material is defamatory and would be held by a court to be defamatory, then the defamation has been done. It is difficult, indeed almost impossible, to imagine that anything in the documents which are tabled- if they are tabled before us today- could be more damaging than the basic material which was put in issue on the <inline font-style="italic">Broadband</inline> broadcast. I think that one has to bear that consideration very strongly in mind. If one is considering and weighing up the matter by reference to fairness, justice or considerations of that kind, what we ought to be doing - </para>

              <para>- That does not appear to be the attitude, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, that</inline> the Government is adopting with respect to this matter. The point has been taken- I would be delighted to hear some further elucidation from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> about it- that the indirect possibility of prejudice, which I can only assume to be the kind of prejudice I have already mentioned, is sufficient in itself to justify these documents not being tabled. If it is a matter of weighing and balancing the further considerations that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline> has adverted to- that is, the likely accuracy and so on of this material- that might be a legitimate reason for giving further consideration to the question of whether this material ought to go in. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>But that has problems too. That rather implies that we as a Senate or those who were determining whether the documents should be brought before us would be making some judicial type judgment as to the accuracy of them. I think that that probably would serve a greater degree of unfairness to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> than would be the case if the documents simply went in as they are now in order that we and the community at large might be in some better position than we are at the moment to evaluate the status of the material that has already been put on the public record. </para>
          <para>After all, all that is being sought is that we be put in a better position by the tabling of the whole documents from which this material has been put on the public record, which has apparently been quoted. If there is any truth in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> &#39;s denials or avoidance of the substance of the allegations that have been made about him, we, the Parliament, and the community as a whole will surely be in a much better position to evaluate the force of those denials, the force of this avoidance, with this material before us than we would without it. </para>
          <para>I go so far as to suggest that the tabling of this material, if there is anything to be said in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> &#39;s favour, is likely to serve to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Urbanchich</inline> &#39;s advantage rather than the contrary. One of the awful realities about the operation of the defamation law as it prevails at the moment in this country is that it takes so long- it takes months and years- for these matters to go before the court, to get a proper airing and for all the evidence to be put in the open. This, I think, is the substance of the recent Australian Law Reform Commission&#39;s recommendations which suggested that there be a procedure for immediate redress. There is, in the absence of that procedure for redress, no other way in which all the material bearing upon this particular case can be put in the public forum and some opportunity for evaluation of it to be provided. </para>
          <para>For those reasons, although I acknowledge that there is a weighing and a balancing that has to go on here, I believe that the balancing is unquestionably in favour of allowing this material in. I see no legal reason, and certainly no moral reason, why it should not go in. The only reason I can think of as to why the Government, or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> at least, has changed its or his mind about what to do about this is that he has considered the matter further overnight from a purely political perspective. He has decided that there is a prospect of alienating a particular right-wing section of the New South Wales branch or the national body of the Liberal Party, and he has made a political decision to keep the material out. Whether it is a moral decision or whether it is a legal decision, let us hear some arguments other than the derisory argument that we have had so far from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> yesterday and from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> today. If there is a good argument we will listen to it; we will take it into account. But we are not going to be fobbed off with the kind of nonsense that we have heard so far. </para>

            <para>- I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> concluded his speech in the way that he did. I am glad to know that the Opposition is prepared to be reasonable. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> acknowledged, there is a balancing to take place in relation to this matter. It is a question of whether, in fairness, these documents should at this stage be given the privilege which attaches to them by their incorporation in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which has been sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt.</inline> At this stage, the important points are these: First, there is the fact that the documents, as I understand it, have not been certified from the point of view of the accuracy of the translation. I regard that as probably the short end point. If the documents represented a certified translation from a person who is recognised as being acceptable to a court as a translator from the Slovenian language to the Australian language, then we would perhaps be able to debate the latter point. As I understand it, an examination of the translation makes it perfectly clear that it is not a good translation. </para>

          <para>Seantor  RAE- From someone who is in a position to be able to read the original document and the translation. That is what I am told. I believe that the problem can be overcome by there being sought a certified translation of the documents. Then perhaps we could see whether the other points apply. I simply make the point that the documents are not a certified translation. These documents cannot possibly be read in the original language by more than a very tiny percentage of the Australian population and, therefore, would have to be read in the translation. Before such documents are incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> there ought to be an accurate certified translation. That is a sufficient reason for opposing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> &#39;s motion at this stage. </para>
          <para>There are further points to be considered, such as the damage the incorporation of these documents can do to the rights and interests of the person concerned, the effect that it may have on his rights in relation to the inquiry which is being undertaken at the moment and which affects positions which he holds, and the effect that it may have in relation to his rights to damages in relation to any publication which has already taken place. Those are questions which I do not think arise at all at this stage because we do not have a certified translation, and there should not be any attempts to incorporate the documents in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> until such time as there is. Therefore, I do not propose to debate the other points because I think that is a sufficient answer in itself. </para>

              <para>- I am sorry, I must have made myself misunderstood. I accepted the legal arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> today when he debated the points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> and dismissed them as not being viable or applicable to this debate. That is what I said. I am sorry if I gave any other impression. Notwithstanding that, the Australian Democrats will vote with the Government on this matter for the very reasons espoused by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and which I stated yesterday. We are being asked to incorporate photostat copies of printed documents with no heading or name at the top and without a signature at the bottom or a date. They are scrappy photostat copies of a typewritten piece purporting to be a translation of the original document. If the Opposition wants to move this same motion in a week or two weeks when a qualified translation of those documents has been made and when they have been attested that that is a true translation, then there would be a case for the documents to be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

          <para>I say at the outset that if statements were made by a citizen similar to those purported to have been made by a certain leading citizen, we would denounce those with vigour, with every member of this chamber, and have them exposed. Let us assume the hypothetical case that an article appears in a foreign language newspaper in Australia; it is written in a foreign language and purports to have been written by a prominent citizen, or even by an honourable senator or member of Parliament. Let us assume that that article states some outrageous propositions on racism, revolution by force or some other dreadful thing. Further, let us assume that somebody produces an unsigned, unattested document purporting to be a translation of that article. We would not know the prominent person, senator or member of Parliament who wrote it in the first place and we would not know whether the translation was in any way accurate. </para>

I plead with the Labor Party on this matter. It is a serious question and I support the Opposition&#39;s motives. I suggest that it wait until there is a proper translation so that no damage is done. Entirely disregarding the legalities of the matter and just looking at the future, I point out that if this resolution is passed today it is open season for anybody who wants to send up anyone in this country. Therefore, the Australian Democrats oppose the motion. </para>

          <para>-by leave-I wish to make a personal explanation. I claim to have been misrepresented. I do not have the advantage of the report of what was asked by my colleague from Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon,</inline> but at Question Time today he asked a question of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> relating to a speech which I made in the Senate on 22 August. I must say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> in that benign way which he has, indicated that time would be made available to me because it was a matter for my conscience. It is not a matter for my conscience; what took place is a matter of fact. If we look at the facts, I think that a very good starting point would be to look at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> &#39;s answer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> said that on a number of occasions he had had comments from other honourable senators about the contents of this speech, that they were concerned about it, and that because of that he had taken the trouble to check the facts. In answer to the question he went on to say, for example, that I had claimed that the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville was a Whitlam Government initiative. If he had checked the facts and read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of what I had said, he would have seen that what I said was that the Whitlam </para>

        <para>Seantor  BUTTON- Honourable senators opposite might not like it, but it is a fact. The history of the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville is that for a period covering four Liberal governments it was discussed in this Parliament. Each one of those governments could claim that it was its initiative, but, like most Liberal governments, nothing was done. It was the Whitlam Government which established the Australian Institute of Marine Science and which chose the site and built the building; and it is there today. That is what I said and what is recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I have been misrepresented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> who has been as sloppy in dealing with this matter as he is in dealing with most matters in connection with the Budget, for example. That was the second point of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> &#39;s question. Is that his name? </para>

            <para>- It is not a question of memory; it is a question of knowledge. The other point to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> &#39;s question alluded was that it was suggested that I said in the speech of 22 August 1979 that the money for marine science had been taken out of the general research funding budget. What I said may be wrong, but if it is wrong so are the Budget Papers tabled by this Government. I want to refer to the Budget Papers on that precise issue. I commend to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> a reading of the Budget Papers on a number of matters, including the Government&#39;s taxation proposals but particularly on this matter, if he wants to ask these sorts of questions about it. Under the heading of Research Grants&#39; the Budget Papers refer to the Queen Elizabeth II Fellowships Scheme and then continue: </para>

        <para class="block">That is the statement upon which I relied- a printed statement in the Budget Papers- for the statement I made in the Senate on 22 August. I do not detract for one minute from that statement, because nobody can do anything else but rely on a printed statement in the Government&#39;s Budget Papers to draw a conclusion about a matter such as that. </para>
        <para>I would not normally waste the time of the Senate with this sort of explanation, but if we are to have a sort of &#39;answers to inaccuracies time&#39; we would be here for five years listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> explain himself in such circumstances. I think it is important that the matter be corrected. If honourable senators on the Government side want to shoot at matters of detail such as this, they should at least get their facts right. To that extent I have been misrepresented in respect of matters of fact and, more particularly, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> &#39;s inaccurate answer. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">I have moved this motion today because, in a world in which there is an ever increasing demand for and usage of energy, particularly with the sophistication of travel and the further development of industry, both in developed and developing countries, it has been estimated that more energy could be used between now and the turn of this century than has been used in the history of mankind. From that alone one can see that there is a need to look very closely at the world&#39;s energy situation and at those countries which are fortunate enough to be rather rich in energy resources. One point that must be made is that following the Industrial Revolution there was a great increase in the demand for and usage of coal for generation and to assist industry generally. But over the years we have seen the demand for coal change to a demand with greater emphasis upon crude oil, which again fits in with modern requirements and general usage. </para>
          <para>It was not until the oil crisis of 1973 that the world suddenly became aware that it was dealing with a diminishing energy resource. So there was a need for the major energy countries in particular to look around, to take stock and to reassess their energy requirements; to look to alternative sources of energy and also to general conservation. With the recent oil price hike, which has increased oil prices by something like 30 per cent since 1978, we find greater concern being expressed by the world generally. We have seen a change in the pattern of demand for particular types of energy. We have seen an upsurge in the demand for coal. We have also seen a great change in the demand for energy in the area of nuclear generation. </para>
          <para>Whatever some people may say, we have to accept that the world today has decided that it must go nuclear to fill this energy gap. The situation is becoming more critical every day of the week. One can look at the statistics and find outlined very clearly what is happening with regard to nuclear generation. From the figures of 27 March 1979, which are very recent figures, we find that some 53 countries throughout the world are committed to nuclear energy. Already 2 1 9 reactors are operating; 244 are under construction; 100 more are on order; and at least 200 more are planned to be established in various countries. This shows very clearly what the world situation is regarding the need to fill the energy gap. </para>
          <para>There is another area in which we can see the emphasis changing. I refer to the announcement in the Press yesterday that a $ 1 billion- I stress billion&#39;- aluminium refinery or furnace, whichever people may like to call it, will be built at Gladstone, Queensland, purely because electricity there is cheap and in abundance because of the great coal supplies nearby. The trend of countries is to get to the source of their energy. Of course, Australia is one of those fortunate countries which are extremely rich in energy. We have a great abundance of coal- black steaming coal and black coking coal as well as brown coal. We have great abundance of uranium. We have one of the biggest reserves or sources of uranium in the world. Whilst we are not self-sufficient in oil, at present we are 70 per cent self-sufficient. We have vast amounts of natural gas and we have great potential in the area of shale ore, just to mention a few. But over and above that, we also have good potential to find more oil and gas in both the off-shore areas and the on-shore areas of Australia. I am very pleased to see the great increase which is taking place in on-shore exploration because of the policies of the Federal Government, which is conscious of the fact that as a government it must meet not only its national but also its international responsibilities. </para>
          <para>Again I refer to the terms of the motion. It refers to the moral obligation of Australia, as an energy rich country in an energy starved world, to undertake commercial development of its abundant resources including uranium. When we look at the situation in the various States of the Commonwealth of Australia we find that great developments are taking place in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria regarding both black and brown coal. There is great potential in that area and projects are being developed there with great emphasis upon increasing exports of coal to energy hungry countries throughout the world. In 1977-78 exports of coal totalled some $38m. In 1979 they have already increased to some $39m, and one can anticipate that we will continue to see great increases in that area. </para>
          <para>On the North West Shelf we have already discovered vast reserves of gas. Multi-millions of dollars will be expended there to bring that gas on-shore, where a lot of that gas will be sold overseas to help the energy needs of certain countries throughout the world. When one looks at uranium mining one finds that the development of mines in the Northern Territory and Western Australia is under way at present. A uranium enrichment plant will be established somewhere in this country. Under the strict guidelines set down by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser, some two years ago, one has greater control in selling enriched uranium than in selling just uranium ore or yellowcake, as it is called by many people. But the interesting thing is that already three States in Australia wish to establish a uranium enrichment plant. I refer to Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. Last year the New South Wales Premier made approaches to see whether an enrichment plant could be established in that State. I commend him for doing that, and I accept the fact that he is the Premier of a Labor government. Nevertheless he can see that there is a need to fill the energy gap throughout the world. But there is one State in Australia that does not wish to adopt a uniform approach with regard to this country meetings its obligations. I refer to the State of South Australia. South Australia has a large amount of uranium. It has numerous deposits scattered throughout the northern areas. In fact, the proven reserves of uranium there at present are greater than the proven reserves in the Northern Territory. </para>

              <para>-I shall not talk about how deep the uranium deposits are, as one honourable senator opposite has done. There is one company- I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop,</inline> who is also from South Australia, will be dealing with this matter because he has been involved in this area of uranium- that virtually could start tomorrow morning if it were given the green light. So enough of that talk. Amongst these deposits there is a deposit known as Roxby Downs, which is already proven to be larger than the city of Melbourne. Many people say that the mine at Roxby Downs could be one of the largest mines in the world. So far it is proven to hold something like 10 million tonnes of copper and 300,000 tonnes of uranium, plus gold and rare earth. Mining of Roxby Downs would have a great impact upon Australia, especially South Australia. Firstly, a township would have to be built, with all the infrastructures that go with it. Secondly, milling plants and refineries would need to be established to separate the copper, uranium, gold and rare earth. I could go on. We might move even into refining with smelters. One can see the great potential that that mine holds. It would employ literally thousands of people. Millions of dollars would be invested there. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>At the present time Roxby will not be developed because the Labor Party in South Australia says no, even though it will admit that there is an energy-hungry world. I should say also that Roxby Downs, if it is not developed, will be the only commercially viable uranium mine in the world that is not being developed. I say to those honourable senators opposite who have been interjecting that they should look at some of the countries on the other side of the world. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, for instance, is mining every ounce of uranium it possibly can. It is interesting to consider the history of the uranium policy in the Labor Party in South Australia. I refer to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> on 6 February this year which was written by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Dean</inline> Jaensch. The article states: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">After a fight at the State convention, that amendment was beaten and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duncan</inline> missed out. It is also interesting to note what happened at the Federal ALP executive meeting. When it was discussed there was a battle, and all that the Premier, the Minister of Mines and the others in the Labor Party in South Australia who support the mining of uranium could do was achieve a holding position and maintain the current policy. It is interesting to see how the attitudes of the Labor Party in South Australia finally were exposed. Roxby Downs is so big that outside partners had to be sought. Eventually British Petroleum came in as a partner, with an initial investment of some $50m. I want to make it clear that BP is a very big company, a very successful company and a very alert company. No doubt it would not have gone ahead with such an investment unless it had been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> that Roxby Downs would go ahead. No company is going to invest $50m on a dead horse. In any case, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> Duncan, one of the left wingers in South Australia- he makes no bones about that- made a public statement, firstly, that BP would be wasting its money if it were to invest and, secondly, that the mining of uranium would never take place at Roxby Downs. Those are two positive statements. The next thing we find is that an anti-uranium lobby was set up within the parliamentary Labor Party in South Australia to oppose anything relating to the mining of uranium. So there is a big division in the State of South Australia. There are many right wingers in the Labor Party in South Australia who support the mining of uranium. Others of the party&#39;s extreme Left strongly oppose it. </para>

              <para>-Rather than looking to the responsibilities of the State and the nation and helping to supply the energy needs of the world, they prefer to adopt their radical left wing policies. They will not assist in any way to meet needs that are so easy to see and so necessary to fulfil. As this matter has progressed the left wing finally has forced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> to a State election some 18 months early. It is only a few weeks ago that the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran,</inline> made it perfectly clear that he had no intention of going to an election. I come back to the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> where the issue is spelled out. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> As I was saying, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> has been forced into an early election by the left wing of the Labor Party in South Australia. There is absolutely no doubt that it is using him as a front for the election. Left wing members know jolly well that a left wing leadership would never get the support of the people in South Australia, whereas <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> has an image and is respected by many people there. No doubt what will happen is that he will be deposed by the left wing because it will have an increase in numbers after the election. There are four candidates for safe seats who are reported to be staunch left wingers. It is obvious that there will be absolutely no uranium mining, no Roxby Downs in South Australia. </para>

          <para>What this means in real terms is that not only will the people of South Australia, if they vote for the Labor Party, be opposed to economic development, including Roxby Downs, and filling the obligations for the energy needs of the world, but also they will be voting for somebody else as Leader of the Labor Party. Who would that be? Would it be somebody like Peter Duncan? Most people in South Australia know his politics, and I make no bones about saying that. They are very conscious of that. I can only say that, as far as I as a South Australian am concerned, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> has let down South Australia by giving in to the left wing of his party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> should have stood his ground and fought for what he believes in, including the mining of uranium at Roxby Downs. I say that to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> who asked me to give him a name. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline>should not allow himself to be used as an election tool by the radical left wing of the South Australian Labor party on an issue that is so vital to South Australia. He is being used in this way and he knows what is going to happen eventually. All he is doing is allowing himself to be used in the hope of winning an election for his party, knowing full well that the left wing will take control straight after the election. There is absolutely no doubt about that. I am making a positive forecast. No doubt others in the right wing of the Labor Party are fully aware of it. There are honest men in the Australian Labor Party who do support the mining of uranium. </para>

            <para>-I am sure that honourable senators, when they heard the wording of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young&#39;s</inline> motion, would have thought that it was a very high sounding and high principled motion because it referred to the moral obligation of Australia. But what happened to his speech? After five minutes of skirmishing, talking about energy problems and uranium, he did what the Liberals in Tasmania did. They set out to attack the Australian Labor Party and to say that it would be controlled by the left wing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> paid some lip service to a very fine Premier whom he likes. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> likes <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran.</inline> He gave some great support to Corcoran and Hudson. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> did not deal with the moral obligations of the nation in respect of resources. I point out to the Senate and to the people who are listening that the debate today is purely a stunt to somehow divert the attention of the Australian people and the South Australian people in particular from the achievements of the State Labor Government. I remind the honourable senator that at lunch time today Des Corcoran, at a tremendous meeting in Adelaide, delivered his election policy speech. Last night the Liberal Party leader was a flop. I make a second point: It is rather strange in this place that when genuine State issues are raised the position is not like it was in the old days when I came here. In those days, every South Australian senator supported his State. </para>

When Premier Playford said that the State wanted improvements in railways or something for the motor car industry, all South Australian senators joined forces and spoke for the State.

I did not receive a clear answer but when the matter was raised in the Senate, what did they do? Some of them walked out. They did not support the motion.

We had the support of a large group of Liberals and we knew that the trade union movement would support a new shipbuilding activity which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen</inline> has now accepted. Unfortunately, South Australian senators opposite let us down. </para>

          <para>What is the position in respect of Roxby Downs? It could be thought from what honourable senators opposite say that Roxby Downs is no longer a goer. But the fact is, as honourable senators well know, that nothing can be done. Already $50m has been invested by BP Australia Ltd and Western Mining Corporation Ltd for exploration over the next three years. We do not know whether it will ever be decided that the safeguards for the mining of uranium are satisfactory. The Labor Party&#39;s insistence on safeguards is an important and moral stand. It is supported by a large number of the Australian people. In particular, it has been supported by the South Australian electorate because is supported the Dunstan Government. Let me tell honourable senators about another strange thing. In 1977 in the South Australian House of Assembly a motion was floated. Every member of the State Opposition in 1977 supported the motion that as a matter of principle they should not mine or develop uranium in South Australia until it was safe to provide uranium to a customer country. </para>

              <para>-I support the Labor Party policy without any hesitation. I would rather talk about the moral obligations of this Government which should provide some remedies for the unemployment problem. There is no doubt that unemployment will increase. That has been stated in the Budget Papers. Yet honourable senators opposite do nothing about it. The Government opposes job creation policies. Is there not a moral obligation on the Australian Parliament in this area? What about the cuts the Government has made in the training of young people. These young people should be trained now for jobs in the future when these great mining projects are commenced. What has the Government done about those matters? The Government has cut expenditure in these areas. The National Employment and Training system has been cut and the total grants for apprenticeship training and other training have been cut by $27m. Is there not a moral obligation in this area? We have heard nothing about moral obligations to assist people. </para>

              <para>- I am asked where I stand on the matter. Do honourable senators opposite want another Harrisburg incident? The Labor Party&#39;s policy has been reinforced by the recent visit overseas by then Premier Dunstan. Everybody expected that he had gone overseas to change Labor Party policy. People said that his trip was an excuse. Already <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> has cited some such nonsense. But what happened when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> came back to Australia? Let me quote some of the evidence that he gave to the South Australian Parliament which has never been answered. For example, what would honourable senators on the Government side do about the disposal of radioactive waste? No honourable senator opposite has stated what sorts of safeguards he would apply. Would honourable senators bring the waste back to Maralinga? Would they bury it near <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> &#39;s little humpy? Would they put it in the West? Would they pollute the streams? I was in New York in recent years. I went to see a great nuclear power station which was very near an important river. At that time- this was two years ago- it was stated that they had all the safeguards necessary to contain the residue from this power station. But what happened? A few months ago, of course, they had a leak. This leak might have threatened and polluted streams. The incident at Harrisburg came on top of that situation. The Labor Party has made its position clear. Its policy is strong and positive. It will continue to assess as much as possible all the information that it gets. </para>

            <para>-I have been anxiously awaiting some hint of policy from the Opposition benches concerning the provision of jobs for the unemployed in Australia. I think it is most appropriate that the matter we are discussing now should have been raised at this time. It is true that Australia has an obligation to share its energy resources with other less fortunate countries. I am appalled to find that whenever the question of uranium mining and development in Australia is raised members of the Labor Party throw up their hands in horror and start screaming about nuclear waste. We are not talking about nuclear waste. That is an excuse that just cannot be sustained. It is an emotional argument which, in my opinion, is nonsense. </para>

          <para>I know very well that the United Kingdom, for example, is accepting nuclear waste from countries such as Japan well knowing that in the future it will have a resource of energy which will be quite valuable. That decision was made in the time of a Labour Government. It is quite foolish for people to turn their backs on this issue. If we are to provide jobs in Australia we have to develop the uranium mining industry as soon as possible. It is quite crazy for honourable senators opposite to suggest that action we take here will prevent 53 countries from proceeding with programs to expand nuclear energy in order to provide their populations with the energy required to increase their quality of life. If we adopt that sort of attitude we are denying people the right to improve their quality of life. I find it extraordinary that the Labor Party should adopt that attitude. </para>
          <para>I am also appalled that the Premier of South Australia, the Honourable Des Corcoran, should state- he was compelled to do so, of course, by the influences at the trades hall, dominated by the left wing- that he will keep in the ground, in South Australia, 10 per cent of the world&#39;s uranium resources. He said he would do so until the industry is completely safe. He is quoted in the Press as having made that statement. He disregards the other power generating industries in Australia. He chooses to disregard the fact that no industry in the world is completely safe. Recently we had evidence of that when there was a methane gas explosion at a mine in New South Wales which resulted in the deaths of 14 unfortunate workers. This created misery for their families. Hardly a ripple of concern was expressed in the papers of Australia about that accident yet if a uranium industry worker tripped and broke his neck in Harrisburg or at another nuclear plant there would be hell to pay. It would be an international incident. </para>
          <para>There were 14 deaths in that coal mine in New South Wales. That industry has a safety record which is absolutely appalling when compared with that of the nuclear industry. Probably not as many as 14 deaths have occurred in the nuclear industry since it began. All the waste accumulated from throughout the world since the 1950s when nuclear power was developed would cover the Adelaide Oval to a depth of about one metre. What is the Opposition talking about? It just displays total ignorance. While the Opposition is denying job opportunities to people in South Australia and while it is denying people jobs by constant frustration and constant agitation by the left wing elements within the trade union movement, it asks what the Government is going to do to provide jobs. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> has illustrated, at Roxby Downs alone there would be 5,000 jobs. </para>

              <para>-I will tell the honourable senator when, if he will listen. After 15 September, when the government in South Australia is changed, a government that will be led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin</inline> and will not be harnessed and restricted by the stupid actions of a trades hall, we will see the jobs created at Roxby Downs. Within four years 5,000 jobs will be provided in that area alone. Let me give another example. At the Beverley deposits, in the vicinity of Lake Frome, there is a considerable amount of uranium. This could be developed within 18 months by a leaching process in which fluid is injected into the ore body- a process which has environmental appeal. The proposition alone would require $100m worth of steel. &#39;Where could that steel be prefabricated?&#39;, I ask the honourable senators from South Australia. The obvious answer is Whyalla. Yet the Opposition asks what the Government is doing about providing jobs for Whyalla. That is what we want to do. The Opposition talks about uranium enrichment plants. </para>

          <para>I was interested in the ALP theme for the current election, namely, &#39;Follow a leader&#39;. The ALP has jingles and variations on this theme flooding the radio, television and other media throughout South Australia, in an attempt to brainwash the electorate into believing that the ALP is the best thing since sliced bread. The theme &#39;Follow a leader&#39; reminds me of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, who tootled his flute and led all the brown rats, the tawny rats, the grey rats and the little kids dancing and singing over the cliff into the sea. I suggest that, the people having heard the non-policy, the unemployment policy of the Labor Party, that is precisely what will happen in South Australia.

            <para>- I must admit that I really did believe that the Government was quite serious in its endeavour to get before the chamber an urgency motion which was not connected with the South Australian election. If we wanted any evidence to the contrary, we have just had it in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> &#39;s speech. This motion has been brought on quite deliberately by Government senators from South Australia to somehow bring some credibility to, or improve the flagging support for their party in the forthcoming election in South Australia. It is perfectly obvious that it does not matter what a Federal member of parliament from South Australia does in this chamber in a debate on an urgency motion such as this as there is no way in which it could alter the course of the election on 15 September. The South Australian Labor Government will be returned with a larger majority than it has now and will thus be able to work much more effectively. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, I would like to speak to the urgency motion because it is a very important one. A number of the words used in the motion demand extremely careful scrutiny, both individually and collectively. For instance, reference is made to the moral obligation of Australia&#39;, which is coupled with &#39;commercial development&#39; and uranium&#39;. Therefore, honourable senators on this side of the chamber must decide whether Government senators are serious when they talk about our moral obligation to the commercial development of resources generally or only when they talk about the commercial development of uranium. I strongly suspect that the latter is the case. </para>
          <para>What we on this side of the House object to is the assertion, which seems constantly to come from the Government benches, that somehow this moral obligation embraces also the exploitation of our uranium mines. There are numerous ways in which the Government of this wealthy country could assist, in the words of the motion, &#39;an energy starved world&#39; to overcome some of its problems. We could do that if we had the courage, the guts perhaps, to spend much more and to devote much more of our physical resources to researching other forms of energy, such as solar power. </para>

              <para>- No, but we can export designs for the containment of solar energy, in case the honourable senator is not aware of that fact. I have obtained today, with the compliments of the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster),</inline> some very interesting documents from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. They are extremely interesting and all relate to solar energy, but they are all inconclusive because we have as yet done nothing more than write documents and undertake small amounts of research. Since I have only 15 minutes in which to speak to this motion, it will be extremely difficult for me to cover comprehensively all of the areas that I wish to cover. I say that we do have a moral obligation to the energy starved world, that we can assist it if only we have the courage to provide the CSIRO with sufficient funds and physical resources to enable it to conduct comprehensive research into those other energy areas. </para>

          <para>Let us for a moment consider what this debate is really all about. The urgency motion speaks also of the &#39;commercial development of its abundant resources including uranium&#39;. We have in this country ample supplies of a number of minerals. We have known gas, oil and coal reserves, yet there is in the motion nothing which indicates that we should be undertaking the commercial development of our abundant resources in those areas. The motion concentrates on uranium. We have heard already noises from the Premier in the north, in talking about the enrichment plant at Herveys Range. We have heard also noises from my own State of Western Australia, where the Premier has insisted that by 1990 there will be a nuclear energy station. However very few noises are being made about - </para>

            <para>Since 1 963 when the first mishap was reported there have been 32 accidents and incidents involving nuclear submarines up to October, 1976. &#34;The dangers of nuclear submarines are incisive with horrific consequences. There are no evacuation plans for cities whose ports are used by these ships. There only needs to be one accident or malfunctioning while a nuclear submarine is in port and the consequences would be disastrous.

              <para>- For some days now we have in this place been discussing, and asking questions about, the proposed sale by the Australian Government of the Ranger uranium mine. Unfortunately, Ministers are either unable or reluctant to talk about it. I want at the moment to refer to another uranium mine which is operating in Western Australia. I wonder whether the Ministers are even aware of its existence. I wonder whether in fact the Minister for Trade and Resources <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> is aware of the operation, and who owns it. I wonder whether the Minister for Science and the Environment is aware of it and whether an environmental impact study has been done. I wonder especially whether the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney),</inline> who is at the moment in charge of the House, has been made aware of it and of the possible effects on the Ngangganawili population around Wiluna. </para>

          <para>This little piece of paper came into my hands some days ago and relates to the Lake Way </para>
          <para class="block">Uranium Project, which is centred approximately 1,000 kilometres north-east of Perth and 10 kilometres east of Wiluna, close to the centre of Western Australia. The uranium deposits are found on the north-eastern shore of the lake within the boundaries of a large pastoral property called Millbillie, which is accessible from the main road heading east to the Gunbarrel Highway. The Yeelirrie deposit is roughly 100 kilometres to the south. This vast station, Millbillie is, surprisingly enough, owned by a large international company. It has been the headquarters for prospecting activities for the past four years, but those activities have lasted only during the four-month cool period each year- between May and September. </para>
          <para>The project is conducted by a three-way consortium and is being pushed forward by American interests. The partnership is led by the Wyoming Co. and Delhi International Oil Exploration Corporation. In line with Federal Government guidelines, the Australian content is being supplied by a sham Australian company, VAM Holdings. The United States interests stem from the giant parent company of Wyoming and Delhi- the Westinghouse Corporation- which builds and maintains nuclear reactors and nuclear armaments. It is estimated that mining operations could be ready to begin in two to three years. I repeat, I have not formally been made aware that this project was even in operation. I doubt whether any of the Ministers concerned have been made aware of it. If they have, I would be grateful if the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs would advise me of the stage the project has now reached. It appears that during the fourmonth period of activity each year some 1 5 or 20 people are employed in various facets of development. They include drillers, surveyors, ore analysts and radioactivity experts. Most are Australians but the key position is held by an American who is answerable to his bosses in the United States. As I have said, this debate is not really an urgency motion about the moral obligations of Australia, as an energy rich country in an energy starved world, to undertake commercial development of its abundant resources including uranium. It is purely and simply about the mining of uranium and the South Australian elections on 15 September. </para>
          <para>Not so very long ago the Minister for Science and the Environment said, as did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> a little while ago, that there had not been a death in the nuclear energy industry. </para>

If he is still not satisfied I ask him to come back to me and I will then talk to him about the Nugget file, which contains excerpts from the United States Government&#39;s special internal file on nuclear power plant accidents and safety defects, as obtained in January 1979 by the Union of Concerned Scientists under the Freedom of Information Act of that country. Let us hear what these people have to say about nuclear energy and nuclear energy stations. The Nugget file was uncovered. It had to be uncovered because this fellow in charge of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was hiding facts, not only from the people in the United States but also from the world, as to what really was happening. That union of scientists had this to say: </para>

The Nugget File is a collection of short reports, averaging perhaps 2-3 pages in length, about a wide variety of astonishing safety deficiencies at U.S. nuclear power plants.

          <para class="block">Whether an accident happens by human error or whether it happens by technological fault is not important. The point is that it does happen. It can endanger an awful lot of lives. We are not opposed to the development of nuclear energy if we can be satisfied that the working conditions of the people who are going to mine the product are safeguarded. We are not against the mining of uranium if we can establish that there is not going to be any harm to the environment or to the people who are in the immediate surrounds. We are not against the mining of uranium if we can be satisfied that there is some safe way in which to dispose of the waste. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> that that is something that nuclear scientists are still arguing about throughout the world. I have no doubt that they would be extremely grateful to receive his contribution. I doubt that it would help them very much. If he feels that he can fulfil that obligation in some way, I ask him to make his contribution to them. If we saw that we had a moral obligation to an energy starved world, to provide them with the necessary uranium, I would be quite happy for us to do so if all those obligations were fulfilled. There is no known way at the moment that we can say that nuclear energy is safe and that the mining of uranium is safe. Until such time as we can say that, it is pointless honourable senators opposite bringing on for debate an urgency motion, taking up the time of the Senate on a broadcast day for the specific purpose of publicising the South Australian elections to be held on 15 September, and then saying that it is the moral obligation of Australia as an energy rich country in an energy starved world to undertake commercial development of its abundant resources, including uranium. As I said before, this urgency motion is based purely and simply on the South Australian elections and the Government&#39;s endeavours to have further commercial development of uranium in this country. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline></para>

          <para class="block">One cannot restrict such a debate entirely to uranium because very many resources in Australia are being mined now. I should say that at this stage those resources are being mined to a greater extent. Australia is a very lucky country. It has mineral and pastoral wealth. Its wealth more than compares with that of most countries of the world, despite the fact that we have a small population. Surely that factor alone warrants, at this stage of the world&#39;s growth and population, that we should share the abundance of this wealth that we have about us. It is all very well for some to say that because we have this abundance of wealth we should not export it. </para>
          <para>A few years ago we were in the utmost trouble because of our operational, management and handling costs. This was at a time when under Labor inflation rose to 18 per cent. What happened then was that Australia&#39;s resources were out-priced on the world market. Thank goodness that in the last few years we have come back to taws- to an inflation rate of some 9 per centand that there are ready markets overseas for the abundance of energy resources that we have in Australia. There are very many reasons why we should export overseas. I would like to indicate Australia&#39;s uranium policy. I think that the people should know this. Australia&#39;s uranium policy was announced on 25 August 1977. After exhaustive consideration of all the issues, the Government decided that there should be further development of uranium under strictly controlled conditions.

The Prime Minister went on to say that government approval for the development to proceed had been given to the Ranger, Nabarlek and Yeelirrie uranium projects. The situation is that Australia&#39;s known uranium resources at the moment represent some 18 per cent to 20 per cent of the world &#39;s resources.

But would she like to go to the Philippines, as I have, and see the people there living in the open without comfort or any source of power? Would she laugh then? It is all very well for the honourable senator to laugh. Let her go to the Third World countries- to the poor countries- which are short of power. She speaks so much about human dignity and humanity. I have a table which indicates that nuclear power reactors exist in Iron Curtain countries. The point I make is that nuclear power reactors are a part of life in the world today; they are required for the good living and welfare of the very many nations.

              <para>- I refer briefly to the development of uranium mining in Australia. The first uranium was mined at Uranium Hill in South Australia and treated at Port Pirie. In the Northern Territory it was mined at Moline and at Rum Jungle. In those days a number of people worked in the uranium mines. I know most of those who worked at Rum Jungle and Moline and who are still in the Territory today. I see no effects on them whatsoever. They also remark on that fact. There is far too much made of the illness that can be contracted through uranium mining. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> has said, I was in Hungary with him last year and we went to a mining area where uranium was being mined at a depth of approximately 6,000 feet to 7,000 feet. We spoke at length to the Minister for energy in that country which, of course, is behind the Iron Curtain. He asked what on earth was the matter and what was wrong with the people in Australia that they were not mining uranium. He said that in mining uranium in Hungary to a depth of 6,000 feet to 7,000 feet there had not been one casualty. Honourable senators can disagree with that if they wish, but that is what the </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Minister had to say. He made a comparison with the mining of coal where there had been many injuries. </para>
          <para>In regard to the situation in South Australia, it has been well proved that Roxby Downs would require an initial investment of at least $ 1 ,000m and would create further investment and employment opportunities in many other areas. It is estimated that if Roxby Downs were developed, approximately 1,700 people would be employed. The establishment of a uranium enrichment plant would bring even greater benefits to South Australia. The estimated cost of such a project is put at $2,000m. There is a general requirement overseas for Australian uranium. I see no reason why South Australia should not participate. It is in a poor economic situation and needs a considerable boost. Projects such as these would assist that State. A survey on industrial investment conducted by the Commonwealth Department of Industry and Commerce in April 1 979 showed that the level of investment in South Australia was a dismal $255m. In contrast, $ 1,750m has been committed to investment projects in Victoria, $ 1,865m in New South Wales, $2, 438m in Queensland and an enormous $5, 389m in Western Australia. Those figures speak for themselves. </para>
          <para>I turn to the Northern Territory. Despite the knockers, both in and out of the Territoryprincipally out of it- uranium is making a tremendous difference to that part of Australia. No matter where one goes in the Northern Territory one will find that the Territory is moving ahead very rapidly. Of course, this is not only because of the development of uranium. One need look only at the economy of Darwin and at the building up of Jabiru. Despite what the figures show about high unemployment, at Jabiru literally hundreds of men are being employed and there are not sufficient men in Darwin to match the labour requirement in the development of Jabiru. There are jobs to spare, and people come from the south to find work. An effect of the development of uranium mining is increased employment. That will bring about the development of the north of Australia and it will also lead to an increase in the population of the area. </para>
          <para>One thing has to be remembered about the future. It cannot be denied that Australia has the right, the necessity and the moral requirement to provide energy to other countries, but one can also see the richness and prosperity that will come to Australia. It has been said, and will be proved, that the present deposits of uranium in Australia now measure up to the black oil of the Arab countries. With the prosperity that will come about through the exporting of uranium- a prosperity similar to that given to the Middle East countries by oil- Australia can look forward to having an influence similar to that which the Arab nations have in the world today. Despite the knocking of many people, I expect uranium mining will bring prosperity to the people of Australia, and it will allow Australia to assist the underdeveloped nations. I support the motion. I believe it is a very good motion and it should receive the support of all honourable senators. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Kilgariff</inline>often contributes well to debates within this chamber.  His  contribution today was good but it is unfortunate that he was dragged into this political scandal of trying to rescue a hopeless minority in the South Australian Parliament when it faces the elections on 1 5 September. It is a minority that joined with the majority for the purpose of saying that there should be no mining of uranium in South Australia. I can agree with everything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> has said. There are employment opportunities and there is an energy need for many countries. Roxby Downs could have the biggest mine in the world. However, the Australian Labor Party&#39;s policy is that we will not mine uranium until we are assured of the safeguards, and that there is no danger. Do people think of humanity when they say that it should be mined without the safeguards? That is the whole matter. </para>

              <para>- Australia must examine the safeguards it wants. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> is reciprocating as a result of my praise of his contribution, but he agrees with me that there must be safeguards. Injuries as a result of uranium mining appear long after the people have been in contact with the environment which causes those effects, unless there is an explosion or an overdose of uranium radioactivity. South Australia has the longest history of uranium mining in Australia. The first uranium discovered in Australia was found at Radium Hill by A. J. Smith in 1 906. In 1 920 a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr W.</inline> D. Greenwood found at Mount Painter in South Australia a yellow-green mineral which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Mawson identified as uranium. Therefore, the first uranium was discovered in South Australia. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We commenced to mine at Radium Hill in 1 95 1 . It was a low grade ore which yielded 2 lb to the ton and we treated it at Port Pirie. This mine closed in 1960. Therefore, for nine years we mined uranium there although at Mount Painter we had mined some uranium during the war years for the British atomic bomb experiments. We developed a low grade ore for only nine years. In 1 960 we dismantled the mine. The Minister for Health in South Australia has established an inquiry by his Department as a result of the effects on those who worked at Radium Hill in South Australia. Although the report is not yet finalised and has not been released it has definitely proved that since 1960- a matter of only 19 years- 59 per cent of those who worked underground at Radium Hill over a period of at least two years died of cancer. It is not a complete report, but it shows that deaths as a result of cancer were four and a half times the Australian average. They are figures from South Australia where 19 years has elapsed since we mined uranium. </para>
          <para>On the television program <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> or the program <inline font-style="italic">Nationwide</inline> there was a report concerning 12 boilermakers who, after the Radium Hill mine had been closed, were employed at Thebarton by the Mines Department in dismantling machinery, cleaning it up and doing any necessary maintenance and repairs. The person who made the investigation did not know what happened to all 12 of the men but he knows for certain- he supplied names, the dates they died or where they were treated- that eight out of the 12 have cancer, or had had it, somewhere in the body. Is this not enough proof to show that we must ensure that there are greater safeguards? I do not know whether any honourable senator has seen a death from cancer, but if I hear of anyone who has cancer my reaction is to say: &#39;I hope they do not last long&#39;. Not only does it kill, it kills over a long period with all the agonies imaginable. </para>
          <para>There is a great possibility that the people who work at Rum Jungle and the other areas in the Northern Territory will not know for 20 years the dangers which are there. Yet we have had introduced here an insulting urgency motion which is not concerned for the welfare of the people of Australia; it is concerned with an obligation to engage in commercial development. We would sell our souls for a dollar! In 1 977 the party to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> belongs was prepared to support a motion in the State Parliament that we should not mine uranium. He was agreeable to that when there was no election being held. Because an election is to be held now this specimen of humanity comes along here without consideration for anything but winning a few votes for a motley crew of politicians so as to save their jobs in South Australia. That is the whole purpose of raising this matter. </para>
          <para>If we want more verification we must remember that the mining industry, in a big way, is trying to get mining started at Roxby Downs. In the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of Wednesday, 17 January- the morning newspaper in South Australia- there was a full page advertisement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr N.</inline> C. Shierlaw who will be known by those who had an interest in Poseidon as a man who became a multi-millionaire overnight. He took a full page to tell us the reasons why we should be mining uranium and how we could overcome all the dangers. I think it is important to note that he is not a source that honourable senators may have some suspicion or doubt about. He is one of the greatest mineral exploiters in Australia and he is advocating mining at Roxby Downs. He stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As a mining engineer, I Tully appreciate the other hazards associated with the mining, treatment and enrichment of uranium just as our Premier does and I believe he and his Party is protecting the public, particularly all union members who could be employed in the production of uranium in South Australia until he is satisfied that all safety precautions are complied with. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Is the fact that a man is insisting on some safety provisions a reason to vote against him in an election? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Shierlaw</inline> went on: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We are well aware of the Fox Reports covering the Ranger Uranium Environment Inquiry. All parts of the mine and mill complex will be potential sources, to a greater or lesser extent, of radiation exposure if the Roxby Downs project proceeds. The undisturbed ore contains uranium together with its decay products, thorium, radium, radon and the short lived radon decay products. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is no greater poison. He stated further that adequate underground ventilation, as well as controlled dust collection in the mill, may do something about the problem. He went on to state: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Evidence has been given that the average whole body dose from external radiation actually received by uranium miners overseas is about one tenth of the recommended maximum.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I say that the evidence is coming out only now. The basis of this question is: Do you support on this occasion a government that will not mine uranium, no matter how many dollars are in it, until such time as we have that assurance? </para>

              <para>- These men, some of whom are now dead, are telling tales. There is danger. The inhuman and unchristian people who speak in this place to gain votes take the attitude that they do not care whether 5,000 people, or 10,000 people, or however many will be employed at Roxby Downs, will suffer the lingering death of painful cancer and that men are easily replaced. What they are concerned about is the dollar. Then they put before this Senate a statement expressing the view that the Senate is so heartless that it is concerned about a dollar, and a dollar only. Surely we have passed the stage when we have no sympathy for mankind. Surely we are not so devoid of Christian principles and of concern for humanity that we adopt that attitude. </para>

          <para>A small amount of radioactive material was buried at Maralinga in South Australia because that area was a testing ground for the British. Because that radioactive material could have been dug up by terrorists or terrorist organisations and used to make a bomb, this Government assisted the South Australian Government in having it removed from Australia and letting England accept its responsibilities. There we saw the Government recognising the potential dangers of radioactive material. Yet the Government parties do not rely on the issue of uranium to fight an election; they rely on other issues which would be less likely to lose them an election. The Commissioners of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry outlined in the Fox report their finding that a terrorist group could use reactor grade plutonium to make a bomb which would have good prospects of yielding several hundred tonnes of TNT. They claimed that the mere possession of nuclear material, coupled with the threat or presence of bomb construction, could suffice to produce the effect desired by terrorists. </para>
          <para>Roxby Downs will be mined, regardless of whether a ban is imposed on uranium. Roxby Downs is potentially one of the wealthiest mines in the world. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young&#39;s</inline> figures, it would yield 10 million tonnes of copper. My figures are a little higher. An assessment of the values per tonne in the ground is: Copper, $80; uranium, $20; gold, $45; and rare earth, $15. There are only 300,000 tonnes of uranium at Roxby Downs. So Roxby Downs is a copper mine. British Petroleum knew its value as a copper mine if it was not permitted to mine uranium or if it had to stockpile the uranium and not make full use of its investment. It knew that without the need to be told a story by Des Corcoran and for him not to tell the other members of his Cabinet about the matter. The mine is a profitable investment. Concern for human lives is the reason that uranium will not be mined for the purpose of sale. If it is mined, it will be stockpiled. The motion before the Senate should be defeated. It should be condemned as a sham. It is a disgrace that it was moved in this Senate. </para>

            <para>- This is one of the most cynical political exercises I have experienced in my 17 years in the Parliament. When I read the reference on the Notice Paper to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young&#39;s</inline> motion, I was under the illusion that we would talk about the moral obligations of Australia. What we have done has been to engage, in the debate on that motion, in a most petty exercise in an attempt to win a few cheap votes. The most serious issue facing the human race is under debate. This debate has been about the development of Roxby Downs. It has not been about uranium per se or moral obligations. I support the remarks on this subject of other speakers on this side of the House. The Australian Democrats will not have a bar of stockpiling uranium at Roxby Downs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> just said, ore can be processed in such a way as to extract copper without extracting uranium. That has been done for many many years in Chile. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> that he look at the Chilean experience. Roxby Downs could go ahead producing copper but not uranium but if the uranium were extracted and stockpiled the pressure to sell it overseas, both economically and politically, would be irresistable. Stockpiling is the thin end of the wedge for exporting and, as such, we totally oppose it. </para>
          <para>I return to the matter of moral obligations, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> mentioned in his motion but did not seem to address his speech to. I remind honourable senators of what was said by a very distinguished former South Australian, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Oliphant, who to my knowledge has not yet been accused of being a communist. As far as I am concerned he is one of the greatest Australians of all time. Not too long ago he said that there is only a 50 per cent chance of mankind reaching the end of this century because of the risk of a nuclear holocaust occurring. I would have thought that that question was a component of moral obligation. We have a moral obligation to consider future generations whenever we are taking decisions that could destroy the planet and everything that lives on it. Another famous Australian to comment on this matter- I am not conscious of his having been accused by the Liberal Party of Australia of being a communist- is Professor <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Macfarlane Burnet. He pointed out the grave risks of using radioactive substances for nuclear energy and advocated the use of alternative safer resources. </para>
          <para>I mention another person who pointed to the moral obligations. He is a man whose mind I respect as much as that of any person now living. I refer to Arthur Koestler. Again, I do not think that he has been accused of being a communist. He wrote probably the most devastating expose of communism that has ever been written in his classic book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Darkness at Noon.</inline> He stated that, because man&#39;s emotional development has not matched his technological progress, man&#39;s self-induced extinction on this planet now becomes almost a statistical certainty. If we are talking about moral obligations of Australians, I would have thought that I, as a person living today, have a moral obligation to the children and grandchildren who will follow all of us in this nation to consider them before putting the planet at risk. What sort of emotions was Koestler talking about when he said that our technological progress has outmatched the ability of our emotions to cope with them? He was talking about greed, money, hate and power. I would have thought that those emotions were relevant when talking about moral obligations. </para>
          <para>Let us look at some examples of what uranium has done to change people&#39;s emotions in those areas. Let me take the Philippines as an example. It is probably the most corrupt nation in the south-west Pacific and we are selling our uranium to it. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peacock,</inline> tells us that we can trust  President  Marcos and the Philippines Government. They can be trusted on one thing, that is, to win elections. They have a rather cute way of ensuring a win at a democratic election: They lock up all their political opponents during the election campaign. On 3 May 1979, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mason</inline> directed a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> about the reactor in the Philippines being sited in a notoriously active earthquake zone close to five active volcanos. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mason</inline> spoke of concrete of inadequate strength being used in its construction and asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> whether he could advise him on the matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> gave an official answer for the Minister responsible for the issue. I wonder where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young&#39;s</inline> sense of moral obligation fits in with that answer. It is our uranium which is going to the Philippines. Where is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young&#39;s</inline> moral obligation to the men, women and children of the Philippines who live in the shadow of that reactor which has been built near a volcano in a geophysical site? The Minister concluded his answer by saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It seems reasonable to assume that in these cases it has proved possible to meet the concerns of the local authorities, which are responsible for safety and environmental requirements. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Talking about morality, that simply means that we in Australia do not give a damn what the Philippines do with our uranium or where it builds its reactors or what the consequences are for the people of the Philippines; that is their responsibility, not ours. Yet the motion refers to moral obligations. </para>
          <para>I turn to the situation in Pakistan. It is about to explode the Islamic bomb. Pakistan&#39;s closest ally is one of the most insidious maniacs in the world, Colonel Gaddafi, who outdistances even the Ayatollah Khomeini for sheer lunacy and an obsession about cutting off hands and killing people at firing squads. Yet we are putting a bomb made from our uranium into that source. Pakistan acquired every bit of its uranium through peaceful agreements. Yet we talk about moral obligations. I thought that this Government had a distinct distrust and dislike for the Soviet Union. </para>
          <para class="block">We have heard statements to that effect in the past. Yet the first or second nuclear agreement we signed for the sale of our uranium was with Finland, which is openly sending its material, our uranium, to the Soviet Union. To do what? Is the purpose to fuel reactors for peaceful purposes? </para>
          <para>I believe, the Democrats believe, that going to nuclear power and exporting our uranium is the ultimate insanity. Uranium will provide only some 1 5 per cent of the world &#39;s energy needs for 30 years; it will leave a legacy for future generations for 500,000 years, a time span my finite mind cannot embrace. Yet we do nothing about seeking alternative sources. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> had moved a motion today to the effect that Australia had a moral obligation to future generations not to go after the ultimate insanity in uranium but to seek alternative fuels for the energy crisis which will hit our young in the mid-1980s, I would have thought it would serve the Senate better. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill provides for an amendment to the National Health Act to increase the general patient contribution for pharmaceutical benefits, as announced by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> in his Budget Speech. I draw honourable senators&#39; attention to clause 3 which will increase from $2.50 to $2.75 the maximum amount that approved pharmaceutical chemists may charge for the supply of a pharmaceutical benefit under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This increase will take effect from 1 September 1979. </para>
          <para>As in the past, pensioners holding a pensioner health benefits card will not be charged for pharmaceutical benefits. Similarly no charge will be made for repatriation pensioners. It is now just over a year since the patient contribution was set at $2.50 and this increase of 25c is broadly in line with the movements in prices and incomes since then. Increasing the patient contribution is one of the means by which the Government can curtail the increasing expenditure on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This small increase is expected to result in a saving of $5.1m for the Government in the financial year 1979-80. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- At the presentation of each annual Budget by a Federal Government, it would be the normal expectation of most members of the community that a basic objective of each Budget would be to correct those trends in the economy which are working against the interests of the majority of the community. It would be reasonable to assume that in drawing up a Budget, the Government would take into account objectives which it claims that it wants to achieve, but which obviously are not being achieved, and having identified them, take the necessary corrective action. Unemployment is an immediate example which comes to mind. It seems inconceivable that any government, just for plain economic reasons- let alone moral reasons- would stand by in a period of increasing unemploment which is predominantly made up of young people, could disregard the situation in its annual Budget, and take no action to correct it. Yet this is precisely what is happening. It would be idle to suggest that any one budget could overcome the endemic unemployment problem from which this country is now suffering, but to say that nothing can be done and in fact to take no action to see that something is done must leave the majority of Australians wondering what manner of government we have in Australia at present. That in itself is reprehensible enough, but for a government under such conditions to declare policies, knowingly and openly, for the next 12 months which will worsen unemployment surely borders on disbelief. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>No one would argue the proposition that the doubling of unemployment in the last three years has been quite deliberate as a means to achieve the Governments stated prime objective of reducing inflation. This statement can be made in complete fairness because for three years we have witnessed no attempts by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fraser)</inline> to reverse the unemployment trend. It appeared for a short time that he could claim that by deliberately creating unemployment he was able to arrest inflation. Indeed, in the last Budget he said that the Government expected inflation to be down to 5 per cent by mid- 1979. But mid- 1979 has now come and gone. We find inflation at double the rate that he had claimed as his objective, and this Budget predicts that inflation will go higher this financial year. So we have wound up with the worst of both worlds. Unemployment is double and inflation is double the predictions. Just on the basis of this one example, can it not be justifiably claimed that either we are dealing with a man who simply does not understand what he is doing to the Australian community, or alternatively, if he does, he is incapable of rectifying it? I would suggest it is a mixture of both. </para>
          <para>Let us take another example. How can a person who is a millionaire several times over say to another person earning $ 1 SO or $ 1 60 a week that we must further depress the purchasing power of his wage or salary? Just in case anyone believes that that is not what the Prime Minister is saying, we only have to look at page 49 of Budget Paper </para>
          <para class="block">No. 1 which states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Because of the implications for activity and employment of the real wage/productivity imbalance, the Government in national wage case hearings before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has consistently advocated the awarding of less than full indexation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So let there be no misunderstanding of what we have seen and what has been happening and what will continue to happen. Wage and salary earners throughout Australia- I ask honourable senators to bear in mind that 70 per cent of them earn less than average weekly earnings- will experience a year in which their pay increases will not keep up with the cost of living, and that is a deliberate stated policy of the Fraser Government. The Budget Paper goes on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A partial indexation approach, it has been argued, not only helps to constrain real wage levels but also lowers the general inflation rate and thus assists in strengthening activity and real national income. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So there we have it spelt out in a little more detail. The Government will continue to press for partial indexation, that is, only permitting wages and salaries to increase at a rate below the cost of living, and, as it says, will constrain real wage levels. It then goes on to state: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Despite the experience of the past twelve months, that by reducing real wage levels, we will be able to lower the general inflation rate. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is patently a contradiction. Real wage and salary levels, as everyone knows and as the Government has been proud to proclaim as some sort of achievement, have been depressed over the past two years, but inflation remains at twice the level of what the Government had planned for. Surely this demonstrates in the simplest and clearest terms another major failure in its economic policy. </para>
          <para>We have listened to these arguments from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> now for <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> years and, despite the fact that they have been demonstrated to fail, exactly the same thinking has been pursued in this Budget and it will have exactly the same results: Declining purchasing power by everyone in the community; higher unemployment; and, as has now been revealed by the Australian Taxpayers&#39; Association, higher taxation for everyone- a combination of the three least desired factors in any economy. Again we saw a repetition of the full story not being revealed in the Budget Speech. The truth of what was really in the Budget had to be extracted by the Opposition and the media. When the truth was revealed the initial reactions of a fair budget, a soft budget, a tax reducing budget, were shown to be totally false impressions and very quickly the media got the message. I draw attention in particular to the unanswerable tax scales that were produced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eric</inline> Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association the following day. When the media finally got the story, Sydney papers such as the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror,</inline> which are not known to be particularly allied to the Labor Party&#39;s cause, ran headlines with such words as these: &#39;Tax sting- you will pay more&#39; and &#39;Tax row on Budget&#39;. These headlines were followed by most newspapers expressing the view that Australian wage and salary earners will be paying more this financial year. All this was in contradiction to the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> had tried to give. While the Prime Minister and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> protest loudly that this will not be the case, the headlines express the significant perception of the Australian community and that is that most Australian taxpayers will be paying more tax. </para>
          <para>People are no longer prepared to believe the Prime Minister- that is a well-known fact. With the prediction of inflation at over 10 per cent and wage and salary increases of only nine per cent, and even with the partial lifting of the surcharge, everyone is able to see that this Government is tax harvesting- a process which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> so roundly condemned when he was in opposition. He said that it was &#39;an excellent opportunity to re-think and develop positive and progressive policies &#39;. Those were his words. </para>
          <para>Perhaps it might be useful if we recall the figures which are involved. The total receipts in the last Labor Budget were $15.3 billion; in the Fraser Budget they were $26.3 billion. It also shows that contrary to its assertions that it is against big government, the Fraser Government is proving not only to be the highest tax government, but also is proving to be the biggest government in Australia &#39;s federal history. There is no doubt that I will be accused there of misrepresentation. So, to avoid that accusation, I will quote from a document prepared by David Block and Associates, financial consultants in Sydney. I suppose that the company is one of the most highly regarded in Sydney business circles. I suggest that Government members have a look at the paper prepared by the firm&#39;s principal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Block,</inline> entitled &#39;Preliminary views on the Budget&#39;. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To finance the projected growth in expenditures and a significant reduction in its deficit, the Government has budgeted from an increase of 16.3 per cent in taxation revenue. Indirect taxes are estimated to increase by 1 7.2 per cent to $8.6 billion, accounting for 3 1.7 per cent of total revenue. Individual income tax payments are budgeted to rise by 18.2 per cent to $ 1 5.2 billion. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Block</inline>appropriately comments: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The increased taxation revenue flowing from this Budget and the mini Budget will add to already rising inflationary pressures and restrain private sector growth. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That comment is by a senior member of the Sydney business community about this allegedly free enterprise government. This is exactly the opposite to the Government&#39;s intentions and the community&#39;s expectations. This is not a case of the Prime Minister&#39;s raising expectations excessively; it is a case of creating false expectations. The Block document then makes what I regard as the most significant point. Government senators would do well to listen to it because already it has been picked by the National Farmers&#39; Federation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Block</inline> says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The public sector has expanded relative to the economy as a whole under the present Government, accounting for over 38 per cent of gross domestic product compared with an average of less than 34 per cent under the Labor Government. </para>

          <para class="block">The National Farmers&#39; Federation was more to the point when it said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It has been overlooked that, despite the Government&#39;s efforts, the size of the Government sector ... is higher now than in 1978, 1977, 1976 or at any time during the Whitlam Government. This is not &#39;smaller government&#39; that the present Government has sought and which farmers support. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those figures should be emphasised, as should the conclusion that the Fraser Government is not for small government but has effectively installed the biggest government in our history. This is the fourth Budget and the fourth occasion on which it has managed to fail to convince people that it is promoting genuine tax reforms. This is the fourth occasion on which it is clear that the Government has not done its homework. On the first occasion, in 1976, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Treasury could not do their sums; the arithmetic was all wrong. On the second occasion the figures were, to use the expression of the then Treasurer, &#39;rubbery&#39;. Now, on the fourth occasion the public perception is that the Fraser Government is a high tax government. </para>
          <para>It is significant that on all of those four occasions tax reform has been allegedly a basic component of budgetary policy but the electorate has failed to be convinced. If the Government really believes that it is for small government and that it must introduce stage 2 of the new federalism policy and force the States to raise their own income tax, then it should say so, because all it is doing at the moment is fudging economic policy and, as a consequence, making a mess of economic management. The Treasurer estimates that inflation will be running at over 10 per cent for the financial year. I suggest that even without pressures for increases in money wages the rate of inflation will exceed that amount, and by the end of next year it could well be at 12 per cent. Food prices for the month of July have already shown increases. There will probably be increases in the price of crude oil and, because of the Government&#39;s crude oil pricing policy, the price of petrol will rise substantially by the end of next year. Any economic policy maker would be deluding himself if he did not take more notice of exchange rate fluctuations. </para>
          <para>While the Prime Minister has been quick to claim that the capital inflow has increased, he has failed on two counts to be completely honest with the electorate: Firstly, he has not clearly stated in the Budget Papers or elsewhere that since it came to power the Fraser Government has borrowed nearly $5,000m overseas, and all for the purpose of propping up the Australian dollar. Secondly if the Prime Minister really believes that he has to smarten himself up, then he should explain to the Australian people that most of the inflation of the last six months, and certainly the inflation of the next 12 months, will result from Government initiated actions. Commodity price increases and wages demands in excess of indexation will be aggravating factors, but they will not be the cardinal factors. It is convenient for both the Prime Minister and his colleague, the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman),</inline> to blame the member countries of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for the oil price rises. They have within their means the power to moderate the effects of increases in oil prices. If the recent price rises are examined, it becomes clear that those OPEC prices have risen at a slower rate than the general rate of inflation in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries over the same period. </para>
          <para>The major factors contributing to inflationary effects have been the rapacious governments which have seen this as a means of milking millions of dollars from the motorists and the oil companies which have used the spot market to push the oil prices higher. Since 1 974, the price of crude oil has increased at an average annual rate of 1 1 per cent. That is about the same as the inflation rate for the OECD countries over the same period. But the dates on which the rises occurred lagged behind the announcements of significant increases in inflation rates in the major industrialised countries. The fact that the crude oil levy is expected to provide the Fraser Government with over $2,000m this year shows what a profitable source of revenue oil has been and will be. It is easy to rely on the crude oil levy for making up for being big government. But, in so doing, the Fraser Government has locked all future governments into this source of revenue raising and, apart from prescribing a particular method of raising taxes, has restricted the flexibility of fuel pricing policy. While the Government continues to harvest inflation and raises very substantial sums through the crude oil levy, it has failed on another three counts: Firstly, it has failed to act positively to solve the very serious problem of unemployment. Secondly, it has failed to stimulate economic growth. As the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research in the University of Melbourne has forecast, 1979-80 will be a very tough year. Thirdly, it is still attempting to force the States into raising State income tax. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer hardly mentioned unemployment in his Budget Speech. The Government has done its best to disguise the issue by publishing only the figures which would paint the best picture, and then making it more and more difficult to find out the number of people who are being paid unemployment benefits. With unemployment a serious problem, one would have expected some measures to offset at least the immediate effects. Instead, the work training programs are cut back by $27m, and the Treasurer stated at the National Press Club last Wednesday that the cut-backs were made because the programs were not cost effective. Perhaps any program introduced by the Fraser Government has to show some immediate electoral advantage to become cost effective. If this is the Government&#39;s approach, it is an extremely cynical one. The Government has tried to sell the idea that, by providing incentives to business and reining in inflation, economic growth will follow. This is at least a return to the original thesis of 1975 in which we-- </para>

              <para>- I suggest that the honourable senator should remember. She has been here long enough. We were to have a consumerled recovery; then we were to have an investment-led recovery; and then we were to have an export-led recovery. All the time, every year, we have listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> saying &#39;We are going to have some form of recovery this year&#39;, and in not one year has he succeeded- and he will not succeed this year. Nothing has eventuated, and Australians would be excused for thinking that nothing will happen on this occasion either. These policies deliberately breed stagnation. There is no real incentive for manufacturers to produce more, because there is no additional market for what they produce. Under these conditions, there is no real prospect of the unemployed in this country obtaining work, unless there is a change in the attitude of the Government. </para>

It is excellent to hear honourable senators on the Government side speak up in support of State income tax. In the last State elections every Liberal in the States said that they did not want anything to do with a State income tax; that it was being forced on them by the Fraser Government. It is no wonder that the Liberals have problems all over the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>The fact that the Government chose to devote a special section of the Budget Speech to measures for Tasmania indicates that it realises that its stocks in that State have hit rock bottom. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> will agree with me on that. It is commonplace, of course, for the present Government to conduct things by sleight of hand. For example, the native forest assistance which was allegedly announced in the Budget was actually announced last year, and the Bill for the completion of the agreement with the Tasmanian Government was introduced into the Parliament during the last sittings. The contribution of $ lm for the construction of the second bridge over the Derwent River is the result of the Tasmanian Government&#39;s and, I hope, my pinning the Government down to make a commitment to fully fund the second bridge. Had the matter not been pressed, we would never have got that commitment, and Government senators know it. The only reason we finally have got it is that the seats of Franklin and Denison are under threat. We waited for three years to get that commitment, which was given by the Labor Government in 1975. It was given just like that. There were no arguments. We said that we would do it. But Malcolm Fraser has waited three and a half years to give that commitment and he would not have given it if he thought for one moment that his electoral stocks in Tasmania were okay. </para>
          <para>Let me compare the total payments to Tasmania with those to the other States. In this Budget the average increase in total payments to all the States was 6.6 per cent. Tasmania will receive a 6 per cent increase. When she speaks, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> can explain to us why that is so. This slug does not end with the lower growth in the payments to the States. Tasmania, of course, has just had an increase in air navigation charges, which will lead to higher air fares. </para>

              <para>-I am sorry, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator, I</inline> have finished my comments in that respect. The Budget offers no hope to the unemployed and very little hope for the maintenance of a reasonable level of economic growth. It offers a real prospect of higher interest rates and a return to pressures for higher money wages in an attempt to maintain real incomes. If nothing else, this Budget puts to bed the myth that the Fraser Government is a low tax, small government party. It is not. It is a high tax, big government party which spreads, very thinly and most unevenly, any benefits that should be available from the massive revenues that are available to it. One would have assumed that, in the current uncertainty and depressed state of the economy, this year&#39;s Budget would have faced up to the task of rescuing the Australian economy from deepening recession. One finds little pleasure in having to say so many of the things that I have said, but they must be said because Australia cannot continue along the path chosen by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser.</inline> The position will be worse at this time next year. Overseas factors will have caught up with us by then. This Government appears to have no idea of how to meet that eventuality. </para>

            <para>- Having just listened to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt),</inline> one would think that he was not a member of a government that caused the greatest inflation that this country has known. One would be excused for thinking that he had no understanding of the central theme of the Government&#39;s policy since taking office in 1975, that is, to make an absolutely uncompromising attack on the inflation that had been caused by the government of which the Leader of the Opposition was a member. If we are to talk about inflation- and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> chose to do so- we should not forget that in June 1 975 the rate of inflation was as high as 1 7 per cent. When we took office it was 1 4 per cent. In June of this year it was running at about 8.8 per cent, which was below the average for all the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Priority has been given by this Budget, and by the Government since it has come into office, to the attack on inflation so that we shall be able to achieve the things that this country is capable of achieving. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> quoted everybody to whom he could lay claim to suit the purposes of his speech. He has quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eric</inline> Risstrom, the National Farmers Federation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Block</inline> and everyone else. I notice that he did not quote from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> &#39;s speech last night on the Budget. I wish to say something about that speech because if there is to be a response to a Budget one could claim that it should take the form of an alternative Budget. It could certainly not be claimed that any alternative proposals which made any sense at all were presented in the speech on the Budget of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden.</inline> The Australian Labor Party has demonstrated that it has no specific proposals for restoring economic growth, creating permanent employment, reducing inflation or doing anything other than hitting the private sector with more taxation. That was the message in the speech of the leader of the Australian Labor Party last night. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline>did not quote for us the policies which emerged from the Adelaide conference of the Australian Labor Party, filled as they were with the dogma of the past, filled with the problems that we have experienced and indicating a return to the increased deficit which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> promised us that he would introduce. That is the sort of basis on which I would want to speak. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> described this Budget as representing an attack on the families of Australia. I want to put down some of the facts with regard to the policies of the Australian Labor Party and those of the present Government and to ask the people of Australia whether there is any real ground for comparison between what has been achieved by this Government and what is threatened by the increased deficits and resulting inflation that will flow from some of the Opposition &#39;s policies if put into effect. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition spoke as if the 1979-80 Budget had not given priority to social security and social welfare programs. I wish to refute that statement and place on record briefly the fact that the income security programs of my Department- social welfare programs- will rise by about 10 per cent this year. Expenditure upon them will be almost $9,000m. Among the Budget features is the fact that most pensions and benefits will be indexed on a six-monthly basis and that income limits for fringe benefits will be increased to recognise the position of some who, through higher incomes, have not been able to avail themselves of those benefits. The Budget also provides for the extension of eligibility for pensioner health benefit cards to supporting parent beneficiaries. Also, additional funds are to be provided for aged persons&#39; accommodation, for handicapped persons and for senior citizen programs, all programs in which the people of Australia work closely with the Government to ensure that services are provided for those who need them. </para>

I wish to refer to the programs of the Government and to what can be achieved by the Australian peoplebecause it is a case of the Government using the funds of the Australian people- in providing these programs. Recognition ought to be accorded to the direct assistance that is given under pre-school services, childrens&#39; services, States grants and home care for aged people and the sort of help that can be given to voluntary agencies in working with the Government. Large figures could be quoted to show the improvement in services that has occurred over the three previous Budgets of this Government and that has been continued in this Budget. </para>

          <para>Let us turn now to what seemed to be a central theme of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> &#39;s speech. He described the Budget as anti-family. That seemed to me to be an extraordinary thesis to develop. If he were to look at what had been achieved by the Government through the use of the funds of the Australian people he would see that in four years we have increased our assistance to families from $34 1 m under the last Hayden Budget to $ 1,053m in this Budget. That represents a threefold increase over a four-year period. These figures reflect, of course, the changeover to the family allowance scheme, which was introduced in 1976 by the Fraser Government. Whatever people may say about that scheme I would think that the Australian Labor Party would have accorded recognition to the fact that it has brought to 300,000 families assistance that they have not previously enjoyed. The Australian Labor Party apparently has never liked the family allowance scheme. It has never liked the fact that it has had such universal acceptance by the people of Australia or that it was a social reform that it wished it had introduced. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline>in his reply to the Budget Speech, criticised the Government, as he has done on many other occasions, because these allowances have not been increased or indexed. I do not argue that they have. They stand at the level at which they were introduced in 1 976. However, I note that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> &#39;s alternative Budget of last year, wherein he made a detailed effort to show what he would introduce as a program, no account was taken of the requirement to index family allowances. One could hardly suggest that, in his speech last night, he made any commitment to increase family allowances. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> is on record as saying that the high cost of increasing payments to the 4.3 million children who are the subject of family allowances represents an inhibiting effect on any desire by the present Federal Government to increase them. He acknowledged that that would also apply to an Australian Labor Party government in times of economic difficulty. The sheer magnitude of the program, involving as it does the expenditure of $ 1,000m, shows the difficulties that confront one in considering indexation. It is sheer hypocrisy for the Australian Labor Party to make such statements and adopt such a posture concerning the non-indexation of family allowances by this Government in view of what is said in a paper that has been released by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> concerning an alternative to the present universal family allowances scheme. I shall quote some of the statements in that paper. It is a paper that calls for a reform of the family allowance scheme. The family allowance scheme provides for the payment of a universal family allowance to every child in Australia. It is an allowance that is universally paid. It is one that is not taxed. Therefore, every child in Australia receives the same benefit regardless of his family circumstances. I quote from page 2 of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes&#39;s</inline> paper. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Family Allowances, which replaced the old system of child endowment and taxation rebates for children, present a means whereby a start can be made to give a more equitable distribution of public monies to benefit those in need, while more basic changes in other areas are sorted out. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I do not know what that might mean- sorting out what? Is it a case of using a universal system to direct funds away from that universal payment? On page 3 of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes&#39;s</inline> paper under the heading: &#39; Reform of the System &#39; he states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The fact that the Family Allowances are paid at the same level to the most wealthy and poor families has been the subject of question and debate since they were introduced. The need to increase the level of payments has been obvious in the case of low income families. The fact that the affluent in the community would benefit unnecessarily from such an increase is an inhibiting factor in advocating increases. The high cost of increasing payments to 4.3 million children per year has an inhibiting effect on any desire by the present government to increase payments. It must be said that this may also apply to a Labor Government in times of economic difficulty. </para>

            <para>If it was considered desirable not to add to government spending, a reduction in the Family Allowance could pay for the increased supplement paid to lower income groups, e.g a reduction of $4 per month per child would have resulted in approximately $200,000,000 in 1 978. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Is that not an anti-family policy to the children of Australia who are receiving benefits under the universal family allowance scheme? Some comment was made with regard to income tax collections. I believe that that is one matter which has been ventilated a great deal over the past few days. I simply want to put on record this fact: Even after increasing taxes last year and for part of this year, the Liberal-National Country Party Government&#39;s personal income tax collections have increased on average by only 3. 1 per cent a year in real terms. This compares with 14.5 per cent a year under Labor in 1972 to 1975, and 6.2 per cent a year in the three years before the advent of the Labor Government. That is surely a record reduction- from 14.5 per cent a year to 3. 1 per cent a year. There should be no way in which that can be refuted. </para>
          <para>I am glad that I have had the opportunity to say something about the family allowance policy or proposals of the Australian Labor Party. To have a paper circulated with those sorts of proposals and to hear the comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> in his speech on the Budget last night on behalf of the Opposition with regard to indexation indicates, I think, that the Labor Party is being less than frank with the Australian people. There are 2 million people who receive these family allowances on behalf of 4.3 million children. When the Leader of the Opposition is responding to a Budget, instead of making criticisms of the things that cannot be achieved by the Government, he ought to put down what his own policy would be, if he ever had the chance to put one into effect. </para>
          <para>The real intentions of the Labor Party are also camouflaged with regard to other allowances. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> criticised the Government for failing to index some basic social welfare benefits, such as allowances paid for dependent children of pensioners and the unemployment benefit for single people. There is no specific commitment in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> &#39;s speech to index all these basic social welfare benefits. Perhaps the reason is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> understands that it would cost in the order of $ 1 80m a year to index the payments that he mentions. Of course, this cost would significantly increase if inflation ever returned to the rates that were experienced under the Labor Government. The $ 1 80m a year relates to a rate of inflation which is half that which we experienced under the Labor Government. One could call it $360m a year if the Labor Party had the same approach to economic management that it had when it was in office. </para>
          <para>It is probably worth noting too that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> was less than accurate in implying in his speech that the real levels of payment to disadvantaged family units were maintained by the Labor Government. I remind him that guardians&#39; allowances, supplementary assistance and child endowment all lost value under the Labor Government. Perhaps he did not care to mention that when he was talking about a anti-family approach. It was also <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> who froze the rate of the unemployment benefit for those under 18 years of age in the Budget which he introduced. All he says is that he will come up with the response to the unremitting neglect of pensioners&#39; dependent children. Perhaps the response that he is talking about is the redistribution of the $200m from the family allowance scheme that was mentioned at the conclusion of the quote that I made from the paper of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes.</inline> If his response is to abandon the universal family allowance scheme, let us hear that from him so that the people can judge which payment they prefer to receive on behalf of the children of Australia. </para>
          <para>There are other aspects of the Fraser Budget of this year and of previous years which, to me, were very important ones. I speak firstly of the introduction last year of the supporting parents&#39; benefit which extended assistance to sole fathers on a basis similar to that which had been introduced by the Labor Government for sole mothers. In this Budget, I take great satisfaction from the fact that from November of this year we are able to extend the pensioner health benefit card to supporting parent beneficiaries. This will ensure that all Commonwealth sole parent pensioners are eligible for the same rates of assistance and the same Commonwealth fringe benefits. It is worth noting that the benefit that has been introduced could be estimated at a value of up to $10 a week for a supporting parent. I think that that is considerable recognition of the needs of families. It represents a considerable measure of support to the families who will now be introduced to this benefit. We estimate that some 56,000 supporting parent beneficiaries- this would cover about 96,000 children- will now qualify for the pensioner health benefit cards. Their health costs will be reduced significantly. This should be of great assistance, particularly to those children who are suffering from chronic or repeated illnesses in relation to which the burden of cost on the family is a very grave one indeed. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline>did not choose to mention that the children&#39;s services program is playing an essential role in the support of low income families. The direction of this program has been to assist those low income families and those with special needs. Inded, the whole focus of the program has been changed by this Government. When we came into office there was a program related to pre-school education. While we have maintained a commitment to pre-school education, we have directed this program towards creating a flexible network of services for more disadvantaged children. We have been able to include services such as day care, emergency care, outside school care and vacation care. Since the 1976 Budget the Government has been able to increase expenditure from $ 16.9m to $36. 13m in the present Budget. It has doubled the assistance given to those families where children&#39;s services are vital and where family support services are required for the strength of the family. There are many anti-family aspects of the Labor Party program. For instance, the program does commit the Australian Labor Party to a policy of big spending. Let us make sure that we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> &#39;s statement accurately. Last night he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I make no apology for the fact that in committing ourselves to such a program we would support a larger domestic deficit to help fund it. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is not news to the Government. We know that larger domestic deficits were the pattern of the economic management of the Labor Government. To have the sorts of statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> with regard to anti-family programs and to neglect to appreciate the effect of inflation on the security of the family is a significant omission from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. In the income security system of this country we have developed a system of minimum income support which is one of the most comprehensive in the western world. Basically, all people- other than those who are able to work but choose not to work or choose to work in unprofitable ventures- are guaranteed an income. The various categories covered under the income security system shows that Australia has a very comprehensive income security system. However, I notice that the Australian Labor Party at the Adelaide conference talked about the introduction of a universal guaranteed minimum income scheme. We do not know the cost of the scheme that the Labor Party has in mind, and neither do its supporters. It is the sort of thing that the Labor Party talks about. It sounds good- a GMI. The Government would like to know by whom it is guaranteed, for whom it is guaranteed and at what cost. I wish to refer to the sorts of programs that came forward. I am using the document prepared in the Laurie Oakes report of the Labor Party conference. If there are any inaccuracies - </para>

              <para>- At the Adelaide conference it was stated that the Australian Labor Party social security policy aimed at the introduction of a guaranteed minimum income scheme. An introduction of a scheme of that kind needs costing and serious consideration. I wonder what sort of consideration <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> would give to that and whether in the introduction of such a scheme he would place recognition on the need to maintain the income security system- which we now enjoy- in respect of families. Some of the other aspects of the Labor Party schemes formulated at the Adelaide conference show that the Labor Party would review the family allowance program in order to direct resources to low income families and provide for annual review of the level of payment to maintain its value. That probably relates to the sort of paper from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> about which I was talking. The Labor Party talks about updating the income tests for social security payments and fringe benefits in line with inflation but it did not necessarily do that when it was in government. </para>

          <para>The Labor Party brings back the old faithfuls- the no fault national compensation scheme and a national superannuation scheme. Perhaps something ought to be said about that. The Government has considered a national superannuation scheme, which was suggested in the Hancock report, and it has rejected the introduction of that scheme because it has recognised that it may place a very heavy burden on the lower and middle income families where the responsibility of raising children already imposes heavy costs. The Hancock National Superannuation Inquiry would have increased the effective tax burden of the worker on a minimum wage by 20 per cent. The scheme would have required $ 1,500m a year in addition to the present taxes which are collected from the Australian people. That costing was based on 1975 or 1976 figures. Today&#39;s cost would be far greater. Where is the low tax government that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> was trying to put forward as his style of government, and where is the small government that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> was trying to imply was his preference when he talked in disparaging terms of big government, as it related to the Fraser Government. </para>
          <para>One thing that is known from the Hayden alternative Budget is that he will not promise to index taxation. He has never suggested in concrete terms that he would introduce personal income tax indexation. He has promised a larger domestic deficit but he has never suggested that he will index personal income tax. He has been quite consistent in this matter. Of course, he is a product of the Whitlam Government which specialised in the collection of increased taxes from the Australian people. All honourable senators can remember <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s policy speech and they could probably transfer it into the speech of any future Labor Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> said: </para>

              <para>- I am speaking as a future Labor Government would speak. It is an interesting exercise to compare how much individuals would have paid in tax under the Hayden tax scales of the last Hayden Budget and the amount payable under the Fraser tax scales. For example, a man on an income of $ 10,000 a year and with a dependent spouse would have paid some $600 a year less on the Fraser tax scales than on those of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden.</inline> That is the sort of thing that the Government would like the people of Australia to understand when they are trying to contrast the situation with what seems to me to be a non-policy, just a series of criticisms of the Budget by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> in his speech. With some very choice words <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> said:   . . the finest flower of Australian youth has been allowed to wilt, while bewildered families have looked on without knowing why. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline>might not know why but most families in Australia do. They knew why in 1975 and 1977, and nothing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> says now suggests that the Australian Labor Party has learned the lesson of the disastrous effect of its policies on the economy. Professor Henderson, of the poverty inquiry, put it fairly succinctly. He said: </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Scotton,</inline>formerly the  Chairman  of the Health Insurance Commission- established by the Whitlam Government- put it in the following way:   . . there can be no doubt that two central policies of the Labor Government- the expansion of public social expenditures and the encouragement of substantial wage and salary increases- contributed to the intensity of both of these problems (inflation and unemployment) and the difficulties of the subsequent readjustment. </para>
          <para class="block">Has there ever been any recognition in the comments by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> or any of the Labor spokesmen of the price that this Government has had to pay for those three years of Labor Party policies? We have not had a costing of the price that would have to be paid for the Adelaide conference policies; we have not had any suggestion from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> of any sense of responsibility in what he suggested that this Government ought to be doing in the present Budget. It seems to me that whilst every person in Australia understands that we have to live within a controlled expenditure, the Labor Party still puts forward the policies, programs and criticisms of the Government&#39;s curtailment of expenditure in a way that sounds all too like a repeat performance of the three years from 1 972 to 1 975. Every private employer in the country is aware of the difficulties; every private employer in the country was able to receive with satisfaction the Budget of the Fraser Government this year. The Budget statements pointed out that wage rates remained too high for certain categories of labour, including those people who lacked qualifications and experience. It is no coincidence that unemployment remains particularly high amongst the unskilled and the juniors. Has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> or any other spokesman for the Labor Party in their concern for unemployment addressed themselves to that issue? Of course, they cannot because the recent Labor conference in Adelaide pointed out that wages policies could only be carried out with the consent of the trade union movement. The policies of the trade union movement are for higher and higher wages regardless of those who do not have jobs. </para>
          <para>One specific policy proposal that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> made to cope with unemployment was for 50,000 jobs to be provided for a total cost of between $80m and $ 100m; in other words, at a cost of about $2,000 a job. Award wages for a 16- year-old are over $3,000 a job. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> assumes that every job means one less on unemployment benefit and that only 16-year-olds would be assisted, it still seems hard to come up with his costing if ongoing costs and administration are taken into account. The Labor Party&#39;s experience of job creation schemes takes us back to the Regional Employment Development scheme of 1975 which cost about $11,000 for each job it created. Even the Whitlam Government realised that that could not work. The purpose of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> &#39;s scheme, of course, was not to create employment but to grab a few headlines by suggesting that the Labor Party has a concern for the unemployed, something which does not show up in the rest of its policies. To this extent perhaps the Labor Party&#39;s policies are cheap. But they are not cheap for the Australian people. They are not alternatives to responsible economic management. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> it gives me pleasure to support the Budget of the Fraser Government. </para>

            <para>- I consider the speech we have just heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> to be a most extraordinary speech for a Minister of her calibre. I would have thought that in the week during which the Budget was brought down we would have heard Ministers and members of this Government telling us positively and enthusiastically just what this Budget was going to do for the great mass of people in Australia. She did not tell us, of course, what this Budget was going to do positively for the great mass of people in Australia because it will not do anything positive for the great mass of people in Australia. It is just going to drag them down further into poverty. We heard a Minister of the calibre of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> reduced to the old catch cry about its all being the fault of the Whitlam Government, forgetting very conveniently the number of Budgets which have now been brought down by this Government and the number of chances it has had to bring this country up to something worth while. </para>

          <para>In 1979 in Australia it does not do to be old, to be sick, to be unemployed, to be a school-leaver or to be a family man with young children. If one falls into one of those categories one is part of the plan of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard),</inline> who stated in the Budget Speech: </para>

          <para class="block">Business profits improved at any price! Presumably business profits can be improved while thousands and thousands of Australians are on the breadline and while thousands and thousands of young Australians find that there is no place in society for them. Evidently we are supposed to be grateful for the ridiculous little bits of padding here and there which have come out of this Budget. Whilst more and more people are pushed into poverty we are supposed to be grateful for the ridiculous little handouts to people. What we and the people of Australia want is more employment, fewer handouts and more dignity. In 1979 in this country who wants to be the object of somebody&#39;s charity? After having gone through school and passed examinations, who in 1979 wants to find that there is no place in this country for them and that whatever they have to contribute is not wanted? </para>
          <para>The old and the aged in this country at least achieved indexation of pensions in this Budget. But that will not come into force until May of next year, whilst pharmaceutical benefit increases come into force from next Saturday. If the Government is so concerned about assisting people in this country one wonders why the situation could not have been reversed. Millions of dollars have been saved by cutting back those pensions that the aged should have got. If the pensioners had got the rise to which they were entitled in May 1978 they would each have $60 more. Over that period meat prices rose by 400 per cent, rents increased, transport charges rose, doctors&#39; fees rose and the cost of health schemes rose. But pensioners were kept on an amount of money that was not able to cope with their needs in 1 979, let alone at this time of the year. </para>
          <para>I say again that what the aged and the pensioners of this country want is more dignity. They want to be able to buy what they need and to pay their bills; they do not want various schemes handed out to them or various bits of charity dolloped out to them when those in authority think fit. While pensioner health benefit schemes go up, the pensioner health benefit card is made available to a few more- a little more charity is handed out. While the petrol tax pushes up the price of every conceivable item that a pensioner might buy they are handed bits of charity and told that they should be grateful for it. </para>
          <para>The sick in this community are in a very bad way. Under this Government and through this Budget they have to put up with increased doctors&#39; fees and the Government has made no move to assist in paying those doctors&#39; fees or to keep them down. They have to put up with increased hospital charges and yet we still have not got hospitals distributed equitably throughout the community. In areas of Melbourne people have to go for miles before they can find a hospital to care for their problems. People who have been caught in accidents have to go miles and miles because there are no hospitals. We are told that we have many hospital beds in excess of requirements, but we do not have hospital beds where we need them; and when we find them we have to pay more for them. </para>
          <para>The increase in pharmaceutical benefits has got to the absurd point. I have listened to young people, who did not know who I was, talking about paying $51 a month for health benefit schemes- for things that they will never need. They will never be so ill that they will need to spend that sort of money, but because of the scare tactics put out by the health benefit associations, assisted by this Government with its propaganda, people are paying out extraordinary amounts of money that they cannot afford. What we wanted in this country was a system that would make sure that when people are ill they are not punished, that when they are ill they are made well whether or not they have the money to pay for a bed in a hospital. If we are going to move away from that, if this Government no longer believes that everybody is entitled to care when they are ill, it should come out and say so to the people of Australia and then the people of Australia can judge. If it believes that health care is an area in which it is quite justifiable to make a profit, it should say so and give the people of Australia the chance to choose. </para>
          <para>When it was shown that there would have to be rises in health benefit payments I noticed that Derek Shaw, President of the Health Benefits Association Ltd in Victoria, issued a warning about the rises that this would entail and the risks that this would involve people in. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government has broken an undertaking we had reached with the Minister for Health that we were to make necessary rate change adjustments just once a year. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> broke a promise to the HBA and to the health benefit funds. He broke a promise he made to the people of Australia when he was elected in 1975 because he said then that the Government would not disrupt Medibank- that Medibank would stay whole. So much destruction has been wrought on Medibank that now in Australia we have no health scheme worth talking about. All that people know is that they have to pay out enormous amounts of money and they are not sure where the care comes from or what calibre it is. If in this country at the moment one is unemployed, married and has a family one has to keep that family on less than $ 100 a week. At the same time the cost of health care has risen enormously. People with young families need health care because of the things that can happen to kiddies. If someone is unemployed, married and has a young family he is facing an enormous increase in doctors&#39; fees which he cannot afford. He is facing enormous increases in hospital charges which he cannot afford. He is facing increases in the prices of foodstuffs which go up every day. The petrol tax imposed by this Government increases transport charges and raises the cost of every item that people have to buy in their day-to-day living. Those increases in transport costs come directly from this Government&#39;s greedy grabbing of an increase in taxation that every member of the Australian population pays every time he fronts up to a bowser. </para>
          <para>An unemployed person without dependants in this country is stuck on an amount of $57.90 a week. No adjustment is being made for cost of living increases; no adjustment is being made for the petrol tax which still has to be paid. Something like 78 per cent of the unemployed people in this country are without dependants. They are told by this Government that they must go out and find jobs. To do <inline font-style="italic">so they</inline> have to spend money on transport, telephone calls and newspapers. They have to buy clothes so that they look decent and clean when they front up for a job. They are expected to do all of that on $57.90 a week. That is not possible with the sorts of costs which people have to meet today- the sort of costs which come about because of the policies of this Government and which are increasing day by day. </para>
          <para>People are being jammed into a situation in which they do not have the money to go out and find themselves jobs, yet they are told by this Government that they are dole bludgers if they do not do so. They are told that they are paid too much dole money, that there are people who can exist on less than the dole that they are paid. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Phillip</inline> Lynch, has been reported as saying that some people could survive on a lower unemployment benefit. I will bet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> has never tried to survive on unemployment benefit. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> said that the unemployment benefit could be too high and could be encouraging people to live off the dole. He has to be kidding. The people living on that sort of money are almost living in a state of starvation. They are in extreme desperation bringing up families on that sort of money. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> said that people are encouraged to go on the dole because they will receive magnificent amounts of money. He underestimates people. He does not pay them their due. People are honest and hard working. They wish to contribute, to be a part of the community. They do not want to have charity handed out to them. They want to keep their families in their own way. They want this Government to provide them with jobs so that they can do that. </para>
          <para>Let us now consider the position of the unemployed people aged under 1 8 years. Let us look at the rate they are paid. They are paid $36 a week. It has been at that figure since 1975. It has lost 60 per cent of its value since that time and no move has been made to increase it. Yet these people make up the heart of what this Government is pleased to call &#39;the dole bludgers&#39;. One wonders how these young people manage to keep themselves going at all on $36 a week. It costs money to go out every day to find a job. Fares could take up $10 of the weekly amount. They have to buy newspapers to find out where the jobs are and pay for telephone calls. They have to buy clothes so that they can look clean and respectable when they go for interviews for jobs. After all those things are taken into account, how much of the $36 a week would be left for board and lodgings? Is it any wonder that mothers and fathers are in despair as to what is to become of their children under those circumstances? </para>
          <para>If it is difficult for children in the city to manage on that sort of money, imagine what it is like for children in country towns who have to go to the city for jobs. How in the name of fortune are they supposed to keep themselves on that sort of money? Yet there must be hundreds and hundreds of children across this country who do have to go to the city to find jobs. I have before me a report prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Don</inline> Edgar, Reader in Sociology at the La Trobe University and  Chairman  of the Planning Committee for the Victorian Country Education Project, and it has some figures on the unemployment levels for country towns. When we look at the situation concerning vacancies for juniors in country towns we find startling ratios of unemployed people to vacancies. In Cessnock, New South Wales, there are 409 unemployed people for each vacancy; in Maitland, 238 people for each vacancy; in Taree, 193 people for each vacancy; in Albury, 80 people for each vacancy. Some Victorian figures are: In Geelong, 120 people for each vacancy; in Mildura, 120 people for each vacancy; and in Swan Hill, 82 people for each vacancy. Those figures give an indication of the number of young people- juniors- in country districts who cannot get jobs. </para>

On $36 a week those people have to come to the city, find themselves board and lodging and get around the city to find a job. In January 1979 the young unemployed people in New South Wales numbered 34,420, 41.3 per cent of the rural jobless. In Victoria they numbered 19,015, which was 52.1 per cent of the rural jobless. That presents for rural towns a massive social problem which has gone unheralded by either the Government or the media. Evidently this Government does not care because not one thing in this Budget will be of any assistance to those youngsters in country towns; nor will anything in this Budget do anything about the problem of jobs or education in country towns. As Don Edgar stated in his report: </para>

              <para>. it even fails to allow room for teaching about those aspects of city culture that might be relevant to rural school leavers who must seek city jobs. Transport, budgeting, job seeking, using newspapers, infiltrating a bureaucracy (State or private), finding accommodation, using support services are all matters of know-how that assist the transition from school to work, yet subject-oriented timetables refuse them any coverage time. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">This Government has shown not the slightest concern for the problem that those people are faced with. They are doomed to no work in the country and to no work and no money in the city. Indeed, one wonders what happens to them when they do come to the city on that extraordinarily small amount of money. As I have said, no support is given in this Budget for the idea of real work for people in the country. No care is shown for the real problems that exist in the country. No response is made to the call for country children to be able to stay in their districts to live out their lives there and to contribute there in a very real way. This Government is responding to the call that has gone out about the closing of expensive half-full country schools but is showing no care for the very real problems that exist there. Yet the cost of country schooling will rise as a result of the petrol tax because it will mean that the cost of buses to take the country children to school, the cost of the petrol which parents use to drive them to school, will be much increased. </para>
          <para>We have a great problem with unemployment. We have a government which is taking something like $2,000m in petrol tax, yet it does nothing about training, re-training and providing work opportunities. This Budget cuts $50m from the National Education and Training program. It is the only program which exists to assist support to the semi-skilled and the unskilled in finding work in the community. The Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> pointed out that we have a great number of unskilled people in the community who find it difficult to get work. If the Government acknowledges that, one would think that at least it would take steps to do something about giving skills to those unskilled people. Yet $50m is being cut from the only scheme we have which might do that. </para>
          <para>We have a scheme called the Special Youth Employment Training Program. This Budget has cut the funding for that scheme by 67 per cent. That scheme subsidises employers to employ people who have been out of the work force for four months. Some employers have abused the scheme. Why do we not deal with the abusers instead of condemning the people who need that scheme to get themselves some work experience and the opportunity to get back into the work force and gain self-respect? That is the only scheme we have which deals with people in that sort of area, yet its funding has been cut by 67 per cent by this Budget. That shows just how much the Government cares about the unemployed, and adds to the growing feeling in Australia that this Government does not really care what level unemployment reaches. It believes that unemployment will solve a lot of its problems. With a large pool of unemployed there will be no problems with the work force and no pressure to give people anything like a real wage for the work they do. </para>
          <para>Some $2,000m will be raised through the petrol tax, but there is no money for training, no money for retraining, no money for employment programs. Where are the plans this Government might have for producing skilled tradesmen? Where are its plans for maintaining our expertise, our ability to produce all sorts of goods in this country. Does the Government acknowledge that we no longer produce such things as spark plugs and ball bearings and that we are in danger of losing the expertise we need to produce those sorts of goods? There is no acknowledgement at all of that. As far as the Government is concerned, we can become a farm, a mine, and a load of peasants. At the moment, a person with a young family finds that costs are rising, unemployment is growing and wages are going down. </para>
          <para>I come now to the family allowances. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> spoke glowingly about family allowances, which were going to give women freedom. Family allowances have not been increased since 1 976. The Government took away child endowment and cut out tax rebates for children. It replaced them with family allowances, which have not been increased since 1976. Although operating on 1979 prices, families have been left with the level of assistance that was deemed reasonable in 1976. So much for this Government&#39;s care for the family. That care was further indicated this week when the Government announced that it would make available $2,000 for research into the cot death syndrome. I cannot help but contrast that with the $3. 5m made available to Project Australia, a project which the Government fondly hopes will raise its standing in the eyes of the community. But when the people of Australia see where the money is going- $3. 5m to Project Australia and $2,000 to research into the cot death syndrome- I am sure that they will understand only too well where the priorities lie. </para>

          <para>The majority of people in Australia know that there is plenty of wealth in this country. The problem is not that we are not a wealthy country; it is that the wealth that exists in this country is distributed unevenly, away from the bulk of the people, and this Budget perpetuates that uneven distribution. I shall quote to the Senate some interesting figures which show the distribution of incomes among families in this country. Some 10 per cent of the lower income people receive 2.2 per cent of total income; the top 10 per cent of income earners receive 23 per cent of total income. </para>
          <para>The wealth of the country is owned in this way: The bottom 10 per cent of our population owns 0.27 per cent of the wealth of the country; the top 10 per cent of our population owns 22 per cent of the wealth. So the money is there but it is very unevenly distributed, and the Government is not prepared to do anything at all about redistributing it. What it has done is impose a petrol tax on the little people of this country, a tax that will bring in a minimum of $2,000m. As petrol prices rise, so will the amount of tax collected. The petrol tax will mean extra transport costs, which will push up prices. Higher prices will mean fewer goods bought, which in turn will mean fewer goods produced. Fewer goods produced will mean fewer jobs, which will push Australia into even deeper trouble. </para>
          <para>It was put earlier in the debate that nothing had been said about what the Labor Party would do. I shall say a little about that by quoting from the policy agreed to in Adelaide by the Labor Party, a policy which has been of such great concern and interest to the Government. Perhaps if I quote the policy the Government will be even more concerned and will adopt some of it. The items we adopted included these: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Recognising that taxation is a source of revenue . . . and a means of redistributing income and wealth - </para>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Reform the taxation system as far as possible to redistribute the burden of taxation in ways consistent with the philosophy of ability to pay and the need for an adequate, minimum standard of living. Maintain a progressive income tax on individuals; and avoid recourse to any form of concession which favours high income earners. </para>
          <para>Support tax indexation to ensure that the burdens and benefits of the personal income tax are not distorted by inflation. </para>
          <para class="block">We believe those things fervently. We are proud of them. We are not in any way ashamed of them, and we will go out and push that line from one end of Australia to the other. The Government knows very well that policy will be well received by the people of this country because, in essence, it represents what the majority of people believe that taxation should do. I should stress that the policy puts the emphasis where it belongs. It puts the emphasis on tax coming from those who can afford to pay, and on the Government&#39;s own figures it is obvious that it is giving the biggest tax concessions to those who have the highest incomes. </para>
          <para>At this stage in the debate on the Budget one can only ask: Where are the Government&#39;s positive plans for employment? Where are its plans for equitable distribution of the wealth of this country? Even in the Government&#39;s terms, where are the plans for a more equitable distribution than we have at the moment? They are to be found nowhere at all, and under this Government there never will be such plans. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the Government believes that business profits must be improved. That is what the Treasurer has said. We on this side say: You are killing the golden goose. </para>

I refer particularly to the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer.</inline> She made out a case that there was nothing at all in the Budget for the creation of jobs for young people. We will come to a larger outline of that matter later. I will answer in a short way now the two specific matters on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> &#39;s case falls to the ground immediately. Business, government, unions and the Crawford report all agree that the way to create jobs in Australia is by stimulating the exports of manufactured products. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline>obviously does not have much time to read the detail of the Budget and possibly she has missed several very important points. The position is that this Budget outlines a substantial increase for the export incentives grants scheme from about $60m or $70m last year up to a sum of over $2 15m in this coming financial year. If that is not a job creation program I do not know what is. </para>
          <para>Let us consider a couple more examples of which I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> will take note. I refer to the reduction in the coal export levy. There was a reduction of $3.50 a tonne in respect of new mines. Is that not creating jobs? Of course it is. Unless I misheard the speech last night and misread the newspapers today, I am absolutely certain that I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> say that we must cut taxes to create jobs. Heavens above, we have cut taxes. What does that mean? Where is the argument of honourable senators opposite? They have no argument at all. Do honourable senators opposite want some more examples? There are the industrial research and development grants. The Crawford report, the Williams study and the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment on industrial research and development point out strongly that there is a need to increase the amount of government money going towards technology and research in this country.

              <para>-Of course the Government has done the right thing and I thank the honourable senator very much for his comment. Expenditure for this purpose has increased from $ 14m in 1977-78 to $24m in 1978-79 and will increase to $32m this year. These are the real arguments. This is the direction job creation is taking and this is the most necessary way to do it. For many years the Opposition has made out cases for artificial job creation schemes, that is that everybody could earn a living by sweeping the streets. That is the sort of job creation scheme that the Opposition has in mind. It does not want to create new skills to enable people to convert from one industry to another because it upsets the union movement. That is why it does not want to create new skills. </para>

Of course, this is as a result of rising affluence within the community. Obviously, it will be a substantial area of job creation in the next 20 years. What is the situation in that industry? Obviously, Australia is crying out for more tourist development as a means of assuring job creation. What has the Fraser Government done? It has responded in an incentive giving way by providing for a deduction of <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> per cent on the depreciation of buildings used for accommodation purposes. </para>

              <para>-Senator Cavanagh knows that that is not true. The Government obviously has the very real interests of country people in mind in this industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> must acknowledge this because the setting up of new motel and hotel rooms throughout Australia must stimulate economic activity in country areas. That is clearly an objective of this Government&#39;s policy as laid down in the Budget. That is job creation in the real sense of the word. That is using the tax system to provide jobs for people in the most acceptable way for an industry whose future will be great. This is not merely putting people to work with brooms to sweep the streets. That is the Labor Party&#39;s alternative. That is job creation in its book. I happen to know that there is a great interest in this depreciation allowance. I am aware of several new developments that are likely to occur as a direct result of that decision that has now been taken by this Government. These will involve substantial investment throughout Australia in the tourist industry thus creating jobs for people to service those motels and accommodation units. That is the proper direction in which to move. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline>apparently is not yet satisfied with this great string of job creation programs incorporated in the last Budget. I mention another very substantial allowance which was made in order to create jobs in the small business sector, namely, a 10 per cent increase in the retention allowance for private companies. This is so that they can retain more funds to invest in more plant and more buildings to house more workers. If that is not a substantial movement in that area, I do not know what is. Obviously <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> cannot be satisfied. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the broad spectrum of the Budget and see how it fits the developing trends in the economy not only in Australia but also throughout the world.

What happened in 1 978-79? In the last financial year the Fraser Government actually put back into the pockets of the people a net sum of 3c in the dollar. It did not extract that amount. </para>

              <para>-The trouble is that members of the Opposition will not listen to facts. Let us again consider the state of the Australian dollar in 1975. At that time the unemployment which had been created by the Whitlam Government rose from something like 60,000 to round about 300,000 in the space of four or five months. Inflation was still running at about 1 7 per cent when the Fraser Government came to power. The first move was to reduce inflation substantially, as that was the most accepted means of ensuring that jobs were created and preserved. Indeed, that still remains, as it should, the fundamental thrust of our policy. In 1976, because of the state of the Australian dollar, something that had been created by previous economic events in the period of the Whitlam Labor Government, the currency of Australia was devalued by 17V4 per cent. This was followed by a series of moves by this Government designed to reduce inflation. This was carried out quite successfully and brought down the inflation rate in the 1978 financial year to under 8 per cent. On that basis, obviously in the last financial year there has been a step-up in the number of jobs created in the private sector. The policy is working. Some 60,000 or 70,000 new jobs have been created in the private sector as a result of this Government &#39;s control over inflation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>What does the Budget for 1979-80 do within the broad panorama of that policy? It continues the thrust against inflation. Not even Bill Hayden disagrees with that policy. It has due regard to a very substantial change in favour of Australia in terms of capital inflow into this country. In the last financial year we saw a movement from the area of negative balance in our balance of payments to a substantial credit balance. It is expected that that will occur even more so in this financial year. It means that a substantial addition to the money supply of this country will result from that capital inflow. It would be a most irresponsible government that did not take action to control the fiscal aggregates of this Government by ensuring that the domestic deficit was kept as low as possible. Accordingly the Government has budgeted for a reduction in the domestic deficit to a figure under $ 1,000m. That is clearly designed to offset expected increases in the surplus deriving from overseas transactions. </para>

              <para>-Yes, it is the lowest Budget deficit for six or eight years. As a proportion of our total gross domestic product it has fallen to the almost insignificant figure of round about one per cent. That has been accepted very well in the financial markets which are the source of investment capital for further job creation activities within the Australian economy. The Opposition will not acknowledge that this is clearly a very sound basis for developing the future of this country. This week we have seen an increase of $ 1 ,000m in investment in respect of the Gladstone alumina refinery, something that was not contemplated prior to the Budget. Given the confidence of investment in that particular activity as a result of this Budget, jobs will be created. That is a direct result of the Fraser Government&#39;s policy. This Government is in a very sound position from the point of view of raising funds on the financial markets to meet its deficit this year. This means that interest rates will be kept stable, at least. I hope they will continue to fall. </para>

          <para>I would like to make some remarks about economic growth in South Australia. Having recognised that there is a substantial move for increased investment in new plant, mineral activities and resource development projects throughout Australia, it is of the greatest concern to the people of South Australia and to my fellow senators from that State- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Teague, Senator Jessop,</inline> the <inline font-weight="bold">President, Senator Sir Condor</inline> Laucke, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young-</inline> that this sort of improvement in our domestic economy is not happening in South Australia. In fact, it was projected in the newspaper this morning that an estimated $26,000m worth of projects will be under way within the next few years. This estimate is by W. D. Scott and Co. Pty Ltd. This figure is for the whole of the Australian economy. But how much relates to South Australia? It is less than 2 per cent of $26,000m. This is notwithstanding the fact that the population of South Australia represents 9 per cent of the Australian population. It is incredible, but it is true. </para>

              <para>- It is because we have in South Australia a government that is ensuring that these sorts of developments will not occur. The Corcoran Labor Government prohibits any development of the Roxby Downs copper, gold and uranium deposit. That Government, because of its silly, narrow policy on uranium mining, will not allow exploration and development to occur. Yet this particular deposit in the northern part of South Australia is said to be the greatest mineral deposit in the world. If that is so, why are we not getting it under way? Why are we not moving now? No doubt my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> would have adequately covered this matter this afternoon during the debate on the matter of urgency so I will not dwell upon it. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I want to refer to several other matters with regard to South Australia. Clearly, if the people of South Australia get rid of the Corcoran Government on 15 September- I do not doubt that they will- we will see that project go ahead. The Labor Government in South Australia is stopping job creation. A Tonkin Liberal government will create new jobs in South Australia based on Roxby Downs and other mineral deposits in that State. Members of the Opposition should face facts. I am not trying to be political; I am trying to make the point that here is an opportunity for the people of South Australia to ensure that more jobs are created so as to get the economy of that State moving and to ensure that it plays a full part in Australia&#39;s continuing recovery and development. The only way to do that- this is not a political statement- is to get rid of the Corcoran Government because it is stopping that development. </para>
          <para>Since the Opposition does not seem to agree with that sort of statement, perhaps some of the people of South Australia and members of the Senate might be interested to hear of some of the great new promises of the Corcoran Government. The Corcoran Government suddenly has found a brand new interest in things like controlling finances. It has been under pressure from the State Opposition on this matter. Yesterday, the day before his policy speech, Premier Corcoran- I was going to say &#39;Corporal </para>
          <para class="block">Corcoran&#39; but he is called &#39;Colonel Corcoran&#39;was going to make a statement about the reduction he would make in the number of statutory authorities in South Australia. A report by Ted Knez in today&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> states that, out of 250 statutory authorities, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> will abolish eight. Let us hear some of the eight statutory authorities that are to be axed under his new sweep clean&#39; policy of looking after the finances of the State, after the tragedy of the Department of Health losses which were made quite clear as a result of the report of the Public Accounts Committee last February. The statutory authorities which are deemed to be redundant and are to be abolished include the South-Eastern Drainage Appeals Board, the Builders Licensing Advisory Committee, the Dog Fence Board, the Pastoral Board, the Land Board and the Central Inspection Authority. The Premier will amalgamate various classifications of Theatrical Performances Boards. I will bet that Don Dunstan will not like that. Apparently the Premier is going to amalgamate a large number of pest control authorities. This is the state of affairs that we find in South Australia at the moment.

              <para>- At least 40 per cent. That is only in direct reimbursement grants. I take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rocher&#39;s</inline> point. On top of that there are housing grants, grants for immigration services, grants for health services through deficit funding of hospitals in South Australia, and so on. Out of that $8 that is collected in South Australia, possibly $5 goes back to the State Government for its expenditure. What a misleading report! What a misleading advertisement, which confuses people in an election campaign- as though it would have some real impact. But most people in South Australia see straight through this man, and clearly they will not support him on 1 5 September if he is prepared to perpetrate such misleading statements. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I should like to follow that up a little further. Corporal Corcoran is well known in South Australia for his misleading statements. We have just heard how active <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> is in respect of axing authorities in South Australia. Recently it was my misfortune to have drawn to my attention the fact that there have been several attempts by the State Government to accuse the Federal Government of not making money available to the State for decentralisation grants. There has been a bit of a song and a dance in our State about the fact that Tasmania seems to be getting all the money, and our State is not getting it. That is supposed to be the fault of the Fraser Government and, indeed, of the Federal representatives from South Australia in this House and in the House of Representatives. But what is the truth? This matter centred on the City of Whyalla. Recently, the Federal Government made a grant of $500,000 to Pacific Salt Pty Ltd to create jobs in Whyalla- that city which in recent times has been suffering some difficulty with unemployment. There were three other submissions by the City of Whyalla. There was one for the creation of one or two jobs for an urban social survey; one for the creation of some jobs in respect of an urban bus depot; and one in respect of a hydroponics industry employing two people. </para>
          <para>I understand that those requests are not sent directly from the local government source to the Federal Government for review and approval of the grants under the decentralisation Act. They are passed through the State Government. One would have expected that if the City of Whyalla had made out these cases to the Federal Government and said &#39;We need your support to help the poor unemployed of Whyalla&#39;- there are substantial numbers of unemployed in Whyallathis request would have received the wholehearted support of the State Government; that is, Corporal Corcoran &#39;s Government. But what has happened? I understand that the State Government in South Australia would not give its support for those projects and that it wrote to the Federal Government and indicated a very low priority for those particular projects at Whyalla. </para>
          <para>Is this Government of South Australia one that is interested in the development of the State, or is it one that is merely trying to make politics out of the truth, to shift the truth and to misuse the truth in misleading ways, such as the way in which this advertisement does, in order to create a mere political support for it that really does not exist? The fact is that the people of South Australia can see through this State Government, and they will give their answer on 1 5 September. It will be a very surprised <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> who, on 16 September, wakes up to find himself as Leader of the Opposition. I understand that he will not even be in that position and that it is quite likely that he will lose all his positions. I see that honourable senators opposite acknowledge that. That is very interesting. </para>
          <para>Let me conclude by reiterating this most important point: The people should look at the tax cut that is coming on 1 December as a very definite reduction in taxes. The people will know that that is what it is, because after that date the average weekly wage earner will have an extra $4.45 in his pocket. He will know quite clearly, through all the confusion and subterfuge that is going on in this place and in other places, that what some people are trying to perpetrate now is nothing but a misleading statement, and it is unlikely, in terms of the people&#39;s understanding, to improve their position thereafter. </para>

            <para>-In speaking to the 1978-79 Budget Papers, I suggest that it is clearly evident that the two speeches we have just heard- one from the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> and the other from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner-</inline> would be two of the worst speeches which have ever been delivered on the opening of a Budget debate from members of the Government parties. I say at the outset that the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> had nowhere near the fire in it that the speech which she delivered in this House immediately after the 1975 Budget had. That was the speech in which she introduced legislation to take away the $40 funeral benefit from pensioners. She was full of fire on that piece of legislation. Tonight, she went down like a lead balloon. So, when the Government is taking something away from pensioners, the Minister in charge of the debate can come in here flashing fire; but when she has to try to explain this Budget, which has also gone down like a lead balloon, she has done exactly the same. She was trying to make excuses. I would say that it is the worst speech I have ever heard from her. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I will return later to the remarks of the Minister concerning what she intends to do to help the needy people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> made great play, first, about jobs. I wish to refer later to an article which was published in 1977 and of which he was the author concerning jobs- jobs which did not eventuate. He talked about advertising by the present Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran,</inline> being misleading but did not tell us about the misleading advertising during the 1977 election. We then saw full-page advertisements in the daily Press right across Australia showing a person holding a fistful of $5 notes. When counted they amounted to about $70. The advertisement attempted to hoodwink and fool the workers that they were going to get this by way of a taxation deduction, per week mind you, from their income if they re-elected the Fraser Government. No sooner was that Government elected than it imposed a <inline font-style="italic">2lA</inline> per cent surcharge on income tax. If that is not misleading the electors I do not know what is. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline>went on to talk about the tax cuts that the people are to receive on 1 December, but he did not tell us that these would be severely offset by the massive increase in the price of petrol which has been nearly doubled since the Government came to office. Also, as the Government has abolished Medibank and people will have to pay probably another $ 1 1 a week to cover themselves for medical care. What is the good of this minute tax cut that they are fooling the people about? They are the greatest con men ever, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> well knows it. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner,</inline>as did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young,</inline> today used the forms of this House to try to promote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin</inline> in his election campaign in South Australia. I intend to do the same thing and to rebut some of the statements that he made. Government supporters have created the precedent. I am not promoting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin;</inline> I am promoting one of the best Premiers that we have had in South Australia, a person who was  Deputy  Premier under Don Dunstan for nearly a decade and who is well qualified to lead the State. We had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> getting up tonight and saying that all the economic ills that he talks about in South Australia can be cured by a government that is led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin.</inline> Not one of the people that he would have in his Ministry, except perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hill,</inline> has ever been in government or has ever had the experience of running a State, yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> had the audacity to get up here tonight and tell us that they could run South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin</inline> could not run a dog fight, and the honourable senator well knows it. </para>
          <para>Getting back to the false advertising issue, I wish to refer to an article that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Standard,</inline> which is a Messenger Press throwaway publication, dated Wednesday, 23 February 1 977. It reads:  1000 Jobs in Liberal Plan: </para>

          <para>Where are the 1,000 jobs. Today I checked with well-versed people in the electorate of Ross Smith and no such thing as 1,000 jobs was ever created.

          <para class="block">I wish to refer to the honesty of the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> I made a speech on that subject some years ago and later I intend to quote quite a bit from an article in the <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> of 2 June.  His  honesty is open to question. He is the person who said that he would not go to an election, that he would not refuse a Budget when we were in government. Of course, as soon as he had unloaded <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden,</inline> he went to an election. The Liberals are criticising the Corcoran Government for going to the polls, saying it has no need to do so. Let me recall a little bit of history. The Australian Labor Party was elected to government in the Federal Parliament in 1972. The Liberals in this very chamber forced us to an election in May 1974. They again forced us to an election in 1975, and in 1977 they again went to the people. Therefore, they had three elections in the space of four years. So there is no ground at all for any Liberal to try to criticise what the Labor Government has done in South Australia. That Government, at this very day, is faced with the same problem that the Whitlam Government was faced with between 1972 and 1975. We had a hostile upper House. For more than 100 years, because of the gerrymandered electoral system under successive Liberal governments- under the restricted franchise, voluntary voting and similar schemes- the Labor Party in South Australia has not been able to obtain a majority in the upper House. However, because of the electoral reform that was introduced by a Labor government, any party in South Australia that can obtain 50 per cent of the electors&#39; votes on a broad base over the whole State will have the required numbers in the upper House. That is the very thing that we expect in a democracy. The Liberals in South Australia still want to hang on to power in the Legislative Council. Some of the members of that Council were elected eight years ago and have not faced the electors since and they want to sit there for another 1 8 months or 19 months. </para>

              <para>- The record can be checked. When it has been it will be seen that what I have said is correct. There was no Legislative Council election the last time that the House of Assembly went to the people. We well know that under the present constitution in South Australia members of the lower House are elected for a maximum term of three years but that those of the upper House, under legislation that was drawn up by the old bluebirds of many years ago, serve for a minimum of six years. We well know that some of them have been in there for eight or nine years and they do not want to face the electors now. But, of course, we will flush them out. That is why they are squealing like stuck pigs. I completely disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner&#39;s</inline> remark that on the morning of Sunday, 16 September, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> will wake up and find himself in opposition. I am quite confident that the people in South Australia realise that, except for a period of two years between 1968 and 1970, they have been well governed since 1 965, by a very stable Labor government. In successive elections since 1970 they have given their decision at the ballot box, and they are going to give the same decision again. </para>

When asked what he would do about tax, he said that income tax rates were too high. He said that one of the first things a Liberal government would do would be to reduce income tax. We all know that the State governments have no powers to levy income tax. </para>

              <para>- Yes, it is. I saw it with my own eyes. I refer to another matter. In 1 968, when I was a candidate for the Legislative Council, I happened to go door knocking in the streets of a certain town. I struck a lot of pensioners who said to me: &#39;How can the Labor Party expect to get a vote for your candidates for the State Parliament when the candidate&#39;- I am not going to name him because he is not in Parliament nowwas along yesterday and told all the pensioners that if he were elected he would see that our pensions were increased? He said that he could increase our pensions&#39;. That was another misleading statement. I know of many pensioners who are still alive today, even though this happened 1 1 years ago, who will verify what I am saying. </para>

              <para>- I am not going to tell the honourable senator, but I am saying that it is quite correct. That is an example of how Liberal candidates mislead the people. That is particularly so of Liberal leaders. The Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> has done it on many occasions. I will refer to those instances shortly. One of the other matters that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> talked about when referring to creating employment was that with the magnificent amount of money allocated by the Government to tourism a lot more work would be created in the building industry by new motel rooms being added and new motels being built. Of course, what he did not go on to tell the Senate and the people who are listening is that people will not be able to drive motor cars because of the massive increase in petrol prices, the high rate of unemployment and the high rate of taxation. What is the good of building more motels if people are not able to drive their motor cars to them? The only people who stop at motels are people who drive motor cars. </para>

Instead, it is giving the money to these overseas combines who could well do without it.

              <para>- I am glad that I stopped the honourable senator in his tracks because he was heading for the door. I will start again. We find that BHP&#39;s operating profit for 1979 was $548m. That is 73 per cent greater than that of two years earlier. G. J. Coles&#39; 1979 operating profit was up by 60 per cent over that of 1977; CSR&#39;s profit was up by 37 per cent; Conzinc Riotinto of Australia&#39;s 1978 profit was $149m and Utah &#39;s profit was $270m. That shows who is getting the big rake off as a result of the reduction in the coal levy. It is not the residents of this country, but the overseas combines who are ripping us off left, right and centre. This Government is giving away our natural resources because in some areas- we would be hard put to prove it- it is getting some kick back to run its election campaigns. This, I think, is a very severe indictment on it. </para>

          <para>While I am talking about coal, I should refer again to the incident we witnessed in this chamber today. I would not have mentioned it if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> had not brought it up. I refer to Roxby Downs. The Government brought forward an urgency motion. The only significance of that urgency motion was that, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> is most critical of the fact that his Government does not have an energy policy, he had to move in the Senate today an urgency motion on his own government. That is one of the reasons why many Government senators were absent from the chamber tonight. They have realised that the Government does not have an energy policy. I suppose the Mineral and Energy Committee- whatever the Government calls its party committee- is out hastily trying to reconstruct one or get one together so that during the recess the Government can say: &#39;That is our energy policy&#39;. It is quite evident that at the present time the Government does not even have one. </para>
          <para>I turn now to some of the statements that the Minister for Social Security made here tonight on the Budget. She talked about the magnificent moves this Government had made in relation to family allowances. Of course, what she did not go on to tell the people was that with the introduction of family allowances the taxpayer can no longer claim children as a tax deduction. I have had people come to my office about this matter. Mothers have been in tears because Dad had cut from the weekly house keeping money the extra money that they received in the family allowance. He had to balance his budget. So in effect what the Government gave Mum by way of the family allowance, Dad took away to pay the accounts that he had to pay. So these people are no better off. In lots of cases they are much worse off under this family allowances scheme. That is nothing for the Minister to be boasting about. </para>
          <para>The other thing she said was that an extra allocation has been made in the Budget for the provision of homes for elderly citizens. I wrote to the Minister yesterday on behalf of the people of Kapunda who have been trying for years to get a grant from this Government to establish an elderly citizens home complex. Every year they are told: &#39;Next year you might get it&#39;. I wrote to the Minister and I pointed out that she had made a statement in the House last Tuesday to the effect that there was an extra allocation of money for this purpose. I asked her to give the Kapunda claim high priority. I hope that in view of the fact that the Minister has made in this House within a week two statements to the effect that extra money will be made available for this type of project at least the people of Kapunda, who have been trying for many years, to receive funds, will receive an allocation or grant so that they can go ahead and provide the homes which are so sorely needed. I might say in passing that while we were in government we made a four to one subsidy grant to people who wanted to construct elderly citizens homes. When this Government came into office it cut the grant right back to about a one for one ratio and made it a triennial grant. Many people in your own area, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President-</inline> the Barossa Valley- had been granted money for architects &#39; fees. They had had the plans drawn up and suddenly, when this Government came into office, everything was swept away and they got nothing. </para>
          <para>This is the Government which, through its Minister, has outlined what it is doing to help elderly people. The Government makes a great brag about having restored the twice-yearly indexation of pensions. 1 am quite confident that that would never have occurred had it not been for the many thousands of Australian people who signed petitions and had them presented both in this chamber and the other chamber ever since that was taken away in the last Budget. Of course, they are not going to get their twiceyearly increases until well into next year, because the ordinary once-yearly increase takes effect in November. So they have to wait until May next year before they will see any real benefit coming out of this restoration of the twice-yearly increase- something which should never have been taken away from the pensioners of this country. </para>
          <para>The Minister spoke also about an extra $5. 5m for child care services and pre-schools. The allocation has gone up from $63. 8m to $68. 3m, an increase of about $4.5m. On a quick calculation, that would represent an increase of somewhere in the vicinity of 7 per cent. That sort of increase does not even keep up with the inflation rate which the Government admitted in its Budget is going to be something in excess of 10 per cent this year. So in real terms we see a reductionSenator Messner talked about this- of about 3 per cent of the allocation to the people who want to maintain their child care services. That is what we are going to be faced with. When we talk about misleading statements, misleading advertising, we have to remember that this is the type of exercise that the Government is conducting. The Minister for Social Security devoted the greater part of her speech to criticising the policy of the Labor Party which was formulated at the Federal Australian Labor Party conference in Adelaide earlier this year. Every ticket-holding person in the Labor Party stands by the decisions taken at the conference by the delegates from every State and Territory in the Commonwealth. Unlike the Liberal Party, every person right down to the sub-branch member had a say in formulating policy. Committees met for two years- since the last conference- to talk about how the Labor Party could amend its policy. That has been done, and the members stand by the decisions. </para>
          <para>The Minister talked about broken promises. Unlike the Fraser Government, which has broken every promise that it has made since 1975, the Labor Government honoured every promise that it made prior to the 1 972 election except for those promises which this chamber would not allow it to honour. Honourable senators are well aware of the trauma that went on in this place and how we were forced to an election in May 1 974 and again in 1 975. Half the people in this chamber had been elected before the 1 972 election. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said in this chamber, the night after the election results were known they set about formulating a policy to get rid of the Labor Government. Honourable senators well know how that came about. I do not need to refer to that matter again because history has been written and I dare say that if the Labor Party wins office at the end of next year- as I expect it will- and if it does not get the numbers in this place, it will face the same type of frustration from the people who sit opposite. As I have said on many occasions in this chamber, when the Liberal Party is in government and when it has the numbers in this chamber it uses this place as a rubber stamp. When it does not have the numbers in the other place and it has the numbers here, this place is used as a house of frustration. To back up my argument honourable senators only have to look at the record of the Autumn session and see how many amendments were moved by the Opposition in this chamber and how many divisions were won by the Opposition. The Opposition did not win one division and yet we have these people who go out on the hustings and say that the Senate is a House of review. It is nothing but a house of frustration when the Liberal Party has the numbers in this chamber. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Social Security stated that the expenditure in her Department this year would increase by 10 per cent. In fact, this is no increase at all because the Budget Papers forecast an inflation rate this year of 10 per cent- exactly the amount by which she says the expenditure in her Department will increase. Honourable senators know that the Budget in her Department blew out by an enormous figure last year because of unemployment which was running rife all the time. As the Government admits in the Budget Papers, unemployment will increase. Of course, the Government is doing everything possible to hide the true figures of the unemployed. It is now known that it uses the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures and that it will not use the official figures from the Commonwealth Employment Service. Anyone who likes to read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports of the Estimates committees debates last year will see that I was able to get an admission from the Australian Bureau of Statistics that the way in which it conducted the surveys was to do a door-to-door campaign and to ask people if they had a job in that week. If they worked for two or three hours, they were put down as not being unemployed. A completely fictitious set of figures are used purely to hoodwink the Australian people into believing that the unemployment figures are lower than they actually are. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline>also accused the Whitlam Government of being a high spending government. I say here and now that perhaps it was a high spending government, but where did it spend the money? It spent the money on giving a better living standard to people who needed it, in the way of increased pensions, more money for child care services, more money for hospitals, more money for land commissions and that type of thing. One can go right through a whole list. That is where the money went. It did not go on luxury items, such as this Prime Minister uses, which waste taxpayers&#39; money. I wish to quote from a revelation in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> of Monday 27 August, that is this week. It is headed A $3,498 tax slug for the PM &#39;s trip &#39;, and states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Taxpayers are slugged $3,498 every time the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> flies from Canberra to his Victorian country property Nareen in a BAC-1 1 1 VIP jet. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Yet, we find this Government preaching austerity and preaching to the workers, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> did, that the workers are the cause of all economic ills because they want an extra bob or two in their pay packets. The Government says that they are the people who create the economic ills in this country. Here we have a Prime Minister who costs the taxpayers of this country $3,498 every time he flies to Nareen. How often does he fly between Canberra and Nareen? It is a scandal. He ought to be ashamed of it. The very same person who is running up these expenses stood up and criticised the previous Prime Minister because he had the audacity- in the Prime Minister&#39;s view- to charter an aeroplane from Qantas Airways Ltd for his overseas trips. We all know what this Prime Minister is doing and the amount of money that he has expended on these two special aeroplanes that he now has for a few overseas trips. What an enormous cost it is to the Australian taxpayers. Of course, the people suffering are the working people who will be hit with higher taxes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I did show two tables to you earlier in the night, and I showed them to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack).</inline> They give a clear indication, and will prove conclusively, that rather than decreasing taxes in this Budget, the Government is increasing them.

              <para>- On this side of the House. We tried to achieve for it the recognition which we believe it deserves and which we now believe it has attained. Tourism is one of the greatest growth industries in the world, if not the greatest growth industry in the world. It has resisted all the trials and tribulations which have resulted from the huge hike in the cost of fuel. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> unfortunately has left the chamber. I wanted to try to enlighten him. He said that tourism had no future. He is a typical Labor Party knocker. He was knocking the tourist industry to which my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner,</inline> had referred. He said that tourism had no future because energy prices were going up and nobody could afford to travel. Energy prices for travel purposes in Australia are about half of those in most of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, yet since the hike in energy and petrol costs tourism has continued to grow. It is one of the major growth industries in the world. </para>

          <para>Let me get away from the donkey-walloper approach to politics and get on to the positives. Let me talk for a little while about tourism and this Budget. Something which was promised in 1975 by the Liberal-National Country Party coalition in its policy was that as soon as economic circumstances permitted we would introduce a depreciation allowance in respect of tourist accommodation buildings. That matter has quite a long history. It goes back as far as 1954. In 1954 the Hulme committee recommended that it ought to be introduced. It has been recommended by a variety of other bodies since then. In 1975, after the Labor Government of that era had refused to introduce it, the Liberal Party decided as part of its policy that as soon as economic circumstances permitted it would be introduced. It has now been introduced. It is a <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> per cent- that is, a 40-year life term- annual allowance of depreciation in respect of incomeproducing buildings such as hotels, motels, guest-houses and the like used for the accommodation of travellers. </para>
          <para>This is a great day for the tourist industry. It means that people can now invest in that industry with the full confidence that it has the total support, on a continuing basis, of the Federal Government. This is the breakthrough which the tourism industry has been waiting for. This is the breakthrough which will mean, I believe, that the finance sector of Australia will change the attitude which it has previously had towards providing funds for tourism development. From the time that this Budget was introduced anybody who is interested in any way in tourism can look forward to the fact that tourism has come of age. It is a real industry. It is an acknowledged industry in which people can invest with confidence. I believe that many people will be taking advantage of that. Already I have had reports from </para>
          <para class="block">Queensland of a whole series of projects which will now go ahead. These are building projects in the various areas of Queensland&#39;s tourist attractions. I am told that several hundred million dollars already are likely to be spent in Sydney on the provision of good accommodation in that city. That city is strained already from the point of view of good accommodation. I am told from almost every sector of Australia that this is the encouragement which people have been waiting for. </para>
          <para>Having received that encouragement, what will happen now is that there will be a fairly significant investment in building in the tourist industry. Building provides jobs, as my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner,</inline> said. This is one of the job creating provisions in this Budget. The building industry, I believe, will obtain a tremendous fillip out of this provision and flowing from it will be a large number of jobs in the tourist industry, which is a fairly labour intensive industry. That is one of the reasons that it is so important that tourism has received the recognition and the assistance which it has received in the Budget. It will provide jobs. Technology does not take the place of a smile. It might take the place of somebody who is working on a production line or of somebody who is doing some other son of job in a manufacturing sense, but it does not take the place of the person who works in the industry and who provides a service to travellers and to tourists. We are going to have increasing job opportunities as the increase in tourism takes place as a result of the lead which this Government has given. I hope that the State governments also will follow this through because they have a very large and significant part to play in relation to tourism development in this country. </para>

              <para>- I thank the honourable senator for the interjection. I was coming to that later, but I am happy to come to it now. Of all the garbage we have heard from some people in relation to this Budget, the matter referred to in the interjection is probably the subject of the greatest amount of garbage. We have been told that as a result of the increase in air navigation charges air fares will increase dramatically. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> know that over a full year- not this year, but over a full year- the increase in air navigation charges, taking as an example the fare from Melbourne to Launceston, which is one of the most important tourist routes, will add less that the cost of a Sunday newspaper to the fare? </para>

              <para>- The Australian Labor Party has led us to believe that there has been a massive increase. I emphasise that over a full year the increase in air navigation charges will add less than the cost of a Sunday newspaper to a fare of approximately $50. That is supposed to be a massive retrograde step. What absolute nonsense! Let me continue to talk about air fares for a moment before returning to the Budget provisions. I do not mind which way I deal with matters, but having started to talk about air fares I will continue to do so for a moment. In this regard I pay tribute to the activities of the Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> Nixon, in particular. I pay tribute also to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Phillip</inline> Lynch, for the work he has done. As a result of their activities, the number of visitors coming to Australia in the first six months of this year has increased by 28 per cent. Labor Party senators are attempting to say by interjection that that is disastrous. Given the 28 per cent increase in the first six months of this year, I believe that the increase we can look forward to in the future is untold. I would like to have a lot more time to develop that argument. I will return to it in a moment. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let me talk about domestic fares for a minute. Domestic fares have been restructured in a way which now means that the average fare being paid in Australia as a result of the introduction of advance purchase excursion fares, super-APEX fares, stand-by fares and other variations of fares is less than it was 12 months or two year ago. Apparently this is one of the things which the Labor Party cannot understand: What has happened is that the people who want regularity of service and first class service from the airlines are paying more for it; the average traveller is paying less. The persons who go on a holiday on a package deal or super-APEX, the young persons or others who can afford to run the risk involved in stand-by arrangements of perhaps having to miss one flight and go on the next, are all getting remarkably cheaper fares than they were getting a year or two ago. What has happened is that there has been a revolution in Australian domestic air travel. It is a revolution which is in the interests of the consumer. It has happened as a result of co-operation between this Government and the domestic airlines. </para>
          <para>There are so many good things to talk about in relation to tourism. Let me come back to some of the things which arose out of the Budget. The Australian Tourist Commission, which is principally involved in promoting Australia overseas as a tourist destination, has had its funds increased by nearly 100 per cent. I do not think that the Labor Party senators can laugh or cackle about that or say anything other than &#39;well done&#39; to the Government for making a 93 per cent increase in the amount allocated to the Australian Tourist Commission. This will enable us to make sure that with the introduction of much cheaper international air fares Australia, as a tourist destination, will receive the maximum promotion. I look forward to seeing as a result not just the 28 per cent increase in visitors which has taken place already but a much more marked increase after the Australian Tourist Commission&#39;s activities in promoting Australia as a tourist destination have been carried out for a year or two. </para>

              <para>- I keep getting interjections about Qantas Airways Ltd, some of which I reply to, others I do not bother replying to. Let me reiterate what I said in this chamber at, I think, the close of the last parliamentary session in May or early June. I believe that Qantas is the greatest airline in the world. I believe that we have every reason, as far as its airline operations are concerned, to be proud of it. But as far as property development is concerned, I just wish it stuck to running an airline. It is building a Taj Mahal in Sydney and it is a disgrace. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let me go on with some of the other aspects of this Budget. Provision is made in the Budget for $500,000 to be spent over the next two years on a domestic tourism promotion campaign. I welcome that measure also. One of the things which I believe we need to do is to encourage that 50 per cent of Australians who have never been tourists, who have never been travellers, to travel. Fifty per cent is a figure which amazes a lot of people, but the result of a survey showed that 50 per cent of Australians have not spent time away from home which would enable them to be categorised as tourists. There is a tremendous domestic market just waiting to be tapped as well as a huge overseas market. I believe it is important that the Australian Tourist Commission be able to get itself involved in working in co-operation with the States in developing a greater appreciation of Australia for Australians. We find that $300,000 has been allocated for special research in relation to marine services and technologies associated with the Great Barrier Reef, which is one of the world&#39;s major attractions. I believe it is one of the most important areas of the world. That is to supplement the activities which are taking place through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which is centred in Townsville and which I had the pleasure to visit a little while ago and to hear about some of the plans for the development and preservation of the reef. </para>
          <para>I am delighted to refer to the fact that the Government has seen fit to set in train something which will make a tremendous difference to Tasmania and, I believe, to the preservation of Australian history. I refer to the proposals concerning Port Arthur in south-eastern Tasmania. Already it is a major tourist attraction. But unfortunately a lot of the buildings, some of which were damaged by fire in about 1929 or 1930 and which no steps have been taken to preserve, are starting to deteriorate rapidly. That area is an attraction because of its historical significance. Let me put this point in relation to its historical significance: Its real historical significance is not that it was a horror place but that the way in which it was conducted was the greatest advance that had ever taken place in any gaol in the world. At the time that Port Arthur was constructed it represented a major advance. It has a place in the penal history of the world. It should be preserved so that it can be seen and compared with what was happening in other parts of Australia, in other parts of the world, at the time that the model prison was developed. We can now look back and say what was done to people was horrific, but when we look at it in the context of the day we see that it was a major step forward compared with what was happening to people who were kept in the hulks anchored in the Thames and at other places around Europe. Compared with the way in which people were kept in prisons in England- horrible though it now seems to us- it must have represented a major step forward to the people who had experienced the prisons of Europe in those days. </para>

              <para>- Work urgently needs to be done to Port Arthur. I am delighted that our Government has recognised that fact. Provision of $400,000 has been made in this Budget to start the work. It has been made on the basis of two Commonwealth dollars for every one Tasmanian dollar. So it is of major benefit to Tasmania. The work is not just being left to the Tasmanian Government because, as we know, the Tasmanian Government does not do a great deal unless it gets a bit of encouragement in one way or another from the Commonwealth. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We also find an allocation of $2m has been made for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. This is a matter of considerable encouragement to the Northern Territory, which is developing a major tourist industry. The Government members tourism committee was there just a couple of weeks ago. The committee has been active not only in relation to depreciation allowances but also in relation to the development of Uluru Village at Ayers Rock and the urgent need to take some steps. More than 30 reports had been made in relation to the proposed Uluru Village at Ayers Rock, but nobody had grasped the nettle. I am delighted to know that decisions have been taken, money has been provided, and the development is now going ahead. The situation that had been reached at Ayers Rock was most unfortunate from the point of view of the very large number of tourists who visit there every year. The road in to Ayers Rock from the main north-south road is being sealed and the whole area is being developed in other ways. The village was suffering from overcrowding and is now to be moved away from the Rock to a new site, where proper environmental protection can be undertaken and a fine village will be built to cater for the needs of the tourists. </para>
          <para>An amount of $130,000 is being provided to the Bureau of Industry Economics, and I should like to refer briefly to its activities. Professor Johns and his team have done a very valuable job in research work relating to tourism. They were able to show what the tourist industry had always believed but many people, including Treasury, had never accepted; that is, that the tourist industry in Australia is a major industry. They were able to demonstrate, for instance, that it is of greater economic significance than the motor vehicle industry, and I think the matter is put in some sort of perspective when those two industries are compared. The team was able to demonstrate that every tourist dollar spent is divided between over 100 other industries. The tourist dollar goes around in the economy more than virtually any other dollar spent. Professor Johns and his team are going to do quite a bit more work to overcome an unfortunate situation. Very little information on the tourist industry, other than the 1973-74 survey, has been available to enable people to work out just what benefits can be obtained and which way policies ought to be directed. </para>
          <para>I am glad that the Government is going to take another step- one which will cost only a relatively small amount; I think from memory something like $36,000- and that is that Australia is going to join the world tourism organisation. That is something which has been advocated for some time by those who are really interested in tourism. Great benefits are to be obtained for Australia as a potential major tourist destination in the world through its membership of that organisation. </para>
          <para>Another matter which I think is not understood sufficiently by a lot of people in the tourist industry, and certainly no credit is given for it by people on the other side of the chamber, is that the Government has included the travel and tourist industry within the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. This is a tremendous opportunity for people involved in the industry to get overseas and promote Australia. What better way to supplement the work of the Australian Tourist Commission and Qantas- I pay credit to Qantas for its overseas promotion work- than for people to be able to spend their own money, to spend a dollar to make a dollar and to be provided with a considerable subsidy from the Commonwealth Government. An amount of $3.2m has been provided for this year, and I hope that the amount required under the scheme will be a whole lot more than that. If the tourist industry gets out and uses the opportunities that are available to it under this scheme it will make a tremendous difference to its own and Australia &#39;s participation in the tourist industry. As I have said, tourism is one of the world &#39;s fastest growing industries, and I think that Australia has every opportunity to join in that growth. </para>
          <para class="block"> While talking of tourism I want to mention something that has not been done yet but which I believe should be done. I refer to the development of some of the circuits available to the people who live closest to us. While we are opening markets in North America, Europe and Japan, we should not forget that we have a very large population, including an increasingly affluent one, much closer to us. For instance, in Taiwan the growth rate last year was 34 per cent and the inflation rate 6 per cent, which is not a bad sort of development rate. An increasing number of people with increasing living standards can afford to travel. They would be most interested to come to a country such as Australia, and particularly to the northern part to see the mining areas and the Pilbara region, to go through the Top End, perhaps across to the Barrier Reef and then out. We need to open up circuits that are available to them. </para>
          <para>If we took a direct line from Japan to Taiwan to the Philippines and through Jakarta to Karratha, we would have a relatively short trip that opens up a population of 300 million people who could travel in a way in which they cannot travel at the moment. We just have to get things organised. I suggest that that is an area that needs further development. I hope that we can do quite a bit, in co-operation with China Airlines of Taiwan and with Philippine Airlines. I have had discussions with the people who run those airlines and they are both keen to develop the sort of thing I am talking about. I think such a trip would be of tremendous interest to those hundreds of millions of people, not all of whom can afford to travel, of <inline font-style="italic">course,</inline> although a considerable percentage of them could. </para>
          <para>My time is running out, so I will leave the subject of tourism to be developed a little further at another time and refer briefly to some of the things that have been done for Tasmania in this Budget. Again, I regard the Budget as being good not only in broad terms but also in relation to the particular interest areas that I have. I am delighted to find that the Tasmanian Fish Centre in Hobart, notwithstanding the protestations of the Labor Minister in Tasmania, has received $234,000 in this Budget. Apparently the Minister is complaining that it did not get enough. Some $200,000 has been provided for the development of a pilot industrial site at Legana, $3,000 for the re-equipment of the Launceston precision tool annexe, and the $400,000 I have already mentioned for Port Arthur. All of those things are important to Tasmania and to Tasmania&#39;s development. However, one matter of greater importance is the continuation of the freight equalisation scheme. Whenever I hear people say that that was something to do with the Labor Party I feel like - </para>

              <para>- I feel like getting agitated; thank you. I want to go back into the history of that scheme. It arose out of the recommendations of a committee of this Senate. It is part of the value of this Senate and of the way in which it operates. I get so sick of hearing people such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> knocking the Senate as an institution, as he was doing a little earlier. It was out of the reference to a Senate committee of the Australian National Line freight rates to and from Tasmania that the whole freight equalisation scheme arose. It was through that reference that the scheme was developed, and I am delighted to say that the reference to the committee was a Liberal Party initiative. I am not saying that the Labor Party had nothing to do with it. I am saying that it was an initiative which came out of the Liberal Party; it was an initiative which was developed by a Senate committee and was carried on from there. </para>

          <para>The Maritime College is to receive nearly $ 10m under the current Budget. The college represents another major development for Tasmania which came as a result of an initiative of the Liberal Party, notwithstanding that from time to time it is claimed that that is not so. When I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> say earlier tonight that he had been trying for years to get some commitment out of the Liberal Party in relation to the second Hobart bridge, I wondered what on earth he had been doing. In 1974 that commitment was given by the then Leader of the Liberal Party. It was repeated by the then Leader of the Liberal Party in March 1975 and repeated again in November 1975. It has been a continuing commitment of the Liberal Party from the time it was first announced in 1974. It was our initiative and not that of the Labor Party, and I find it very hard to understand how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> could have the gall to come in here and claim some sort of credit for the Labor Party and some sort of criticism for the present Government. I compliment the Government on the Budget. I am delighted to be able to talk about things in which I am interested and have developed. I wish that I had longer to speak because there are so many other things in the Budget about which one could talk. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I ask the Minister for Transport whether it is a fact that the original tender documents for car rental concessions at Commonwealth airports provided that the third or local car rental concessionaire could not sell or assign his right to operate to another party. Were the terms and conditions of contracts changed after tenders had been accepted to enable the third operator to sell or assign with the approval of the Secretary to the Minister&#39;s Department? Has this enabled Avis, which missed out as one of the national operators, to purchase from Elite and Thrifty rent-a-car firms their concessions at Hobart, Devonport, Wynyard, Canberra, Adelaide, Perth and Coolangatta, thus enabling Avis to link up with its own concessions as third operator giving it rent-a-car concessions at 90 per cent of prime airport locations for a fraction of the price paid by Hertz and Budget? Who gave the authority for this action? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">At this point the Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> said: &#39;Scandalous&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline> the Minister for Transport said- it is very revealing- &#39;There is nothing scandalous yet. Just wait and be patient&#39;. I am sure that this will prove to be a Freudian slip. He went on to say: &#39;There will be nothing scandalous about this matter by the time it is completed &#39;. I want to give some background to the matter and to the Minister&#39;s response. At 2 p.m. on 9 March 1979 tenders closed for the rental car concessions at the 58 Commonwealth airports owned and controlled by the Federal Department of Transport. The original tender document C3/79/10 contained an appendix B headed Terms and Conditions to be observed by Concessionaires&#39;. Section 6, dealing with the assignment of rights, stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The concessionaire shall not assign or sell any privileges or rights arising under this authority or sub-let any part or parts of the business, except that he may appoint persons as his agent on franchise for the purpose of conducting the business at any of the airports. The concessionaire shall not permit any person so approved to conduct the business otherwise than in the name of the concessionaire. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">On this basis, Hertz, Budget and Avis tendered for two national concessions. Budget, Avis and a number of small rent-a-car firms tendered for various third or local concessions. When the results of the tenders were announced, Hertz had won the No. 1 position with a tender of $8.1m and Budget the No. 2 position with a tender of $3.2m. Avis, the holder of the position for sole operation for a number of years, had missed out with a bid of $3.1m. However, Avis had been successful for the third operation spot at Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Cairns, Mackay, Mount Isa, Rockhampton, Townsville, Launceston, Port Hedland and Alice Springs. A variety of other firms had won the third operation spot at the other airports. </para>
          <para>Shortly afterwards it was announced that Avis, in complete breach of the tender documents, had negotiated the purchase of the concessions at Hobart, Devonport and Wynyard from Elite and at Canberra, Adelaide, Perth and Coolangatta from Thrifty Rent-a-Car. The figure for the purchase has been suggested as between $ 1.5m and $1.6m. Avis therefore had gained access to the 18 prime airports that generate 90 per cent of traffic for a figure of around $2m which is twothirds of what Budget had paid and for onequarter of what Hertz Rent-a-Car had paid. When the documents of contract were returned to the other companies it was noted that a significant change had occurred that altered the whole meaning of the original tender documents. </para>
          <para class="block">The alteration had occurred to appendix B which I quoted before and which now reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The concessionaire shall not assign or sell any privileges or rights arising under the authority - </para>

It is now quite clear to a number of people who have examined these documents that some person or persons in the Government acted in an immoral, unethical and corrupt way to advantage Avis Rent-a-Car and therefore Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. If the Facom- IBM incident was a scandal for this Government I believe that the issue that I have raised tonight will prove to be a disaster for this Government. </para>

            <para>- The information I have relating to the matter that has been brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> is that the general wording that was originally placed in the documents, as I understand it, would obviously convey the meaning that any transfer of rental car concessions at airports would not be in order unless it were done with the approval of the Department of Transport or its principal officer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> castigated the Government and suggested that something untoward had happened. According to the principle outlined by the honourable senator, a transport concessionaire at an airport who was going bankrupt and wanted to get rid of his concession could not do so because he had agreed to a provision preventing the transfer of his concession. Provided the Government or the Secretary to the Department of Transport approved the sale or transfer, it would be acceptable. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I understand it, the words which were originally used, were inserted to protect the Commonwealth. The tender documents did say that the concession was not to be sold or assigned. Of course the intention was that it was not to be sold or assigned without Commonwealth approval. The honourable senator may have knowledge of some documents in which he says the wording has been changed substantially, although the words he quoted did not suggest to me that it is a substantial change. There is some lack of commercial understanding. If a proprietary company or a public company were a successful tenderer and the shares in the proprietary company or the public company were bought out by another concessionaire then, according to the honourable senator&#39;s argument, the sale or transfer would be readily acceptable because at law ownership had not changed. As I understand it, it is a matter of getting authority from the Department of Transport or the principal officer of that Department. I do not see any point at all in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> has raised but I will refer the matter to the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon).</inline></para>

A condition of this fare is that the length of air travel must exceed 1,000 kms but that the sectors travelled need not be consecutive. This fare would appear to offer considerable benefits to international visitors to the Commonwealth Games in 1982. </para>
