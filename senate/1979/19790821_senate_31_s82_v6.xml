The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or equivalent free voting procedures.&#39; (Article 21 (1) and (3).) </para>
        <para>Elections for Senators meet all requirements except one. Senators are elected periodically, by secret ballot, with universal franchise, and the quota-preferential method of proportional representation ensures that the vote values within states are equal as nearly as can be. </para>

Let me simply say that the track record of governments of our philosophy and kidney is such that they have always shortened up, so much so that for 58 of the 78 years since Federation the people of Australia have had the eminent good sense to choose us, as they will again when next we go to the electors. </para>

            <para>- I understand that discussions have taken place between the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Australian Soccer Federation to enable closer consideration to be given to the rules related to the entry of soccer players from overseas to engage under contract with clubs in Australia. The aspects of most concern to both parties have been the standard of players to be admitted, their transfer between clubs after arrival, possible limits to be imposed on the number of overseas players represented in any one team, and the maximum period of stay. There is agreement on the need to introduce specific guidelines which will ensure that all clubs observe the rules - laid down and that young Australian players of talent will not be denied access to the senior levels of the sport. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A significant factor in the review of the rules relating to the entry of overseas players has been the restriction which to date has operated against local players. The Australian Soccer Federation has advanced measures to control the numbers and standard of players to be admitted from overseas, allowing for the rules which operate in other soccer-playing countries. Currently these proposals are being examined by the Government and there should be no difficulty in their early implementation, should they be agreed to. </para>

            <para>- One thing is certain: History will record that the huge and talked-up increase in wages by the Whitlam Government- 35 per cent in one year, 75 per cent over 3 years- was the prime cause of the disastrous inflation which hit Australia. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> is asking, whether there has been a direct link between the increase in wages and inflation, the answer is yes; the Whitlam Government&#39;s disastrous regime stands historically to prove it. That principle runs, and in no way is it a denial of what has been said. </para>

              <para>-Clearly the Minister did not understand the original question, so I shall ask it again in a different form. As at the last national wage case under this Government, that is, in the last six months and in the life of this Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street, Mr Fraser,</inline> and the Minister himself in this place each said that wage increases were a cause of inflation and that there should be no wage increases.

Is the Minister aware of the claims reported in the Australian of 3 August 1979 that, unless the island is proclaimed a national park, several species of birds on the island may become extinct? Is the Minister aware also of the possibility that one day the island will feature on the World Heritage list, earmarked for preservation at all costs? To what extent does the Commonwealth Government regard this matter as part of its responsibility or the responsibility of its instrumentalities? Does the Minister agree that immediate action must be taken to prevent any further destruction of the island &#39;s habitat? If so, will he assure the Senate that strong pressure will be brought upon the New South Wales Government to have the island declared a national park, managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service? </para>

          <para>- First of all, my understanding is that the use of the word &#39;gagged&#39; is a little exaggerated as arrangements were made with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> within a time program to permit him the right to move, as all honourable senators have the right to move, that a private member&#39;s Bill may be read a second time. In fact he enjoyed the same privilege as any private member has enjoyed with respect to a private member&#39;s Bill at any time in this place. So we put aside the superlatives. I and the Government will give consideration to the matter. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. As the announcement appears imminent of the selection as the main artillery weapon of the Australian Army of the 155 millimetre gun, which will be of overseas design and possibly of overseas manufacture, will the Minister initiate the design and manufacture of a close-support infantry weapon to replace the 105 millimetre gun at present in service, which is at least 45 years old? By way of information, all the research and development activity in ordnance around the world is directed towards 155 millimetre and heavier calibres, for the obvious reason that they permit the development of precision - </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister blames poor communications for the Government&#39;s current position, what is the function and use of the Government&#39;s media information unit, which employs at least six journalists on salaries of about $26,000 each? If that unit has not been effective, will the Government, in line with its views on inefficient civil servants, retire members of its media unit by management directive? </para>

            <para>- That question comes strangely from a member of a party which had a mass propaganda unit infinitely larger than anything this Government could dream up and which supports the Wran Labor Government, which spends millions of dollars a year on a mass communications unit. May I say simply that in the Whitlam case no amount of public relations could sell a bad product. The people of Australia gave no repeat order to the Whitlam Government, as they will not give one to the Wran Government. They give repeat orders to our side of politics because our products are right and are judged to be right, even though from time to time our public relations is not as good as that of the Opposition. It is the product that counts in the end, not slick words. </para>

I want to deny categorically that any such statement was made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gyngell</inline> or any member of the Tribunal by any officer of my Department. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The advice given to the Tribunal in relation to this or any other inquiry in which it is engaged is purely legal advice. It is not concerned with the substance of the matter before the Tribunal. The officer was there purely to give the Tribunal some help and guidance in relation to legal questions which arose. The honourable senator asked me to indicate what advice had been given to the Tribunal. In the first place, I am informed from discussions I have had with the officer concerned that the advice given was oral advice about the powers of the Tribunal in relation to the issues that arose in that inquiry. It is not the practice to disclose any legal advice given by my Department to any departments. Therefore, I do not propose to disclose the nature of the advice or to table any opinions that may be given by my Department in relation to other matters. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Did the Prime Minister announce on 20 February the Australian Government&#39;s willingness to provide personnel from the Australian armed forces to serve in a United Nations task force in Namibia? Since that date have there been major developments in Namibia which might affect Australia&#39;s position? I instance the varying statements by the South West African People &#39;s Organisation- Swap - about Australia &#39;s participation; the opening of a South African based National Assembly in Namibia during May; South Africa&#39;s announced plans for Namibian independence; certain activities by the United Nations General Assembly in May, including the appointment of another ambassador to deal with the matter; the Lusaka decisions relating to Zimbabwe; and the replacement of the liberal Administrator of Namibia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Martin Steyn, by the  chairman  of the arch reactionary B roe der bond of South Africa, Professor Garret Viljoen. Do any of these developments affect Australia&#39;s commitment to send Service personnel to this area? Given the importance of such an overseas commitment, will the Minister bring this matter up for debate in the Senate and thus ensure that Parliament examines this issue before Australian lives are put at potential risk in southern Africa? </para>

            <para>-The Minister for Transport has advised me that in preparing official authority documents for the successful tenderers some variations were made to the wording of the clauses which had appeared in the tender schedule. The variations were designed to express more clearly the conditions of the authority. They are not regarded as changing the conditions of the tender, but simply as expressing the conditions more explicitly in the form of a legal instrument. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable senator&#39;s question is probably referring to recent publicity surrounding a variation in the clause relating to transfer of the authorities. The tender document included wording to the effect that the authorities were not transferable. This was designed to ensure that the Commonwealth&#39;s interests were protected and that transfers could not be effected without approval. In the authorities which have been issued this clause has been amplified to include the words &#39;without the approval of the secretary&#39;. Authorities issued under the provisions of the Airports (Business Concessions) Act 1959 have always been regarded as transferable assets. It is therefore common practice for such authorities to contain a condition prohibiting sale without the prior approval of the Commonwealth. The previous authority held by Avis Rent-a-Car System Pty Ltd contained such a provision, and clause 6 of the advertised conditions of the relevant tender was intended as a similar limitation on transfer. </para>

This was a major statement and canvassed the full range of issues including the central role of Vietnam in the refugee outflow from Indo-China. The question of any further statements on issue at this time will depend on developments, particularly those affecting the undertakings given by Vietnam at the Geneva meeting to restrict the disorderly outflow of refugees from Vietnam. </para>

          <para>Honourable senators will be aware that the Minister announced at the Geneva meeting that Australia&#39;s intake of Indo-Chinese refugees in 1979-80 would be increased from 10,500 to 14,000. This increase will mean that by June 1980 Australia will have accepted over 37,000 Indo-Chinese refugees. In the 1978-79 program year Australia contributed $8. 39m in support of Indo-Chinese refugee operations in South-East Asia, $6. 19m of which was a direct contribution to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The other major matter was the decision that the Government would move to establish a refugee advisory body. Arrangements to establish the council and its terms of reference and consideration of who might serve on it are under active consideration. These details will be announced in due course. Beyond that, I am unable to state when the Minister may make any definitive statement on this matter. </para>

Is it also a fact that the Minister took similar action, under section 29 ( 1 ), in the newsagents &#39; case? Consequently, I ask the Minister again whether he will examine the agreement by referring it to the Trade Practices Consultative Committee, which he established on 28 June 1978 to advise him on matters such as the one in question? </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources. It follows the announcement that the Government intends to sell its share in the Ranger uranium project. I ask: Does the Government intend to give its present partners first option on the shares? If so, under what terms of valuation and conditions will this be done? If not, will the shares be sold to Australian interests, after consultation with the Ranger partners and, if necessary, will sufficient time be given to permit those companies with the highest beneficial Australian interest to participate? If the answer to these two questions is no, what is the present situation in regard to the disposal of Federal Government shares in Ranger? </para>

              <para>-Senator Wriedt says that it is shameful. That may be his opinion. The Government has made clear, as I have just quoted from the Minister- from the original statements made in August 1977 in regard to its policy in relation to uranium- its own view as to its disagreement with the fundamental philosophy. It was a philosophy of participation by government. It was the Labor Government&#39;s philosophy. The Labor Government entered into the Memorandum of Understanding. We decided that we had to honour it. We made it clear that it was contrary to our own philosophy. We are now, as I have said, indicating a consideration of the proposals of interested parties who are prepared to make a satisfactory proposition as far as the Government&#39;s interest in the project is concerned. This matter has nothing whatever to do with the implementation of the policies that the Government has framed in relation to the development of uranium mining. </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. Has the Minister for Transport given permission for the operation of executive-type jet aircraft in the 1 1 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew period at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport? If so, was this decision taken without any consultation with the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport Noise Abatement Committee? Has the Minister also given his permission for the provisions of the curfew to be changed to permit certain international jets to land until midnight? </para>

            <para>-I refer the Minister for Social Security to a case of a very courageous mother of seven from Hobart who recently had her widows pension restored and was paid some $10,000 after taking out a High Court writ against officers of the Minister&#39;s Department. Was the money paid to this lady in replacement of the pension that she had previously been refused? What action has been taken against those officers who refused her this pension in October 1977 and then allowed the situation to go on until a High Court writ was necessary? Have the guidelines pertaining to bona fide domestic relationships, which were an issue in this case, been changed as a result of the case? If so, how will this affect the thousands of other women in this country who have been refused pensions for similar reasons? </para>

            <para>- The first part of the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> referred to the money paid to the person concerned in replacement of the pension. If I recall correctly, part of the money was paid to her. The other part of it, I think, may have been reimbursed to the State department which had paid allowances to her during the period she was deemed by my Department not to be eligible for the pension. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As far as I am aware, there was no requirement for action to be taken against the officers concerned. This matter concerns the determination of eligibility for a pension; and on grounds which were reasonable to the officers concerned a determination was made. I am not aware whether the Director-General has altered the guidelines with regard to pensions as a result of this case. I think that the manual states the terms of eligibility required in the Department&#39;s work with regard to all pensions and benefits. I am not aware of any need to change these as a result of the particular case that has been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes.</inline></para>

              <para>- Neither I nor anyone else would be in a position to say what would be upheld in a court prior to a court hearing. As far as the reversal of the decision is concerned, I understand that there was a continuing review of this matter through Social Security Appeals Tribunals and in other ways throughout the period of the matter we are discussing. I cannot make an assumption on the basis of unheard court cases, nor would I presume to give some prior knowledge of what determinations would be made in a court. I am saying only that this matter was the subject of review and that, in the final instance, the review determined that the pension should be made available to her retrospectively. I understand that the matter has been concluded. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, refers to a ruling which we have been told comes from Canberra and affects the payment of family allowances to parents of handicapped children. I understand that one case has been sent to the Minister. Yesterday two cases were brought to my notice. In one case a parent who had put a child into an approved home for a holiday rest for 1 S days was told finally that she had lost both payments for the whole month. In the other case the period was just as brief. As this is a great injustice, I ask whether the Minister will reconsider what seems to be a most recent policy. If the children are in homes on the fourteenth or fifteenth of a month the parent loses both payments for the full month. </para>

Because of the increasing cost and the risk of irregular supplies of oil-based fuels for rural production, will the Government consider allowing small distilleries to be operated in country areas to provide ethanol or grain alcohol as a fuel supplement and, depending on the product used for distillation, a high protein stock food as a by-product? </para>

As to those matters I am not aware that the Government has responded. I will bring the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the question and seek a response for the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. I refer to the questions which have been asked this afternoon relating to the proposed sale of the Government&#39;s interest in the Ranger uranium project. I ask: While the Government is considering the sale of its Ranger interests, will it also, consistent with its philosophy, consider further the sale of Trans-Australiann Airlines to a public listed company to be incorporated by the Commonwealth, in relation to which at least 50 per cent of the shares are offered to employees and in which the Commonwealth may retain some of the shares, and that other limited size holdings be offered to small investors? </para>

            <para>- May I first of all detach the propaganda of the first part of the question. Let me make it perfectly clear that our criticism of the Whitlam Government&#39;s long range of appointments and jobs for the boys was that they were political and without merit- &#39;no damn merit&#39;, as I think the phrase was on another occasion. Directing myself to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> &#39;Byrne&#39;s question, he will of course have refrained from informing the Senate and the people of Australia of the singular capacity and experience of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eggleton</inline> in the field of the Commonwealth of Nations, he having been, over the years, directly associated with those institutions and with their leaders and, therefore, having a particular quality of value and experience not only to the Prime Minister and the Government but also to the people of Australia. Let me make it clear that it is only the Labor Party that regrets the great success of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> at Lusaka. That success was in some measure due to the advisers around him. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eggleton</inline> secured leave of absence. Unlike the Labor Party, when the Commonwealth Government uses advisers it uses people of singular expertise and experience, and in this case there are few people with more experience in this field than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eggleton.</inline></para>

            <para>- I thank the honourable senator for his comments about the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. It certainly is worthy of the support of all. I know that it has that support from the Opposition as well as from the Government. The honourable senator asked whether the CSIRO is involved in research on the extraction of oil from coal. As part of the general package of energy research that has been put down, that subject certainly is one for assessment by the Government. </para>

          <para>CSIRO has been involved for some years now, basically in Sydney, in what is known as the flash pyrolysis method of extraction of oil from coal and has been particularly successful in that respect. The honourable senator asked whether the answer could be put in dollar terms. Over a period of some years CSIRO has been involved in the extraction of oil from coal, using the particular method I mentioned. The various consequences of that and the testing of the product, which is carried out in another area of CSIRO &#39;s operation at Fishermen&#39;s Bend in Melbourne, would be inputs into the cost of the extraction of oil from coal. However, if the honourable senator has a genuine question in relation to the cost and cares to put the question on notice, I will seek an answer for him. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development, ls it a fact that between 1972 and 1975 oil exploration, as measured by the number of wells drilled, declined to a negligible figure and that since 1975 oil exploration has been re-established in this country? Is it also a fact that no incentive will be given to oil explorers in their search for oil if a secondary profits-related resources tax, which is now the inflexible and committed policy of the Australian Labor Party, is imposed on the oil industry? </para>

            <para>-Although I do not have the actual figures in front of me, I agree in broad terms with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> has said. During the time of the Labor Government there was the greatest disincentive and discouragement in regard to the search for oil and gas. There was a steady decline in that area of activity, as indeed there was in many other areas of resource investment and development. The present Government has been able to revive a good deal of activity in this field, particularly since its world parity pricing policies have been implemented and understood. As the Senate would know, the Government was faced with the question of the effect of a resources tax in this area. It considered the matter but rejected such a tax because of the very clear disincentive effect it would have on investment in this and other vital areas of resources development. The Labor Party has adopted the same policy again, and if it were faced with responsibility in this area again, that policy would have the same effect as it had previously. </para>

            <para>-I ask the Attorney-General: Was a complaint received by the Commissioner for Community Relations from the Winch in am and Burden groups of Aborigines in Queensland that the Queensland Government was acting in breach of the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act in refusing the transfer to such groups of land intended to be purchased? Did the Commissioner, in accordance with section 22 of the Racial Discrimination Act, call a conference of representatives of all parties concerned to try to resolve the matter? Were two Queensland State Ministers and two State Government officials directed to attend the conference and did they fail to attend? Did the complainants seek a certificate under section 24 of the Act to permit further proceedings? In the circumstances, did the Commissioner have a statutory responsibility to issue the certificate? As reported in the Press, did the Attorney-General pressure the Commissioner to neglect his statutory responsibility and not issue the certificates? </para>

            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has suggested, a conference was called by the Commissioner for Community Relations on alleged racial discrimination by Ministers and, I think, two officials of the Queensland Government. It was called by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> and the Ministers and the two Queensland officials were instructed to attend. This is a question of long standing. Some time ago the Solicitor-General gave an opinion on the power of the Commissioner for Community Relations to call State Ministers to a conference of this kind. I wrote to the Commissioner for Community Relations and drew his attention to the opinion of the Solicitor-General and expressed my view and my agreement with it. I explained to him what in our opinion were the limits on his powers. That letter was conveyed to the Commissioner for Community Relations. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I can assume only that that is what it has been alleged constitutes pressurising of the Commissioner. All I was doing was drawing his attention to his legal powers and asking him to observe the limits of his legal powers. I specifically said in the letter that under the statute he was not, in the performance of his powers and functions, subject to direction by me or by any other Minister. As the first law officer of the Commonwealth 1 felt that it was my responsibility to inform him what his powers were. That is all I did. </para>

            <para>-Senator Puplick asked me earlier in the day an important question regarding Namibia. I have some information. I am advised that since the Parliament last met there has been no real progress towards implementation of the Western-United Nations plan for a Namibian independent settlement. Developments over the past few months within Namibia, including the installation on 2 1 May of the internally elected Namibian Constituent Assembly as a national assembly with legislative powers and reports of continuing armed clashes between the South African forces and the South West African People&#39;s Organisation can only further retard prospects for an early implementation of the plan. At the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Lusaka the heads of government deplored South Africa&#39;s attempt to establish an illegal national assembly as the developments contravened Security Council resolutions and were in defiance of the efforts of the international community to bring an end to South Africa&#39;s illegal occupation of Namibia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government has consistently supported the Western-Security Council plan for Namibia and believes it is most important for the future stability of southern Africa that it be put into effect. For this reason the Government is glad that the door to negotiations is being kept open and that discussions between the Five and the South African Government through the agency of the Five&#39;s special envoy. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir James</inline> Murray, will continue. </para>
          <para>The Minister has previously outlined in another place some of the difficulties still to be resolved- the question of recoupment of Swap forces within Namibia, monitoring Swap forces in neighbouring countries and agreement on the composition of the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group. South Africa maintains that all Swap forces should be confined to recoupment centres in neighbouring countries- for example, Angola and Zambia- whilst the Secretary-General, in accordance with the Western plan, has proposed  the establishment of a number of centres within Namibia to house such Swap forces as may be inside Namibia at the start of a ceasefire. The Australian offer to contribute an engineering unit, in response to informal approaches in New York, remains contingent upon final agreement emerging between the parties on the implementation of the United Nations plan. </para>

          <para>- by leave- I think it is essential that at the beginning of a new session we make provision for ample discussion at a later date on these various statements on international disasters. There is no question that the magnitude of each new oil spill seems to be increasing. Some questions have never been resolved and one of them was touched on in the first report of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson.</inline> A number of other House of Representatives and Senate committees have considered the matter further. However nobody on the Government side has been very clear cut in relation to oil exploration mishaps and their effect on yachtsmen, fishermen or people at large and liability under the Navigation Act or the Tanker Owners Voluntary Agreement concerning liability for oil pollution. This is quite apart from the environment damages which may result. It is one matter about which we should have a more clear cut understanding. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> would be aware, the establishment of the Australian Marine College in Tasmania will improve the quality of our master mariners and the maritime work force generally and I know that amendments are contemplated to the Navigation Act. However, on the question of tanker mishaps as distinct from oil exploration mishaps, the Government has not indicated that it is prepared to outlaw inefficient vessels that masquerade under Liberian or Panamanian flags. These matters, coupled with the oil exploration mishap off the coast of Mexico, are matters on which we want full and frank discussion. </para>
        <para>We are- I suppose it is debatable at times- a States House. We have relations with the various States. Without canvassing a dispute with honourable senators from the northern State of Queensland, 1 point out that our nearest major mishap was the <inline font-style="italic">Oceanic Grandeur</inline> disaster. There was a slanging match between Federal transport officers and State marine officers about who was right and who was wrong. Fortunately, I suppose, mother nature intervened and the effect of the tides was such that no major damage claims resulted. </para>
        <para>I will round off my remarks because I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mason,</inline> a fellow member of the Senate Committee on Science and the Environment wishes to supplement them. I believe that we cannot go on and on living in a fool &#39;s paradise and believing that it will not happen here. It can and will happen here. Unless we have devised iron clad relations, as between Federal and State governments, to minimise the possibilities, we could have a disaster of amazing magnitude. I will conclude on that note. </para>

          </talker>
          <para>-by leave- I rise to refer briefly to this matter now because I am a little concerned, in view of recent international events such as the Mexican oil spill, about the text of the statement of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)-</inline> a view expressed also by honourable senators, particularly in the last session during the debate on the Great Barrier Reef- that somehow nothing is going to happen for the oil industry has reached a stage of technology where it is impossible for there to be major spills, wells can be capped and other measures taken to clean up or prevent a spill from becoming dangerous. In that regard I can only support the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> that a sort of &#39;in-God-we-trust&#39; attitude is not good enough. Such an attitude is reflected in the Minister&#39;s statement, when he says:   . . although the possibility exists of large scale pollution from shipping, off-shore operations or land installations, experience has shown that the risk factors are extremely low. This is due to the low density of shipping around Australia and to the operating procedures followed on off-shore platforms and at shore installations. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">When one reads the proceedings of overseas parliaments, and other organisations, including that of the California legislature, in regard to this matter, those words have a very familiar ring. The view has always been that it will not happen here. What we have to consider is what we will do if it does happen here. </para>
        <para>When we come back to questions of oil drilling in certain parts of the Australian off-shore waters, surely we must go further than generalities and deal with specific matters. For instance, I would hope, as the Minister has mentioned, that one of the recommendations that will be carried through- the monitoring of international developments- will include a careful study of the history of major oil spills throughout the world in recent years and, further, that such information will then be collated and considered within the context of Australian weather, tidal and geographic patterns, because experience has shown that measures which can be taken to prevent or control oil spills differ greatly in different geographic situations. One would hope that, particularly if there is to be any question of oil exploration on, or exploitation of, the Great Barrier Reef, there should be prepared through this mechanism which the Government has provided- the monitoring of international developments- a specific model, available to the Australian people and to this Parliament, as to exactly what would happen if there were a major oil spill in areas of the Great Barrier Reef in which there are proposals to drill. I believe that once we have this information we will be in a position to judge whether such exploration should proceed. I believe that without that information it would be dangerous and irresponsible to do so. </para>
        <para>The second major point that I wish to make concerns the question of funding. The report of the Minister says that a number of useful measures have not been carried through because, in some instances, of a problem of non availability of funds. These include such things as compulsory pilotage, imposing restricted areas around off-shore platforms, the widening of recommended tracks on navigation charts, the provision of increased funds for hydrography work, and the extension of the national plan to other hazardous substances. </para>
        <para>All of these, except the last, have, I believe, a direct relationship to the tanker industry. I am wondering how that industry and the oil companies seem to have such a good lobby that the statement can be made that the view is not accepted by the Department of Transport or by the shipping industry that tanker operators should pay a larger share of levies because &#39;in Australian waters tankers are no more frequently the source of marine pollution than other vessels&#39;. Surely this misses the point completely. If an ordinary merchantman were unlucky enough to sink or go aground there would not be major pollution, but if it happened to an oil tanker there would indeed be pollution on a large scale. So guarding against that possibility in the future is what we ought to be considering, and I suggest that in this case the Government ought to consider going to the shipping industry and saying: Yes, if you do operate oil tankers it is essential, based on world experience, that you pay a levy, and that the resulting funds be used to plan for the future in a responsible way. &#39; </para>
        <para>Finally, for many decades- it is decades now there have been attempts by many well intentioned people to get going a world organisation that is capable of dealing with oil spills. They have never succeeded. I ask the Australian Government at this stage to use its influence in international forums to see that that is done. I believe that is possibly the answer. Oil spills are now so enormous that to control them is beyond the ability of a single country. There again, we would hope that the planning organisation that we now have would study carefully which methods- bacterial, booming, air drops- have been used in other parts of the world, so that when we do have that oil spill of the future- and it will happen sooner or later, with tankers nearing the end of their useful lives and with greater oil exploration around this country- when that crisis comes we will be operating from a basis of knowledge and preparedness, rather than one of panic and complete ignorance. </para>

In indicating briefly what the four Bills do, I make a fairly redundant speech, I think, because the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> has already done that. The first of the Bills, the Northern Territory Supreme Court (Repeal) Bill 1979, repeals the Northern Territory Supreme Court Act of 1961-68 in order that the 1979 Act may come into effect on a day to be proclaimed. There is in the Bill a number of transitional provisions in relation to appeal proceedings, pending before the High Court and the Federal Court of Australia, from decisions of the old Supreme Court. These preserve that right of appeal. Under clause 6, the repeal provisions will not affect the appointment of judges to the Federal Court of Australia where such appointments have been made before the commencing date. There are a number of other transitional provisions in that Bill. </para>

              <para>-No. It has brought <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> in. We always expect some noise from that side when she is present. I was speaking to the Judiciary Amendment Bill. Clause 3 of the Bill provides that Section 67b of the principal Act will allow the Commonwealth and the Territory to sue each other at law in equity or in tort in the new Supreme Court of the Territory. There are also provisions which will allow actions by way of prerogative writs in the Supreme Court against the Commonwealth or its officers. The Bill grants the Territory&#39;s Supreme Court the powers contained in section 15(2) of the Old Act. There is also a provision which makes it clear that the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory shall have full power to make laws for the prosecution of indictable offences against the laws of the Territory in the Supreme Court. That is consistent with previous decisions of this Parliament in relation to the state of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Section 67e provides that there shall be no execution against a property or moneys of the Territory. Section 67f provides that jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory by this Act is in addition to and not in der rogation of any jurisdiction otherwise conferred on that court. There are a number of transitional provisions in this Bill. 1 will now briefly refer to the Federal Court of Australia Amendment Bill 1979. That is consequent on the provisions of the Northern Territory Supreme Court (Repeal ) Bill. The Judges&#39; Pensions Amendment Bill is also consequential and will merely change the nomenclature of judges of the Northern Territory Supreme Court in the Judges&#39; Pension Act 1968. These are, I have no doubt, very important Bills. As 1 have indicated, the Opposition does not oppose them. I hope that honourable senators were enlightened by my explanations of the respective clauses of the Bills. I wish the Bills a speedy passage. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-The substance of the High Court Justices (Long Leave Payments) Bill 1979 and the Judges (Long Leave Payments) Bill 1979 has been dealt with by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> in the second reading speech. I only want to make some very brief comments about these Bills and to move an amendment to the second reading stage of the Bills. These Bills remedy a situation that was discovered in a Senate Estimates committee as far back as April 1 977 when those three outstandingly diligent senators, Senators Wright, James McClelland and Wheeldon, in the course of their duties on an Estimates committee, raised questions about the capacity of the Government to make long service leave payments to Federal judges. Honourable senators will recall these questions being raised at the time. It appeared that the payments, which were in the form of a gratuity, were made by virtue of a convention that one suspects the High Court had established for itself. Under that convention the judges got a pot of gold at the end of the judicial rainbow which was provided for by the Government. As I understand it, the amount was essentially determined by the judges themselves. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The three honourable senators to whom I referred raised questions as to the validity and desirability of payments being made in this way to judges. This legislation reflects the view that the Government now considers that it is more appropriate for these payments to be legislated for as, of course, other long service leave payments in respect of ordinary people are legislated for. It has taken a very long time for the Attorney-General to bring these Bills to the Senate consequent upon that Estimates committee of April 1 977. One makes no further comment about that. We welcome them as necessary legislation and do not dispute that long service leave payments for judges should be legislated for. </para>
          <para>However, there are a couple of matters in the Bills which we regard as unsatisfactory. The first relates to the arrangements for payment of long service leave to judges. These Bills provide for no pro rata payment of long service leave in the event of a judge leaving the bench prior to 10 years of service being completed. The Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976, which deals with other Commonwealth employees, provides for a pro rata payment in respect of termination of service before the expiration of 10 years. </para>
          <para>It is important to remember that a number of desirable points should be taken into account in considering the whole question of payment of long service leave, and that it is important in any legislation which comes before this Parliament that there should be a consistency of approach about the payment of long service leave entitlement. I say that because with the consequences of the greater incursions into the working lives of most people in the community which I believe are likely to follow from technological change, and the consequences of what is sometimes termed in the jargon the post-industrial society, more and more as a legislature, we will have to examine the provisions pertaining to the formal provision of periods of leisure in the course of people&#39;s working lives. </para>
          <para>It is desirable that we develop some consistency in the principles which apply and see that as far as possible key principles apply across the board and apply to judges as well as everybody else. I believe we have to be diligent in considering such questions as the desirability of portability of long service leave entitlement and perhaps as time goes by long service leave entitlement accruing after much shorter periods and being made available to people in part time employment. We must consider also the important question of pro rata payments to people whose employment is terminated prior to the expiration of the period in respect of which they are eligible for full long service leave entitlements </para>
          <para>In the course of discussing this legislation I wish to draw attention to the fact that there are quite disgracefully discriminatory provisions in long service leave legislation throughout Australia. I am not referring only to Commonwealth legislation but also, more particularly, to State legislation, which I would think covers the vast majority of employees for long service leave entitlement. In that context it is important that the Australian Government should set the pace in terms of setting uniform, and perhaps better, standards for long service leave. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the sorts of situations which arise when long service leave is not payable on a pro rata basis prior to a lengthy period of employment. Anyone who is experienced in law or industrial relations will be familiar with numerous cases of companies which, if long service leave is provided for after 10 years, adopting the practice of examining their staffing situation and getting rid of people at the expiration of about nine and a half years service. There is some point in looking at the desirability of introducing pro rata payments on a wider basis to try to stop that practice. It is a principle which should be enshrined in all long service leave legislation. </para>
          <para>Similarly, employees who have been with a company for a long time but who have served for less time than the period needed to accrue absolute rights to payment of long service leave often feel themselves financially bound to remain with the one employer for fear of forfeiting those rights to long service leave entitlements. It is not only bad for an employee who remains in a work situation unhappily because financial reasons dictate that he should do so but arguably it is also bad for the economy generally in terms of the prevention of natural mobility of labour and natural choice of career and job. That is an issue which will become more and more important as society becomes increasingly technologically committed in terms of changing skills and things of that kind which will affect people&#39;s desire for mobility in employment. </para>
          <para>I raise those general issues only because I think it is important that general principles should be considered when one is talking about any legislative vehicle dealing with long service leave. I know people such as the Attorney-General hang on my every word and, if those issues are not particularly relevant to this legislation the next time long service leave legislation is introduced these sorts of matters will undoubtedly be taken into account. The problems which flow from the inflexibility of long service leave legislation throughout Australia are compounded by the worse problem with superannuation in Australia. It is not really a problem with judges but it is a problem with most employees. That problem is well illustrated by companies which, through private trust deeds governing the administration of superannuation funds, effectively bind employees for a lifetime in much the same way as I have just suggested in relation to long service leave entitlement. </para>
          <para>A second specific objection to this legislation is that under it judges will be accredited with 36 days of long service leave per year of service, whilst under the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act Commonwealth employees are entitled to a mere three-tenths of a month per year of service, which works out at approximately nine days per year of service. So there is a long service leave entitlement of nine days per year of service for Commonwealth employees generally and 36 days per year of service for judges. I am not arguing for an increase in the entitlement of Commonwealth public servants in respect of that matter; I am not arguing necessarily for a decrease in respect of judges. I am arguing for some degree of uniformity in the entitlements because, after all, the judges&#39; salaries, which of course are enormous, are presumably assessed on the basis of all the disabilities which attach to their most onerous profession. Their long service leave entitlement in terms of money reflects the onerous nature of their work long after they have, as it were, transcended the bench and entered another sphere of life on, indeed, a sphere of death, in which case the benefits flow to the widow. It is very difficult to establish what is the basis for the discrepancy for judges and other people in this legislation. Perhaps the Attorney can tell honourable senators something about that. I would have thought that the differences were most adequately compensated for in terms of judicial salaries. </para>

              <para>- I would never suggest that but I am grateful for the phrase that the honourable senator has used, because it is something about which we ought to think. The point I seek to make is about the ludicrous discrepancy, for which I do not think there is any justification, except that perhaps judges have a bit of clout with Government because of their robes and things which seem to make them more important than anybody else. As I have said, the Opposition has two objections to the legislation. For that reason I move: </para>

            <para>- I second the amendment. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> When stripped to their essentials these two Bills provide in effect for payments of the two following kinds to High Court judges in particular and to Federal judges generally. First of all, there is provision for an additional payment of 12 months&#39; salary on the retirement of the judge in question after 10 years&#39; or more service. Secondly, there is the provision for pro rata payment on death of 5.2 weeks&#39; salary for each year of service which the judge has given. These payments are expressed to be reduced by the amount of the actual long leave which the judge may have taken and to that extent the payments provided for in this legislation are payments in lieu of long service leave. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As we were told by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> when he introduced this legislation, we now have embodied in legislation that is, in the Bills before us- what hitherto has been merely the subject of administrative arrangements which as such have been the subject of considerable criticism by a Senate Estimates committee in 1977, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> pointed out. While the Opposition certainly applauds the decision, belated as it is in its accomplishment, actually to embody financial arrangements of this kind in legislative form rather than to leave them to ex gratia payments and the operation of convention and administrative arrangements, we are certainly not at all happy with the terms of this particular legislation which is now before us. </para>
          <para>The essential reasons for our unhappiness are those summarised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> in terms of the second reading amendment which is before this chamber. It seems to me that there are three basic criticisms which can be directed to these Bills. Let me spell them out in turn. The first is that, as does any payment in lieu of the taking of leave of any kind, the provisions of a lump sum cash payment here must be regarded, at least to some extent, as encouraging the acceptance by judges of payment in lieu of leave rather than the actual physical taking of leave by them. This, I understand, has been the practice for many years, particularly at the High Court level where long leave has been taken only in fairly isolated instances and has not been regarded as something which the judges took as a regular matter. However, in our view it is not desirable for judges, any more than it is for anyone else in the community, to accumulate leave of this kind and take it in cash form rather than to enjoy it as it falls due. We make this point, as the Government has been heard to make it on a number of occasions at least in the context of annual leave, particularly in the context of jobs of the kind in issue here which involve very considerable stresses and strains on the incumbents. We regard it as both appropriate and desirable that occupants of judicial office, particularly high appellate judicial office take leave as it falls due. There is an unfortunate incentive to that extent embodied in this legislation for them not to do that. </para>
          <para>The desirability of persons of this character and decision taking this leave was in fact something which was emphasised by a number of Government back benchers in another place. I recall that in May when this matter was debated in the other chamber, the honourable member for Fadden, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Donald</inline> Cameron, said: </para>

          <para class="block">That point becomes perhaps particularly pertinent to those of us who heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman,</inline> the Minister for National Development, referring this morning three times in the course of the radio program <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> to the &#39;United Arab Emigrants&#39;- not &#39;Emirates&#39; as one might have expected. As my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> said, this is something one might expect from a National Country Party Minister, but it represents a sad deterioration in standards for the once great Liberal Party. Even Ministers, it seems, from time to time require a more extended period of leave than they seem able to get under present arrangements. </para>
          <para>We would make the same point, sharing the sentiments of the honourable member for Fadden, in respect of judges. We make that point particularly in the context, as I have said, of judges of high appellate standing who are subject to very great stresses and strains and who deserve rest accordingly. There are some less than charitable souls who might hope that the leave taken by some High Court Justices would be of a more permanent character than is provided for in this particular legislation. Without going so far as to suggest anything of that kind the Opposition makes the point that judges ought to be encouraged to take leave and not simply to accumulate an entitlement and cash it in the way they are allowed to do by this particular legislation. </para>
          <para>The second and perhaps most substantial criticism of this legislation is that it sets standards for long service leave which are far in excess of the norm prevailing in the community generally and certainly in excess of the norm prevailing in the Public Service. The norm in the community generally is a figure of something like nine days of long service leave accumulated for each year of service carried out as compared with 5.2 weeks which is the relevant figure here. One cannot help but note that legislation of this kind can do nothing but encourage unions, particularly the Public Service and white collar unions, to seek the extension of benefits of this kind to themselves. No doubt when claims of this kind are made they will be met by the Government, with all the hypocrisy which it is usually able to muster on these occasions, with a clear, straightforward and unequivocal rejection. The Government is tempting fate by passing legislation of this kind and by setting standards of this kind. </para>
          <para>While it may be that judges are deserving of proper financial consideration for taking up the burdens that they do, it is difficult to argue that they are especially deserving, more so than other members of the community who work equally hard for a living. It is, it seems, just a matter of judges, whether waving their robes or exercising some other kind of strategic power, being a small group of strategically located employees who are able to exercise industrial muscle which is out of all proportion to their desserts. It is a phenomenon which this Government is not loth to criticise in a very elaborate and rumbustious form when it is experienced in other industrial contexts, and in my suggestion it is a phenomenon which the Government ought to be equally robust about condemning and rejecting when it occurs in a judicial context. It is not to the point that this legislation is simply embodying an established convention or administrative practice. If there has been such a practice which has emerged and developed over recent years to pay these sorts of sums on an ex gratia basis, it is a practice which ought to cease. In the present stringent economic and public sector financial climate that we are constantly told about, this is one particular gravy train which, in the Opposition&#39;s submission, ought to come to a halt. </para>

              <para>- I have no doubt that with the honourable senator&#39;s customary attention to detail, even from some 12,000 miles distance, he will be only too able to draw attention to any anomalies which might appear. Nor is it to the point, in case this particular matter might be thought by the Attorney-General to be relevant when he replies, that judges are deserving of some special financial consideration because in most cases they are giving up substantially greater incomes than they receive as judges on the Bench. I make the point, whether or not my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> also makes it, that barristers who get of the order of $80,000 to $ 100,000 or more per year by way of income are, by any standards, however hard they work, being overpaid. To that extent a barrister&#39;s income ought not be treated by the Government, or anyone else, as a relevant consideration when working out the kinds of fringe benefits to which judges ought to be entitled by virtue of their judicial office. Perhaps a further point that needs to be made here is that judges&#39; salaries are fixed basically by a remuneration tribunal and it is to that remuneration tribunal, in respect of Federal judges generally, that arguments of this particular kind ought to be put in order that proper considerations might be applied, rather than one-off random considerations of the kind which seem to have lain behind the initial development of this administrative practice and which are now enshrined in this particular legislation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>A third criticism which the Opposition makes of this Bill is that it does not provide- and I certainly understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> to be making this point with some vigour- any pro rata payment for justices who are forced to retire before completing 10 years&#39; service. This, in my submission, is quite anomalous, not least because, first of all, many other employees in the community- I suggest most other employees- do have pro rata provisions of some kind in their long service leave entitlements. I understand in particular that the position with respect to Commonwealth public servants under recently enacted legislation is that there is a pro rata provision which applies after only one year&#39;s service in the event of age or invalidity forcing the retirement of the public servant in question. A further anomaly that occurs to one as a result of the absence of any pro rata provision is the extraordinary one that judges may feel themselves placed by this legislation in a position where it is financially advantageous to them, or at least I suppose I should say to their families, for them to die on the job, to continue working when they are manifestly ill, rather than retiring, because if they are in a situation where they have not yet accumulated their basic 10 years&#39; service they will get no cash return in lieu of long service leave forgone. That seems to me a quite obviously anomalous provision which flows very directly from the provisions before us, and in particular the failure of those provisions to conform to the kind of provisions which are applicable in most other parts of the community, and in particular are applicable to Commonwealth employees under the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976. It is for those reasons that I support the second reading amendment which has been moved by the Opposition. </para>

            <para>-I feel that I should say a few words at least on this subject, even though I had not contemplated doing so. While I drew attention to what seemed to be some rather remarkable  inconsistency in tone and approach between the two speakers from the Opposition on one aspect, I must say that on this last aspect I also express some concern. I will not be voting for the Opposition amendment, I am not endeavouring to change the Bill, but I hope the Government will look further at this question of pro rata payments. It does seem to me that there is a great deal of sense in what has just been said about the provisions in relation to a judge who perhaps sensibly ought to retire before a period has elapsed. Not to make provision in respect of judges whilst they are made in respect of other persons, public servants and so forth, seems to me very considerably a matter of injustice and a matter of folly. So far as this aspect is concerned, I would be very interested to hear why there should not be a pro rata provision. This is why I hope that the Government will look further into this matter. If it is persuaded by some foolish propaganda by persons that it is not desirable to give judges too much, and this is thought to be something which is too much, I should like it known that I do not think it is, and I never have thought it was too much. It seems to me that this is something which the judges could rightly have expected to have had in this legislation, but it is something which is not there. Therefore, I rise to express my own concern that this provision is not in the legislation and hope that the Government will look at it again. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition has submitted an amendment that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted to provide for pro rata long leave entitlements for judges on the same basis as long leave entitlements to Commonwealth employees. It is not quite clear to me, as indeed I do not think it was clear to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen,</inline> just what is the attitude of the Opposition to this measure. I do not know whether the object of this amendment is to seek a redrafting of this Bill in order to put the long leave entitlements of judges on the same basis as Commonwealth public servants, or whether the Opposition wants to improve the Bill in order to provide this additional entitlement to pro rata leave, and presumably payment in lieu thereof. Indeed, from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said, I understood it was really the latter purpose. But in view of something that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said, and also what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> has said, it seems as though the Opposition is really opposed to the provisions for long leave which have been accorded to judges. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This legislation does not constitute a code of long leave for judges. The rights and entitlements of judges to long leave are set out in administrative arrangements which have been in existence for some years. In fact, I think it was in about 1967 that those arrangements were formally adopted by way of a Cabinet decision. Those administrative arrangements set out the entitlements to leave and also the payments which may be made in respect of leave not taken. The vast majority of Federal judges have been appointed on that basis. Indeed, I think that all High Court judges, with the exception of the Chief Justice, have been appointed on the basis of those arrangements. The taking of long leave by judges is a practice of long standing. </para>
          <para>Really, the purpose of this legislation is to give effect to an undertaking which I gave to this chamber on behalf of my predecessor, the present Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for the Capital Territory, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> in response to criticisms made in the hearings of the relevant Senate Estimates Committee in 1977, I think it was; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> mentioned the date of those hearings. As I recollect, the criticism of that Committee was not in respect of the long leave to which judges were entitled, nor was it in respect of the actual payments to which they were entitled in lieu of long leave not taken. The criticism of the Senate Estimates Committee was that those payments were not authorised by an Act of </para>
          <para class="block">Parliament but were authorised simply by the administrative arrangements to which I have referred. The only parliamentary authorisation is contained in the Appropriation Bill. Of course, it was the Appropriation Bill which the Senate Estimates Committee was considering in its hearings. </para>
          <para>The Government accepted that Committee&#39;s criticism and agreed that any payments to judges, on the highest constitutional principles, should be provided for in legislation. That is what this Bill does. As I said, it has been brought into the Parliament purely and simply to give effect to the undertaking which was given to the Parliament by my predecessor and which at the time was given specifically to this chamber by me on behalf of my predecessor. So this legislation contains no new policy at all. It is designed simply to give legislative effect to one aspect of the entitlement of judges to long leave, namely, the payments to which they are entitled in lieu of any of that leave which is not taken by them. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline>outlined some views about the nature of long leave- about what the entitlements to it should be throughout the community. What he said was of interest to me and to the Government, as it always is, despite some pessimism which he seems to have about these matters. I certainly will give regard to what he said. But I do emphasise that those entitlements of the judges are really, in a sense, accrued rights in that all the judges have been appointed on the basis of their receiving those rights. They know on appointment that those entitlements are part of the rights which they will have. From something which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said I am rather of the impression that he is not opposed to judges receiving long leave of the length to which they are entitled under these arrangements, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Evans</inline> was critical of what, as I understand it, he thought were excessive entitlements. </para>

              <para>- Quite. I am only pointing out these matters. I am not wanting to chastise the Opposition in any shape or form. What I really want to emphasise is that these are rights and entitlements on the basis of which the vast majority of the judges of Federal courts have been appointed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> talked about the mobility of labour and of how we ought to have as much uniformity as possible under these entitlements to long leave because of the greater mobility of labour. Although that undoubtedly is correct- I think that mobility of labour is a very welcome development in our modern economy- I do not think mobility of labour is likely to apply to judges. In the case of judges, virtually the only mobility would be between State and Federal judiciaries. It is a fact that recently one judge of the Family Court resigned to go back to his practice at the bar, but I think that, generally speaking, the argument about mobility in the labour force generally has little application to the judiciary. </para>

Another matter which was raised related to pro rata leave. It has not been provided for Federal judges. Indeed, from the investigations which have been made by my Department, it does not appear that it is provided in any of the States. Each of the States provides for a very substantial qualifying period before there is an entitlement to long leave. In Queensland, Victoria and South Australia, the qualifying period is seven years. In Tasmania, which incidentally provides only three months long leave, the qualifying period is five years. Western Australia provides for three months long leave after five years service or six months leave after seven years service. New South Wales provides six months long leave after five years service. So, the general principal has been against pure pro rata entitlements. As I said, all the States provide for a substantial qualifying period. Admittedly, under our provisions the qualifying period is 10 years. It might be that there is merit in the suggestion that the Commonwealth Government should look again at the actual entitlements. </para>

          <para>As I have said, this legislation is not brought forward to provide the entitlement. The entitlement is there; it has been there for many years.

The Bill has never been intended to address itself to the general matter of policy on entitlement to long leave and how it ought to be altered.

            <para>That the Senate take note of the papers. </para>
          </motion>
          <para>Tonight the Treasurer is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 1 979-80. </para>
          <para>It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the budget proposals of the Government. </para>
          <para>The purpose of a Budget Speech is not only to give details of a Government&#39;s revenue and expenditure plans for the year. </para>
          <para>It is also an occasion to take stock, to review the course of the economy over the previous year, to assess prospects and problems for the year ahead and above all to restate the basic economic policies of the Government. </para>
          <para>One persistent theme has dominated this Government&#39;s conduct of economic policy since its election in 1975. </para>
          <para>That has been the uncompromising nature of its attack upon inflation as the fundamental and most enduring cause of the economic difficulties of the 1970&#39;s. </para>
          <para>Tonight I reaffirm the determination of this Government to maintain that attack. </para>
          <para>In recent months, due largely to world wide price increases, inflationary pressures have intensified in Australia. </para>
          <para>The prime purpose, therefore, of this Budget is to respond decisively to these renewed pressures. </para>
          <para>In doing so we should not lose sight of the real gains that have been made. Despite the recent upward movement in inflation, it is still very much lower than it was several years ago. </para>
          <para>It should not be forgotten that inflation was as high as 17 per cent in the year to June 1975 and stood at 14 per cent when this Government took office. For the year to June 1979 it was 8.8 per cent which was below the average for the OECD countries. </para>
          <para>The priority given by the Government to the attack upon inflation has been vindicated by the steady improvement in Australia&#39;s economic health over the past three and a half years. </para>
          <para>That improvement strengthened and broadened in 1978-79. </para>
          <para>Real gross domestic product is presently estimated to have increased by 4.7 percent. </para>
          <para>It was, of course, a very good year for the rural sector, with a most gratifying rise in real farm product of 36 per cent. </para>
          <para>Growth elsewhere, while less spectacular, was still quite firm. </para>
          <para>On current estimates, real non-farm product grew by 2.8 percent. </para>
          <para>Business fixed investment recorded an increase of 10 per cent in real terms. </para>
          <para>Private dwelling construction has also picked up. </para>
          <para>Overall business profits improved last year. This process must continue if recovery is to be consolidated. </para>
          <para>Civilian employment grew by 1 .4 per cent over the course of the year. Most encouragingly private sector employment rose by about <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> per cent and, for the first time since 1973-74, there was a rise in jobs in manufacturing industry. </para>
          <para>Our balance of payments turned sharply for the better in the second half of the financial year. </para>
          <para>It was especially pleasing to see a strong growth in manufactured exports reflecting a substantial improvement in the competitiveness of Australian industry. </para>
          <para>Confidence in the strength and stability of the Australian economy continued to grow. </para>
          <para>Private capital inflow for 1978-79 was the largest for seven years. </para>
          <para>There was also a marked rise in the number of major investment projects foreshadowed. </para>
          <para>These developments clearly show that policies which address fundamental economic problems do yield results. </para>
          <para>Lower inflation does inspire greater confidence and encourage greater risk taking. </para>
          <para>Lower costs do make our industries more competitive; they do encourage development; and they do, thereby, provide jobs. </para>
          <para>The clear benefits of firmly pursuing an anti inflationary policy over more than three years are reason enough to reaffirm that policy tonight. </para>
          <para>Moreover, the difficulties faced by the entire industrialised world- including Australia- over the next year in responding to fresh inflationary pressures make it all the more essential that fighting inflation be the hallmark of this Budget. </para>
          <para>In doing so we should remember that no Government can guarantee that prices rises will never occur; indeed, some price rises are inevitable. </para>
          <para>The rise in the price of oil is a case in point. </para>
          <para>Our policy in respect of crude oil is to conserve our resources through a reduction in consumption, to promote exploration and to encourage the use of alternative energy sources. </para>
          <para>There is no way this policy can be effectively pursued unless the price of Australian crude oil is set at the world level. </para>
          <para>This means we now feel the full effects of price increases by the OPEC countries. </para>
          <para>Oil prices alone will add directly about 1 <inline font-style="italic">lA</inline> per cent to the Consumer Price Index in 1979. </para>
          <para>We might wish that we could isolate ourselves from the higher world oil prices. </para>
          <para>But to have persevered with the old pricing policy would merely have delayed the inevitable change and would have run counter to our energy objectives. </para>
          <para>Ultimately the change would have been forced upon us. Ultimately it would have been necessary to recognise that if something is scarce, artificially holding down its price will make it even scarcer. </para>
          <para>If we had delayed the change the eventual dislocation would have been all the greater. </para>
		  <para>THE 1978-79 BUDGET OUTCOME</para>
		  <para>The Budget deficit in 1978-79 was $665 m higher than estimated when the Budget was brought down last August. </para>
          <para>The higher deficit was not due to a relaxation of expenditure restraint. Outlays grew by 8.4 per cent which was only 0.6 per cent greater than estimated in the Budget itself. </para>
			<para>Most of the higher deficit was due to a revenue shortfall of $490m largely in the areas of provisional and company tax. </para>
			<para>Tax avoidance played no small part in the lower revenue collections in these two areas. </para>
			<para>Of the total revenue shortfall, $180m was due to tax avoidance over and above the allowance which had been made for that when the Budget figures were prepared last year. </para>
		  <para>To illustrate the continuing nature of the tax avoidance problem, I point out that the total amount of income tax outstanding at 30 June 1979 included an abnormally high figure of $433m attributable to specific tax avoidance schemes against which the Government has taken action. </para>
		  <para>This amount is in effect tax in dispute arising from these schemes. Given the nature of the processes involved, it is not assumed, for the purpose of the revenue estimates, that any of this amount will be recovered in 1 979-80. </para>
		  <para>In addition, in preparing this year&#39;s estimates of revenue it has been necessary to allow a sum of $2 50m to cover further possible loss of revenue through tax avoidance. </para>
		  <para>THE SHAPE OF THE BUDGET</para>
		  <para>I have already explained the economic needs to which this Budget must respond. </para>
		  <para>Accordingly, we have decided upon a major reduction in the size of both the total and the domestic deficits. </para>
		  <para>In doing so we have continued firm restraint over our expenditures. </para>
		  <para>The containment of Government spending has been one of the central elements of our economic policy. </para>
		  <para>It is worth noting that in the three years to 1972-73 Commonwealth Budget outlays grew by an average of 43A per cent per year in real terms; in the three years to 1975-76, by lO&#39;/i per cent per year; and in the three years to 1 978-79 by only 1 per cent per year. </para>
		  <para>There is a growing and I believe proper sentiment in the community towards lower taxation and smaller government. </para>
		  <para>However, it is all too often the case that enthusiasm for taxation reductions and for the general restraint on expenditures which makes these reductions possible is not matched by a willingness to accept the consequences of expenditure reductions in particular areas. </para>
		  <para>It is the Government&#39;s responsibility to achieve a proper balance between these competing pressures. </para>
		  <para>No one should be under any illusion that the task is easy. </para>
		  <para>It is often compounded by unexpected changes in the need for certain government services. For example, an examination of our defence needs earlier this year showed that we required a greater commitment to defence spending. </para>
		  <para>This priority will undoubtedly command the support of the Australian community but, obviously, it comes at a price. </para>
		  <para>Furthermore, the need for social security spending- which is the largest single item in the Budget- can increase through circumstances not always within the control of any government. </para>
		  <para>The proportion of social welfare pension and benefit recipients in the community has about doubled since 1971-72. </para>
		  <para>Whilst a considerable part of this increase results from an extension of benefits such as the removal of the means test for those aged over 70 and the introduction of the sole parent benefit, social and demographic factors have also swollen the social welfare bill. </para>
		  <para>These include the aging of the population, the greater tendency towards early retirement, the increased incidence of single parent families, and a sharp rise in the number of World War II veterans becoming eligible for the service pension. </para>
		  <para>However, all in all, this Government&#39;s record in expenditure restraint speaks for itself. </para>
		  <para>On the revenue side I noted in my statement of 24 May that it was not possible to make final decisions about revenue measures for 1 979-80 until closer to the Budget. </para>
		  <para>I also foreshadowed in that statement that it would not prove possible to both restore tax indexation for this financial year and remove the income tax surcharge imposed in the last Budget. </para>
		  <para>In the final event, we have been able, within the context of a responsible Budget, to remove the surcharge from 1 December. </para>
		  <para>As it happened, there were major changes in the revenue picture between May and final preparation of the Budget. </para>
		  <para>One of the main changes related to the crude oil levy. </para>
		  <para>Prior to the new arrangements I announced in May, it could have been expected that, on the basis of then posted OPEC prices, revenue from the levy would have been $ 1 ,363m in 1 979-80 or $ 1 74m more than actual receipts in 1 978-79. </para>
		  <para>Revenue from the levy is now estimated to be $2,023m, or about $660m greater than the earlier estimate. </para>
		  <para>Of this additional amount, $140m reflects the new arrangements concerning the levy on parity related oil announced in my statement in May and fully set out by my colleague the Minister for National Development on 29 June 1979, had posted OPEC prices remained in their May levels. </para>
		  <para>The remaining $520m thus represents the additional revenue flowing from the further price increase announced by OPEC on 28 June. </para>
		  <para>But this does not mean that when we came to finalise the Budget we had $S20m more in hand than we had supposed on 24 May. </para>
		  <para>In particular, policy decisions aside, estimates of other revenue items were some $400m lower than the preliminary estimates available in May. </para>
		  <para>I shall now give details of expenditure and revenue decisions. </para>
		  <para>OUTLAYS</para>
		  <para>I turn firstly to expenditure. </para>
		  <para>Many of the Government&#39;s 1979-80 expenditure decisions have already been announced. Details of these and the others I am about to announce are contained in the accompanying Budget documents. </para>
		  <para>DEFENCE</para>
		  <para>Positive steps are being taken to maintain and improve the operational effectiveness of our defence forces. </para>
		  <para>The Budget provision for defence expenditure this year is $2,887m. This is a rise of $281 m and implies an increase of 2.6 per cent in real terms. </para>
		  <para>The Minister for Defence will keep the Parliament informed of particular decisions made by the Government in this important area. </para>
		  <para>EDUCATION</para>
		  <para class="block">Programs of the Education Commissions </para>
		  <para>The provisions already announced for the Tertiary Education Commission will maintain total intakes of students into universities and colleges of advanced education in 1980 at current levels and permit substantial real increases in activity in technical and further education. </para>
		  <para>Present real levels of recurrent support for schools will be maintained in 1 980 and in some areas, such as migrant education, increased. The prospective decrease in capital expenditure is in line with a levelling off in total enrolments in schools and projections of a downward trend throughout the 1980s. </para>
		  <para>Overseas Student Charge</para>
		  <para>Commencing with the 1980 academic year, private overseas students who enrol at an Australian university or college of advanced education for the first time, or who change courses, will be charged between $1,500 and $2,500 per year towards the cost of their tuition. </para>
          <para>This charge is consistent with overseas practice where foreign students attending tertiary institutions are required to contribute to the cost of their education. The move will also assist in alleviating the current excess demand for places available to overseas students. </para>
          <para>This charge is estimated to yield about $6m in 1979-80 and will help to defray the costs presently met in full by Australian taxpayers- of educating private overseas students in Australia. </para>
          <para>Full details of these new arrangements will be announced after consultations have been held with major source countries. </para>
		  <para>Student Assistance Schemes</para>
          <para>The Government has decided to adjust the means tests used for determining student benefits to reflect past increases in average weekly earnings. There will be no change in the level of those benefits in 1980. </para>
          <para>These adjustments are estimated to cost $3. 1 m in 1979-80 and $6.5m in a full year. </para>
		  <para>WELFARE PAYMENTS</para>
		  <para>Budget outlays classified as Social Security and Welfare Payments are estimated at $8,925m in 1979-80, an increase of 9.6 per cent and equivalent to 28 per cent of total outlays. </para>
		  <para>Indexed Pensions and Benefits</para>
          <para>Last year when the Government took its decision to introduce annual indexation adjustments of social security and repatriation pensions and benefits, it was with the prospect of a lower rate of inflation than now prevails. </para>
          <para>In the event this expectation was not realised. Following many representations to the Government, it has been decided to restore twice yearly automatic indexation for all indexed pensions and benefits. </para>
          <para>This means that in addition to the forthcoming November increase, there will be a further increase in May 1980 in line with the rise in the Consumer Price Index over the six months to December 1979. </para>
          <para>The additional cost of restoring twice yearly indexation is $63 min 1979-80. </para>
		  <para>Pensioner Fringe Benefits</para>
          <para>We have decided to extend eligibility for Pensioner Health Benefit Cards to supporting parents and their dependants. This means that supporting parents will be eligible, as are widows and other sole parents in similar circumstances, for certain fringe benefits, such as free pharmaceuticals. </para>
          <para>The basic income test limits for eligibility for Pensioner Health Benefit Cards have not been altered since 1 973. This has resulted in the loss of this particular benefit by large numbers of pensioners. As a consequence, the Government has decided to increase these limits as follows: from $33 to $40 per week in respect of single people; and from $57.50 to $68 per week in respect of married couples. </para>
          <para>These extensions will be effective from 1 November and are estimated to cost a total of $ 1 3m in 1979-80 and $23m in a full year. </para>
		  <para>Repatriation Benefits</para>
          <para>The changes to welfare benefits just outlined will also be available to repatriation pensioners. </para>
          <para>In addition, as promised in the 1977 policy speech we have decided that, from the first pension-day in February 1 980, the Service Pension will be available, on a similar basis as for British Commonwealth veterans, to those veterans who served as members of the formally raised forces of allied countries in any war or warlike operations in which Australia participated. </para>
          <para>Tne Government will re-introduce free medical and hospital treatment for all conditions for all veterans who received TB pensions prior to 2 November 1978. </para>
          <para>There will also be increases in a range of benefits available to specially disadvantaged Repatriation beneficiaries including Orphan&#39;s Pensions, Attendant&#39;s Allowance, Recreation Transport Allowance, Gift Car Allowance and Clothing Allowance. </para>
          <para>The rate of Repatriation Funeral Benefit will be increased by $200 to $300 as from 1 November 1979. </para>
          <para>My colleague, the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs, will be announcing full details tonight. </para>
          <para>The total cost of these changes is estimated at $10.7 million in 1979-80 and $27.6 million in a full year. </para>
		  <para>Other Programs</para>
          <para>Other provisions which indicate this Government&#39;s concern to assist needy groups include: $62. 5m for the construction of homes and hostels for aged persons, an increase of $9.8m; a further $4m for senior citizens centres; $69.2 m for assistance for pre-school and child-care projects in the States and Northern Territory, an increase of $5.4m; $39.3m for handicapped persons facilities, with further approvals up to $5m for funding in 1980-81; and grants totalling $500,000 to community welfare agencies which are in need of support in providing emergency assistance to members o the community. </para>
		  <para>ABORIGINALS</para>
		  <para>The Budget also provides $125m for special assistance to Aboriginals through programs administered by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs; this is an increase of about $9m on 1978-79. </para>
		  <para>HEALTH</para>
		  <para>Hospital Payments</para>
          <para>The Commonwealth will provide an estimated $1,1 94m to the States and Territories in 1 979-80 under the cost-sharing arrangements for public hospitals. </para>
          <para>But for the increase in public hospital charges effective from 1 September 1979, this amount would have been much greater. </para>
          <para>As foreshadowed, an independent inquiry with the powers of a Royal Commission- is to be established to investigate and report on the efficiency and administration of hospitals. </para>
          <para>It is planned that an interim report be available by 30 June 1980. </para>
		  <para>Medical Benefits</para>
          <para>Expenditure on medical benefits is estimated to increase by $64m in 1979-80 to $593m, notwithstanding the previously announced changes which are to apply from 1 September 1979. </para>
          <para>In the absence of those changed arrangements, the medical benefits bill in 1979-80 would have been about $ 1 80m higher. </para>
		  <para>Pharmaceutical Benefits</para>
          <para>Legislation is to be introduced to increase the patient contribution for pharmaceutical benefits supplied under the National Health Act to the general public from $2.50 to $2.75 per prescription. </para>
          <para>This increase will be effective from 1 September and is estimated to reduce Commonwealth outlays on pharmaceutical benefits by $5m in 1 979-80 and by $7m in a full year. </para>
          <para>Eligible pensioners- those holding a Pensioner Health Benefits Card- will, however, continue to receive their pharmaceutical benefits free of charge. </para>
          <para>The Government is also proposing to examine the range of drugs available under the National Health Act with a view to reducing the costs of the scheme by up to $20m a year. </para>
          <para>The Government will shortly receive the report of the Inquiry into the Pharmaceutical Industry- the Ralph Inquiry. </para>
		  <para>OVERSEAS AID</para>
		  <para>Assistance under the overseas aid program is estimated at $485m in 1979-80, an increase of $29m. </para>
		  <para>IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROGRAMS</para>
		  <para>Assisted Migration Program</para>
          <para>Provision is made in the estimates for an assisted migration program of 23,500 persons in 1979-80, approximately 5,000 more than last year. </para>
          <para>This total includes up to 14,000 Indo-Chinese refugees, compared with 12,000 in 1978-79. </para>
		  <para>Services to Migrants</para>
          <para>Some $15m will be provided in 1979-80 for the continuing implementation of the Galbally recommendations to provide special services to migrants. </para>
          <para>An amount of $24.1 m has been allocated for the Adult Migrant and Refugee Education Program, an increase of $6. 1 m. </para>
		  <para>Departmental Charges</para>
          <para>Charges are to be introduced to help offset the administrative costs incurred by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in providing certain of its services. </para>
          <para>These charges, which will be detailed by the Minister, are estimated to yield $2. 3m in 1 979-80 and $4m in a full year. </para>
		  <para>CULTURE AND RECREATION</para>
		  <para>The Budget provides $3 1 9m for cultural and recreational activities, $38m more than in </para>
		  <para class="block">1978- 79. </para>
		  <para>This includes $ 189.2m for the ABC and associated activities. Over the next three years the ABC will also be permitted to retain, for its own purposes, increases in revenues from its entrepreneurial activities. </para>
		  <para>The total also includes: $26. 3m for assistance to the arts through the Australia Council; $ 1 7.6m for the National Gallery, including $ 10. 1 m for its new building; $4.2m for the National Parks and Wildlife Service; and $2. 7m for sports development. </para>
		  <para>HOUSING</para>
		  <para>Welfare Housing</para>
          <para>As already announced, the Commonwealth will provide $260m to the States for welfare housing in 1979-80. </para>
          <para>Of this, $100m will be provided by way of grants. </para>
          <para>This compares with grants of $ 1 4m in 1 978-79 and will enable substantially increased assistance to be extended to pensioners, Aboriginals and other disadvantaged groups. </para>
		  <para>Homes Savings Grants</para>
		  <para>As I announced in May, the Homes Savings Grant Scheme has been modified by the introduction of a tapered dwelling value limit with the aim of directing assistance to those most in need. </para>
          <para>However, because of the build-up of approvals awaiting payment, outlays are estimated to increase from $20m in 1978-79 to $75m in </para>
          <para class="block">1979- 80. </para>
		  <para>Private Sector Housing</para>
          <para>Activity in the private sector housing area has strengthened during 1978-79. This has been aided by the record amounts of finance made available by the major housing lenders. </para>
          <para>It is the Government&#39;s policy that a high priority for housing finance be maintained consistent with overall monetary policy. </para>
          <para>Lending institutions are again being informed of the Government&#39;s wish that, within the parameters of monetary policy and subject to their own commercial judgment, they lend to home seekers to the maximum extent. </para>
		  <para>NATIONAL WATER RESOURCES PROGRAM</para>
		  <para>The allocation for the National Water Resources Program is to be increased from $20m to $25m in 1979-80. </para>
		  <para>This will enable a number of new projects to be commenced, including urgent salinity control and drainage works in the Murray Valley. </para>
		  <para>INDUSTRY MATTERS</para>
		  <para>Air Navigation Charges</para>
          <para>It is the Government&#39;s intention to fully recover costs incurred on the domestic trunk airline sector over the next three years. To this end we will be seeking annual increases of 25 per cent in air navigation charges for domestic airlines over that period. </para>
          <para>Air navigation charges for the general aviation sector are to be raised by 20 per cent. </para>
          <para>These increases are estimated to yield a total of about $4m in 1979-80 and $8m in the first full year. </para>
		  <para>Crawford Report</para>
          <para>The recommendations of the Crawford Study Group on Structural Adjustment have been receiving careful consideration and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will make a detailed statement on the Government&#39;s response shortly. </para>
          <para>I note, however, that in respect of two of the principal recommendations in the Report encouragement of exports and industrial research and development- this Government already has a commendable record. </para>
		  <para>Export Incentive Grants</para>
          <para>A total of $2 15m is provided for export incentive and market development grants, an increase of $157m over 1978-79. </para>
          <para>This large increase reflects the full-year effects of the generous export incentives scheme introduced last year, the strong growth in eligible exports, and steps taken to expedite the processing of claims. </para>
		  <para>Industrial Research and Development</para>
          <para>Industry will also benefit from a substantial increase in the  provision for industrial research and development. </para>
          <para>Expenditure for this purpose increased from $14m in 1977-78 to $24m in 1978-79 and is estimated to increase further to $32m in the current year. </para>
          <para>The Tourist Industry has the potential to generate a large number of additional employment and income opportunities in Australia. To foster this industry, the Government has decided to provide additional assistance for its expansion and development. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Industry and Commerce will announce details but I mention, as one illustration, that $8. 2m will be provided to the Australian Tourist Commission in 1979-80 compared with $4.2 m last year. </para>
          <para>I shall have more to say about this industry in the Receipts section of this Speech. </para>
		  <para>REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT</para>
		  <para>A further $ 10.5m will be available under the Commonwealth Regional Development Program to encourage the development of selected non-metropolitan centres, together with a further $5m for the Albury-Wodonga growth centre. </para>
		  <para>ASSISTANCE TO TASMANIA</para>
		  <para>The Callaghan Report identified certain areas where special assistance might be provided to Tasmania and the Commonwealth proposes to offer assistance for a number of projects. </para>
		  <para>These offers amount to $ 1.3m in 1979-80 and include assistance for native forestry; restoration and development in the Port Arthur region, the establishment of a fish centre in Hobart and a pilot industrial estate at Leg an a; and re equipment of the Launceston Precision Tool Annex. </para>
		  <para>The Commonwealth has also agreed to fund, by way of special grants, the full cost of constructing a second bridge across the Derwent River at Hobart. </para>
		  <para>The total cost of this project is estimated at about $32m, of which $lm is likely to be required in 1979-80. </para>
		  <para>MANPOWER AND TRAINING PROGRAMS</para>
		  <para>A total of $ 131m will be provided for training programs in 1 979-80 to assist some 1 70,000 Australians to improve their own employment prospects and to help fill gaps in the supply of skilled workers. </para>
		  <para>The total provision represents a reduction of $27m, mainly because of a reduction of almost $50m, to $68m, in estimated expenditure on the National Employment and Training System (NEAT). That in turn reflects the steps taken by the Government to limit subsidy payments under the Special Youth Employment Training Program (SYETP) to people who would not otherwise have been employed. </para>
		  <para>Expenditure on the CRAFT program, under which employers receive tax-exempt rebates for the costs of releasing apprentices to attend approved trade and training courses, is estimated to increase by $26m to $54m. </para>
		  <para>STATES, NORTHERN TERRITORY AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES</para>
		  <para>Taken together, net Commonwealth payments to the States, the Northern Territory and local government authorities are estimated to increase by 7.8 per cent in 1 979-80, to $ 1 1 ,608m. </para>
		  <para>Payments to the Northern Territory Government amount to $442 m and comprise both general and specific purpose payments akin to those made to the States. </para>
		  <para>The total also includes $222m- an increase of $42 m or 24 per cent- in tax-sharing grants to local government authorities and reflects our decision to increase their share of 1978-79 personal income tax collections from 1.52 per cent to 1.75 per cent. </para>
		  <para>The Government&#39;s election promise to increase the share to 2 per cent will be met by the time of the next Budget. </para>
		  <para>MAINTENANCE OF EXPENDITURE RESTRAINT</para>
		  <para>For its part the Commonwealth intends to maintain maximum restraint on expenditures in 1 979-80 and to pursue economies and eliminate wasteful practices wherever possible. </para>
		  <para>In this connection I mention that last year there was a further net reduction of 780 in areas subject to staff ceilings and that the overall ceiling this year will be retained at about the same level as in 1978-79. </para>
		  <para>In each of the past four years this Government has held actual spending below, or very close to, the Budget estimate of total outlays and we aim to maintain that good performance in 1 979-80. </para>
		  <para>RECEIPTS</para>
		  <para>In turning to the receipts side of the Budget, I deal first with personal income tax. </para>
		  <para>PERSONAL INCOME TAX</para>
		  <para>As I have already indicated, it has only proved possible to remove the income tax surcharge. Tax indexation will not be restored for 1979-80. </para>
		  <para>Whether or not tax indexation can be restored in 1980-81 will depend upon general economic conditions. Wage decisions by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission will be relevant to that. </para>
		  <para>The Government hopes that the increase in take-home pay of wage and salary earners as from 1 December will encourage greater wage restraint. </para>
		  <para>Let there be no mistake. The Government wants to be in a position to restore tax indexation but economic circumstances have to be right. </para>
		  <para>One of the factors which will be relevant is the extent to which wage and salary increases contribute to inflation. </para>
		  <para>From 1 December 1979, the standard rate of personal income tax will be reduced from the present effective 34.57 per cent to 32 per cent for PA YE purposes and PA YE tax instalment deductions will accordingly be reduced from that date. </para>
		  <para>There will be corresponding reductions of 2.57 per cent in the rates applying to higher incomes, to 46 per cent and 60 per cent. </para>
		  <para>For a person on average weekly earnings, the reduction in tax instalments and increase in take home pay will be about $4.45 a week. </para>
		  <para>Rates for assessment of 1 979-80 tax will be derived as a weighted average of the present effective scale for PA YE purposes and the scale to apply from 1 December. For example, the &#39;standard &#39; rate on assessment for the year as a whole will on that basis be 33.07 per cent. </para>
		  <para>Provisional tax payments for 1979-80 will also be based on that weighted-average rate scale where the taxpayer self-assesses. In accordance with past practice, somewhat higher rates will apply for provisional taxpayers who do not self-assess. </para>
		  <para>There will also be adjustments to provisional tax arrangements to take account of the withdrawal of the Trading Stock Valuation Adjustment from the beginning of the current year. </para>
		  <para>Further details of these measures are contained in Statement No. 4 attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech. </para>
		  <para>PROVISIONAL TAX THRESHOLD</para>
		  <para>Provisional tax is not at present charged to salary and wage earners, pensioners and super annuitants if income subject to provisional tax is less than $400. This amount, which has not been changed since 1970, is to be increased to $1,000. This will have the effect of freeing large numbers of taxpayers with small amounts of property and investment income from the liability to pay provisional tax. </para>
		  <para>PRIVATE COMPANIES</para>
		  <para>A frequent concern of small business is the maintenance of adequate working capital. The Government acted in 1976 to ease the distribution requirements for private companies under Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act by increasing the retention allowance from 50 per cent to 60 per cent. </para>
		  <para>We have now decided to go further. For distributions in respect of taxable incomes of 1978-79 and subsequent years, the retention allowance for trading or business income will be increased from 60 to 70 per cent. </para>
		  <para>No change is being made to the 10 per cent retention allowance for property income or to the rule that there is no retention allowance for dividends that one private company receives from another. </para>
		  <para>The increase in the retention allowance will have negligible cost in 1979-80 but is estimated to cost $30m in a full year. </para>
		  <para>DEPRECIATION OF INCOME-PRODUCING BUILDINGS-TRAVELLER ACCOMMODATION</para>
		  <para>To encourage the provision of accommodation for tourists and travellers, the Government has decided to introduce a system of depreciation allowances for new income-producing buildings, or extensions to existing buildings, used for the accommodation of travellers, where construction commences after today. </para>
		  <para>Eligible buildings or extensions to buildings must contain at least 10 guest rooms. </para>
		  <para>Depreciation will be allowed at a flat rate of <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> per cent of eligible cost. </para>
		  <para>This deduction will have no cost in 1979-80 but a progressively increasing cost in subsequent years. </para>
		  <para>Further details will be announced at a later date. </para>
		  <para>STORAGE FACILITIES FOR GRAIN, HAY OR FODDER</para>
		  <para>Since 1 973, on-farm facilities for the storage of grain, hay or fodder have been subject to depreciation in the usual way. </para>
		  <para>In the light of recent heavy grain harvests and the consequent pressures on bulk grain facilities, and in order to encourage the holding of hay and fodder reserves against the requirements of poor seasons, a special rate of depreciation will be allowed in respect of on-farm facilities for the storage of grain, hay or fodder in conducting a primary production business. </para>
		  <para>A rate of 20 per cent per annum will apply to such facilities which are ordered, or the construction of which by the taxpayer commences, after today, so that the cost of such facilities is written off in 5 years </para>
		  <para>The investment allowance, at the 20 per cent rate, will continue in respect of eligible storage facilities covered by the new special rate of depreciation. </para>
		  <para>This measure, which will have negligible revenue effects in 1 979-80, is estimated to cost $6m in a full year. </para>
		  <para>LIMITATION OF VALUE OF MOTOR CARS FOR DEPRECIATION AND LEASING PURPOSES</para>
		  <para>Whilst the Government recognises that cars are needed in many businesses and professions it does not believe there is any reason why the revenue should subsidise the full cost of expensive luxury vehicles used for such purposes. </para>
		  <para>The Government has decided to limit to $18,000 the amount which may be depreciated for income tax purposes for motor cars and station wagons (including four-wheel-drive vehicles, leased vehicles, and those used to provide services to the general public) ordered after tonight. </para>
		  <para>The excess of the price above $ 1 8,000 will not be depreciable and balancing adjustments on disposal will be calculated by reference to a deemed cost of $18,000. </para>
		  <para>The limit of $ 1 8,000 for depreciation purposes will be indexed annually. </para>
		  <para>The gain to revenue from this proposal will be negligible in 1 979-80 and $ 1 5m in a full year. </para>
		  <para>I mention also that the Government is concerned that some lessees of cars and station wagons are, at the end of the lease, buying the vehicles for a price that enables them to profit by reselling the vehicles at their market value. </para>
		  <para>As the law now stands, the resulting profit may not be taxable, even though it effectively represents a recoupment of tax deductible lease charges. </para>
		  <para>Accordingly, the Government has decided to amend the law to ensure that any such profit is taxed on a basis corresponding with that applied where a person sells plant on which he has previously been allowed depreciation. </para>
		  <para>The amendment will apply in respect of all cars and station wagons that are purchased from lessors by the lessee or a relative or other associate after tonight. </para>
		  <para>The gain to revenue from this proposal will be negligible in 1979-80 but about $25m in a full year. </para>
		  <para>Further details of these measures are given in Statement No. 4. </para>
		  <para>ENERGY CONSERVATION</para>
		  <para>In his statement of 27 June on Energy Policy, the Prime Minister announced a number of taxation measures designed to conserve scarce oil resources. </para>
		  <para>Those measures will be supplemented by two income tax concessions related to conversion of oil-fired industrial equipment to other energy sources. </para>
		  <para>The cost of such conversion or adaptation of an existing unit will be allowed as an outright deduction in the year in which it is incurred. </para>
		  <para>Where an existing oil-fired unit of property is wholly replaced by one that uses other energy sources, the replacement unit will qualify for normal depreciation but will also attract a special conversion allowance at a rate of 40 per cent double the investment allowance that may otherwise have applied. </para>
		  <para>To qualify, the conversion must be completed and the equipment be in use by 30 June 1 982. </para>
		  <para>In addition, the exemption from sales tax of kits used to convert vehicles to LPG use is to be extended to compressed natural gas conversion kits, and further extended to cover conversion kits for all internal combustion engines. </para>
		  <para>REBATE FOR PETROLEUM EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT</para>
		  <para>In order to provide further encouragement for the discovery and development of petroleum resources throughout Australia, the Government has decided to extend the present scheme of tax rebates for share capital subscribed for offshore petroleum exploration and development to subscriptions for onshore petroleum exploration and development. </para>
		  <para>In addition, it has been decided to extend from two to four years the period within which capital subscribed must be spent in order to qualify ibr a rebate. </para>
		  <para>These changes will apply to share capital subscribed after tonight. The legislation will of course contain appropriate safeguards against abuse. </para>
		  <para>There will be no revenue cost in 1979-80, but an estimated $6m cost in a full year. </para>
		  <para>SALES TAX ON EQUIPMENT USED BY BLIND OR DEAF PERSONS</para>
		  <para>The sales tax law already provides exemption for a range of appliances and other goods used by blind or deaf persons. </para>
		  <para>To avoid the need to amend the law frequently to cater for the development of new aids, the Government has decided to provide a general exemption that will apply to all articles designed and manufactured expressly for and of a kind used by blind or deaf persons. </para>
		  <para>The exemption will apply after tonight. </para>
		  <para>The cost to revenue of the new general exemption is estimated to be $ 100,000 in a full year. </para>
		  <para>Details of this and some other measures in the sales tax area will be given in the enabling legislation to be introduced later this evening. </para>
		  <para>COAL EXPORT DUTY</para>
		  <para>The existing coal export duty of $3.50 per tonne on high quality coking coal will be reduced for open-cut operations, and major expansions of such operations, commencing production after 30 June 1980, and for existing and future underground mines. </para>
		  <para>The rate of duty to apply will be $1.00 per tonne- the rate presently applying to exports of lower quality coking coal. </para>
		  <para>These changes will take effect on 1 November 1979. </para>
		  <para>The cost to revenue is estimated to be $ 12m in 1 979-80 and $ 1 9m in a full year. </para>
		  <para>BUDGET OVERVIEW</para>
		  <para>Total outlays in 1979-80 are estimated to increase by 9. 1 per cent to $3 1 ,692 m. </para>
		  <para>Total receipt, after the measures I have outlined, are estimated to increase by 15.4 per cent to $29.499m </para>
		  <para>The overall deficit is therefore estimated at $2,193m, a reduction of$l,285mon 1978-79. </para>
		  <para>After allowance for overseas transactions, the domestic deficit is estimated at $87 5 m in 1 979-80, much less than half the domestic deficit of $2,258m in 1978-79, and the lowest for six years. </para>
		  <para>To see these deficit figures in perspective it should be noted that the projected Budget deficit as a percentage of GDP has been reduced from last year&#39;s outcome of 3.4 per cent to an estimated 1.9 percent. </para>
		  <para>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</para>
		  <para>This section of the Budget Speech traditionally contains views on likely developments in the economy during the year ahead. </para>
		  <para>They do not, of course, represent promises or guarantees by the Government as to the outcome in certain areas. They never can. </para>
		  <para>Circumstances can alter quickly to radically change the basis on which original assumptions and forecasts have been made. </para>
		  <para>The monetary outcome for last year is a good example. A major part of the change was due to the unexpectedly large turnabout in private sector foreign exchange transactions during the year and the increase in the Budget deficit. </para>
		  <para>I have already canvassed the further progress of economic recovery in 1 978-79 as well as drawing attention to the heightened inflationary pressures facing the industrialised world. </para>
		  <para>Quite apart from the adverse developments caused by oil price movements, 1 979-80 will be a difficult year for the world economy. </para>
		  <para>Nevertheless, our prospects are better than those of many other countries. </para>
		  <para>Activity in the non-farm sector is expected to continue to expand in 1979-80, at a rate of over 3 per cent. </para>
		  <para>Following last year&#39;s exceptionally favourable rural conditions, we must expect some falling back in farm production. However, given reasonable conditions farmers should still have a good year. </para>
		  <para>GDP as a whole might increase by only 2 to <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> percent this year. </para>
		  <para>Private investment should again contribute quite strongly to aggregate demand. </para>
		  <para>Although plant and equipment investment will probably grow less dramatically than in 1978-79, the building and construction component of business investment is likely to keep on expanding firmly. </para>
		  <para>Dwelling investment is in a moderate upswing phase. </para>
		  <para>Non-farm stocks are expected to accumulate fairly steadily during the year. </para>
		  <para>However, total public spending on goods and services may increase somewhat more slowly than in 1978-79. </para>
		  <para>Private consumption spending has been fairly subdued and there are no evident factors which suggest any major change in that trend in the months immediately ahead, although the increase in take-home pay from 1 December next should help. </para>
		  <para>The contribution to aggregate demand from net exports of goods and services is likely to be quite strong. </para>
		  <para>As a result, the improvement in the current account deficit which occurred during the second half of last year should be maintained. Whereas the deficit amounted to $3, 156m in 1978-79, it could decline by several hundred million dollars in 1979-80. </para>
		  <para>There are also good prospects of a continuation of the recent stronger rate of net private capital inflow. </para>
		  <para>Taken together, these improvements would, of course, permit a substantially lower overseas borrowing program by the Commonwealth than last year. </para>
		  <para>Against this background, we expect a moderate growth in job opportunities during the year. </para>
		  <para>Wage and salary earner employment is expected to grow by about 1 per cent. </para>
		  <para>Although the level of unemployment remains high, recent trends in labour force participation rates have combined with growing employment to hold it broadly steady over the past year. </para>
		  <para>We do not expect unemployment to improve in the year ahead. </para>
		  <para>As to the inflation outlook, factors already in the system are likely to lead to higher rates of increase in price indices in the months immediately ahead, before a renewed downward trend can be established. </para>
		  <para>Those factors include recent oil price increases still largely to be reflected in the Consumer Price Index, higher costs of health care as a result of changed financing arrangements and increases in doctors&#39; fees, and some acceleration of wage costs. </para>
		  <para>For 1979-80 as a whole, the CPI is presently estimated to increase by a little above 10 per cent. </para>
		  <para>It is expected to peak with a relatively large December quarter increase due to the coincidence of the factors I have mentioned. </para>
		  <para>It is essential for our future economic prosperity that the temporary factors putting upward pressure on prices in recent months do not become permanently built in to the inflation base. </para>
		  <para>For this reason, restraint on the part of all those involved in wage determination including, not least, the arbitral authorities themselves- is no less vital than it ever was. </para>
		  <para>MONETARY OUTLOOK</para>
		  <para>I turn now to the monetary prospect for the year ahead. </para>
		  <para>First, the expected improvement in the balance of payments on private account is likely to result in an addition to domestic liquidity in 1979-80, in contrast to the reduction from this source over 1978-79 as a whole. </para>
		  <para>This involves a turnaround in private sector foreign exchange transactions which has already become apparent in recent months. </para>
		  <para>The turnaround is expected to amount to approximately $ 1,000m or more and will convert the negative impact of these transactions of some $2 50m on the money supply last year to a sharply positive impact in 1979-80. </para>
		  <para>Another large wheat harvest is being foreshadowed. The Government will, however, again seek arrangements for financing advances to growers so as to minimise the addition to liquidity. As was the case last year, this will not be at extra cost to growers. </para>
		  <para>The large reduction in the domestic Budget deficit will, of course help greatly in moderating the growth of the monetary aggregates. </para>
		  <para>Moreover this year the borrowing requirement of the public sector as a whole will be markedly reduced; the net reduction on account of the Commonwealth Budget and approved Loan Council programs is some $ 1 billion. </para>
		  <para>I reaffirm that the Government&#39;s monetary policy is directed at providing adequate funds for sustainable expansion in private sector activity and employment, while continuing to bear down steadily on inflation and inflationary expectations. </para>
		  <para>There is a need for growth in the monetary aggregates this year to be reduced from the rates of 1978-79. The Government has already taken a number of measures to that end. </para>
		  <para>As was evident in 1978-79, circumstances can arise which render appropriate a monetary outcome different from any initial projection at the outset of a financial year. </para>
		  <para>For 1979-80, it is believed that growth in the broadly defined measure of the volume of money (M3) of about 10 per cent over the course of the year would be compatible with policy. </para>
		  <para>Economic developments throughout the year may make appropriate an outcome either above or below that projection. </para>
		  <para>However on present assessments it seems appropriate that the outcome be not more than ten per cent. </para>
		  <para>There will be a fairly sizeable bond-selling task for that outcome to be achieved. </para>
		  <para>But, given the expected trends in underlying conditions, and with appropriate flexibility in the operation of policy, it should be manageable. </para>
		  <para>I reaffirm the Government&#39;s commitment to the importance of monetary control in bearing down on inflation and for the pursuit of a path of economic stability. </para>
		  <para>With this commitment, supported by our continued emphasis on fiscal restraint, we look forward to further sustainable growth in activity, and the prospect of seeing, by the latter part of the year, a return to a downward trend in the rate of inflation. </para>
		  <para>CONCLUSION</para>
		  <para>This Budget has been framed to meet the needs of the Australian economy in 1979. </para>

			<para> by leave- The Treasurer in his Budget Speech referred to changes in social security programs. It is appropriate that I elaborate on his statement and provide the Senate with some additional information. The Treasurer, in his statement of 24 May 1979 in which he announced certain decisions on expenditure and taxation, said: </para>

          <para>Against the severity of these cuts there will be attempts to frighten people receiving Commonwealth social security pensions and benefits and repatriation payments. These payments will be maintained by the Government. The fear mongers should be ignored. </para>
        </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government has maintained social security payments. It has also been able to make some very worthwhile improvements to the social security and welfare system. In particular, we will restore half-yearly indexation of pensions and benefits; extend the income limits for pensioner fringe benefits; extend eligibility for Pensioner Health Benefit cards to supporting parent beneficiaries; provide grants to voluntary agencies providing emergency relief; significantly increase expenditure on services for families and children; and increase the rates of worker&#39;s compensation for Commonwealth employees. </para>
		  <para>Half-Yearly Indexation</para>
          <para>This year the Government has given very careful consideration to the issue of indexation in the light of present economic and budgetary circumstances and, as the Treasurer announced in his Budget Speech, the Government is pleased to be able to restore twice-yearly indexation. The Government will be introducing legislation to amend the Social Services Act to enable the following payments to be increased automatically in May and November each year in accordance with movements in the consumer price index: age, invalid and widows&#39; pensions; supporting parents&#39; benefits; wives&#39; pensions; sheltered employment allowances; unemployment benefits for all people aged 18 or over with dependants and for married people aged 16 or 17 years; and sickness benefits for all people aged 1 8 or over and for married persons aged 16 or 17 years. Indexation will not be introduced to cover the following payments: Unemployment benefits for single persons aged 16 or 17 years and for those aged 18 or more without dependants; sickness benefits for single persons aged 16 or 17 years; and age pension paid free of income test to people aged 70 years or more. </para>

The rates are $5 1 . 45 a week for a single pensioner and $85.80 a week for a married pensioner couple. People in receipt of these pensions may be eligible for a higher rate of payment depending on how much income, excluding pension, they receive.

		  <para>Fringe Benefit Income Limits</para>
          <para>One area of great concern to pensioners has been the income test limits for pensioner fringe benefits. Commonwealth fringe benefits available to pensioners holding Pensioner Health Benefit cards include: Access to bulk billing of medical fees; a range of free pharmaceuticals; access to free optometric al consultations and hearing aids; a one-third reduction in telephone rentals; and some reductions in fares on Commonwealth rail and shipping services. In addition, State governments and various private organisations provide assistance to these pensioners. </para>
          <para>At present a pensioner loses all of these fringe benefits if his private income reaches $33 a week for a single pensioner and $57.50 a week for a married pensioner couple. These amounts are higher when there are children. While it is difficult to calculate the value to the individual pensioner of fringe benefits, it has been suggested that, on average, they could be worth up to about $ 10 a week. The income limits for fringe benefits have been fixed for some time. Some pensioners have lost entitlement to fringe benefits as a result of increases to their superannuation or war pensions over which they have no control. Accordingly, the Government has decided to increase these limits to $40 a week for a single pensioner and $68 a week for a married pensioner couple. These amounts are higher where there are children. It is estimated that some additional 25,000 pensioners plus 5,000 dependants will qualify for Pensioner Health Benefit cards as a result of these increases. </para>
		  <para>Extension of Eligibility for Pensioner Health Benefit Cards to Supporting Parent Beneficiaries</para>
          <para>For some time the Government has been aware of differences in the treatment of different sole parents. When we came to office, there was no specific assistance available to sole fathers and supporting mother beneficiaries were not eligible for the full range of pensioner fringe benefits- they were not eligible for pensioner health benefits. </para>
          <para>In 1977 this Government introduced the supporting parents benefit which replaced the supporting mothers benefit and extended eligibility for assistance to sole fathers on essentially the same basis as for sole mothers. We have now decided to extend eligibility for Pensioner Health Benefit cards to supporting parent beneficiaries subject to the liberalised pensioner fringe benefit income test outlined above. As a result, Commonwealth fringe benefit assistance for supporting parent beneficiaries will be exactly the same as that for Class A widow pensioners. The rates of assistance are already the same. </para>
          <para>It is estimated that some 56,000 supporting parent beneficiaries, including 2,500 men, plus 96,000 dependants will qualify for Pensioner Health Benefit cards. As a result their health costs will be reduced significantly. This will be of special assistance to those with young children, particularly children suffering from chronic illnesses. </para>
          <para>Eligibility for fringe benefits provided by State governments and other organisations are generally restricted to holders of Pensioner Health Benefit cards. The extension of these benefits to supporting parent beneficiaries and to pensioners with private incomes between the existing and proposed income limits will, however, be a matter for the States and other responsible bodies. </para>
		  <para>Other Income Security Measures</para>
          <para>The Government has already announced its intention to charge long-term hospital patients who are, in effect, nursing home type patients an amount towards their care and accommodation on a similar basis to nursing home patients. This change will not come into effect until the States agree to changes in the hospital cost-sharing agreements. </para>
          <para>As a consequence of the Government&#39;s decision in this area some minor improvements will also be made to provisions under the Social Services Act, namely: </para>
          <para>The standard rate of pension is to be extended to a woman receiving wife&#39;s pension where the living expenses of a married couple are likely to be greater than they would otherwise be because illness or infirmity prevents them from living together. As a result, in this area a wife pensioner will be treated as if she were a pensioner in her own right. </para>
          <para>Eligibility for wife&#39;s pension is to be extended to a woman who is an inmate of a benevolent home and to a woman who has no child or has not attained 50 years of age where her husband is an inmate of a benevolent home. Thus, where either or both of a married couple are inmates of a benevolent home, wife&#39;s pension will be payable on the same basis as age or invalid pension. </para>
		  <para>Emergency Assistance</para>
          <para>During the last election the Government made a commitment to provide $500,000 to assist voluntary agencies providing emergency relief. Last year the Australian Council of Social Service and the Department of Social Security were commissioned to prepare a report on emergency relief-giving agencies and their clients. The report of the joint study, &#39;Emergency Relief- A Study of Agencies and Clients&#39;, was tabled in the Senate on 29 March 1979. </para>
          <para>The Government has decided to allocate $500,000 in 1 979-80 to assist voluntary agencies providing emergency relief and to provide special assistance to welfare organisations experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, administrative changes have taken place in the Department of Social Security to give immediate assistance, by way of special benefit under the Social Services Act, to clients suffering hardship. In view of the findings of the joint study, these measures will reduce the burden on voluntary agencies and State welfare administrations. </para>
          <para class="block">Assistance to the Aged </para>
          <para>Apart from the payment of pensions, the Government provides assistance for the provision of suitable homes for the aged and disabled and home care services including senior citizens&#39; centres. In addition, the Government provides a personal care subsidy for organisations providing hostel accommodation and a delivered meals subsidy for organisations providing meals-on-wheels services. Total expenditure allocated under the aged or disabled persons homes and aged persons hostels programs is $62.5m in 1979-80; $52. 7m was spent in 1978-79. This year&#39;s allocation should enable all approved projects to be completed. Early approval has been given also for funding additional priority projects to the value of $ 10m in 1980-8 1 in order that the necessary forward planning and development of those projects can be completed during 1979-80. </para>
          <para>Further, $4m has been allocated in 1979-80 for grants towards the costs of senior citizens&#39; centres; $3m was spent in 1978-79. A joint Commonwealth-State announcement on the new projects to be funded will be made as soon as State governments confirm their priority lists. (Quorum formed). Spending under other parts of the home care services program also will increase from $822,000 to $1,128,000 for grants towards salaries of welfare officers and from $8,586,000 to $9,255,000 on grants towards costs of home care services. These increases follow on a large increase in total Commonwealth expenditure on home care services last year. </para>
          <para class="block">Assistance for the Handicapped </para>
          <para>Apart from the payment of invalid pensions, sheltered employment allowances, sickness benefits and handicapped child &#39;s allowance paid under the Social Services Act, the Government assists handicapped people under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act by way of grants to eligible organisations to establish and operate sheltered workshops, activity therapy and training centres and residential accommodation for handicapped children and adults. In addition, the Government provides rehabilitation treatment and training through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. </para>
          <para>Expenditure under the handicapped persons welfare program will total $39.3m in 1979-80. Approval will also be given to new projects during the financial year, some of which will be completed during 1979-80. Additionally, new projects will be approved this financial year in order that planning can be undertaken to enable funding in 1980-81. Expenditure by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service will rise from $ 17.3m to $ 19.2m in 1979-80. This rise follows the expansion of rehabilitation services to Townsville, Hobart and Darwin, together with the effects of the widened eligibility criteria announced by the Government in 1 977. </para>
          <para class="block">Assistance for the Homeless </para>
          <para>Expenditure under the homeless persons assistance program will increase from $2,781,000 to $5,640,000 in 1979-80. The higher expenditure reflects progress on construction of two major centres in Brisbane. At 30 June 1979, 1 13 other centres catering for homeless persons were receiving recurrent assistance. The Government has decided also to extend the principal Act to permit continued rental subsidies. </para>
		  <para>Children&#39;s Services</para>
          <para>In addition to the payment of universal family allowances, double orphans pension and handicapped child&#39;s allowance, and additional payments for the children of pensioners and beneficiaries, the Government provides under its children&#39;s services program financial assistance to community organisations, local government bodies and the States for a range of care services for children under 1 8 years of age and services to support their families. A block grant is also made to the States and the Northern Territory for preschools. Total expenditure under the children&#39;s services program will rise from $63,786,000 to $69,220,000 in 1979-80. Grants for services for families and children will rise by $5,094,000 to $36, 1 30,000. Particular types of services funded include day-care, emergency outside school hours and vacation care. The Government has given priority to expansion of services in these areas. </para>
          <para>An announcement will be made in the near future of new projects to be funded under the children&#39;s services program and on special grants to mark the International Year of the Child. The Fraser Government has more than doubled assistance on child care and other related services, from $16.9m in 1975-76 to $36.13m in the present Budget. Assistance to the States for preschool education will be maintained. A total of $32. 75m will be provided this year. For the first time assistance of $340,000 will be provided for pre-schools in the Northern Territory. </para>
		  <para>Pilot Programs</para>
          <para>The welfare rights program provided funds for the appointment of welfare rights officers to work with organisations associated with disadvantaged minority groups within the community. </para>
          <para class="block">Ten organisations received grants during the pilot period of the program and these will now be funded within other Commonwealth programs. The community information centre program was a pilot program to evaluate means of providing community information and referral services to assist people to make use of the full range of welfare services and facilities offered by the community. The pilot program has now been completed. The centres will be funded within existing programs. </para>
          <para>Assistance for Research and Welfare Co-ordination </para>
          <para>The Social Welfare Research Centre at the University of New South Wales will become operational during this year. An amount of $300,000 has been provided for the Centre&#39;s operation in 1979-80. There has also been an expansion in the Budget of the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat, from $424,000 to $564,000. Total allocations to national social welfare coordinating organisations have increased. The Australian Council of Social Service, the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled and the Australian Council on the Ageing have had their basic Commonwealth grants increased by $10,000 to $160,000. In addition, the Australian Pre-school Association will receive $50,000, together with an additional sum for coordinating the activities of Lady Cowrie centres. </para>
		  <para>Compensation Rates for Commonwealth Government Employees</para>
          <para>The Commonwealth has decided to increase, from I September 1979, the rates of worker&#39;s compensation payable to Commonwealth employees by about 12% per cent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table which sets out the existing and proposed rates. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I wish to throw a little more light and a different perspective on the social security section of this Budget, or as much light as I can in view of the short time I have had to look at the Budget papers and at the statement put down by the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle).</inline> The Minister has said that this is a compassionate Budget, and I assume that she based that statement on the fact that the Government has decided to restore justice to the pensioners of this country by reintroducing twice-yearly indexation, which should not have been removed last year. It should not have been removed, firstly because its removal was unjust and, secondly, because in doing so the Government went back on a firm electoral promise to the people of this country. The Minister also said that the Budget was compassionate because it dealt in a compassionate way with the needy in this community. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I want to deal with four aspects of the Budget which concern the needy in this country and to demonstrate the Government&#39;s strange handling of the word &#39;compassionate&#39;. First of all, I assume it is an oversight, but nowhere in the </para>
          <para class="block">Budget Speech or in the Minister&#39;s statement can I find reference to special benefits. I assume that special benefits will be indexed in the same way as sickness benefits, but as there is no reference to them I believe that the Minister at some time should make it clear that they will be indexed. If not, it would certainly be a severe penalty on the poorest people in the community. Much has been made in both the Treasurer&#39;s speech and the statement by the Minister of the increase in the eligibility level for fringe benefits. By coincidence, the Minister today answered a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Klugman</inline> in another place which asked what the level of eligibility for fringe benefits would be if they had been indexed in the years since they were last increased. In answer to Question on Notice No. 3968 the Minister said that for a single person the amount would have been $62.10 and for a married couple $108.15, considerably more than the $40 and $68 of which the Government is trying to make great play. It is the very poor and the very disadvantaged people in this community about whom I am concerned. </para>
          <para>The first group to which I will refer is the single unemployed without dependants. Such people will remain on $51.45, the same benefit they have received for the last two years. I point out that that is actually less than the daily travelling allowance for a Minister of the Crown in this country. In March there were some 261,500 unemployed without dependants in this country. As with other unemployed people, they are still allowed to earn only $6 a week. If they earn more than that their benefit is reduced by $ 1 for every dollar they earn over $6 a week. Such people are still in that parlous situation in an economic climate where there are 23 unemployed for every job vacancy in the community. Our biggest social problem by far is unemployment, yet the Government treats the unemployed without dependants in what I believe is a heartless and callous manner. The young employed, those under 18 years of age, remain on $36 a week, as they have since 1975. However, their benefits have been eroded considerably by the 40 per cent-odd inflation that has occurred since then. Many of the unemployed without dependants in fact are over 45 years of age. They have lost their jobs because of technological changes, because their jobs have been replaced by machines as a result of, amongst other things, the investment allowance introduced by this Government. Yet of all people they have been singled out in this Budget. One wonders why. </para>
          <para>The next group is those who can probably be called the poorest of the poor in the community. They are the pensioners who are earning less than $5 a week and who live in rental accommodation. Every survey of the poor in our community points out that such pensioners are the poorest of the poor, yet the supplementary allowance payable to assist them with their rent remains as it was in 1 975. There is to be no increase in that allowance, nor is there to be any increase in the amount paid for pensioners&#39; children, which has not been increased since 1975. These poor people with children, who are dependent on the Government for their incomes, have not had their children&#39;s allowances increased since 1975. That can hardly be described as compassionate behaviour towards the poorest people in the community. </para>
          <para>I come now to family allowances, mention of which has been avoided very carefully in this Budget. Family allowances have not been increased since 1976, when they were introduced to replace child endowment, which had remained unchanged for many years and had become fairly meaningless. They also replaced the tax rebate for children, which in any reasonable system of tax indexation would have been indexed since 1976 and certainly would have been increased since 1976. Family allowances have been eroded by inflation since that time, a factor which was admitted in a speech made to a recent social security conference by none other than the Director-General of Social Services, a man who is not known for wild statements on this subject. The allowances are extremely important to that group in the community who are not touched by our social security system- the working poor, the people on low incomes with a number of dependent children. Their only extra income has been the family allowances, and the value of those allowances has been eroded consistently since their introduction in 1976. If one adds to that group the pensioners with children whose dependants&#39; allowances also have not been increased since 1975 one finds that those people in the community are being affected severely by inflation and by the failure of the Government to recognise that and to compensate them for the inflationary forces in our economy. </para>
          <para>Finally, may I mention the Commonwealth employees compensation scheme. At last, following considerable pressure since 1976, the Government is going to increase the benefits paid under the Commonwealth employees compensation scheme. They will be increased by about 12.5 per cent, although the consumer price index has increased by some 36 per cent in that time. With the exception of that well-known welfare State of Queensland, the Commonwealth </para>
          <para class="block">Government remains the Government which pays the lowest compensation to its sick and injured employees. Employees in private industry in Canberra still will be paid more than employees of the present Government. We have had already a report from the Commissioner for Employees Compensation criticising both the level and the efficiency of the Commonwealth employees compensations scheme. After three years the Government is to increase its payments by a measly 12.5 per cent, which puts it below all other States except Queensland, and even below Victoria, which in the past has been notorious in this area. </para>
          <para>In the area of the unemployed without dependants, in the area of low income earners with children, in the area of the poorest of pensioners- those who have an income of $5 apart from their pension and live in rented accommodation- and in the area of Commonwealth employees compensation the Government has been as mean and miserly as it was in the past. I dare say that it will continue to be so in the future except that we believe the Government will not remain the Government for much longer. </para>
          <para>There are other areas of social security which will need questioning and more careful examination once one gets through the economic and sociological jargon in which Budget Papers are usually cast. But in those points I believe that the Opposition is bound to demonstrate the Government&#39;s meanness and its unfair treatment of these poor people in our community. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

              <para>- As the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> announced in the Budget Speech, some important increases and extensions in repatriation benefits will be effected in this financial year. I would like, for the benefit of honourable senators, to provide details of these and other Budget measures which will concern veterans. I am pleased that the Government has been able to act now to improve very appreciably the lot of those who served their country in time of conflict and these measures certainly emphasise the Government&#39;s commitments to veterans and our determination to ensure that the continuing needs of veterans are met. When the Government came to office it had to review very carefully all fields of its expenditure and veterans&#39; affairs was no exception. Administrative expenses were cut back wherever possible without affecting the quality of treatment services available through the repatriation system or the level of compensation to disabled veterans and their dependants. Despite this, some significant improvements have been made. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In 1 976, we announced the indexation of the main repatriation pensions in line with movements in the consumer price index, the first increases under this new arrangement applying from May 1977. This has been 100 per cent indexation and not discounted. Indexation, which will now be twice yearly, has been one of the most significant developments in the history of repatriation. It has given to our veterans and their families the security of knowing that their pensions are not eroded by inflation. In addition to indexation, repatriation pensioners enjoy freedom from taxation on disability pensions. This has placed them in a very favourable position compared with a general community dependent upon wages and salaries. Despite the great value of indexation, however, the Government has not until now been in a position to increase many repatriation benefits and, particularly, those which are directed at the most disadvantaged groups among the veteran population. It has now decided that the effective value of many of these benefits will be increased. As mentioned by the Treasurer, these allowances are to be increased as from 1 November next. The increases are substantial. </para>
          <para>The funeral benefit, for instance, will be increased by $200 to a new level of $300. The benefit for an orphan of a veteran who has lost both parents will be increased by $4.10 to $25 weekly, and for an orphan who has lost one parent by half this amount. Seriously disabled veterans who require the help of an attendant will receive an extra $10.10 a week, making the new benefit $35 a week, while those less seriously afflicted will receive an increase of $2.80 a week, making the new weekly rate $ 1 7.50. Seriously disabled veterans greatly suffer from a loss of social mobility unless special arrangements are made for them. Because of this, the recreation transport allowance for the most seriously handicapped is to be raised by $4 to $40 a month, and for the less seriously handicapped it will be raised by half this amount to $20 a month. </para>
          <para>Some veterans, because of the nature of these disabilities, are provided with cars at no cost to them, together with an annual allowance. As honourable senators are aware, the cost of maintaining a car has risen considerably in the last few years, and so the Government has decided to increase the annual allowance for this purpose by $48 to a new figure of $480 a year. Because of their disabilities, certain veterans experience unusual wear and tear on their clothing. To help them meet this cost, a small clothing allowance is provided at three different rates. As from 1 November, these rates will be increased, the highest rate being now $ 1 .50 a week. </para>
          <para>Whenever a veteran is required to travel in connection with repatriation pension or treatment matters, he is reimbursed travel and subsistence costs at set levels. These rates of reimbursement have not been changed for some years, although costs to the veteran have increased markedly in the meantime. This Government has decided therefore that travel and subsistence allowances will be automatically adjusted in future in line with the levels paid to Commonwealth public servants. The daily sub.sistance rate for attendance for official purposes in a capital city will be increased by $ 1 8.65 to a new rate of $41.15, while the daily rate for attendance elsewhere will rise by $17.50 to $34.50. Some veterans who live relatively near to the departmental office or hospital may not incur high costs, but in the event of their being required to attend during a mealtime, new rates up to $7.80 will apply from 1 November. Where it is medically necessary for a veteran to use his own motor vehicle for such official attendance, new rates of reimbursement, more in line with current costs, will be paid. Where it is not medically necessary for a veteran to use his own vehicle, he will normally be reimbursed at rates based on public transport travel costs. If he travels by rail, the standard will now be first class. </para>
          <para>In 1977, the Government decided that a review of all pensions paid in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis would be carried out to ascertain actual levels of disability in line with the general principles of the repatriation system. Rates for the TB pension were frozen at the May 1 978 cash levels pending the outcome of the review, which is nearing completion. This decision placed the TB pensioners on the same footing as all other veterans and, in so doing, confirmed a principle, namely that pension and treatment benefits be related to the degree of actual disability. The review has provided an opportunity for an accurate determination of the needs of veteran TB pensioners and a fully informed reassessment of their total situation. On the basis of this reassessment, the Government has decided that eligibility for full, free medical treatment will apply immediately to those veterans who were receiving a pension for pulmonary tuberculosis before 2 November 1978. In addition, they will continue to receive for life a pension paid at a rate not less than the 100 per cent general rate applicable in May 1978, irrespective of the degree of actual incapacity. </para>
          <para>Veterans in receipt of the Service pension, which is similar to the social security age pension, could be entitled to a pensioner health benefit card to show their eligibility for full free medical treatment under the arrangements administered by the Department of Health. In considering eligibility, other income is considered, and in the case of veterans half of any disability pension is taken into account. The indexation of disability pensions has taken a number of Service pensioners beyond the limit of other income on which eligibility depends, and so they have lost pensioner health benefit entitlement and eligibility for certain fringe benefits which all add up to a considerable saving in a year. The limit for pensioner health benefit card has been $33 a week in the case of the single pensioner and $57.50 in the case of a married pensioner. As for social security pensioners, these limits are to be lifted from 1 November to $40 and $68 a week respectively. </para>
          <para>The extension of Australian repatriation benefits to veterans who served in Allied, rather than Australian, forces during wartime has been an important issue for many years. Eligibility for the Service pension was extended to those who served in British Commonwealth forces in 1975, and in 1 977 the Government accepted the argument that such eligibility should be extended to members of Allied forces now living in Australia. The need for maximum financial restraint has prevented this until now. I am sure that all honourable senators will agree that those who fought for the Allied cause in time of war have considerable claim to benefit. In view of the tremendous contribution which they have made to this country since the war, it is only fitting that they should be eligible for the Service pension on a similar basis to Australian and British Commonwealth veterans. As announced, from the first pension pay-day in February next year Allied veterans will be eligible to apply for the Service pension on the similar basis to that applying to British Commonwealth veterans. The exact details of this eligibility will be included in legislation to be introduced later in this session. </para>
          <para>Apart from indexation, the measures I have outlined tonight will cost $30m in a full year. The pension increases alone in November 1979 will cost $84m in a full year. The lifting of pensioner health benefit income limits will lead to additional Commonwealth expenditure through the Department of Health. This is a very considerable additional expenditure by the Government when you bear in mind that we were already spending more than $1.1 billion a year on maintaining the repatriation system. Let me repeat, it is more than $1.1 billion a year. It is estimated that pensions and allowances alone this year will amount to nearly $950m. </para>
          <para>Finally I would remind honourable senators that these increases in expenditure will add to a repatriation system which is outstanding by world standards. Compared with arrangements in other countries with comparable standards of living, the Australian repatriation system is very generous. The Government has not been able to increase other than the main repatriation pensions for three years, but this has been a matter of priorities in which we were guided by continuing consultation with organisations representing veterans. I am aware that these priorities have been a large factor in the regular consultations between the Minister and his Department on the one hand and the National  President  of the Returned Services League, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Keys,</inline> and the federal leaders of various organisations on the other hand. This has also been the subject of discussion whenever the Minister visits, as he frequently does, sub-branches of the RSL or other gatherings of veterans. </para>
          <para>Now, I am happy to say, we have been able to adjust these allowances to conform with current needs. These increases in benefits, restoration of six-monthly indexation, lifting the limits applying to pensioner health benefits and the restoration of full, free medical treatment to veterans who have suffered tuberculosis, plus inclusion of Allied veterans into the Australian repatriation system, is evidence for the whole country that this Government has compassion and is very mindful of the needs of the veteran and his dependants. There is no doubt of the obligation which the Australian people still owe our veterans. I hope that the new measures announced in the Budget will demonstrate that the Government fully accepts this commitment. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Strictly speaking, the answer to the question is &#39; nil &#39;, as any transfer of the nature referred to would require a constitutional amendment. However, in order to be as forthcoming as possible, set out below are details of functions and duties which have been transferred to State Governments or Instrumentalities since December 1975. Also included arc details of functions and responsibilities which it has been agreed are to be transferred in the future. The Northern Territory has been treated as a State for these purposes. For convenience, the following material covers matters falling within the portfolio responsibilities of all Ministers. </para>
            <para>Minister for Industry and Commerce: In two instances the prime responsibility of States has been re-affirmed: </para>
            <para>In the small business field- a Commonwealth/States program of assistance was developed, under the aegis of the Commonwealth/State Ministers Industry Council, by which States provide &#39;grass roots&#39; counselling services for small business and the Commonwealth provides support services such as management training packages and publications. This scheme replaces national small business counselling services which operated in Sydney and Perth. </para>
            <para>In the field of domestic tourism promotion- the Commonwealth, through the Australian Tourist Commission, ceased to bc involved. State/Territory prime responsibility for domestic tourism has been agreed between Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for tourism. </para>
            <para>Minister for Primary Industry: The following responsibilities have been transferred to the States: </para>
            <para>Livestock certification in respect of the Northern Territory; </para>
            <para>The Commonwealth Department of the Northern Territory transferred to the Northern Territory Department of Industrial Development the responsibility of being the designated authority for the purposes of OECD Schemes for varietal certification of seed moving in international trade. </para>
            <para>In addition, the 1978 Premiers&#39; Conference on off-shore matters produced a proposal for joint Commonwealth/State management of fisheries. Under the present system, the State manages the fisheries within territorial limits and the Commonwealth manages the fisheries beyond territorial limits, with the States performing day to day licensing and enforcement jurisdictions for the Commonwealth. Under the proposed system, which will be further considered at the 1979 Premiers&#39; Conference, fisheries would be managed by a joint Commonwealth/State authority, by the Commonwealth alone or by the State alone. </para>
            <para>Minister for Education: The following adjustments have been made in areas which are the responsibility of the Minister for Education: </para>
            <para>States Grants (Schools) Acts have been simplified to provide States with greater flexibility in the application of funds, less detailed accountability requirements and greater devolution of responsibility for approving disadvantaged and special government schools: and in addition the facility now exists to enable States to transfer grants between the general recurrent and capital programs in line with their own program requirements. </para>
            <para>In the tertiary area there have been discussions with the States on ways to improve administrative arrangements and already some procedures have been modified to reflect the responsibilities of the States. The Williams Report has made a number of recommendations in this area and these are under consideration. </para>
            <para>The Northern Territory Apprentices Board was transferred to the then Department of the Northern Territory on 1 January 1978, and control subsequently passed to the Northern Territory Government on 1 July 1 978. The provision of education services and responsibility for education matters in the Northern Territory, excepting those of a national nature for which the Commonwealth has a continuing responsibility, will be transferred to the Northern Territory Government on 1 July 1979. </para>
            <para>Minister for Transport: </para>
            <para>Navigation Amendment Bill 1979 contains provisions that will allow the States and the Northern Territory to legislate to apply the international collision regulations to all civilian shipping in the territorial sea and internal waters, to the exclusion of Commonwealth law. To the extent that the States and Territory so legislate. Commonwealth law on this subject will not apply in those waters. </para>
            <para>It is also proposed that: </para>
            <para>The regulation of intr a territorial navigation in the Northern Territory, which is currently covered by the Navigation Act, will be eventually covered by Northern Territory legislation; and </para>
            <para>The Northern Territory will eventually exercise aviation regulatory functions similar to those possessed by State governments, viz. economic regulation in the form of licensing of air services. </para>
            <para>Treasurer: States have been enabled under the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Act 1978 to increase or decrease the rate of personal income tax imposed on residents of the State. </para>
            <para>Minister for Social Security: </para>
            <para>The Australian Assistance Plan- previously within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Social Security devolved to the States in July 1977. </para>
            <para>Preschool education- from I January 1977 payments to the States have been made as block grants and not (as previously) on the basis of 75% of preschool teachers salaries. This change has allowed greater discretion to states in the deployment of preschool education resources. </para>
            <para>Lone mothers- as from 1 July 1979, the NT will assume responsibility for financial assistance to mothers bringing up children alone under an arrangement similar to that which is available to States under the provisions of the States Grants ( Deserted Wives ) Act. </para>
            <para>Minister for Finance: Revenues and expenditures relating to functions transferred to the Northern Territory as a consequence of self-government have been subject to the Territory&#39;s Audit Ordinance since 1 July 1978. The Audit Act 1901 ceased to apply to those revenues and expenditures from that date and the functions and responsibilities of the Minister for Finance have therefore been correspondingly reduced. </para>

            <para>There are no telephone facilities connecting the Lockhart River community to the telephone network. However, the office of the aboriginal community has an outlet via radio to the State Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement network based on Thursday Island. The hospital has access by radio to the Royal Flying Doctor Service at Cairns for medical calls and telegrams. </para>
            <para>A number of Outpost stations have been connected to the telephone network on a trial basis through the RFDS base station at Cairns. It is understood that the RFDS has no objection to Lockhart River community joining this trial but a request to participate would need to be made by the State Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement. </para>
            <para>Telecom is currently surveying the whole problem of telephone facilities for aboriginal communities and has commenced a program designed to provide standard telephone service for a number of communities both in Queensland and the Northern Territory. Firm plans for Lockhart River have not yet been made but it is quite a remote area in which there are other communication needs which must also be catered for. It will be sometime before standard telephone service is available in the area. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The Automatic Data Processing (ADP) equipment industry in Australia comprises two sectors: a small manufacturing sector (6 companies) employing some 500 persons and producing mainly cathode ray tube display terminals (known as CRT&#39;s) and other peripheral equipment a large service and consulting sector, mainly concerned with supplying and installing large computer systems (including software) of overseas origin. Large international companies e.g. IBM, Digital Equipment, Faso and Honeywell, constitute this sector of the industry. </para>
            <para class="block">In its report on ADP Equipment and Parts of 1 8 August 1 976 the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) found that there was little prospect for the production of large scale computer systems in Australia and that these units would continue to be imported. The IAC considered that the local manufacture of ADP equipment would probably continue to be confined to small peripheral equipment. </para>
            <para>The Government&#39;s decision, announced in November 1 976, on that report was to maintain the existing 24 per cent tariff on CRT&#39;s and to provide a bounty over a seven year period for most other ADP equipment. The bounty is equivalent to 20 per cent of value added in Australia by ADP manufacturers in each of the first three years of operation, decreasing to 15 per cent in each of the next two years and 7.5 percent in the remaining two years. </para>
            <para>Because the industry is subject to rapid technological change the Government also decided that the assistance accorded the industry be reviewed in five years, instead of the seven years recommended by the Commission, and that consideration would be given to including the software sector in the review. </para>
            <para>The Government&#39;s decision on the type and level of assistance to be provided to the manufacture of computers in Australia takes into account the need to provide positive assistance to the industry to plan for the future, to maximise the use of computers in Australia and to allow users access to the latest and best computer technology at or near world prices both to the benefit of Australian industry and the community as a whole. </para>
            <para>Bounty payments, which commenced on 29 March 1977, amounted to some $600,000 in 1977-78 and in last year&#39;s budget $ 1 , 500,000 was appropriated for this purpose. </para>
            <para>The Australian computer industry is also assisted by the Government&#39;s offset policy which was introduced in 1970 with the objective of narrowing the gap in technology and industrial efficiency between Australian manufacturing industries and those of highly developed overseas countries. As a result, major direct technological benefits to the computer industry have occurred through improvements in software developments, computer terminal production technology, introduction of high precision machinery and the manufacture of computer components. </para>
            <para>To date, offsets in excess of $60m have been awarded against purchases of imported computers providing considerable benefit to the computer industry. </para>

              <para>I ) Telecom has advised that a review of staff requirements is being carried out following a decline in traffic at the Northam Manual Assistance Centre. The fall in traffic handled at the exchange is due to the extension of Subscriber Trunk Dialling facilities in the area. The staffing review has not yet been completed but a reduction of three temporary employees is expected. The five temporary staff at the exchange have been advised of this possibility and four of these employees have already indicated their willingness to accept employment elsewhere. They can be placed in Perth if necessary. There are no firm plans to close the Assistance Centre in 1981. However, a nationwide review is being undertaken to develop plans for Manual Assistance Centres throughout Australia and the future of Northam, along with other centres, will be considered as pan of the exercise. The review will be very comprehensive and the final long-term plan is expected to be completed towards the end of 1979. A significant consideration in developing the long-term plan will be the extent to which it is possible to retain employment opportunities in country areas. </para>

          <para>Family Planning Associations are non-governmental organisations which conduct two different types of activities, namely, clinical (i.e. medical ) services and information, education and training programs, although there are some common areas in administration and in practical training. </para>
          <para>Clinical services provided by the State and Territory Family Planning Associations include counselling for pregnancy, infertility and sexual problems. These services are funded through Health Program Grants which are paid direct by the Commonwealth to the Associations. In 1978-79 approved Health Program Grants payments for these clinical services amounted to S2.4m. </para>
          <para>As mentioned, Commonwealth funding is made available under the Family Planning Program for information, education and training programs for health and health-related professionals, community groups and the general public. </para>
          <para>The ACTION Centre (a pilot project which opened in Melbourne in December 1976) is funded wholly by the Commonwealth under the Family Planning Program.

            <para>Since the beginning of 1 979, there has been a satisfactory recovery in foreign portfolio investment in Australia, reflecting the effect on foreign investors&#39; confidence of the improved outlook of the minerals and rural sectors, the stability of the Australian dollar and the general increase in the competitiveness and profitability of Australian industry. Data published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that for the March quarter 1979 the level of foreign portfolio investment was the highest quarterly inflow since this component was first published separately. </para>
            <para>The Government welcomes foreign portfolio investment because it injects additional capital resources into the economy without diminishing Australian control of local companies. </para>
            <para class="block">By its nature, a portfolio investment would not normally result in the foreign investor gaining a substantial interest in a company, let alone achieving control of the company. </para>

Proposed investments that involve takeovers of Australian companies must be notified to the Government. Such proposals are considered against broad criteria that take into account economic, social and other considerations and are only allowed to proceed provided they are found to be not contrary to the national interest. </para>

        <para>I am aware of recent authoritative papers concerning the incidence of surgical operations in general, and tonsillectomies, appendicectomies, hysterectomies and cholecystectomies in particular, which maintain that the variations between regions in Australia appear to be greater than can be explained by differences in population structure. </para>

            <para>I am not aware of any detailed plans to introduce a hospital patient monitoring system. However, following a recommendation of the National Committee on Health and Vital Statistics, on which all States and Territories are represented, every health authority is expected to be maintaining a hospital inpatient statistical collection by 1980. These will give a good picture of the utilisation of hospital services in Australia and should provide a foundation for further cost saving initiatives. In addition the Government is actively supporting the medical profession in developing systems of peer review, which, as well as promoting quality care, should serve to identify unnecessary procedures. The Government is firmly committed to reducing health costs and is discussing with the States possible measures which could be used to contain hospital costs, the largest component of health care expenditure. The discussion paper &#39; Report on Rationalisation of Hospital Facilities and Services and on Proposed New Charges&#39;, which I tabled in Parliament on 24 May 1 979 describes a number of these measures. In addition, I am confident the proposed national hospital inquiry will provide valuable information on ways of achieving savings overall in the hospital system. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) Occasionally there have been reports of individual farmers or farmer organisations expressing dissatisfaction with some aspect of the quality of farm machinery. This may be expected in these days of intensive farm mechanisation when it is so necessary to match the machine to the particular performance expected of it. It is not possible for machinery manufacturers to control the way in which the machinery is used in the field. The machine may be overloaded or not used according to specifications resulting in a failure which could not be attributed to faulty design or manufacture. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>There is some degree of dissatisfaction regarding the availability of spare parts as shortages can occur from time to time. This is understandable in view of the large range of sophisticated machines now in use on Australia&#39;s highly mechanised farms and the difficulties of maintaining full stocks of spares at numerous small agencies. Many country agents prefer to order spares as required from city merchants rather than maintain large costly stocks themselves. Sometimes there will be delays in despatch and transport from the cities. Furthermore the spare parts for many machines are imported which means that they may be subject to delays in supply from overseas. </para>
          <para>The question of the price of spare parts was the subject of an inquiry by the Prices Justification Tribunal in 1 977. </para>
          <para>The inquiry was initiated by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs following representations from several primary producer organisations including the Australian Farmers Federation, which expressed concern about the price and availability of farm machinery spare parts. The inquiry covered the seven major importers of tractors and agricultural equipment. It did not cover distributors or dealers, which are in most cases relatively small enterprises. </para>
          <para>In its report the Tribunal found that the prices of one of the seven companies should be reduced by five per cent and those of two other companies by ten per cent. </para>
          <para>The relatively high prices of spare parts were found to be due partly to the fact that the farm machinery industry generally sought higher rates of profit on parts than on new equipment, and partly to the cost of holding stocks of spare parts. In respect of some imported parts, it was found that the high prices were due to high transfer costs charged by the overseas parent company. </para>
          <para>Nevertheless, the Tribunal commented that the industry provided a high-grade service in terms of quality and availability of spare parts but that the cost of providing such a service network entailed large dealer networks holding large stocks of parts with slow turnover and consequent shrinkage and obsolescence. </para>
          <para>The Tribunal also found that complaints about availability of spare parts were few, particularly in view of the extensive distribution system provided by all companies. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The Department of Primary Industry maintains an interest in the supply and availability of agricultural machinery, and has recently collected information on availability and prices in the agricultural areas of Australia. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Whilst the Government seeks to provide the climate and conditions conducive to efficient development of industry, it would not be appropriate for the Government to seek to intervene directly in such matters as the number of different brands of equipment offered or policies concerning spare parts availability. Consumers and equipment producers alike are free to make their own commercial judgements in matters related to the purchase and supply of equipment. This enables consumers to secure access to the widest range of equipment which they themselves consider necessary, whilst producers are encouraged by the self-regulating effects, and the market place to ensure that they satisfy customer&#39;s requirements, including requirements for spare parts. </para>

            <para>The 1973 Medical Fees Tribunal under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> J. T. Luke discontinued the practice of lower Tees for Items 3330-3346 (removal of keratoses, warts or similar lesions) when these services were provided by non specialist practitioners. This decision which came into effect in April 1974 was in line with the Australian Medical Association&#39;s (A.M.A.) policy of not providing fee differentials when services are commonly and efficiently performed by specialist and non-specialist practitioners. The A.M.A. had, in fact, already removed the fee differentials from these items in its List of Medical Services and Fees 1 973. </para>
            <para>Item 3349 covering the removal of skin cancer was introduced into the Medical Benefits Schedule from 1 February 1979, after due consideration by the Medical Benefits Schedule Review Committee, on which the A.M.A. is represented. Cancer, of course, is often a very serious disease, but the skin cancers covered by Item 3349 resemble the wans, keratoses and similar lesions that I have already referred to. I am advised that they can be satisfactorily removed by a virtually identical procedure, and I have accepted the Committee&#39;s recommendation that a fee differential should not be provided. </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) Many agricultural sprays are highly toxic in their concentrated form. Even when diluted they could cause health or environmental hazards if improperly used. They must be handled with extreme care and only by properly trained, competent persons. For more than a decade the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association (AVCA) has conducted a campaign urging users &#39;read the label and heed the label&#39; so that they will use these chemicals safely. The labels draw attention to the need for care at all times. They specify not only the concentration and frequency of spraying, but also the safety precautions that must be observed and the safe period between the last spray and harvesting, and they give first aid information in the case of accidents. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>No. The packaging and labelling of these chemicals was converted to metric units in 1974, that is to say five years ago, though dual markings were permitted for a transitional period, lt would be a retrograde step to reintroduce dual marking. During 1974 the Metric Conversion Board issued a booklet entitled <inline font-style="italic">Metric Farming</inline> which had been prepared by its Agricultural Information Sector Committee in association with AVCA. 300 000 copies were distributed through AVCA members and State agricultural extension officers who also advised farmers on the recalibration of their mixing vats. The only significant dimension is the size of the tank or mixing vat. Once that has been re calibrated correct mixing is easy especially since many chemicals are pre-packaged in sizes directly related to the more common tank and vat sizes. Chemical sprays are expensive items and cost conscious users will take great care to avoid unnecessarily high and hence uneconomic mixtures. </para>

Extensive inquiries both within Australia and overseas were necessary before this could be obtained. Hence delay in answering the question. </para>
            <para>There is no evidence to suggest there is any risk of cancer arising from the use of plastic utensils in such ovens. Tests carried out by the Union Carbide Corporation and Moray Chemical Corporation in the USA have not shown any migration of plastics constituents into the food. The Food and Drug Administration of the USA has not placed any restrictions on the use of plastics in microwave oven cooking ware. </para>
            <para>Any container manufactured from plastics for food contact which is not fitted with metal pans can be used in microwave ovens as the microwaves do not heat the plastics. Heating of the plastics only takes place via the food in contact with the container. However, some plastics are limited in their use for microwave oven ware because of their low softening point which affects physical stability, their flammability and their low resistance to staining and impact. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources been drawn to a letter in the Australian Financial Review entitled &#39;Injustice to Shareholders&#39; and written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr K.</inline> W. A. Bridges in which the writer outlines the taxation system whereby the suppliers of all the risk capital in the Cooper Basin are receiving minimal dividends on the vast sums of risk capital invested so that consumers in the Sydney area are able to obtain subsidised gas supplies? Does the Government accept these actions as being conducive to the encouragement of further exploration and development? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>My attention has been drawn to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bridges&#39;</inline> letter, the thrust of which appears to relate to pricing arrangements for natural gas from the Cooper Basin rather than taxation as such. Cooper Basin natural gas for distribution in Sydney is purchased from the producers by The Australian Gas Light Company. The well-head price for this gas is established by negotiation between AGL and the consortium of producers. When agreement is not able to be obtained in these negotiations, the price is determined by independent arbitrators appointed by the producers and AGL. </para>
            <para>The city gate price at Sydney is a composite of the producer price plus the pipeline tariff from Moomba to Wilton. Until quite recently, the Sydney city gate price of natural gas was higher than any other Australian capital city. </para>
            <para>In March 1979, AGL announced reduced rates that apply only to domestic consumers, who represent 1 2 per cent of the total load. AGL estimate that the average price reduction to domestic consumers will be of the order of 5 per cent. </para>
            <para>Although the Federal Government does not control the price paid to Cooper Basin producers for gas distributed in NSW, nor in South Australia, we have a number of incentives to encourage exploration and development of hydrocarbon reserves, a number of which have benefited the Cooper Basin producers. For example, current taxation concessions include the accelerated write-off provisions available for capital expenditures on the development of a petroleum field and on petroleum transport facilities, and the eligibility of petroleum exploration, development and transport expenditures to be deducted against income derived from any source. Petroleum exploration and development has been encouraged by the Government&#39;s move to import parity pricing- especially by the decision to increase progressively the proportion of crude oil production eligible for import parity pricing, and by the reintroduction of permission to farm out exploration permits. The Government&#39;s various decisions concerning the North West Shelf have enhanced the prospects for that project and are further expressions of this Government&#39;s interest to encourage oil and gas exploration and development. </para>

          <para>The number of medical practitioners who have migrated to Australia in the nine month period to 31 March 1979 totalled 371; a substantial reduction from the 586 for the same period in the previous financial year. Of the 37 1 immigrant doctors, 14 were refugees and 25 were admitted on the basis of family reunion. In addition, a small number were admitted on humanitarian grounds or under free-flow movement across the Tasman. </para>
          <para>These figures clearly indicate the impact of the Government&#39;s recently introduced tightening of entry requirements which now involve an &#39;employment nomination&#39;. To be acceptable, an employment nomination must show that after extensive advertising a suitable medical practitioner was not available in Australia. </para>
          <para>The whole question of the immigration of overseas medical practitioners was considered by the Committee of Officials on Medical Manpower Supply, whose report was tabled in Parliament on 22 March 1979.

            <para>The production of oil from shale at Glen Davis in New South Wales was sponsored by the Federal and New South Wales Governments between 1940 and 1952. 1 am informed that the project was sustaining heavy losses at the time of the decision to close the plant and that the decision was also influenced by a shortage of mineable shale. Although the remaining reserves at Glen Davis are not known accurately, they are considered to be relatively insignificant by comparison with certain other deposits in Australia. In these circumstances they are not considered to be an attractive proposition for development at this time. </para>

            <para>I and my Department are aware of recent statements by nutritionists and medical practitioners about the relationship between poor food habits and patterns of disease in the community and the large amounts of money spent on advertising highly processed foods. </para>
            <para>Some time ago, I asked my Department to look at better nutritional programs for the Australian people. As a first step, a food and nutrition policy has been developed by my Department and nutrition education activities have been expanded. This year a number of publications have been produced including the large full-colour teaching poster Good Food for Good Health&#39; and a 76 page book &#39;Your Health and Your Figure&#39; which addresses itself mainly to people who are overweight- the major problem of malnutrition in our community. In response to public demand, a smaller edition of the poster has just been released, which is suitable for individual and household use. </para>
            <para>Also, the popular budget publication &#39;Eat Better for Less&#39; has been widely distributed in the community and continues to be available. </para>
            <para>A number of new publications are planned for 1979-80, including nutrition booklets for adolescents and for pregnant and lactating women. The poster&#39;Good Food for Good Health&#39; will also be printed in a number of languages for the migrant community. </para>
            <para>I would like to point out that an active nutrition education program at a national level would require a co-ordinated effort from many groups in the community. These would include the food industry, consumer organisations and professional groups, as well as Government. </para>
            <para>It is expected that food and nutrition will be an important component of the recently announced National Health Promotion Program to develop and test an initiative aimed at persuading all Australians to adopt healthier lifestyles. </para>

            <para>The full extent to which drugs, including heroin, are illegally used in Australia is difficult to gauge due to lack of comprehensive and uniform statistics. The indirect indices of illegal drug use which are available include police statistics on drug-related offences, drug-related deaths reported up by coronial enquiries, statistics from Government treatment services for drug dependent persons and community surveys of drug use. </para>
            <para>Because of the difficulties in comparing available data and the limitations on their interpretation, it is difficult to know how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gordon</inline> of the We Help Ourselves Organisation could make an accurate measurement of the current heroin usage level in Australia or predict future levels. While it would appear that there is a serious problem at present concerning illegal use of heroin, none of the indices available suggest a rise in heroin use in the future of &#39;epidemic proportions&#39;. </para>
            <para>The most recent police statistics show that the number of detected offenders involving heroin had decreased from 1,662 in 1976 to 1,346 in 1977. Figures available on the known deaths related to abuse of narcotics for all States except the Northern Territory show that there has not been a marked increase in deaths over the period 1 974 to 1977. The largest and possibly the most accurate numbers are reported for New South Wales, which had a total of 121 opiate related deaths over the four-year period. The deaths in NSW, however, have remained steady in 1976 (49) and 1977(42). </para>
            <para>It is also known that the numbers of patients treated for drug dependence (not only heroin) by State Government health services have continued to increase. While treatment statistics indicate a growth in the number of patients, it should be recognised that this increase is related to such factors as the availability of facilities, and the types of treatment offered. </para>
            <para>Several population surveys of drug use have been carried out in Australia in recent years, but it is difficult to compare study findings and reach any conclusions other than those of a general nature. In the most recent of the surveys of the NSW Health Commission*, it was shown that just under  S  per cent of 1,443 fourth formers reported having tried opiates and that half of these indicated that they were still using drugs. Very few indicated &#39;use on most days of the week &#39; and the trend from 1971 (0.2 per cent) to 1973 (0.4 per cent) of increased frequency of use on most days was reversed in 1977(0.2 percent). lt should be noted that only a small proportion of &#39;users&#39; are, in fact, addicted and in any prediction concerning future levels of use of heroin, only a small proportion of total use would be for the purpose of maintaining actual addiction. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister for Health has provided the following information: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Surveys of the Jabiru town site have shown the presence of Anopheles species mosquitoes. The species is widely distributed in the northern half of the Northern Territory. </para>
            <para>A program of monitoring the breeding sites of mosquitoes and advice on their control in relation to centres of population has been in existence for some years, together with surveillance of possible human carriers of malaria, and public education measures. The Northern Territory Health Department is continuing this activity. </para>
            <para>With regard to the selection of the town site, this was recommended by consultants to the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry, A. A. Heath and Partners Pty Ltd and Willis, Heath wood and Partners Pty Ltd. The site recommended was approximately eight kilometres to the west of the Ranger site on the south side of the Arnhem Highway, although other sites were put forward in addition to the preferred site. </para>
            <para>The Ranger Inquiry subsequently endorsed the recommendations of the consultants and the Ranger Inquiry recommendations were, in turn, endorsed by the Government. </para>
            <para>Officers of the Commonwealth were responsible for the design and successful implementation of the malaria eradication campaign which freed mainland Australia of this disease in 1962. Since that time a successful maintenance campaign has kept Australia free from malaria and this will continue in co-operation with the State and Territorial authorities concerned. </para>

              <para>1 ) Control of metal fatigue and corrosion is a continuing maintenance function exercised by aircraft operators throughout the world with metal aircraft of all types. Corrosion control is a variable and unpredictable component of aircraft maintenance throughout the economic life of all aircraft. It is a simple fact that all metal aircraft such as the Boeing 727 and Douglas DC9 suffer corrosion problems in service and these can only be dealt with by early detection and application of corrosion control measures. Despite the millions of dollars spent on research on aluminium alloys no methods have yet been developed which can prevent corrosion economically in the aeroplane environment. The same situation applies to aircraft engines. Control of metal fatigue is similarly maintained by a process of early detection and rectification. </para>

These must be approved by my Department and in the case of the local airlines, the manufacturers&#39; recommended inspection intervals and overhaul periods are varied by my Department to suit Australian operating conditions, lt is generally conceded by the prime manufacturers and overseas airworthiness authorities that Australian standards are conservative in this regard. The intervals are specified in the airline maintenance manuals as well as in Departmental airworthiness directives. </para>
