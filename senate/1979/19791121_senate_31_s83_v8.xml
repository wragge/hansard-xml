            <para>- I thank honourable senators for giving me leave. It has come to my notice through radio and newspaper reports today that last night it was alleged in the Queensland Parliament that I had some implied commercial association with certain drug runners in north Queensland. The allegations, which were made under parliamentary privilege, are scurrilous, defamatory and damaging. The allegations have no basis in fact and I deny them. I deny any knowledge of ever having met the gentleman who was mentioned in them. Now that the allegations have been made, I am grateful to the Queensland Government for having extended the commission of the royal commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Williams, to clear my name and also to expose the base nature of the honourable members of the Queensland Parliament who made the allegations. </para>

If you believed that the question asked and the answer given breached the sub judice rule, it was your duty to rule them out of order on the basis that the public interest involved was not of greater importance than adherence to the sub judice rule. In this way power would be kept in the Senate. The Senate has the power to disagree with your rulings, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> but we have no power to disagree with a Minister's decision not to be responsible to the Parliament. If a Minister decides whether a matter is sub judice, power is taken completely away from the Parliament. </para>

I point out that the general principle of the sub judice doctrine is to avoid interference with or prejudice to the proceedings of any judicial inquiry. That I have insisted upon very definitely and I will continue so to do. Within that principle any question asked should seek factual information only and not information which would have relationship to evidence or proceedings going on in a court in this country. </para>

Is he aware that the report indicates that the incentive will be at seven different levels related to the value added content, that it will be based on net foreign exchange earnings and that it will apply to a firm's total earnings rather than only to the increases in export sales? Has the Minister investigated this proposal to establish whether it retains the present relativities between the two countries or whether it will distort the market to Australia's disadvantage, contrary to the existing arrangements? </para>

I refer to the KGB spy affair in the United Kingdom which is centred on Anthony Blunt and which has followed the publication of Andrew Boyle's book <inline font-style="italic">The Climate of Treason.</inline> Is the Minister aware that the author, Boyle, claims that Blunt 's confession to British intelligence, otherwise claimed to be in 1964, was made as early .as 1957 and that Blunt 's exposure- to quote Boyle- 'may have come from a defector'? I ask the Minister: Was Petrov that defector? Noting that the Petrov affair blew up in Australia in April 1954 and that it is acknowledged that Petrov revealed to the Australian authorities a wide range of Soviet intelligence material including names of persons involved in espionage in other countries, I ask: Did Petrov name Blunt? Did Australia pass this information to the United Kingdom authorities? If so, to which specific authorities? </para>

Because the aged HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> already spends long periods out of service which will increase as time goes on, is it a fact that the Department of Defence is unwilling to see her tied up alongside to be fumigated against these pests? As the Minister would have the health and comfort of the men of the <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> at heart, will he or perhaps the Minister for Science and the Environment be able to give advice as to how the vessel could be fumigated or how the cockroaches could possibly be eradicated without the vessel coming temporarily out of service?

            <para>-My brief indicates that elections were held on 14 November to elect a national Parliament and regional councils on Tanna and Santo islands. The anglophone Vanua'aku Party won a two-thirds majority in the national Parliament. The Vanua'aku Party also won a majority on the Tanna Regional Council. The national Parliament is to meet on 28 November to elect a Chief Minister and to form a new government which will decide the date for independence. The Australian Government is closely interested in developments in the New Hebrides. It looks forward to the completion of the New Hebrides' progress towards independence and to an expansion of relations between the two countries. </para>

          <para>I say briefly that we have set a minimum target of $84m over the next three years for our aid to the South Pacific islands as a group, not including Papua New Guinea, and the New Hebrides can expect to continue being a beneficiary under this program. Currently projects covering several years and with an estimated total value of over $6m are in progress and new projects, in line with the priorities of the new government, will be introduced into the program when possible. However, we would expect the British and French governments, as the administrating authorities and, in the future, as the former metropolitan powers, to meet the major aid requirements of the New Hebrides, just as we have provided the major aid needs of Papua New Guinea since its independence. Britain's support for development and administration in the New Hebrides runs at around $6. 7m a year. We understand that the British have indicated that subventions of this magnitude, reducing at 6 per cent per annum, will continue in the postindependence period. </para>

I have not the actual dates but I will get them and let the honourable senator have them. The basis on which the pardon was given was in regard to the nature of the evidence that she was thought to be able to give in the case. The pardon was, of course, recommended by me to the Governor-General. The submission that I made to the Governor-General is not a matter which I propose to disclose, for reasons which I gave the other day when, I believe, I was asked a question about that. Certainly, documents passing between the Government and the Governor-General, or Ministers and the Governor-General, are not disclosed.

I do not propose, at this stage of the proceedings or in this place, to indicate to whom they have been given. That would be a gross interference with the conduct of the prosecution in this case. Certainly, anything further that I said in relation to the matter not only would be interfering with the conduct of the prosecution but also would raise sub judice questions. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. How does the Minister view the present campaign for a shorter working week as a means of reducing unemployment? Would those people working a shorter week take a pro rata cut in pay or would they demand the same pay for less work? If this happened, would not the consequent increase in hourly labour costs drive many firms out of business or cut back production, thereby increasing unemployment? In any case, for the firms not driven out of business, would not the likely result be, not the employment of the presently unemployed, but an increase in overtime by the current work force and a further increase in the costs of production? Is this not another cynical attempt by some militant unions- evidenced in other areas by attitudes to such things as crippling penalty rates- to gain maximum benefits for their members in work and to ignore the unemployed? </para>

            <para>- I have seen Press reports that the Vietnamese have been using toxic gases against Meo tribesmen in central Laos. These reports seem to have been based on Meo refugee reports from Thailand. The Government has no independent evidence to confirm the reports. I note, however, that on 8 November the Hanoi newspaper <inline font-style="italic">Nham Dan</inline> categorically rejected allegations that Vietnamese troops were using toxic chemicals in Kampuchea and Laos. In January the Minister for Foreign Affairs told the inaugural session of the Committee on Disarmament that Australia regarded the negotiation of a convention to control chemical weapons as an urgent matter. He said that chemical weapons remained the principal category of weapons of mass destruction still to be subject to a regime of control but it was an area where practical measures were immediately possible. Since then Australia has worked to this end in appropriate disarmament forums and is currently cosponsoring in the United Nations General Assembly a resolution urging the Committee on Disarmament to undertake at the beginning of its 1 980 session negotiations on a complete prohibition on chemical weapons. </para>

            <para>-I direct my question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Last week a report indicated that maize was available from the east coast of Australia for Timor but that no ships were available until January. Having in mind that the monsoonal season is rapidly approaching and that soon it will be well nigh impossible to get into the Timor mountains where famine is reported to be at its worst, will the Government press for the immediate consignment of rice in the DarwinKununurra area from which four barges now in Darwin can deliver food in the space of 36 hours along the coast of Timor and distribute it by using the barges' own four-wheel-drive vehicles and forklifts, et cetera? </para>

            <para>-I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> for his thoughtful question. My understanding is that a contract for 1 ,200 tonnes of maize was placed on 19 November with Wesfarmers Export Co. of Melbourne. Arrangements are in hand to ship the first 700 tonnes direct from Brisbane to Dili at the end of the month. The Government did consider the use of barges to carry this consignment, but it has now been able to arrange the charter of a larger vessel. This method of shipment offers a more economical alternative to the use of barges from Darwin which have less carrying capacity and the use of which would involve the trucking of the aid from Brisbane to Darwin. The possibility of using barges to distribute aid around the coast of East Timor was raised with the Indonesian Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross which are conducting the relief operation in Timor, but they advised that air and road transport had greater priority. The Government is aware of the offer of 25 tonnes of rice by the Western Australian Government and is examining whether this offer, which is an additional one to the one which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> has mentioned, is acceptable to the IRC and ICRC joint program. Maize, not rice, is the staple diet of the Timorese. </para>

I agree with him that, now that Australia's cricket team is back in one piece and with those two visiting teams in Australia, it is likely that we will have a particularly interesting season of great interest to people right round Australia. I will pass on the request that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> has made to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. I can report to him that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline> has stated on a number of occasions over the last few weeks when the matter has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> and by honourable senators opposite, some of whom were indicating their interest a few moments ago, the Government is particularly concerned that not all Australians will be able to see the various matches programmed and is actively continuing its efforts to ensure that these relatively recent developments in the granting of exclusive television rights to various television stations do not unduly prejudice the long history of widespread coverage of sporting events. </para>

            <para>- Control of the weed Paterson 's curse, or Salvation Jane, has been raised previously in the Senate. Indeed, the honourable senator, coming from Victoria, knows the problem that it is for agricultural areas throughout Victoria. Within the Australian Agricultural Council there was some contention as to whether the introduction of biological control of this plant would be detrimental to the interests of apiarists. The honourable senator will recall that recently the former South Australian Government expressed some opposition. I think it was the only party opposed to its introduction. Perhaps it is not quite correct to say that it was opposed to the introduction of a biological agent, but it was reluctant to see a biological agent introduced until the interests of apiarists had been fully considered. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation had a control agent available and was building up its stocks of that agent but was unable to make a release-that is not the prerogative of CSIRO- until it had the approval of the Australian Agricultural Council. </para>

          <para>The honourable senator's question is most opportune because today I received certain information from the Minister for Primary Industry in relation to this matter. The honourable senator was not aware of this; I received it only today. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon's</inline> letter, which is addressed to me and which will be conveyed to the CSIRO this day, states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I refer to our recent exchange of correspondence concerning the early release of insects for the biological control of Paterson 's Curse/Salvation Jane, and in particular to the proposal that the Australian Agricultural Council should continue to provide the mechanism for handling consideration of the matter. </para>
            <para>I am now in a position to inform you that the Council has unanimously agreed to the early field release of the control agents and that the CSIRO may proceed accordingly. In this context I suggest that CSIRO officers might contact direct those State Departments of Agriculture/Primary Industries concerned with the project, so that necessary administrative matters associated with the release may be finalised. </para>
            <para>All State Members of Council have been advised separately of the Council's out-of-session decision and their respective Departments advised to anticipate a direct approach by CSIRO in due course. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister representing the Minister for Defence aware that McDougall Airlines, which operates coastal surveillance between Cairns and Broome under sub-contract to Executive Air Services, was one of the air charter companies named in the debate on drugs in the Queensland Parliament last night as being possibly involved in the drug trade? Can the Minister inform the Parliament how many air charter groups, including sub-contractors, are engaged in coastal surveillance? What sums are paid for each contract? What type of aircraft is being used, including the numbers of aircraft? What are the names and addresses of all owners and crew members, and of company board members where applicable? Does the Department of Defence check owners, companies and crew members before contracts are awarded? If not, why not? In view of the doubt cast on one more contractor engaged in surveillance- the Minister will recall that another of my colleagues mentioned that one of these companies is owned by a Hong Kong company- will the Government take urgent action to replace private surveillance contractors with Royal Australian Air Force aircraft and crews? </para>

            <para>-I refer the Minister for Education to a recent publication by the Schools Commission entitled 'Australian Students and their Schools', for which publication I congratulate him. Does that report show, in part, that about one student in eight may be losing a day's schooling each fortnight through illness; that one-third of school children aged five to 14 years are taking some form of medication, most of it not prescribed medication; and that almost one in four of such students suffer from some form of chronic illness? Is the Government concerned about this evidence of fairly widespread ill health among Australia's youngsters? Is the Department of Education giving any thought to developing programs in schools which seek to promote healthier lifestyles among the young specifically, given that we are doing that for adults, and which specifically seek to discourage young children from taking pills and other medicationa habit which if started at such a young age may prove almost impossible to break at a later stage in life and in fact may lead to long term adverse consequences? </para>

            <para>-I hope that all honourable senators will have perused the report 'Australian Students and their Schools' and that they will take the satisfaction I have taken in the quality of the report and the information it contains. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Puplick</inline> indicated, it shows that, as a result of a health survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics during 1977-78, 12.4 per cent, or about one student in eight, lost one or more days from school in the two weeks before the ABS interview, probably due to illness or injury. It should be noted, however, that absenteeism may not always coincide with illness. In the two days before the interview, 3 1 .6 per cent of children aged five to 14 years were estimated to be taking some form of medication. Of the total in the age group, it was estimated by the Bureau that 20 per cent were taking medications which were not prescribed, while 14 per cent were taking prescribed medications. The report shows also that of the children aged five to 14 years it was estimated that 26.9 per cent, or approximately one in four, had experienced chronic illnesses- those which respondents said their children had had for more than six months or were permanent disabilities. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government is extremely concerned at the health statistics reported in the publication. I will ask the Schools Commission to raise the issue at its next regular consultations with State government and non-government school authorities- the bodies responsible for the direct administration of the majority of schools. Honourable senators will appreciate the usefulness of a publication of this nature. As to the whole issue of positive health, I have had discussions with elements of my Department, including the Curriculum Development Centre, to see whether one could devise curricula, not only by way of remediation but also by way of prevention, so that we would be developing in Australia an attitude towards positive health. I regard the matter as a very important one indeed. </para>

He is particularly concerned about the matter. Of course, the legislation that has recently been passed by the Parliament itself sets out very strictly to whom information may be divulged. The Director-General is at pains at all times to ensure that that is observed. </para>

            <para>-I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Construction to the recent Budget decision relating to reductions in this year's Federal public housing expenditure. Is it correct that as a consequence of this decision the Federal Government's contribution to the Victorian public housing budget will be reduced by at least 30 per cent during this financial year? Is the Minister aware that these reductions have put increasing pressure on the Victorian Housing Commission to become, to a large degree, self-financing? Will the Minister comment on the claim of the 'Shelter Victoria' group that new public housing and rent rebates for the poorest third of public housing tenants are being paid for by working class Commission tenants and buyers and not by the community as a whole? Does the Minister agree with the claim that this redistribution of subsidies away from lower income earners defeats the aim of Commission housing? If so, will he assure the Senate that the Government will take whatever action is possible to prevent the introduction of market rents and escalating interest rates within the Commission so as to ensure the maintenance of low cost Commission housing for those families and individuals on low and moderate incomes? </para>

            <para>-The Commonwealth is providing substantial aid to Victoria for housing assistance to lower income earners. For 1 979-80, $42m in low interest advances and $22m in interest free non-repayable grants have been allocated to Victoria. Whilst this is a reduction of 25 per cent on the allocation for 1978-79, it must be seen in its proper perspective. The grant component, as the honourable senator may know, has been increased from $6m to $22 m and that gives Victoria the incentive to increase its contribution to housing and to attract private capital into the program. When considered in light of the big increase in the level of private housing finance and the large increase in untied general purpose payments, it will be seen that Victoria is allowed maximum flexibility in ordering priorities in relation to housing. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Victorian Housing Minister has advised that in 1978 the Victorian Government made available $ 18.6m from Consolidated Revenue, Treasury funds and semi-government borrowings for welfare housing purposes. This is in direct contrast with reports that welfare housing has been forced to become self-financing as a result of cuts in Commonwealth funds. The direct State contribution is approximately 30 per cent of the Commonwealth contribution. The 1978 Housing Agreement has as its aim the provision of housing assistance to those in need for the duration of need, and therefore provides for States to set rents having regard to a policy of rents relative to market levels for those who can afford to pay. Rent rebates are provided for those in need and allow increased repayments as circumstances improve. Each pays according to capacity. For both home purchases and rental assistance programs, hardship is avoided. It is incorrect to say that low income tenants are subsidising the poorest third of Housing Commission tenants. </para>
          <para>In addition, I believe that honourable senators should be aware of the substantial increase in the allocation for the operation of the Home Savings Grants Scheme. In 1978-79, Victoria received $6m for the operation of that Scheme. In 1979-80 this amount has been increased to $22m. The Government believes that the policies embodied in the 1978 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement are progressive, equitable and efficient to meet the housing needs and to ensure that each person pays according to capacity. </para>

            <para>- I have seen various reports arising out of the statements from the European Community and the European Commission, all of them emphatically pointing to the fact that the world is moving into a crisis in the short term and into a quite perilous situation in the long term if energy is not developed by alternative means to fossil fuels. I have seen reports of very substantial sums of money which are to be set aside by the European Commission for the development of energy sources and notably nuclear energy. It is clear that a very large number of European nations have come to the conclusion that they will need to develop nuclear electricity generation as the one viable alternative to fossil fuels. Therefore, under absolutely proper safeguards, Australia has a responsibility to ensure that the world is not put into peril and insecurity by the collapse of its energy programs. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Yesterday Senator Wriedt</inline>asked me whether the Minister for Defence was aware that in 1977 Air Vice-Marshal Jordan, to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> attributed the position of Director-General of Health Services, gave the Williams Royal Commission detailed statistics of cases of drug addiction in the three Services between 1975 and 1977. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> went on to allege that there was a conflict between the Defence Minister's answer to a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> and the evidence presented to the Royal Commission by the Department of Defence. He went on further to advance a suggestion either that the Minister for Defence was unaware of what was going on in his Department or, alternatively, that there had been attempts by the Minister to mislead the Parliament. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> put out a Press release in the same vein yesterday. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am now advised by the Minister for Defence as follows: It is a fact that in December 1977 Air Vice-Marshal Jordan, who was Assistant Chief of Defence Force Staff and not Director-General of Health Services, provided the Royal Commission with evidence on matters specified in the Royal Commissioner's letters patent insofar as they related to the responsibilities of the Department of Defence. I am advised that that evidence is freely available in the Parliamentary Library. The hearing was a public one. The statistics provided by Air Vice-Marshal Jordan are Exhibit 129 of the proceedings of the Royal Commission. Nowhere in the submission, or in the accompanying statistics, was the term 'addiction' used. The Minister for Defence further advises that the answers to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> 's questions are: </para>

            <para>Australian exporters of meat and livestock have indicated that they are not facing any problems associated with discharging cargo at Iranian ports. Latest reports show product is being handled normally. </para>
            <para>Some shippers of meat and livestock faced initial difficulties in obtaining payment for product which had been shipped and for which letters of credit or payment facilities were to be cleared through the US. However, Iranian authorities have recently indicated that these food items are priority imports and that they would facilitate arrangements which would allow exporters to receive payments through alternative channels which would not involve clearing monies via the US. For example by cancelling existing letters of credit and issuing new ones for clearance outside US. </para>
            <para>Some exporters are reported to have already been able to make alternative payment arrangements and we are hopeful that all other affected exporters will similarly be able to conclude satisfactory new payment arrangements. </para>
            <para>I would hope that all exporters are alerted to the possible difficulties arising from this situation and that they are aware of alternative financing procedures. With regard to livestock and meat exports, I am sure that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation with its representatives in Tehran, would be able to assist. </para>
            <para>With respect to wheat, up to the present the Australian Wheat Board is not aware of any problems associated with discharge at Iranian ports. The Wheat Board in August 1979 contracted to sell 520,000 tonnes of wheat to Iran for shipment from September 1 979 through to January 1 980. Part of that quantity has already been shipped. The next shipment is scheduled for late November. The Wheat Board has received payment for all wheat that has been shipped and the Board's bank has been reimbursed for the payment. The Board is presently checking through bankers with the Iranian importers as to the arrangements regarding payments for future shipments. </para>

            <para>-On 8 November 1979 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland sought advice on the possible use of section 64 of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 to enable the Australian Broadcasting Commission to televise sporting events declared to be in the national interest. At the time I said that although I was not offering a legal opinion I thought it was stretching the point a little to suggest that that section of the Act could be used in that way. The advice that I have been able to obtain since then confirms that preliminary response. I am advised by the office of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications that if the television rights to a particular sporting event are not held by the ABC the Minister could not direct the ABC under this section to provide a coverage. The suggestion is described as another example of the somewhat simplistic solutions which have been canvassed in recent times. </para>

          <para>This matter is obviously of concern to a number of members of this Parliament, as is evidenced by the rash of questions which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline> and I have received in recent weeks.

As I said in answer to questions from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> both this week and last week, the solution requires cooperation between the organisations which grant the rights, the commercial network which secures the rights, and the ABC. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline> is committed to the view that the co-operative approach offers the only real solution. </para>

I asked a question at Question Time and spoke in the debate on the High Court of Australia Bill in the afternoon. I was in the Senate briefly after dinner but left, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> mentioned yesterday, because I was going through a difficult phase with a stomach complaint that I picked up recently. </para>

        <para>It is a fact, as <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shows, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chipp</inline> and I have spoken and voted in the Committee stage of the Human Rights Commission Bill, voting in divisions on amendments up to the one of last Monday night. The attitude of the Australian Democrats towards the Bill changed when several Liberal senators made a statement last weekend to the effect that they had withdrawn their significant and important amendments and that these amendments, which we would have supported, were no longer achievable. I have been present in this chamber every sitting day of this calendar year, as the records of the Senate will show. For one good reason or another most honourable senators do not manage that. I think it is fair to say plainly and publicly that there are devices, such as pairing, which enable honourable senators to slip away from this place for hours, days or even weeks at a time. When that happens with Government and Australian Labor Party senators we do not hear an outcry from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> or from the media itself. However, this outcry does come about when a Democrats senator is absent for only a few hours even as a result of illness. We appreciate the interest in us to that extent. </para>
        <para>The effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> 's reported comment in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> has been, I believe, to cast a slur on my dilligence in this place. I must reply to that. I think that the record shows that I have tried to raise issues as much as possible in debate and through questions. Indeed, I have asked 105 questions with and without notice in the Senate this year, which is many times the average. Although the Australian Democrats number only two of the 64 senators in this place, at one stage - </para>

          <para>Not surprisingly, with a war in progress in Kampuchea only 300 kilometres from the conference room, and the threat of a further influx of Khmer Rouge refugees into Thailand as soon as the rains stopped later in October, the issue of 'illegal immigrants' occupied the minds- of delegates above all else. Accordingly, in the Joint Communique adopted and issued by the Assembly major stress was placed on the following resolutions: </para>

            <item label="10.">
              <para>The AIPO Second General Assembly deplored the continued occupation of Kampuchea by Vietnamese armed forces. It noted with grave concern that repeated efforts by the ASEAN states and other members of the international community to obtain the withdrawal of Vietnamese armed forces from Kampuchea and to allow the Kampuchean people to exercise their right to self-determination have so far proved to be of no avail. On the contrary, there are strong indications that further massive Vietnamese military build-up in Kampuchea is preparatory to a new major offensive after the rainy season. </para>

              <para>The General Assembly also noted reports that widespread famine has broken out in Kampuchea and that the entire Kampuchean people is threatened with extinction through starvation and diseases. A quarter of a million people may be forced to flee into Thailand within the next six months, in search of food, medical supplies and safety from the fighting in their country unless something is done immediately to end the conflict there. Moreover, the conflict in Kampuchea may spill over into the ASEAN region, in particular Thailand, and it may draw foreign forces into direct armed confrontation with Thailand. </para>

          <para>There is no doubt that the attendance of an Australian observer delegation at the AIPO General Assembly was welcomed by all the delegations present, and that it contributed to a further strengthening of relationships with our ASEAN neighbours. Every opportunity was provided by our hosts, the Thais, to enable us to mingle informally with delegates as well as to occupy a prominent position at the formal sessions of the Assembly. We were also introduced to senior figures in the Thai Government and military establishment, who generously assisted in making arrangements for us to visit the border town of Aranypathet and the refugee camp in that area. </para>
          <para>The atmosphere was one of friendship and warm hospitality towards Australia, as well as openness of discussion on a wide range of topics of mutual interest.

          <para>On 9 October I indicated to the House that I would shortly be in a position to make known the Government's response to the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory relating to planning procedures and processes in the ACT. This Report was tabled in both Houses on 4 April 1 979. </para>
          <para>The Report of the Committee is wide-ranging and thorough and it deals with a matter of importance for future direction of the ACT. I congratulate the Committee on the Report. </para>
          <para>The subject matter of the inquiry has presented to the Committee some challenging issues which it has met forthrightly and, I venture to say, wisely. It has made some 25 recommendations and I am pleased to announce that the Government has found only 5 of these unacceptable. It would be a formidable task for me to detail the Government's attitude in relation to the recommendations. </para>
          <para>The implementation of the proposals which have been accepted is, of course, the next step in the process. Some of the proposals can be put into effect immediately and relatively easily. Some have already been put into effect. Others involve the amendment of ACT Ordinances and the NCDC Act. Some will have administrative and resource implications. The Parliament may nevertheless be assured that the Government, within its capacity, will work speedily towards the implementation of the recommendations to which it has agreed. It looks forward to a continuing fruitful relationship with the Joint Committee on the ACT. Following is a summary of the recommendations and the Government's proposals in relation to them. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">The Government, in introducing the Aboriginal Development Commission Bill, is taking steps to put into effect what I have been saying for a number of years- the placing into Aboriginal hands of the control of Aboriginal affairs. I have said on many occasions in the past that the Aboriginal people have come of age. It has now been accepted by the Government that this proposition is undeniably true and this Bill confirms their belief in that view. I am confident that those Aboriginals who will be appointed to the Board of this Commission will accept the challenge the Government has thrown down to them. This is doubly an historical occasion, I believe, not only because of the importance of the Bill itself for the Aboriginal people, but for the first time in history an Aboriginal is introducing a Government measure into the Parliament. I sincerely hope that this measure will be accepted by the Aboriginal people and that they will support the Government's policies on self-management and self-sufficiency which underpin this measure. This Bill is another positive move towards meeting the Government's major policy commitments to the Aboriginal people of Australia. It places in the hands of Aboriginal people important instruments for their own advancement. It is a further step in the implementation of the policies of self-management. It is not the first step, nor is it the last. </para>
          <para>During the life of this Government, it has placed substantial capital assets and operations in Aboriginal hands and under Aboriginal control. These have included: in the Northern Territory, land rights in the form of land held in trust for Aboriginal owners in perpetuity; and throughout Australia, the purchase of land, enterprises and housing for both social and economic purposes. </para>
          <para>These accumulating assets are providing a new social and economic base for Aboriginals. The Commonwealth is not working alone in this. State governments are also playing a significant role in setting aside and preserving Aboriginal lands, including sacred sites. The Commonwealth will continue to encourage the States to make suitable provision for Aboriginals to have secure access to, and use of, land for their social, economic and cultural benefit. </para>
          <para>The Government recognises that there remain many areas of inadequacy in the field of Aboriginal affairs- be it health, housing, education or employment. We are not, therefore, satisfied with what has been achieved so far. While there have been many advances, much remains to be done. Some programs which have been introduced with the very best of intentions have not always succeeded in achieving their aims. In some such cases, significant causes of failure have been a lack of understanding of Aboriginal ways and a lack of sensitivity to Aboriginal people by governments and their public servants. For too long, non-Aboriginal people have generally decided what is 'good' for Aboriginal people. Under the Aboriginal Development Commission Bill, Aboriginals will be responsible for the decision-making. Of course, this is not to say that Aboriginals also will not make mistakes. It is to be expected that we will, as we all do. But Aboriginals should have greater sensitivity to Aboriginal needs and they will learn from any mistakes they make while exercising this responsibility. </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to create the Aboriginal Development Commission. The Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser, in his 1 975 policy speech said that the Government would: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Fund programs which develop Aboriginal self-sufficienty and which represent initiatives that Aboriginals themselves believe will enhance their dignity, self-respect and self-reliance. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Commission is seen as a concrete expression of this principle. Also, an Aboriginal Entitlement Capital Account will be established and vested in the Commission in accordance with the joint parties' policy statement of 1 975 which: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Recognises the problems arising from the past dispossession and dispersal of the Aboriginal people and the community's resulting responsibility. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Honourable senators will recall that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> first announced the intention to establish the </para>
          <para class="block">Capital Account on 26 October 1978. Subsequently, the decision to proceed with legislation to establish the Commission and the Capital Account was announced on 2 September 1979. The Commission will take over the responsibilities of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission for acquiring land, the Aboriginal Loans Commission in making loans for houses and businesses, and the area of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs which makes grants for enterprises. The amalgamation of these functions into one statutory Commission, which will be under the control of Aboriginals, will overcome problems of co-ordination, improve overall effectiveness in the delivery of these services to Aboriginals and provide greater scope for Aboriginal training and employment. The Bill 's purpose is to further the economic and social development of Aboriginals and, in particular, as a recognition of the past dispossession and dispersal of the Aboriginal people, to establish the Aboriginal Entitlement Capital Account with the object of promoting Aboriginal development, self-management and self-sufficiency. </para>
          <para>The Account will have two Funds, a Capital Fund and a General Fund. The Capital Fund will provide a permanent capital asset for the use and benefit of the Aboriginal people which will provide a further opportunity for Aboriginals to accumulate assets. In this it is not unique because, as I mentioned earlier, large capital assets have already been vested in the Aboriginal people. However, this will be the first explicit statutory recognition of the broad and wide concern of the Australian community to effect a just settlement. Honourable senators will recall the unanimous resolution of the Senate on my motion on 20 February 1975, which stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1 788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people, and introduce legislation to compensate the people now knows as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government draws attention to the fact that land rights, land purchases and other accumulating assets to which I referred earlier are real measures of compensation. Additional moneys to those required for the annual programs and administration of the Commission will be provided to the Capital Fund so that it can operate as an accumulating investment account. The moneys appropriated to the Capital Fund will not be available for distribution by the Commission to its programs and administration, but the income which is received from the investment of these moneys will. The capital will be placed in approved forms of investment. Payments to the Capital Fund will be determined annually in the budgetary context and will provide a significant and increasing source of capital. This is a new development which ultimately will lead to independence from Government funding. </para>
          <para>The basis of the General Fund will be the moneys currently available to the Aboriginal Loans Commission, the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission and the Department's enterprise vote. Future amounts will be determined in the budgetary context. The 1979-80 appropriation for the Aboriginal Loans Commission is $5. 5m. The 1979-80 appropriation for the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission is $0.8m which, together with an amount of $0.556m carried over from 1978-79, will make available $1.3m for the Commission's activities in 1979-80. The Enterprise grant-in-aid appropriation for 1979-80 is $3.6m. The total of these appropriations is $ 10.5m. It is estimated that an additional $2m from the recycling of existing housing and enterprise loans will also be available. Additional moneys will be necessary for the Commission to be administratively autonomous from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. In addition to moneys from these sources, it is proposed that the Commission should also be able to receive moneys from nonCommonwealth sources, such as gifts and bequests. The Commission will also have a borrowing power within Australia which will be subject to appropriate limits. </para>
          <para>It should be noted by honourable senators that the Commission will have a ten-member Board of which at least seven members, including the  Chairman,  will be Aboriginals. The other three members may be Aboriginals or nonAboriginals but are required to have expertise respectively in banking, property and business. In deciding to permit non-Aboriginals to hold up to three positions on the Board, the Government accepted the advice given by the all Aboriginal Council for Aboriginal Development. Appointments will be made by the Governor-General. The Commission will develop its own policies, subject to any general Ministerial directions which the Commission will be required to set out in its Annual Report to Parliament on its operations and activities. It should be recognised that with such authority being vested in the Commission, it will carry the responsibility for its decisions. Provision is made in the Bill for the National Aboriginal Conference to comment to the Minister on the Commission's annual report. The Minister is required to table both the Commission's annual report and the comments by the National Aboriginal Conference in the Parliament. This is the first statutory recognition of the National Aboriginal Conference and thus focuses on the National Aboriginal Conference as the elected representative body of the Aboriginal people. </para>
          <para>The major functions of the new body will be to advise and make recommendations to the Minister on the economic and social development of Aboriginals- a new statutory function; to acquire land for Aboriginal communities and groups on a walk-in-walk-out basis; to assist Aboriginals to obtain loans for houses and certain personal purposes; to make loans and grants to Aboriginals, including individuals, partnerships, clubs, cooperatives or companies, who are capable of engaging in business enterprises to set up business ventures; to provide training for its personnel and its clients; and to assume new functions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner's</inline> statement of 26 October 1978 stresses maximum participation of Aboriginal people in the development of the final proposals'. A task force was commissioned in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to consult with interested Aboriginals and Aboriginal organisations throughout Australia, including the National Aboriginal Conference and the Council for Aboriginal. Development. The task force received detailed submissions from the Aboriginal Loans Commission and the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission. Reports from Aboriginal organisations and individuals were also taken into consideration. </para>
          <para>The question of a report by the National Aboriginal Conference on the Bill was discussed between the National Aboriginal Conference Executive and the Minister on 9 November. These discussions took place in the context of a call for a treaty. Some people have said that a treaty is the proper approach, while others have expressed concern that a treaty is not appropriate because of its international connotations. Both the Government and the National Aboriginal Conference acknowledge the obvious fact that we are all citizens of Australia and the Executive of the National Aboriginal Conference has indicated that it, like the Government, is interested in negotiating consensual arrangements about the appropriate provisions which should be made by the Commonwealth for the Aboriginal people of Australia. The National Aboriginal Conference has described the proposal as 'makarrata', a Yolnu word which signifies the end of a dispute between communities and between a community and an offender and the resumption of normal relations. The problem of a divided nation which some people have mentioned does not arise in the dealings between the Commonwealth and the National Aboriginal Conference as the elected representatives of the Aboriginal people. At its discussions, the National Aboriginal Conference Executive decided to establish a committee to examine not only the proposal for an agreement but also the Bill, and to provide its comments on the latter by early March 1 980. The Minister indicated to the Executive that the committee, in its work, might cover long-term arrangements in Aboriginal affairs. The Executive has stated that it sees its consultations on the longer term proposal for an agreement extending over the next 1 8 months. </para>
          <para>The Council for Aboriginal Development is the formal advisory body to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and, through him, to other Ministers and Commonwealth authorities responsible for policies and programs bearing directly on Aboriginals. The Minister has therefore consulted the Council for Aboriginal Development on this and other matters on a number of occasions. The Council made detailed recommendations to the Government which have greatly assisted in the preparation of this Bill. The Minister wishes to thank the Council for its contribution. </para>
          <para>As stated previously, the Commission will be an Aboriginal controlled body and will therefore be responsible for the recruitment, selection,  appointment, promotion and dismissal of its staff. The Government anticipates that the Commission will seek maximum Aboriginal staffing. To assist the Commission, it is proposed to expand training programs for Aboriginal staff early in 1980. In its 1977 policy statement, the Government acknowledged the general importance of training in management and other skills. Training will have an important bearing on the success of this Commission. It will be a necessary requirement to ensure that aboriginalisation will in fact become a reality within an acceptable period of time. The Commission cannot expect to function effectively unless Aboriginals acquire the necessary skills, to control operations and meet objectives. </para>
          <para>A great deal has been achieved through the existing commissions, which were set up in 1974. The valuable contribution made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Charles</inline> Rowley,  Chairman  of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Wardle,  Chairman  of the Aboriginal Loans Commission, and their fellow commissioners in these important areas of Aboriginal affairs, is recognised and appreciated. </para>
          <para class="block">The two existing commissions will continue their roles until the new Act is proclaimed. It is intended that the Bill be available for public scrutiny and debate and that it should lie on the table until later in the autumn sittings with a view to passage and then proclamation by I July 1 980. This will allow for public comment to be received and assessed by the Government. Copies of the Bill, explanatory notes and a 'plain English ' version will be circulated to Aboriginal individuals and communities, and other interested bodies, throughout Australia. </para>
          <para>The task force will conduct further consultations with Aboriginal people throughout Australia during the early New Year period, and all interested individuals and organisations will be asked to forward submissions by no later than early March. A similar process was followed in relation to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Comment and suggestions on the contents of the Bill, therefore, would be welcomed as its-enactment will have an important impact on Aboriginal economic and social advancement.

          <para>It is not too many years ago that I was degraded by being obliged to have a permit in order to leave the Palm Island Aboriginal Reserve. As a contrast, it is a source of great pride to me as an Aboriginal senator to. stand here today and be able to commend to honourable senators this Bill, which represents a significant step forward for my people- a step which I am absolutely confident that they will unhesitatingly take. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- I refer again to questions concerning publications which were asked during the hearings of Senate Estimates Committee A when dealing with the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Various appropriations are made for the purchase of books, newspapers, periodicals and so on. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has supplied quite an extensive breakdown of the various publications. It is interesting to note that, for that one Department, $17,000, no less, is appropriated for newspapers, $15,000 for periodicals and magazines, $ 1 1 ,000 for government publications and $10,000 for books of various natures, making a total appropriation of $56,000. I was assured by the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick ) that every effort is made to ensure that there is no overlapping in the publications which are bought by departments.</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>When one looks at the list of periodicals, magazines, overseas newspapers, et cetera which are bought by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, one finds that there are about 350 of them. All of us in the Parliament would be reasonably familiar with a great many of them. In fact, they represent quite a massive amount of reading material. Assuming that they are coming in mostly on a weekly or monthly basis, I do not quite know how any number of people in the Department could possibly find time to read them. They are not reference publications; somebody would have to read them to find out exactly what material is contained in them and how that material can be used. In view of the undertaking given that an effort was made not to overlap these publications and therefore prevent any unnecessary expenditure, I asked the Department of Foreign Affairs to provide a similar breakdown of the various publications. I have not as yet received the breakdown but I ask the Minister to ensure that a list is provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs similar to that provided by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, so that we can obtain some indication of whether an unnecessary expenditure is taking place and whether in fact those departments would do better to liaise more with each other on many of those documents. That might be so particularly in so far as the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is concerned, as presumably a very large number of publications is purchased by the Department of Foreign Affairs because they involve matters of a foreign affairs nature. If the Minister can provide that information now, well and good; if not, I would like it supplied as soon as possible. </para>
          <para>I take this opportunity to refer to another matter which I believe is of concern to most Australians at the present time. It concerns the appropriation for matters within the responsibility of the Minister for Finance <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson).</inline> I raise the matter of the quite horrendous overseas borrowings by the Australian Government. We will all recall that prior to the last general election the present Prime Minister ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser) gave an assurance that Australia would not be put into hock and that we would not become dependent on overseas capital. Of course, we in the previous Labor Government were accused of doing that by endeavouring to borrow moneys overseas for the purpose of developing Australia 's resources. It is an irony that now this Liberal Government has given the States authority to do just the very thing that we were endeavouring to do during our term of office. Already the States have been authorised to borrow an amount of almost $2,000m for the purpose of infrastructure borrowing; that is, for capital works, roads, rail facilities, port facilities, power development and things of that nature. </para>
          <para>The more serious matter is the fact that the Australian Government is now in hock to overseas lenders to the extent of $6, 628m, virtually all of which has been incurred under the prime ministership of the man who said that we would not put Australia into hock. Recently I asked the Minister for Finance for details of Australia's present commitment under that borrowing program. I think it is worth placing on record the extent to which we have placed ourselves in hock. The Minister for Finance indicated in his reply to me on 11 October that during this year, 1 979-80, we will have principle and interest repayments of not less than- I will keep these in round figures- $327m. Before I mention the rest of these figures, I might add that not one cent of this money has been borrowed for the purpose of developing Australia's resources; it has been borrowed to get Australia out of the currency mess that this Government has got us into. Next year 1980-81, we will have to repay $397m; in 1981-82, $668m; in 1982-83; $685m, in 1983-84, $936m; in 1984-85, $713m; in 1985-86, $649m; and in 1986-87, $667m. Whatever party forms the government in this country in those six financial years will be required to repay overseas no less than $4, 300m of moneys borrowed by the Fraser Government because of the economic difficulties into which it has got itself in the last four years. </para>
          <para>I repeat: None of these moneys has been borrowed for the purpose of developing Australia's resources. The moneys have been borrowed because of the Fraser Government's own mismanagement. We now find ourselves indebted to this huge sum for which the Australian taxpayer will have to foot the bill in seven short years. In that seven-year period we will be required to repay over $4,000m to the people from whom we borrowed those moneys. By the end of the century the amount will total $6, 600m. This is not allowing for the fact that almost certainly these borrowings will continue. They will certainly go on while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> remains in office and continues with these policies. </para>
          <para>I want to put on record the nature of the difficulties so that they can be understood by the Senate and by as many people as can possibly learn of them. We should cast our minds back to the outcry that took place when a previous government wanted to borrow less money than the amount now involved, not just for the purpose of shoring up our currency but for the purpose of developing our resources which at that time were worth no less than $5,700 billion and which now of course are being largely developed by overseas capital. This Government did not have the courage and never will have the courage to proceed with development using Australia's own resources and its own borrowing capacity. Instead we have this massive burden hanging around our neck which will have to be repaid by Australian taxpayers, thanks to the policies of Malcolm Fraser. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I rise to take the opportunity presented in this debate to give a brief report to the Committee and the Australian public on a matter of great public interest. Recently, in the company of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin,</inline> I joined a delegation of American congresswomen seeking to enter Kampuchea to plead with the authorities to allow more relief in to assist the people, particularly the children, who had been the victims of warfare and violence in that country. I think that the Australian public is very well aware of the plight of the people of Kampuchea, both those who have survived the holocaust within that country and those who have sought refuge in neighbouring Thailand. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am greatly gratified that the Australian public has taken the situation very much to heart and has responded very generously to the various calls for aid from Australian aid agencies. Because of the great interest by Australians in what has happened to the Kampucheans in recent times and because no Australian parliamentarian had been into Kampuchea since 1975 I believed, along with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin,</inline> that it was important that we should make every effort to get into the country so that we could bring back to the Parliament a first hand account of the needs of the people there and reassure the Australian public that the aid that it was giving so generously was reaching the people for whom it was intended. </para>
          <para>The initiative came from American congresswomen who, like the people of Australia, had been extremely concerned and distressed by the reports of massive starvation and deprivation in Kampuchea itself and in the refugee camps. They wanted to make some concrete sign of goodwill and support towards those suffering people. It was an initiative of congresswomen particularly I think arising from the women's caucus within the Congress. It was hoped that a delegation of women, perhaps because of its novelty, might have a particular impression on the Kampuchean authorities. Women from legislatures all over the world were invited to join the delegation. In the event only <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline> and I from the Australian Parliament were able to join the delegation. But we brought with us to the administration in Kampuchea messages of support for the exercise from all women in Australian parliaments. This, in itself, I think is unique and very important. </para>
          <para>I will describe very briefly our experiences, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline> will expand on this description. Firstly, we were able to visit two refugee camps in Thailand. One was at Sa keo. It is a new camp which had been constructed specially by the Thai administration in order to allow refugees who had been living along the border for some time to move into the sanctuary of Thailand and to receive the aid that was being offered by the aid agencies. The condition of most adults and children in that camp was very dire indeed. There had been many deaths- up to 40 a day. That number was decreasing with the assistance that was being provided. Distressing signs of extreme deprivation, starvation and disease amongst adults and amongst children in particular were evident. However, the camp was being administered by representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Most of the world aid agencies as well as independent relief teams including an Australian medical team were giving assistance to the refugees. It was heartening to see that the efforts of the international agencies were so effective and that the agencies were so competent at delivering emergency services in these traumatic circumstances. </para>
          <para>The delegation subsequently visited a very large border camp in the province of Arunyaprathet where up to 200,000 people were seeking refuge from the continued fighting in that part of Kampuchea. It was very difficult for us to ascertain the general standard of health in that camp because of the sheer weight and mass of people. However, again it appeared that there were very serious needs for food, shelter, medical supplies and administrative assistance of all kinds. On the next day we were finally able to get visas to enter Phnom Penh. With the American congresswomen we did so. The sight that met our eyes was as distressing as has been described in various parts of the media. The city has been destroyed. The countryside has been destroyed. There are no resources at the moment to meet the needs of the people who have survived what was carried out during the Pol Pot regime. However, the Australian public will be interested to know that emergency food supplies and other emergency assistance are getting into. Phnom Penh via the international agencies. Representatives of various international agencies in Phnom Pehn are working with the administration to try to restructure, and set up, services for the supply of food, medical services and transportation. According to the report of the relief workers in Phnom Penh, every effort is being made in the most difficult of all imaginable circumstances to start to supply some of the immediate needs. </para>
          <para>A subject of discussion in the world community has been whether the aid has been able to get into Phnom Penh and the surrounding areas. We were relieved to find that aid was reaching at least the needy in Phnom Penh. The distribution of aid from Phnom Penh into the countryside is difficult. The transportation system has been totally destroyed and very few of the people left are able to carry out any sort of food distribution program. The process is very slow. However, we left Phnom Penh feeling that every effort was being made. Again we can give assurances to the Australian public that the aid that it is giving via bodies such as the Australian Council for Overseas Aid and World Vision is indeed meeting its targets. </para>
          <para>Back in Bangkok we were able to have a meeting with the Prime Minister of Thailand. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline> on our behalf was able to express to the Prime Minister the appreciation of the Australian people for the very generous efforts which the Government of Thailand is making in assisting the refugees. At some risk to its own security Thailand is permitting the refugees to enter its country. It is providing a haven for hundreds of thousands of people and, of course, is co-. operating in every way with the international agencies to bring emergency services to these people. This is a very generous act of the Government of Thailand and one which involves its own security. I have been gratified to learn since we returned to Australia that even more camps are being constructed by the Thai authorities and more refugees will be moved from the very dangerous border areas into the relative safety of Thailand. </para>
          <para>One could go on at great length describing the circumstances of the people who are the victims of what has happened in Kampuchea in recent years. There have been some very graphic photographs and news reports of the situation. I have certainly never witnessed such deprivation, severe starvation and rampant illness on such a large scale. I am sure most Australians would feel as I do that that situation is totally unacceptable. Anything the Australian public can do to alleviate it will be welcome. The fact of the matter is that the situation will continue for the foreseeable future. There is no immediate resolution for the political problems of Kampuchea in sight; so there will be an on-going flow of refugees seeking refuge in Thailand, assistance from the world community and. in some cases, seeking refuge in countries such as Australia. Vast amounts of aid will have to be supplied by the world community to the camps within Thailand. </para>
          <para>It is unthinkable that Thailand itself should bear the full brunt of providing services to these people. Vast amounts of aid will have to be sent continually into Kampuchea itself. One of the heartening results of our visit was that the Kampuchean administration has expressed itself as being more willing and flexible in regard to the receipt of aid from international agencies and the very necessary matter of allowing medical personnel into the country is now under consideration. We were led to believe that this was under consideration by the administration in Kampuchea. Kampuchea is a devastated country. There is no question of its being able to provide for its people the resources they need. There is no question that it can be rebuilt without substantial on-going help from the world community and in particular from countries like Australia where there is very serious recognition of the problem and a willingness to assist. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, I would like to assure all of those people who have been giving assistance through our agencies to the international agencies that what they have been doing has been effective and very important. I hope that they will continue to exercise the generosity they have exercised to date. I would like to place on record my appreciation and recognition of the very excellent work being carried out by all the international agencies which are active both within the camps in Thailand and in Kampuchea itself and, of course, our own aid agencies which are co-operating with them. I personally acknowledge the assistance given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline> and me by officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs both here in Canberra and in Bangkok. Our trip was arranged at extremely short notice and it was only because of the very strenuous and competent efforts of Department of Foreign Affairs officers that we were able to secure the necessary documentation to carry out this exercise. Any person living in an affluent and lucky country like Australia ought to feel that he or she can contribute to alleviating the problem. I hope that we will continue to do so. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I, along with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan,</inline> appreciate the pressures on the Senate this week in considering its business. We seek to take the opportunity which is provided by consideration of the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs which includes multilateral aid programs to speak briefly in the Senate on this matter. We appreciate the assistance that has been given to us by other honourable senators in enabling us to take up this short amount of time to make formal public statements for the public record on our visit to Kampuchea last week. I shall endeavour not to repeat those sections of our experience that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> has outlined but shall elaborate on some other aspects of the journey which I believe are of significance to this country and of significance to the horrendous refugee problem that exists in Thailand as a result of problems in Kampuchea, and the difficult problems that exist in Kampuchea itself. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Australians are assisting in the resolution of that problem in a number of ways. I believe that there is a very real concern in Australia for the very unfortunate victims of the situation which has ruled in Kampuchea for the last few years and which currently obtains. I think that is demonstrated when one looks at the level of support that has been given from Australia both by the Government and by the public in an attempt to alleviate the problem in some small measure. Therefore, I think that it is relevant that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> and I should report back to the Parliament and to the public on what we saw of the way that both Government and private donations are being used and on indications that were given to us of what might happen in the future. </para>
          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> indicated, our visit was important in the sense that we were the first Australian members of Parliament to be permitted to enter the country since the fall of the Lon Nol government. It ought to be noted publicly that we applied to enter the country on very short notice. We applied only a few days before we actually went to Phnom Penh and with the difficulties of communication over there it is clear that the Kampuchean authorities were very swift indeed in giving us approval to join the United States congressional delegation to enter their country. It ought to be reported to the Parliament that when we went into the country in a United States Air Force plane with what had originally been a United States congressional delegation, the Kampuchean authorities accorded us as Australian members of Parliament totally equal status with the United States congresswomen and made a point of ensuring that whenever they referred to the delegation they mentioned both the Americans and Australians. One can conclude from that that there was some significance to the Kampucheans themselves in their very deliberate decision to allow us to enter their country in quite a unique way. </para>
          <para>I would like to speak for a few minutes about a number of matters that were raised with us in Phnom Penh as well as making a few comments on the subject of aid. We met in Phnom Penh with Hun Sen who is the Foreign Minister under the Heng Samrin regime. I will briefly report the issues that he chose to raise with us, that is, a delegation of representatives from the United States of America and Australia. There is some significance in the topics he chose to raise. There had been a great deal of controversy and heartburning throughout the world on the attitude that the authorities in Phnom Penh had taken towards receiving aid through the international agencies for the Kampucheans who are still living in Kampuchea. Previously the Heng Samrin regime had set a condition that aid would not be accepted from, those agencies which also sought to distribute aid to Kampucheans in the areas of Kampuchea not dominated by either the Vietnamese or the Heng Samrin regime. That has sparked a great deal of feeling and was very much the instrument in stirring the Congress women to seek to visit the country and to carry the message that the world wants to help these people who are starving. </para>
          <para>The message <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> and I took is that Australians want to help these people who are in this desperate plight. They do not want to be involved in local politics; they just want to help people who are in" very obvious need. The Foreign Minister told us that he did not believe aid should go to both sides and said that to give aid both to Phnom Penh and across the Thai border was to challenge the sovereignty of the Heng Samrin regime. He termed giving aid across the Thai border as an act of aggression. Nevertheless he went on to state very strongly that the country wanted aid and that suggestions that the Heng Samrin regime would not allow aid in to its own people were lies which were spread by enemies of the country. We placed strong emphasis on the fact that the country would accept aid. When we pressed him on how it would be made available he said that the authorities were prepared to accept aid through the international agencies. When we asked him which international agencies- I think that this was the most significant thing to come out of our visit to Phnom Penh- he specified all agencies currently in Phnom Penh, which included the United Nations Children's Fund and the International Committee of the Red Cross which are two agencies which had not accepted the condition of giving aid to only one side. These agencies had insisted throughout on their right to give aid to people in need wherever they may be. It is now clear that the Heng Samrin authorities have dropped that condition to receiving aid from those two agencies. That was very good news indeed. </para>
          <para>On the matter of actually delivering and distributing aid in, we had a lengthy discussion. One of the great difficulties has been that Phnom Penh airport is in such bad condition. It can take aircraft of only a limited size, and only a limited number of flights a day. Aid has been getting in through the airport but it has been emergency aid, the kind of food that one flies in for people who are very very ill, as well as small quantities of rice and maize. Medicine has been getting in, as have some transport vehicles, but access through Phnom Penh airport has necessarily been very limited because of the condition of the airport. </para>
          <para>Kompong Som harbour has now been repaired to the stage at which it can take vessels of a reasonable size. Very recently it was announced that the Mekong River would be open to boat traffic and thus it would be able to transport significant volumes of food up river through Vietnam and into Kampuchea. In regard to the method of distribution, the authorities indicated that their first preference, was that aid should come in through the port of Kompong Som because it was best able to handle large amounts. They also said that the Mekong Riverwas very significant because, as well as enabling the shipment of large amounts of food up to Phnom Penh, it could be used to distribute food within the country in which, we are informed, not one bridge on the roads is left standing. That very small piece of information might give people some idea of the incredible difficulty of distributing aid within the country. I repeat, all of the bridges have been destroyed. </para>
          <para>When pressed on the subject of bringing in aid through Phnom Penh airport, the authorities said that they would agree to the receipt of as much aid as the airport could handle; that they would agree immediately, if necessary, to increasing substantially the number of daily flights that could come in. However, they emphasised that they did not believe that it was the best way of bringing in large amounts of aid. When pressed on whether they would agree to flights to provincial airports, in view of the great difficulty of transportation by road, in order to get food out to the provinces, the authorities said that they 'would consider it'. I think that I can say on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> and myself that effectively they were saying 'no'. They did not really, in our opinion, rate that as a possibility. </para>
          <para>When asked their priority of need for aid, they listed them in this order- food, medicine, clothing and transport. I must say that the inclusion of clothing was a small surprise to us. We would have thought that transport would have come third after medicine. When questioned closely on it, they said that clothing was their third priority. We were informed that the Pol Pot authorities had taken away from the people all but one set of clothing. They are desperately short of basic clothing for the population. </para>
          <para>The question of medical aid raises the question of medical personnel. We visited a hospital which had 600 beds and only four doctors. As far as we were aware, in the pan of the hospital that we saw, all of the 600 patients were very ill indeed. They had no laboratory facilities, pathology facilities, X-ray machines or ancillary equipment of that kind. Obviously, they desperately need that sort of support service- not just medicine but the support services that go with it. Clearly, they also need additional personnel. They must now face the problem of bringing in foreigners so that medical facilities may reach the people effectively. When asked whether they would consider proposals for bringing in foreign medical personnel, again they said that they would consider it'. They gave an equivocal answer. Proposals on this subject have been put to them in the past and rejected. Again I think I can say on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> and myself that our reading of the answer was that while it was an equivocation there were positive overtones and there may be some chance- under whatever conditions we are not aware- of getting some medical personnel into the country. They did mention that there were in the country some Vietnamese medical personnel, but we received the impression that there were not many. That is a summary of our meeting with the Foreign Minister, which was the most significant event that we participated in there. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline>has covered the subject of aid. I would like, in one or two minutes, to make a few comments on that subject. Aid is being sent from Australia in two forms. It is going in direct aidwhere the Government has decided that it will spend money on specific programs- and through the international agencies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> has said quite a bit about the international agencies and how well they are working there. I would endorse that in order to reassure the Parliament and the Australian public that the aid that is received from public sources, whether governmental or through individual donations to public agencies, is being used very well indeed. Also, the Australian Government has supported and funded one or two specific programs and comment on these was made while we were in Thailand. I refer to the provision of a medical team in the refugee camp of Sa Keo, the provision of a Hercules aircraft to fly from Bangkok to Phnom Penh with the emergency supplies to which I referred earlier, and the provision of a jumbo jet load of tarpaulins and medical supplies which last weekend flew to Bangkok, courtesy of Qantas Airways Ltd. There was comment on that from aid personnel. Clearly, if specific assistance is to be given that is the sort that the Government ought to be giving. For example, the point was made that a Hercules aircraft is ideal for flying into an airport which is in such a bad state as is that of Phnom Penh. Other countries have offered 747s and DC 10s but they cannot land aircraft of that size at that airport. Our decision to send a Hercules was a very wise one. </para>
          <para>The ICRC and other aid agencies are stockpiling tarpaulins, food, medicine and so on in anticipation of a huge influx of refugees in a condition similar to that of the poor wretches who are in Sa Keo, the camp which has received so much publicity in recent times. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> in reassuring the Government and the public that the money that we are spending there is well appreciated. It is understood that Australia is making a significant contribution. Many people have said to me since I came back from Kampuchea: 'We know it is terrible and we feel strongly about it, but what can we do?' I say to them that they can do something. They can give money, money which will be used very well. I was gratified to read in the Press of the last couple of days that the Australian public, through private donations, has now contributed more than $4m to the Kampuchean Relief Fund. That news is extremely welcome. </para>
          <para>I make one final point. The congresswomen sought to make a particular point about the children of Kampuchea and the very desperate state that they were in. Of the many tragedies the we saw- it is the first time that I have seen directly the effects of war- the plight of the children was heart-rending. We saw in a number of cases evidence that there are very few Kampuchean children. We noted in refugee camps the very low proportion of young children in relation to the total population. In an orphanage in Phnom Penh we noted a very small number of children under the age of six. In circumstances of extreme hardship it is the old and the very young who die first because they are the ones who are most vulnerable- as the Kampuchean children have proved to be. It is tragic to watch the stunting, as well as the death, of so many of them. In Kampuchea we saw not only a devastated country but also a devastated race, a devastated civilisation. Whatever we can do as Australians, as very wealthy individuals in a very rich country, to alleviate the extraordinary suffering and devastation that that race and country have undergone we must do. </para>

            <para>- I have answers to several queries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> asked earlier today about Government borrowing. I am advised that the Government's program has been the subject of a number of policy statements by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> in recent years. These borrowings have largely reflected the adverse movement in Australia's overall balance of payments situation resulting, inter alia, from depressed overseas demands for Australia's commodity exports, the surge in oil import prices and adverse private capital movements. The Treasurer has indicated that future overseas borrowings will continue to be influenced by the state of the balance of payments. Australia 's debt servicing requirement* relate to the gross domestic product and are consistent with levels which prevailed in the 1960s. I think that that reply may also answer other queries that have been raised. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have received advice from the Joint House Department regarding a question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> last evening concerning the front entrance of Parliament House. The honourable senator asked whether additional staff would be required to police the new entrance. The answer to that is yes. He asked whether the salary estimate for the Joint House Department allows for the additional staff to be appointed. The answer to that is no, but an application for additional staff is to be made shortly. He asked whether the new front entrance has been finished. The answer is yes. He asked whether additional staff had been appointed. Additional staff have not been appointed, but applicants have been interviewed and recommendations for employment are being prepared. He inquired as to when the additional staff are likely to be appointed. Staff appointments are expected to be made as soon as positions can be formally created, funds approved and recruitment processes finalised. </para>
          <para>Last evening a question was raised in the Committee of the Whole about the Governor-General's allowance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline> suggested that the Governor-General's allowance should be provided by some special appropriation. The present practice was adopted in 1 953-54. It provides a measure of privacy for the Governor-General for domestic expenditure at his official residences. A change in the appropriation would not in itself throw the allowance open for public scrutiny as to detail. Such scrutiny would be available under the present appropriation if that were the policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> asked a question relating to separation of the costs of official establishments, particularly in relation to the Lodge and Kirribilli House. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has consistently declined to provide a separation of costs. This follows an answer which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> as Prime Minister, gave in 1975, a copy of which I have. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> gave a partial breakup in March 1 976, to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> referred last night. The Prime Minister has already dealt with this aspect in answer to a question on 8 April 1 976. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline>also referred to each trip of the Prime Minister to 'Nareen' costing $3,500. This is a repetition of a misquote in the Press. In answering a question in June 1979, the Minister for Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen,</inline> quoted the cost of a flight by a BACIII aircraft from Canberra to Mount Gambier at $3,498. The Prime Minister actually flies in a VIP aircraft from Canberra to Melbourne and in a charter aircraft from Melbourne to 'Nareen'. This represents a substantial saving on flying via Mount Gambier. </para>
          <para>In relation to the use of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr's telephone, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> claimed that the Prime Minister's answer to his question on notice had not provided the information requested. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> is aware of the answer that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> gave in the Senate on 8 June 1979 to Question No. 1325. As recorded on page 3009 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is not the practice to make public the telephone accounts of current or ex-holders of Vice-Regal or Parliamentary office and I do not propose to institute such a practice. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In relation to advertising costs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> asked for an explanation of the increase under division 500.2.06 for advertising and media productions from $29,195 in 1978-79 to $58,000 in 1979-80. As I indicated last night, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> sought similar information before Senate Estimates Committee A. As was explained by officials at that time, the increased provision covers the cost of a Press advertisement on 16 July headed 'In the national interest', and over the signature of the Prime Minister. Detailed information in relation to this advertisement was given in answer to Question No. 4430. </para>
          <para>A question was raised about surveys for the information task force. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> asked for information on the provision of $10,000 for surveys under division 500.2.06. The information task force was set up to examine the dissemination of information by Commonwealth departments. Details were set out in an answer given by the Prime Minister in September 1978. The $ 10,000 provision covers, in the main, a poll designed to establish the extent of public awareness of departmental programs, a survey of newspapers to establish the extent to which Press statements have been reported, and the monitoring of television and radio programs to establish the nature and frequency of references to departmental activity. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline>referred to underestimating relating to VIP aircraft costs. Because the use of VIP aircraft is authorised as and when required, estimating likely flying time over a future period of 12 months is particularly difficult. The only practical approach is to base the estimate on the number of hours flown in the previous year with a reduction for any non-recurring events in the previous year. The hourly costing rate applicable to flying hours is the rate current when the estimates are compiled. No allowance is made for future increases in operating costs arising from factors such as increasing fuel prices. </para>
          <para>I hope that that, basically, provides adequate answers to a number of questions that were raised last evening. I think that the Senate will see that some of those questions were raised before Estimates Committee A. I acknowledge that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> was unavoidably absent during the questioning of officers by Estimates Committee A. I think it would serve the chamber well if we were to consider first the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the proceeding of Estimates committees. If answers to the questions <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> is asking are contained therein the time of the Senate now would be saved. </para>

            <para>- I thank the Minister for Science and the Environment for providing answers to some of the questions that I asked last night. We now know that an application has been made for additional staff in order that the new front entrance of Parliament House may be operated in the way that it was intended to operate. I assume that the application for additional staff has been submitted to the Public Service Board. I would like confirmation or otherwise of that. I would also like to know whether an application has already been submitted to the Public Service Board and rejected. According to the estimates for the Department of Housing and Construction, $166,000 has been spent on the new front entrance. The rationale for installing a new entrance is that it is essential for the security of Parliament House. It is not being used although it was finished on 24 July. We have gone through the whole parliamentary session with the new "entrance having been completed but not being used because staff have not been made available. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I suggest that that is evidence of either very faulty planning or a tacit acknowledgment that the whole project was not worthwhile in the first place. I will assume that the real reason for this front entrance having been, by implication of the Government, unnecessarily constructed lies in the over-reaction by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> to a bomb explosion which occurred in Sydney about 20 months ago. In other words, $166,000 of public money has been wasted to indulge the Prime Minister's militaristic fantasies which flowed on from that explosion in Sydney. I note that the Minister has not answered the other questions that I asked last night pertaining to the Auditor-General's reports. I would like to take up that matter at a later stage. </para>

            <para>- I thank the Minister for Science and the Environment for the part answers that he has given to me. The first matter that I wish to deal with relates to the answer he gave to me regarding my query on the cost of VIP aircraft flights from Canberra to Nareen. He admitted that the Minister for Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen,</inline> was the one who triggered off the Press release that the cost was $3,498. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has since disputed that cost. That raises the query now of who, in fact, knows the actual cost? Is it the Minister for Defence, who is in charge of VIP aircraft, or the Prime Minister, who uses them? That is something which we should ascertain in this Parliament. We have received two different statements of the actual cost. If honourable senators look through the manifest, they will see that at times the VIP aircraft does go to Mount Gambier. It might not go there all the time, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> has stated, but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> admitted a few moments ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen</inline> is on record as saying that the VIP aircraft costs us $3,498 every time it is used by the Prime Minister to go to his home at Nareen. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As the Prime Minister was highly and severely critical of the cost of travel of the previous Prime Minister, I think some comment needs to be made on that. As I said before, this Prime Minister appears to have double standards. He is quite prepared to use any amount of public money in his own interest. On the other hand he was quite prepared to severely criticise the previous Prime Minister's using money for his conveyance. The other matter of great interest, relating to the query I raised last night, concerns the amount of $58,000 for advertising. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> referred me to page 399 of the Senate Estimates Committee A <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> had pursued the matter at some length. Of course, I have found after reading that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that $45,000 of that amount dealt with a Telecom Australia industrial dispute. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> has just told us that it was an advertisement in the national Press headed: 'In the National Interest: Telecom Dispute'. I would like to know why the Prime Minister became involved with such an advertisement when that is rightly a matter for the Minister for Industrial Relations. It is in his province to solve disputes like that. </para>
          <para>What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> is probably not aware of or does not want to admit is that although $45,000 was spent- I want to ask about that because the officer of the Department in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> said that that was not the final cost and perhaps today we can get the final cost of the advertisement- on the advertisement which was headed, 'In the National Interest' we now know that that dispute has been resolved in the interest of the Telecom employees. So, $45,000 of taxpayers' money and some further amount about which we will probably be told was used in an exercise against the workforce of this country to put an argument which in my view was a false argument because the court a few days ago approved the Telecom employees' claim. The increase they sought has now been granted. They were quite right in engaging in the dispute yet the Government of this country put out a national advertisement which it said was in the national interest. It spent $45,000 of taxpayers' money to try to prove to the taxpayers that in fact the Telecom employees were the people who were in the wrong and that the Government or Telecom was in the right. I think that that situation ought to be brought home to the people who take a vital interest in some of the misleading statements that are put out by the Government which now runs this country. </para>
          <para>Another matter, of course, is the use of $ 10,000 for a survey into what use is made in the newspapers and in the media of radio and television of Press statements put out by Ministers. Here is a government admitting that it is prepared to spend $10,000 of taxpayers' money to monitor Press statements put out by its Ministers. I well recall that not so long ago many Liberal members of this Federal Government and members of the previous Liberal Opposition in South Australia very severely criticised the Dunstan Government's setting up a monitoring program to see if its Press statements were being fully and properly reported. That is again a test of double standards. The Liberal Government in Canberra is doing the very same thing about which its members were very severely critical of the Dunstan Government in South Australia. If one goes through the whole history of the Liberal and Country Party coalition and the now Liberal Government in South Australia, one can find, time and time again, instances of its being quite prepared to criticise a Labor government in office for what it does. Then when it gets into office it does the very same thing. The Government says that the action was in the national interest! </para>
          <para>I want to get back to the non-answers that I have been given in relation to two matters. Firstly, the cost of the previous Governor-General's telephone between Australia and England. I have spoken at length on this matter in the Parliament on many occasions. I have asked, as I did last night, whether he has a free telephone. Yet the Minister came in today and said that we cannot be told the cost of a telephone for previous office holders. Cannot we be told whether in fact this gentleman has a free telephone or whether he pays for it himself? We have to assume that in fact he has a free telephone. Cannot this Parliament ascertain what the use of this telephone is costing the taxpayers? We were able to extract from the Government the bill that the taxpayers had to foot for Harry M. Miller. It was in excess of $30,000. As I said last night, Harry M. Miller was the entrepreneur for the book that was written by the previous Governor-General. I have been told that the book was mainly written over the telephone with calls between England and Australia. That is why I want to know the cost of the telephone. Yet here we have a Government which is prepared to run in secrecy over that matter. It is not prepared to tell us what it cost the taxpayers to write that book. It is trying to bolster up the actions of that Governor-General on 1 1 November, four years ago. We will have to use some other means. I suppose, considering the Government's behaviour, we will have to wait until we get into government and then we will expose the cost. That is the only way we will be able to find out. The Government of the day is not prepared to admit that this person has a free telephone and what the cost is to the Australian taxpayer. </para>
          <para>We got a similar answer today about the break up of the cost of running Kirribilli House and the Lodge. The Minister came in and referred to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> when he was Prime Minister. Of course, as I pointed out last night, that precedent was broken by the present Prime Minister. On 26 March 1976, a few months after he assumed office, he was quickly able to get a breakdown of the running costs of Kirribilli House and the Lodge. At the time he thought that would embarrass the previous Prime Minister. Yet we now find that the Government relies on a statement, made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> that one cannot get a breakdown of the costs. Again we have the Prime Minister using double standards. He is quite prepared to give us the running costs of those two official establishments for six months for the period when Labor was in office but he is not prepared to tell us what it costs now. I think this Senate has a right to know how taxpayers' money is being expended by this Government. Today I looked though some old <inline font-style="italic">Hansards.</inline> I found it very interesting that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holding,</inline> asked a similar question at Estimate Committee A of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> who was in charge of the estimates. He gave the very same answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holding.</inline></para>
          <para>Of course, when one has a look through the <inline font-style="italic">Hansardone</inline> finds that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> who put a similar question on the House of Representatives Notice Paper when the Labor Party was in Government. He sought the breakdown of the running costs of Kirribilli House and the Lodge. He wanted it. We were not the first to try to find out what the costs were. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner,</inline> who is now a Minister who wanted to find out the cost when he was a back bench member in the Opposition. Yet we are criticised when we want to know the cost. He did not get an answer but he quite ably referred to a statement by the former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam.</inline> I will quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> 's answer which appears in the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of '25 September 1979 of Estimates Committee A and which is recorded at page 33. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I refer the honourable member to a statement by former Prime Minister Whitlam- <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> 4 November 1975- in which he stated the traditional rule that expenditure figures are not made available for official establishments individually. It has been regarded in the same light by other Prime Ministers, and they have all adhered to the principle of regarding the costs of operation of official establishments as a total charge against the annual budget appropriation, and would not provide information as to different charges incurred by different establishments. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">They are the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner.</inline> Why did he want to get a breakdown when he was a member of the back bench in Opposition. He wanted the information then. Of course, when he was asked a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holding,</inline> the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in the other place, during the Estimates committee hearing, he fell back on the answer given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam.</inline> He failed to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holding</inline> that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> who created a precedent by quickly getting a breakdown of the costs of those two establishments. Again I ask the Minister: Why cannot we have it? Why does the Government want to cover up the costs of this Prime Minister in those two establishments when it wanted those costs revealed when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> was in Opposition. He sought that information through his back bench when he was Leader of the Opposition. When he became the Prime Minister, after a series of events of which we have spoken many times, he was quickly able to give us a breakdown of the costs. They are the matters to which we want answers. Surely we can be told whether the previous Governor-General has a free telephone? It is only a simple answer, yes or no, and surely the Minister's officers ought to be able to tell him. If they cannot, I will have to pursue the matter through the office of the Minister for Administrative Services, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McLeay.</inline> But when we look at these divisions in the Appropriation Bills, I think they rightfully come under the Prime Minister's Department. </para>
          <para>In relation to the matter of the break-up, I can assure the Minister that in the time I have remaining in the Senate and while I am here in the Opposition that I will continue to explore the costs of those establishments incurred by this present Prime Minister. It is no good a government of the colour that we have today going out and preaching economy to the work force if it is quite prepared to spend money as though it is going out of fashion and not account for it in the Parliament when it is asked questions. Surely in the interests of the people of this nation that answer can be given. We want it, and I say that we are entitled to it. </para>

The answer I am given is that the parliamentary officers approached the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and recently obtained his approval for the increases in staff ceilings to allow staffing of the new security procedures. That has endorsed the situation. As I understand it, they have achieved the positions that they require, and as I indicated in an earlier answer, staff appointments are expected to be made as soon as positions and funds are provided and the recruitment processes finalised.

          <para>In relation to the comments that have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> I would really appreciate it if we might be able to get some assistance from him. We are in a situation where the honourable senator's help would probably be quite vital to the whole Senate. He has made the comment that, he is criticised because he wants some answers. I ask him to believe me when I say that he is not criticised at any stage in his request for answers. But whether or not he gets them is probably another matter. Referring to the matters that the honourable senator has pursued here over some period of time, which he also pursued in the late hours of last night, and most of which he has reiterated today, I think he should bear in mind that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> had, during the Estimates committee hearing, raised some of the questions and achieved some of the answers in the normal way. We on this side of the House are more or less prepared to accept the fact that the honourable senator was overseas at Government expense or at public expense, whilst this particular committee was in operation. I do not think there is a point to be made from that. But the fact is that all Government expenditure is not necessarily made public. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> sought cooperation. From the way he was appealing for it, I thought that he was being very conciliatory. But of course as usual he could not help himself at the finish. He had to have a shot at me that I was overseas. I should like to remind the Minister that I have been in this Senate for over 8!6 years and only once have I accepted an official engagement overseas on behalf of the Parliament. I emphasise, only once. If I wanted to be vindictive I could mention a lot of cases on his side of the House when people have had many trips. I have had only one, and I was overseas with a parliamentary delegation. That cannot be used in relation to the information I am seeking. As the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> has pointed out, it is the prerogative of any member of the Senate to ask questions. We cannot attend all Estimates committees, even if we are here and not away representing the Parliament. But we do have that prerogative to come back into the Committee of the Whole and seek information. I know that I have been seeking the information that I am now talking about, and about which I spoke last night, for a number of years. I am unable to get it. As I pointed out to the Minister, I was not the first one who sought a breakdown of the cost of Kirribilli House and the Lodge. It was the now Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner,</inline> who put the question on notice to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam.</inline> He was the first one to set the precedent and now I am accused of trying to run a scaremonger campaign when I follow it up. As I said earlier, as recently as 25 September, when he had the opportunity to give the answer to the member for Melbourne Ports, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holding,</inline> during the Estimates committee hearing of the House of Representatives- and it looks as though I have to repeat myself in order to try to get through to the Minister- the Minister gave the same answer as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> gave to him when he sought the answer. It is just the use of the words of the Government trying to evade the issue. </para>

          <para>So far as the ex-Governor-General's telephone goes to my knowledge he is the first Australian-born Governor-General to leave this country after his appointment was terminated to go and live in another country, and this is the first time that there has been an opportunity available to ask whether he is entitled to a free telephone. I have not asked whether the other Governors-General who came here from the </para>
          <para class="block">United Kingdom and returned have free telephones. I think the Minister knows very well why I am asking this question about the previous Governor-General. It is because of his involvement with Harry M. Miller, who was the entrepreneur of a book published by the previous Governor-General. We know that Harry M. Miller cost the taxpayers an amount of over $30,000 in his work. I think an answer given in the House the other day relating to the whole cost for Harry M. Miller, due to his appointment by the member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair),</inline> cost the taxpayers something in excess of $500,000, and that $30,000 of that amount was for telephone accounts. That is all I am pursuing. Perhaps at a later stage in these Estimates debates I will pursue all the other matters to which we cannot get answers. </para>
          <para>I repeat that I think the Senate is entitled to an answer, and I ask whether the Minister can tell me under what part of the Constitution can the Parliament or the Government refuse to divulge expenditure incurred by ex-office holders? I am only seeking information in relation to one person- I have had the answer in relation to others, ex-Prime Ministers and what have yousome years ago. I was satisfied with it when I finally received the answer. But I cannot get an answer to this question. I should like the Minister to tell me under what section of the Constitution can the Parliament be refused an answer to a question in relation to expenditure by a Government. To my mind there is only one other department in relation to which we cannot get information on expenditure- and I have asked many questions about that- and that was the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I have pointed out on many occasions in this Parliament the fact that departments appropriated a certain amount of money in each Budget and that it spent a certain amount of money, not a cent less and not a cent more. But we cannot find out where it spent the money or whether it has access to a trust fund to get extra money if it does overspend. We are told that the Department's accounts are audited, and the audit is not made public. I accept that, because of the legislation. I accept that because it is an organisation which we have all been led to believe is working in the interests of the security of Australia. But under no circumstances can the Government of the day say that the ex-Governor-General is working in the interests of the security of this nation. The exercise that he undertook on 1 1 November 1975 was quite the reverse. That is why we want to know whether he has been given some perk by this Government which can probably say quite correctly that it assumed office because of his actions, because the Senate refused to pass the Budget and the Leader of the Opposition of the day was able to go to Government House secretly and have himself appointed the caretaker Prime Minister and come back and tell the Parliament that Gough Whitlam had been sacked. Is the ex-Governor-General in receipt of some perk from this Government for services rendered? Surely the Minister can answer that question. I want him to tell me under what part of the Constitution he can refuse giving an answer to the Parliament about the expenses incurred by this man in the use of his telephone. Surely I am entitled to an answer. </para>

              <para>- If it had not been <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> it would have been someone else. Government members were there in greater numbers. They were not mentioned. The remark would not have been made if our proceedings were not being broadcast. It was an attempt to denigrate an honourable senator in his home State while people were listening to the broadcast. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> was absent serving his country. The remark was made because he has the pertinence to come in here and ask about the expenditure of taxpayers' money. Whether that is covered by the Constitution is not the point; it is part of the Westminster system. Members of Parliament are elected as custodians of the people's purse. Every member of the Parliament has a right and a responsibility to question whether money collected by taxation is spent in the best way in the interests of the taxpayers. The only time when there should be an exemption is when security is involved. The Government would then be forgiven for not disclosing the expenditure of taxpayers' money. It is not the Government's money; it is the taxpayers' money. That money is placed in the hands of the Parliament and it must see that it is spent properly. </para>

          <para>We are considering whether an exGovernorGeneral may have excessively run up a telephone account which the taxpayers of Australia have paid. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> believes that that account may relate to a commercial venture. He has the right and the responsibility to assure the people who elect him that their money has not been spent wrongly, whether by an exGovernorGeneral or anyone else. One immediately jumps to the conclusion that, as there will be no disclosure, money was spent improperly. There is no justification for non-disclosure. If there is a precedent involved, it was established recently. It is not correct to say that the Whitlam Government would not reveal the expenditure of the Vice-Regal representative in Australia. As honourable senators know, the expenditure of the Queen of England is questioned in the House of Commons, as are the allowances paid to the whole of her family. Yet we do not know what expenses are paid for the Governor-General. </para>
          <para>Only this morning we heard that there is no accounting of the allowances given to him; they carry over to next year. Why has one man the right to spend taxpayers' money without we, the custodians of the taxpayers' money, being able to find out whether it has been soundly or properly spent in the performance of his duties? I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> has the right to ask that question and we will insist on an answer. He will get it at some time or another. It is not right that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> insisting on his rights and doing his duty as a politician, should be abused in this chamber by a Minister who opposes the asking of that question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> should have the protection of the chamber in that regard. </para>

            <para>- How many times does the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> have to be told? I will tell him again. He mentioned the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> that he would not divide the costs. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> who took the initiative and created the precedent of dividing the costs. My argument is that if he could get those costs about three months after he assumed office, why cannot we get his costs now when he has been in residence at the Lodge for something like four years? It is no good the Minister continually falling back on what Gough Whitlam said. The precedent has been set by this Government. The Government was quite prepared to divulge the cost of that residence in an endeavour to humiliate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> but it will not divulge the costs of the present occupants of the two residences concerned. That is what the Oppostition wants to know. </para>

          <para>It is no good Sentor Webster saying that I went overseas last year at the taxpayers' expense in the sense that he said it today, and then claiming that he said it last night. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shows that he did not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> is quite right when he says that the Minister said that today for a particular purpose. I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> had mellowed a little in recent times, but it is obvious that he has got back to his old habit of trying to denigrate any person who has the courage to stand up in this place and question any decisions made by this Government. I tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> that he can try as hard as he likes but he will not sink me because I have a shell as hard as a tortoise. If I think that I have a matter to pursue in this chamber, I will pursue it, and nobody on the Government side will deny me that right or frighten me off. I can ask questions, and so can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> but we will not get the answers. We know we will not get the answers and we will spread it far and wide that this Government is covering up for something, particularly in respect to an ex-Governor-General. He did the Government a favour and it is paying him out for it. The Government will not divulge what it is costing the taxpayers for it to pay him for the favour that he did for the former Opposition on 1 1 November 1975. That is a burning question a question that will continue to be asked in seeking an answer. </para>

            <para>- I wish to speak only briefly. 1 do not want to enter into polemics with the Minister on this question. Obviously his answer was wrong, and it needs correcting. I accused the Minister of not saying last night that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> had gone overseas at taxpayers' expense. If he is justifying saying it today because of what he said last night, what he has said is a lie because it was not said last night. The Minister said on the air that the honourable senator was overseas at the time. Saying that because of confusion the cost of government residences used by the Prime Minister cannot be separated is entirely different from saying that the cost of a telephone account for the ex-Governor-General will not be disclosed. The cost of the upkeep of residences used by the Prime Minister was available. Possibly the impossibility of separating costs within the then Department of Housing and Construction was the reason for not revealing a particular payment at one location. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> would not answer. I think his statement was that he could not answer; he did not know. But here is a question the Government can answer. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Whilst the combined cost of both residences is known, no one knows the cost of the former Governor-General's telephone account. Having read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> 's book concerning the activities of that Governor-General, I say that he may have made many more telephone calls at the taxpayers' expense. I do not know which telephone accounts of the Governor-General the taxpayers should pay. My point is that obviously we do not know whether the accounts were excessive, and we have a right to know. The argument used in justification for not being told that- that someone else would not give the information- does not take away from the Minister the responsibility of informing the Parliament about expenditure. I rose for the purpose of showing that my question was not answered because a separate amount which was included in two expenditures was not divided at some time in the past by a previous Prime Minister. </para>

            <para>- I want to protest about that. These questions were asked last night. There has been a whole working day since then. Unless there has been some gross inefficiency within the Government or within some Government departments I do not believe there is any reason why the Auditor-General's Office could not have supplied answers to those questions by now. Further, I believe that the Government is trying to dodge questions on this issue, as it has dodged questions on a variety of issues over the last few days. The fact is that two special reports from the Auditor-General have been received by the Minister for Primary Industry, one by the previous Minister on or about 20 September. A later report on the same subject has been received by the present Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon ) at a time not known to us.</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister for Primary Industry has twice been asked about this matter in the House of Representatives. He was first asked on 26 October when he intended to table the first report. He said he had not had a chance to have a proper look at it. Last week he was asked again by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kerin</inline> whether he had received the second report and when he was going to table either or both reports. He completely ignored the question. That evasion by that Minister in the House of Representatives has led to my questions today. I know that the Audit Act contains provisions which state that, under some circumstances, it is mandatory for the Auditor-General to report to the Treasurer and for the Treasurer then to table those reports in Parliament. There are other provisions in the Audit Act which appear to allow for some discretion to the Auditor-General as to what other actions he may take pursuant to his recommendations. To enable the Minister to provide an answer to these questions, I move: </para>

              <para>- May I make a suggestion? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> you will recall that last night I made a suggestion that we take each department separately so that after we have dealt with each department, in this case the Attorney-General 's Department first, the officers could go home to their places of residence. Then we could move on to the next department, the Department of Trade and Resources. If we take Group B as a whole we will go all over the place and we will have officers sitting here until midnight, as they did last night. In fairness to the departmental officers, I suggest that we deal with the departments separately. </para>

            <para>- I am going to use this Department as a springboard for what I will be saying when we deal with the Department of Industrial Relations. I would like some statistics that would indicate the number of cases of award breaches in a given month in which the Industrial Relations Bureau recommended prosecution and how long such potential prosecutions remain with the Attorney-General. I do not want the figures now, but I think I ought to be able to get an idea of the time that elapses between the Industrial Relations Bureau becoming satisfied that there are gross award breaches and those cases getting to the Attorney-General's Department before a prosecution is launched. I will not name the individual, but I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> would have known over two years ago of a certain commercial buccaneer that operated in canteens and kiosks at some of our airports for a long time before he was prosecuted. I think that the whole thrust of industrial relations depends on the prosecution. I am following this course and seeking that information now as the Attorney-General is the administrative head of industrial relations. </para>

            <para>- I refer to division 173, subdivision 3, item 04, relating to grants to organisations for pre-marital education. I note that the estimated expenditure for this year is $50,000. According to the explanatory notes, the purpose of that item of expenditure is: </para>

          <para class="block">I note that last year also the appropriation was $50,000. So there has been no increase at all in the appropriation for this year- not even an increase to reflect increases in prices and costs of services. I draw the attention of the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> to the fact, that according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, teenage divorces are becoming a common social phenomenon, with one in 10 youthful marriages failing. That would seem to be a factor which ought to have influenced the Government at least to increase the provision for pre-marital education services. </para>
          <para>I know of a number of people who are quite dedicated to working in that area. I believe that they should receive support. They are receiving support from various church and community groups, but I believe that their work would more readily be known and their services would be more readily availed of if more money were made available to them from the Government. I appreciate also that that sort of service ought to be able to attract voluntary donations from adherents to the community groups I have mentioned. Can the Minister advise us why the appropriation is the same this year when statistics would suggest that the amount should be increased? </para>

            <para>- I wish to say a few words in support of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> has said. No doubt, he is aware of action being taken in some States, particularly Tasmania. I am particularly aware of the work being done by organisations in Victoria. Very good work is being done in New South Wales as well. It seems to me that those organisations are unable to expand their activities into new areas and to do work which is very valuable to the community. I believe that there is a limitation on what they can do with their present allocation of funds. Most of them are dependent upon charity- upon support from churches and other bodies. I believe that a little more money spent in that direction would be of enormous advantage in saving people from certain troubles. </para>

              <para>- We are speaking of a small amount of money. For example, people might not marry unwisely if they had an opportunity of discussion. The cost to the community of people marrying unwisely would be many times the amount which needs to be spent in that area. Because people marry unwisely we have more judges, more social problems with children and so forth. I think that money spent in that direction would be of infinitely more value to the community.

            <para>- I think that we would all support what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> said, knowing the difficulties facing the family law courts. I bring up the matter of the apparent lack of judges, or commissionerswhatever they are called- in Family Law Courts in South Australia. Only last Friday I received a call at my office from a chap who was granted a divorce in August 1978. The matter of property rights still had to be resolved. He is a pensioner living in a flat for which he is paying from his pension, $50 a week. The repayment of the mortgage on the house in which his ex-wife is living is $28 a week. Of course, he wants to gain possession of that house.  His  case was listed for hearing in October. He was eighth on the list. But now he has been told that consideration of his case will have to stand over and be placed on the February list. The man concerned does not have the money to carry on. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I rang the Registrar of the Family Court in Adelaide and spoke to his secretary, who advised me that if I got the solicitor of the person concerned to write to the Registrar the Registrar might put that man's name higher up on the list. But, after all, that would be done only to the detriment of someone else. However, I did ring the man's solicitor and gave him that information. He said: 'I felt I would not be successful if I tried to do that, so I did not do it. But now that you have spoken to the Registrar's secretary and got that information, I will write to the Registrar and see whether he will place the man 's name higher on the list'. That is only one case of hardship. I think that about 15 months is a bit long to have to wait for a solicitor to get a hearing in a court. </para>
          <para class="block">The solicitor told me that his complaint was that there was a lack of people who could hear such cases. </para>
          <para>I rose mainly to speak about the social security cases being heard in New South Wales, about which I asked a question yesterday. I will be very careful; I will not say anything which would prejudice proceedings in the court. I am concerned about the activities of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack ) and whether he is acting upon the right advice. Yesterday I asked the Attorney-General a question which he told me he would consider. He told me that as the relevant dates were known he would obtain an answer to my question and give it to me as soon as possible. As the dates I used in my question were the dates he had used previously, I expect that the dates are readily available and that he would now have an answer to my question.</inline></para>
          <para>I find the dates confusing. Chris Nakis was charged with defrauding the Commonwealth between 1 July 1972 and 31 March 1978- a period of six years.Then the Attorney-General saw fit to give an indemnity against the prosecution of that individual. But he gave it only in relation to offences committed under the Social Services Act from 1 August 1975 to 1 January 1977. Chris Nakis was charged with offences committed over a period commencing three years before 1 August 1975 and ending 14 months after 1 January 1977- a long stretch of time. </para>
          <para>I do not know whether the Attorney-General was of the belief that there was a hope of proving only offences in the restricted period for which he gave an indemnity and that charges for offences committed outside that period would be dropped, or whether Chris Nakis did not draw any social services benefits prior to the date from which the Attorney-General gave him indemnity. If it is the latter, why did the police claim that offences had been committed over such a long period? It must show the uncertainty of the police in laying the prosecution and the extreme difficulty a defendant has in defending a prosecution. The individual has to think whether he did anything in 1972 or 1973. If he has not the matter is made extremely difficult. </para>
          <para>I do not know the difference between an indemnity and a pardon. After getting the indemnity this person, on the Attorney-General's advice, got a pardon, which apparently is something different. I thought a pardon was granted after someone was convicted. I thought pardons were granted to erase a conviction or to prevent a penalty being imposed. The pardon relates to I January 1975 and dates back to some eight months before he received the indemnity. That action was taken on the advice of the same Attorney-General. Why does the pardon relate to 31 March 1978 and the indemnity to 1 January 1977? He has a pardon for the period from January 1975 to March 1978. His indemnity relates to any offence he may have committed from August 1975 to January 1977. What is the meaning of all this? Why are there different dates? Why is there a change concerning the summons, the indemnity and the pardon? I seek some answers. </para>

          <para class="block">I am in the same position as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> was in earlier. I am trying to get some information. I consider those questions to be quite legitimate. I consider that the Minister should have referred them, as many Ministers do, to the correct Minister. In this case it appears that the first, second and third questions are the responsibility of the Attorney-General. I thought that these questions, having been asked on fairly sound information, should have been replied to. If the Attorney-General has the information or can get the information I think it should go on the public record after all. The charges are fairly serious. It is unfair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pratt</inline> if they are left in limbo without the Government's coming to the party and answering the question and giving the details. Apparently the inference drawn by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to the fourth and fifth questions is that they might have been tied up in some sort of way with my previous three questions. I assure the Minister that I made no attempt to set out to catch him on anything at all. </para>
          <para>The matter involved money. The Northern Land Council is funded by the Government and/or from royalties and other payments from mining companies. I am sure that there is some sort of supervision over these things. I am sure that the Government knows precisely how much money is spent in every area. Suggestions have been made in the past about lawyers in the Northern Territory and some other parts of Australia- I mean this in no disrespect to the profession- levying very outlandish charges against people because government money is being provided and therefore they know that the fees will be paid. It is a bit like the so-called Greek conspiracy case where some outlandish charges are being levied by people in high positions in the legal profession. There have been tendencies in the past, particularly in the Northern Territory, for some of these charges to be levied way and above the normal fees. </para>
          <para>If there is an attempt by the Government to suppress this information I, like my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> intend to pursue the matter until the date of the election. I want to get the truth. If something has been hidden or the Government is not prepared to expose something to public view, the Government ought to be ashamed of itself. After all, it took a long time to reply to these questions. If corruption has occurred in the Northern Territory in this area, the Government is put in the same car and can be classed as corrupt because it is suppressing information. I seek those replies. I believe that they should be readily forthcoming. If they are not, I shall pursue them in other areas. </para>

            <para>- I would like to correct what may have been a misleading impression created by one passage in the report of Senate Estimates Committee B of which I was a member. The Committee was discussing a Minister's withholding of certain information from the Committee. The report states: </para>

            <para>Specific information was sought in two areas of the Attorney-General's Department, the first relating to fees paid by the Commonwealth to a Queen's Counsel acting on its behalf, with the second concerning the cancellation of the Sixth United Nations Conference. The Attorney-General has replied to the Committee's satisfaction in relation to the second matter and no doubt a reply concerning the Queen's </para>
            <para class="block">Counsel's fees will be forthcoming before the Senate considers the Committee's report. </para>

          <para class="block">I make no comment about the matter of the Queen 's Counsel 's fees although it did refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rofe</inline> and the current conduct of the conspiracy case in Sydney which has been the subject of a good deal of comment. Indeed, the reply of the Attorney-General on that matter was quite informative and forthcoming. However, I for one am not satisfied with the reply that the Attorney-General gave in relation to the reasons for the cancellation of the sixth United Nations Congress on Crime. Australia was to host this very important gathering at the Sydney Opera House in August and September 1980. </para>
          <para>The United Nations crime congresses are held every five years. They study a very wide range of matters concerned with crime including crime prevention policies, alternatives to imprisonment and the human rights of prisoners. It was proposed that the congress be attended by up to 2,000 participants from more than 100 countries, including Ministers of justice, judges, criminologists and leading figures in the field of corrections, police, social welfare, mental health, education and a number of related areas. The hosting of this conference was something that the Australian Government in 1975 at the time of the last conference had undertaken with a good deal of drum beating and, indeed, a good deal of justified pride. The Government has itself said in publicity associated with this congress that it would focus world attention on Australian criminal justice, laws and practices and on criminology in Australia. </para>
          <para>This is no trivial international gathering we are talking about, but one of very great consequence. It was cancelled, however, abruptly in June this year after very large sums of money had already been spent on preliminary organisation for it. In the last financial year $ 1 31 ,451 was revealed in the estimates as having been the amount actually expended in the employment of full time personnel and other associated expenditure to set this very complicated conference in train. The reasons given at the time the announcement was made were cursory in the extreme. In the Attorney-General's Press release the statement was simply made in the following terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Having considered all the circumstances, the Government had concluded that it would not be practicable for it to host the congress. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">To the extent that there was any public or private speculation at the time as to why the Congress had been cancelled, let me point out that the reason was apparently the possible attendance at the conference of an observer delegation from  the Palestine Liberation Organisation. The PLO is one of those organisations which, by virtue of the United Nations resolutions, has a standing invitation to attend United Nations gatherings of various kinds of which the United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders is one, Because of the lack of forthcoming information from the Government as to the reasons for the cancellation of this prestigious affair and because of the squandering of public money that was obviously involved in such a cancellation at this time, I put a series of questions to the Attorney at the hearings of this Estimates Committee. The Attorney took the questions on notice and replied to them. To shorten my speech and for convenience I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> both the text of those questions and the Attorney's answers. </para>

I pursue the matter on this occasion and seek from the Attorney a more forthcoming response on what the Government's real reason was. If it was something to do with the likely visit of a small observer delegation from the PLO, I and the Senate would like to know whether that, in itself, was sufficient justification in the Government's mind for cancelling the Congress. I have no  particular  brief to advance for that Organisation although I do make the point that as the history of the Middle East dispute has evolved it does seem to be more and more pigheaded - </para>

              <para>- It does seem, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> rather pigheaded for the Government to be taking a head-in-the-sand attitude towards this Organisation which exists. Moshe Dayan, after all, has found it convenient and desirable to engage in negotiations with the Organisation and the United States Government has recently found it desirable to seek its good offices in the context of the appalling affair in Tehran. I am concerned if the reason the Government has abandoned the conference was its concern at the impending visit of a small delegation from this Organisation. I am further concerned that the reason lying behind that decision was not any concern that there would be any actual threat to the security of Australia as a result of the visit of that Organisation but rather a blatant political one, that the visit of that Organisation to an event sponsored by the Government in an election year would be unpopular with some significant sections of the Australian community and would, as a result, conceivably do some political damage to the Government. If that was indeed the reason, as I suspect it is, and as many honourable senators on both sides of this chamber suspect it is, let us please have an open and honest articulation of those reasons. The Government has a good deal of explaining to do when an important prestigious occasion like this of great intrinsic significance, of great significance to world criminology, is in fact cancelled in circumstances where a very large sum of taxpayers' money has already been expended in setting that conference in train. I repeat that the language which appears in the Committee's report about our satisfaction with the Attorney's reply is, although this is no doubt inadvertent and no fault of the Committee secretariat, an inaccurate expression of my response to the Attorney's reply. I think it appropriate that he be more forthcoming now as to the reasons for the cancellation of this conference. </para>

            <para>- I wish to refer to some answers that I have received from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in response to my questions when its officers came before Senate Estimates Committee B. I asked those questions because of my concern about certain things that were stated and recorded in the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 29 August. I refer to a document headed 'Safety Record Of </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The Nuclear Power Industry-Accidents, Leaks, Failures and Incidents' which was compiled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> and incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> On reading it I was very concerned at some of the items that had been included and took it up with the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. I accept the fact that in this country there are many people in this country who are concerned about the development of nuclear reactors and nuclear generation. I am also very concerned because many misleading statements are made and frequently these cause unnecessary alarm. I refer to a report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Parker of the United Kingdom on what was known as the Windscale Inquiry. Almost in its introductory remarks, on page 3, under the heading 'Essential Background ', the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This report is as I understand it, intended to form, as was the Inquiry, an element in a wide public debate on nuclear issues. Moreover it was repeatedly stressed by one or other party in the course of the Inquiry that the public are badly informed and should be better informed. I have no doubt whatever that this is so, in the sense that the public should be provided with more in the way of digestible and reliable information. It is the lack of such information which renders the public or some members of it suspicious of those who operate the nuclear industry and exposes them to anxieties which are needless. </para>

          <para class="block">I emphasise the words 'exposes them to anxieties which are needless'. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Parker continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In saying this I do not intend to imply that there are no grounds for anxiety in certain respects. There clearly are. It is equally clear, however, that many of the anxieties which are felt are without foundation and spring from a fear of anything nuclear, no doubt partly due to the fact that the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, with their devastating effects were the opening events of the development of nuclear power. Furthermore the anxieties which are felt, and deeply felt, however irrational and misplaced they may be, undoubtedly do exist. </para>

The document incorporated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> refers to deaths in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1 975 following the leak of 800 litres of radioactive steam during vent repairs. 1 repeat that the document states that two deaths followed the leak of 800 litres of radioactive steam during vent repairs. Inquiries with the Australian Atomic Energy Commission revealed that the deaths were caused by steam burns and that radioactivity was not significant. There is a great difference. I could cite many more examples.

              <para>- One could go on to give many more examples. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> can say, if he likes, that they are from biased men. The people in the Australian Atomic Energy Commission are responsible people. Anybody in this chamber who wishes to stand up and accuse them of irresponsibility can go his hardest, but to make statements like that is to be misleading. I would rather take notice of what people in the Australian Atomic Energy Commission tell me than take notice of inserts like this in the Senate Hansard. I hope that those who participate in future debates in this place will give factual information irrespective of their political views on issues like this. We in this place, whatever our views might be, should not give misleading information; we should try to put the facts before the people of this country. One should realise that the world itself is turning nuclear. This is an emotive issue. We must do our best to make sure that responsibility will play its part in this very important issue. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I could not let this opportunity pass without answering some of the points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young.</inline> My first question to him is whether, accepting for the moment the good faith of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, it had available to it the report to the United States  President  resulting from the Harrisburg incident. I think that honourable senators will find that the answer to that is no. It was definitely reported to the United States  President,  after very exhaustive surveys of the incident at Three-Mile Island, that there had been severe failures in construction methods and in management techniques in relation to the operation of that nuclear facility. In fact, there has never been a more scathing indictment of the failure of engineering on the one hand and management techniques on the other than there was on this occasion. We are told that during the course of the accident personnel within the control room of the facility had no idea what was going on, except that 100 red lights were flashing at the one time. They could not comprehend the gravity of the disaster. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> whether he agrees that if the nuclear industry is to go ahead it must be on the basis of far better engineering and far better systems of management. Surely he would agree with that. I realise I am straying by debating this matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young,</inline> but he has raised and presented to the Australian public on the radio broadcasting night a report which is gravely deficient in that the most exhaustive examination of a nuclear accident to have taken place since electricity generation by nuclear means was invented contradicts much of the easy nonchalance which he displayed in his few remarks. </para>
          <para>A further and perhaps more pertinent matter regarding the manner of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young's</inline> presentation was his use of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to bolster his own political view. The Australian Atomic Energy Commission has a combination of functions to perform. It is concerned with research and entrepreneurial effort. It also has a concern for safeguards. The contention of the Australian Labor Party is that it is asking too much of the one institution to require it to combine research and the production of isotopes, and their sale on the world market and also to ask it to be concerned with the development of adequate safeguards criteria. The Australian Labor Party maintains that the research effort in atomic energy in Australia ought to be hived off and separated from the entrepreneurial effort and, of course, that safeguards ought to be in the hands of a completly independent and impartial body. I am afraid that to quote as authoritative a body which combines such contradictory functions does not carry enough weight to convince those who are genuinely concerned with finding answers to the way in which we can provide enough energy for the world in future given the fact that our liquid petroleum supplies are running out. </para>
          <para>Do not let it be suggested in this chamber that the Australian Labor Party is not interested in finding solutions to the energy problem. One well knows that the huge development off the northwest coast of Western Australia would not be going ahead if it were not for the bipartisan support of the policies which, against a lot of opinion in Australia, will allow the export of some 53 per cent of the known gas reserves from that area in order to allow development to go ahead. There is a willingness on this side of the chamber to come up with solutions to the energy crisis, but we are not going to be stampeded into endorsing methods, particularly the production of electrical energy, which do not pay sufficient attention to the needs for safeguards not only in the operation of the reactors but also when it comes to the disposal of the waste products and the circulation of raw materials throughout the world. </para>
          <para>Finally, as to the actual scientific status of the remarks that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> bestowed upon us concerning an important accident, all he was able to say and all the Atomic Energy Commission said- on which he built so much of his argument- was that the Commission could say with reasonable certainty that it knew the cause of a particular accident which by some has been ascribed to a serious breakdown. To say that one has come to a conclusion with reasonable certainty is not to come to a scientific conclusion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> has not presented this chamber nor the listening public with scientific conclusions. He has presented statements from a body which has within it contradictory functions. He has failed to bring before the Senate in this so-called balanced view the very important findings of the United States commission of inquiry into the Harrisburg incident which, in its report to the  President,  found that there were grave failures both in the engineering and management techniques applying to the operation of nuclear reactors. </para>

            <para>- I listened rather briefly to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> had to say. It seems to me that he has a funny feeling about uranium; that he feels that we have to go ahead and use it or the world will fall into disrepair or something like that. What my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> had to say about the incident at Three-Mile Island was factual. Perhaps it is only latterly, as a result of what happened on Three-Mile Island, that the world is starting to become aware of the immense dangers of nuclear reactors once they start to go wrong. I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> that he should read a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">We Almost Lost Chicago.</inline> It contains a factual report about a previous nuclear reactor which went mad. The bodies of the three men in charge of the reactor were found stuck to the ceiling, having been penetrated by the nuclear rods that blew out of the reactor when the accident occurred. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is very interesting to note that one of the most reactionary governments in the world today, the Philippines, has declined to go ahead with nuclear development in Bataan province.  President  Marcos has refused or declined to go ahead with that development because he fears that Westinghouse has not built a nuclear reactor capable of withstanding all the various pressures that may be applied to it. I also say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young,</inline> and to anybody who seems to want to go ahead with nuclear development in this country today, that we in the Australian Labor Party have only one objection to nuclear development, and that is the problem of waste. As far as we are concerned, when science can- I am convinced that it will- overcome that problem of nuclear waste and no problems remain for future generations, the Labor Party will change its policy. </para>

              <para>- I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that it is very interesting to note that a few years ago, when I was a member of a committee relating to the Australian Capital Territory, that Committee was told that the Canberra Hospital was pouring nuclear waste down the sink. That is the way nuclear waste is being handled at the moment. It is like so many other wastes in our society. Scientists, technicians and other people who work in areas where nuclear power is used do not know what to do with the waste. Like others who dispose of all sorts of commodities that the garbage man will not pick up we utilise the cheapest and easiest means to dispose of our waste. For example, in country areas where there is no garbage collection people throw their waste onto the side of the road. That is a very cheap and easy way to get rid of it and to let future generations, the shire council or the borough council pick up the tab for the disposal of it. Right throughout society today I suggest that because this problem has not been solved hospitals and other people who want to get rid of nuclear waste just pour it down the sink and let future generations, the fish and God knows who cop the effects from that. </para>

            <para>- I want to add very briefly to the comments which have been made in the debate which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> introduced into the discussion on these estimates. Only last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> tabled a statement in this chamber. It was the sixth report by the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council on Radioactive Waste Management. I think it would be wise for us to recall what was in that document bearing in mind, as has been said, that there is evidence from overseas which should give us very great cause for concern. In our country, the council which reported to this Parliament also hedges its comments. This is indicated in a statement which was made by the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> who when presenting the report, stated: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>It is recognised internationally that radioactive waste management is an issue of concern which requires continuing effort directed towards improving the existing technology and current practices. The international scientific community is working towards the future development of industrial facilities for waste disposal, and the Government recognises that validation of some of the technical principles involved in nuclear waste disposal in geological repositories will have to await construction and operation of such facilities. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">By what yardstick can anyone suggest that we have a solution to this key question of nuclear waste disposal which would warrant this country- or for that matter any other country at its risk if it wants to- producing this nuclear waste for which there is obviously no proven means of disposing. We should all recognise that expert authorities around the world differ so markedly iri their views as to whether in fact we will get on top of the waste disposal problem. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> may be right when he said that we will. Let us hope that we do. If nuclear power can be found to be a safe means of generating power for the use of mankind then certainly let us use it. With respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young,</inline> he has stated here tonight that virtually false arguments have been used by members of the Opposition in presenting the Opposition's case against the development of nuclear power. Those honourable senators have cited authorities which I think are as substantial and authoritative as the authorities which can be quoted from other directions. This report from the Council was the one given to this Parliament. I dare say that that Council has some hope that this matter will be overcome. But it was very cautious in its use of words. The Minister also stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Disposal of such wastes in repositories in deep geological formations on land appears, at present, to be the most promising of the approaches for the long-term management of those wastes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course, that is not new. The argument was advanced one or two years ago- questions were asked in this chamber- that one of the most suitable sites apparently for these deep geological formations is in Central Australia. The Government was asked then to give an assurance that nuclear waste would not be imported for depositing in Australia back from countries which were using Australian uranium. Only a sort of commitment was given. I hope that if this Government is so concerned about its responsibility for the exporting of uranium that we can assume that it has the same measure of responsibility if Central Australia proves to be the only place where nuclear waste can be satisfactorily stored. The logic of that argument is that it has an equal responsibility lo do that too. Let us hope that the Government will be quite emphatic and that it will tell any user or potential users of Australian uranium that Australia will not become a dumping ground for nuclear waste. </para>

            <para>- There is an old saying that where ignorance is bliss it it folly to be wise and we have had one of the most crass displays of ignorance on a scientific subject in the last half hour in this chamber than I think we have ever heard. 1 will not take up the time of the Senate by speaking in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> for too long. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate's</inline> questions raised three points. In regard to the Harrisburg disaster certainly there were reports in the report to the United States  President  of bad management. Bad management is universal to all fields of human activity. There may have been some slightly bad engineering, but the point one has to realise is that nuclear engineering has some of the highest forms of technology that the human race has yet attained. It is not repetitive. It is creative. It uses new designs. Obviously where one is doing things for the first time there must be some mistakes. The great lesson of Harrisburg was that no one was hurt. The fail safe design prevented injury to human beings around the plant. That speaks for itself. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Just-look at what has gone on with the thermal generation of power. Let us look at the hundreds of thousands of people who have died from the underground mining of coal. Others will do so because underground mining is inherently dangerous. Let us look at the thousands of people who died in the building and maintaining thermal powerhouses. The number is countless. They will go on dying that way. We have not had one death in nuclear power houses. What if a thermal powerhouse fails because of some action taken by the unions and thousands of people in a city are disadvantaged? What happens to a place that is without power. With nuclear power generation we would not have that rate of failure. What about the environmental effects of all the trace elements coming out of the millions of tonnes of black coal we burn each year in this country. Just read my speech earlier this year if one does not know what happens when coal is burnt. The effects of burning coal are quite enormous. <inline font-weight="bold">Major scientific</inline> problems are posed as our hydrocarbons are lost and as we go on to black coal as a source of fuel. The earth is facing an environmental problem of a magnitude which it has not coped with before. That problem is avoided with nuclear generation. All this humbug is spoken about getting rid of nuclear power but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> said, we are in a nuclear age. Japan gets about 20 per cent of its power from nuclear sources; Belgium gets about 18 per cent; Britain about 13 per cent; and the United States of America about 13 per cent. Does the honourable senator think that those people can change overnight to an alternative source of power? They cannot. </para>
          <para>I come finally to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate's</inline> point in relation to the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. I have never heard such a scurrilous attack on such a fine institution in my life. All this business of the old socialist dogma of the research, the entrepreneurial production business, and safeguards is really a veiled attack, a Trojan horse to destroy our capacity to understand and use nuclear power in this country. Just look at the record of the scholarship of the AEC. Let us look at the publications. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> would understand this, but his colleagues would not. They would not know what a publication list was. They would not know a reputable scientific journal if they saw one. But the reliability shown by the AEC in its publication list over the last 15 to 20 years is proof of its integrity in the world of scholarship. On the final point of reasonable certainty, scientists are not dogmatic people. They are intelligent, cautious people, and most scientists phrase their judgments in terms of reasonable certainty. They do not make statements of absolute truth. </para>

            <para>-The rash and intemperate contribution of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> on this very important matter does not do him any credit, nor does it do credit to the cause for which he is a very strong lobbyist. I should like to draw attention to the fact that a matter such as this should be dealt with more fully in the Senate in a full scale debate, because it is a continuing problem that this country faces and it will not be resolved by the type of debate and the type of contribution that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> has just made. However, I should like to point out that the lobby for the rapid development of uranium mining in Australia is a very strong one. Very big vested interests are involved in it; the same interests that would promote the exploitation of uranium indiscriminately are the same people who right throughout history have used human beings, have used people up to the limit, and have thrown them on the scrap heap without any responsibilities. That has been the whole history of mining. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline>referred to coal mining. Of course the coal miners have been exploited throughout the years. Of course the industry has never put back what it has drawn out of it, and it has used up the human element to its fullest extent. I would say that the issue that we see here is a matter of blatant lobbying which is being carried out by honourable senators on the Government side for the uranium interests, these people who stand to make millions or billions of dollars out of this industry without the necessary basic preparation for the nuclear era and the accidents that are happening all over the world. </para>
          <para>The statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> at page 363 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on 29 August indicates that right throughout the whole area of development of the uranium industry and of nuclear power generation these accidents are happening, and there is a tremendous amount of basic work still to be done. If the industry is to develop, it is a matter of hastening slowly, very slowly, because there are factors involved in this new era, this new dimension, despite the claim of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> of all the knowledge and that anyone who opposes him is ignorant. It is just like his impudence to take that stand. I should also like to draw attention to the fact that because we are opposed to the immediate mining and processing of Australia's vast uranium deposits does not mean that we will always oppose the development of nuclear energy. We need to have a policy that acknowledges that some very difficult problems will have to be resolved, especially those related to the storage and disposal of radioactive wastes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> knows very well the problem in relation to the disposal of radioactive wastes. We are finding problems of stealth, of dishonesty, by the uranium people who are trying to cover up when they know that this great problem exists and will not tell the public of the situation. These people do not care about human life and the environment, because there is a fast buck in it if they can get away with it. They do not care about the consequences not only for the present but also as to the half life of this substance and its damage to the environment in the future. </para>
          <para>I want to refer more specifically to the mining of uranium. For too long we have allowed the industry to neglect the matter of the health of the workers in the industry, in particular the long term consequences that are now starting to show in many of these industrial processes. It has been estimated that the health records of workers pick up only 2 per cent of the occupationally related chronic diseases. Contributions that have been made in this chamber at different times have been able to refer glibly to injuries suffered in the past in underground uranium mining, but presumably they mean the high incidence of cancer in former underground uranium miners at Radium Hill in South Australia when the mine was worked during the 1950s. This should give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> some inside knowledge of the consequences that will develop not only now but also will accelerate in the future. </para>
          <para>The South Australian Department of Health has recently and belatedly attempted to follow up these men to check on their health. There is a great risk of radon gas associated with the mining of uranium in open-cut mines. Radon gas is heavier than air and tends to concentrate more heavily in the lower areas of the pit floor, and the long periods without wind and the temperature inversion experienced in the Northern Territory uranium mining industries will complicate these problems. The industry will have to examine these matters right from the very basis before any of us can get up and proclaim that this is yet in a condition where we can go ahead full steam, which many of the senators on the Government side would like to see take place. </para>
          <para>I should like to refer to a Department of Science and the Environment assessment report on the proposed Nabarlek uranium project, dated February this year. It is said that the temperature inversions which frequently occur during the night in the Nabarlek area can lead to a build-up of radon to a pre-dawn peak concentration. We never hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> or any of his colleagues on that side speak on this aspect, and yet it is a source and possibly a basic cause of untold damage to the lungs and to the general health of those engaged in the industry. The code of practice on radiation protection in the mining and milling of radioactive ores adopted by the Commonwealth Department of Health sets the radiation dose limits for workers in the uranium industry. The Department of Science and the </para>
          <para class="block">Environment report refers to earlier states that exposure should be kept as far below these levels as practicable. It was quoted just recently during the course of a debate in the Senate that uranium miners receive a radiation dose far below the level where there are any detectable health consequences; yet recent studies indicate that the harmful effects of low doses of radiation may be substantially greater than estimated previously. But what is meant by detectable health consequences? We know that uranium mining has been associated with a high death rate from cancer since the nineteenth century. We know that miners who smoke are especially at risk. These men will have left the industry and probably will have moved to other areas before the health consequences of uranium mining become apparent. </para>
          <para>I should like to refer to a report which has been presented recently by the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia who have responsibility in this area. I want to commend the union for its concern for its members working at the Nabarlek and Ranger uranium mines. This union is commissioned to report on the radiation monitoring of the mines, and one would hope that the companies concerned would act immediately on its recommendations. Many of the points raised in the report are disturbing. How could any company ensure that the workers whose future health is at stake will follow safety procedures, when the induction course booklet at one mine contained no information on the hazards of radiation and was pitched at a level more suitable for engineers or other professional people? From the recommendations of the Report, it seems to me to be absolutely essential that a central register of uranium workers be kept so that their future health can be monitored. I realise the problems associated with an industry where men might be working under false names and have no wish for their future whereabouts to be traceable, but they should be advised that they might later develop cancer and that they are entitled to compensation. </para>
          <para>I raise these matters because of the attitude that has been taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon-</inline> that this industry will go ahead regardless of the consequences to the human element associated with the production of uranium and the development of nuclear power. It is an unknown quantity; it is an area in which we need to have the greatest caution. It is a power that can be turned to the greatest use for mankind if it is used in the way that we would like to see it used- with the greatest respect and concern for those who are associated in the industry. A loud word of warning should be sounded about those people who would advocate the helter skelter, go ahead regardless of the consequences policy that the very powerful financially well equipped uranium lobbyists are influencing so many people in this place to believe. They would like to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian public by saying that all is well in the industry. </para>
          <para>The history of nuclear power so far is a reflection on the fact that the scientists are prepared to subvert the great ideals that they have held in the past for the sake of a fast buck. They are selling their principles. As long as I am able to stand in my place and warn people against the hazards and dangers of uranium and nuclear power generation, I intend to do so. It is for that purpose that I have made these comments- to counter the lobbyists who rose in the chamber tonight to try to push out a story that is completely untrue and unsubstantiated. </para>

            <para>- I am the greatest conformist in this chamber. Never would I betray the Standing Orders; nor would I go against a ruling. Before addressing my remarks to the estimates for the Department of Trade and Resources I want to say that I regret being absent from the chamber in the early part of the evening session. I came in to seek advice as to whether there had been replies from the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> to my contribution on the Attorney-General's Department. The Committee decided to take the estimates Department by Department and I now find that I did not receive a reply. By some twist of fate we have now moved onto the Department of Trade and Resources although there has been no clarification of the questions I raised before. Perhaps the trend now is that honourable senators do not get replies. I now wish to conform with the ruling of the  Chairman  and refer to the Department of Trade and Resources. I refer to division 640.3.09 which covers the Uranium Advisory Council and contributions towards administrative costs. The Uranium Advisory Council appears to be a council set up by the Minister as a result of the Fox report. It is a council to represent the common people and to advise the Minister on the requirements of the uranium industry. In the first annual report of the Council, made on 30 June 1979, on page 4 it states: </para>

In light of these instances we feel it is desirable that the Government should confirm our understanding of the role of the Council and, anticipating that the Government would wish to receive comments from the Council on matters that are under consideration or may be the subject of debate, it is essential that procedures be devised to ensure the Council is fully informed on relevant matters. </para>

          <para class="block">This body, established by the Government, is not being informed of the information the Government has so that it can do its job and report on the dangers that it sees. </para>
          <para>There are dangers and perhaps we do not know what they are. In a debate in this chamber I requested figures in regard to people who worked underground for over 12 months at Radium Hill in South Australia. I asked a series of questions and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> supplied the answers. A small number of those people had died. The statistics relating to those people confirmed everything I said. I think they made the point I made more dramatic. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> quoted from a report of the Department of Health in South Australia which had made an assessment. That Department is now under the control of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Adamson,</inline> a member of the Liberal Government in that State. She announced recently that, as a result of that survey, she is now having a health check done on everyone who worked at Radium Hill. I commend her for having that health check done. But while that is going on we have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> quote something from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt</inline> which says that everything is safe. He has no knowledge of the long term effects of uranium. For the purpose of getting the mining of uranium started in the Northern Territory we are hearing quotations from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt</inline> rather than, as I said in my speech, from sources within a State which has the longest history of uranium mining in Australia. </para>
          <para>There are dangers and I do not want to exaggerate them, but the figures suggest that we must move with caution, that we must examine everyone who has been in contact with uranium and that at some time we must make a decision as to whether the risk to human health is greater than the profits we can get from uranium mining. That is the decision the Government must make. If it is heartless enough to say that dollars are more important than health, let us mine regardless of the issues. But if the Government has enough humanity to say that health is more important, we should hesitate until we have conclusive figures from the investigation in South Australia which a Liberal Party colleague of members of the Government is making. I just ask this question: In future will the Government co-operate with and advise the Uranium Advisory Council on things that the Council wants to know about for the purpose of carrying out its duties? </para>

We find that in 1 964 at Wood River in the United States of America there was one death from radioactivity in a uranium enrichment plant. A further reference shows that in 1972 at Surry 1 in the United States of America there were two deaths due to the failure of a valve and that an investigation detected more than SOO faulty welding spots. We find that Edward Gleason, a New Jersey truck dock worker, accidently spilt plutonium on himself while handling a leaking box of liquid waste in 1963. Four years later his hand, arm and shoulder were amputated because of a rare form of cancer from which he died in 1973, aged 39. The company responsible refused to pay him compensation before he died. In 1975 in Oklahoma there was plutonium poisoning of workers in an enrichment plant.

              <para>- They will say anything, but what we have to bear in mind is that when honourable senators opposite say that we should mine uranium, they are interested only in the mighty dollar, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> and other honourable senators have said. They could not give two hoots for the safety of the personnel who live in this community and who have to work in uranium mines or handle uranium. They could not care less about them. All they are interested in is the mighty dollar. This Government is using the very high unemployment rate that it has brought upon this community as a scare solution to con the people into believing that if we mine uranium we will solve the economic crisis that this Government has got this country into and solve the unemployment problem. We all know that there is no employment of any magnitude associated with the mining of uranium. There might be a few extra jobs while the mines are being prefabricated, but once that work is done and we get to the mining of this product, how many people will be employed? Who gets the money when it does become operational? All the multinationals get it. The money is transported overseas and it is of no value to the Australian community. Yet we find repeatedly that honourable senators on the other side of the chamber say here and go out on the public hustings and say that the mining of uranium would provide a solution to the unemployment problem and to the economic crisis, both of which this Government has involved this country in. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline>would do well to read the South Australian <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and see that not so very long ago a motion was moved in the South Australian Parliament and it had the unanimous support of the people who now sit in government in that State. They are now claiming that they can solve the crisis South Australia is facing- of course, that is a myth, there is no crisis; that has been proven since they have come to office- if they mine Roxby Downs. We can go through the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for years back and find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> has been a great advocate for mining Roxby Downs. We all know that he talks about copper. Copper cannot be sold. We have a mine at Kanmantoo, a few miles from where I live. It has been held on a care and maintenance basis for over two years. It is all ready to go. It employed 1 50 people. But because they cannot get an acceptable price for copper the jolly thing has closed down. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> talks about how we can get the copper out of Roxby Downs and that its resource will be a great potential money maker for Australia. He well knows the situation. He must have gone past the Broken Hill South mine at Kanmantoo many times and have seen it lying idle. They have a copper seam there which could raise money if mining it were a viable venture. Mining it there would be more viable than mining what is at Roxby Downs, which has not yet been proven. </para>
          <para>We have to dispose of the uranium. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> asked, what will be done with the waste if that uranium is sold overseas? It has already been stated that those countries cannot cope with it and that they want to send it back to Australia and to bury it out in the middle of this country. What will it do if it is put there? Eventually it will pollute our underground water supplies. All that will happen just because the Liberal Party of Australia wants the mighty dollar. As we have said time and time again, all it is interested in is money, money, money. It is time that the Liberal Party got down to the grass-roots and started to think about people and their interests. </para>

            <para>- A few moments ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> of South Australia commented on a speech I made in this chamber last night. From the way in which he represented my speech, I think there is some misunderstanding. Uranium mining in the Northern Territory is not new; uranium was mined in the Northern Territory back in the 1950s. For very many years it was mined by the open cut and the deep mining methods. It was reported in the hearings of Senate Estimates Committee C that reports on that mining were in the archives. Those reports have now been released. They indicate very conclusively that the people who mined uranium by the open cut and tunnelling method some 25 to 30 years ago in the Northern Territory have suffered no ill effects and the people are still working in their various trades in the Northern Territory. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline>said that honourable senators on this side of the chamber are heartless. It is not a case of the Government parties looking for dollars; what uranium mining in the Northern Territory means is jobs. At the moment, employment opportunities are building up. Some 1,250 people are employed and that number will go up to 5,000 plus. I point out to the honourable senator opposite that the minimum wage for people working in the field is some $480 a week. I suggest that uranium mining is part of the future for the Northern Territory and for Australia. It will bring about employment and it will provide energy supplies. The safeguards which are being observed now by the authorities and which honourable senators opposite seem to decry are such that the Department of Health will continue to oversee the standards of health of the workers in those mines. </para>
          <para>In closing I mention this: I believe I heard in the media in the past few days that the unions have conducted an inquiry into the safeguards and the feasibility of workers mining in the uranium industry. My recollection is that the person who has carried out that inquiry on behalf of the unions has said: 'Yes, there is every reason for workers to work in the uranium industry. It has been proved safe for them to do so'. All that was asked was that certain safeguards be observed, which naturally they will, and that there will be consultation between the workers and the authorities who are working the uranium mines. The criticisms which have been made this evening do not wash. </para>

            <para>- I am very sorry if I crossed swords with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff.</inline> I have some respect for him and I do not want us to be at cross purposes. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> said, uranium means a lot to the Northern Territory. Miners are earning $480 a week. Of course that means a lot. But the question is: Are we concerned about dollars or health? Uranium mining means a lot to the Northern Territory; therefore, we should be somewhat hesitant about interrupting it. What I am concerned about is what effect it has on health. That is the whole question. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline>said that the archives had some information. I suppose that the records in the archives relate to a time before the value of uranium was known and before it started to be mined. During an urgency debate I expressed the opinion that we would find no trace of ill health in the people who worked at Rum Jungle because the time span of the operations at Rum Jungle and Radium Hill is different. Cancer is a disease which appears some 20 or 25 years later. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> could draw upon to justify his claim that uranium mining is not unhealthy was a report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt,</inline> who said that he had held a Federal inquiry. </para>
          <para>I did not bring in foreign figures; I used figures which had been verified by the Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> on the results of investigations of people who were underground for over two years, people who were underground for over 12 months and people who were above ground at Radium Hill. I do not say that those figures indicated that uranium mining caused earlier deaths. They showed that, of the sample taken of people who worked underground for over two years at Radium Hill, some 40.9 per cent died of cancer of the lungthat figure was verified by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyleagainst</inline> an average of about 7 per cent for the Australian population. That is the statistic for the incidence of lung cancer after 20 years. What is the answer? I ask honourable senators opposite to give us the answer. Just to get progress in the Northern Territory, just to get $480 a week for workers there, we are committing them to that sort of a future. </para>
          <para>As I have said on other occasions, if any honourable senator had seen a death by cancer he would pay any price to prevent one of his relatives or dear ones suffering that disease. That is the important point. Whether it is a conclusive point I do not know. All I say is that we should be hesitant about going ahead with uranium mining. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff's</inline> colleague in South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Adamson-</inline> the young Liberal Minister for Health in South Australia- who surely is entitled to some respect is now having an investigation conducted into the health of everyone who worked at Radium Hill. Why do we bring up other figures on uranium mining from paper studies by people who have not been in the business, as South Australia has done, and say that my figures are wrong? Why do we not try to get the facts? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff's</inline> information is not the most reliable because, in his speech yesterday, he told us of the progress of the Northern Territory and of full employment there. </para>

              <para>- According to the Commonwealth Employment Service figures published today, the Northern Territory has an unemployment level of 9 per cent, the worst figure in Australia. So with all that prosperity in the Northern Territory, it has a higher level of unemployment. We cannot accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> as the authority. We should be doing all we can to help the unemployed in the Northern Territory. It does not matter that the CountryLiberal Party is in government. We cannot accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> as the authority on anything in the Northern Territory. When the health of men is at stake, surely we should seek greater assurances than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> can give. I ask the Attorney-General to communicate with <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Adamson</inline> from South Australia, who is a member of his party, in order to work out the dangers that are involved. We should not rush into the matter until we know the dangers and are given an assurance about them. </para>

If an opinion poll were taken today or tomorrow I am quite convinced that the majority of people in this country would indicate that they want to see uranium remain in the ground. It is significant that the people who want to see it extracted are those who hope to make personal profit out of uranium.

          <para>The Northern Territory has come to a disastrous situation as a result of the political policies of the Fraser Government. It was made an area with State-like powers as a result of a dream that the then caretaker Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> had when heading for Darwin in 1975. He asked some people on his aeroplane as it was flying towards Darwin: 'What will we give that mob up there?' One of his aides suggested that the Northern Territory might be made a new State. 'That's it,' he said. I am not quoting the exact words, but what I am saying is near enough to the message. He said: 'We will tell them they can have a new State'. </para>

              <para>- They are the words that were used. The Prime Minister said: 'We will tell the people in the Northern Territory when we get there that they can have a new State'. The Press reported that he met a rowdy meeting. The Prime Minister's threat- this was taken down by a journalist who happened to be present at the meeting- was that when he got into government the people who opposed him would be put in gaol. He said that that is where they deserved to be. I still have the transcript of the shorthand notes of the statement he made. The Prime Minister decided, in answer to all the ills of the Northern Territory and to keep the people on side, to get <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> elected to the chamber and to get the member of the House of Representatives re-elected, to make some son of promise. He did just that. </para>

          <para>It is clear that the recommendations of the first and second reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox have not been adhered to in the Northern Territory. As my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> said, if people want to see what has happened in the area they should have a look at the devastation at Rum Jungle. I know that the excuse offered today is that a lot more is now known about the mining of uranium and such devastation will not happen again. But it is happening again in the areas that are now being exploited and will continue to happen because of the non-compliance with many of the safeguards that are supposed to be carried out. </para>
          <para>Australia certainly is rich in uranium fields and it ought to remain rich in uranium fields by keeping the uranium under the ground until we know how to handle it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon,</inline> in his very emotional speech a few moments ago, referred to all the things about Three Mile Island. He said that nothing went wrong. Either he is an idiot or he thinks we are. If we swallowed the sort of story he told us here tonight we would be idiots. Great problems are connected with Three Mile Island. The company involved has been fined massive amounts of money. Some of the safeguards were not observed. It is likely that Three Mile Island will never be able again to operate properly as a reactor. </para>
          <para>This is the sad story that occurs around the world particularly when reactors are in the hands of private organisations or transnational companies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> said earlier this evening that these companies are more interested in the dollar. They do not care about anything else. The major transnational oil companies today are becoming deeply involved in the exploration for and exploitation of uranium. The Premier of Queensland is deeply involved with an associate company of one of the transnationals in South Australia. The Premier of Queensland is prepared to dig anything out of the ground on which he and his mates can make a quick buck. </para>

You allowed them to put over the pro-uranium story. You have been unfair and biased in your attitude, but if that is the way you feel about it then I shall refrain from continuing in this debate. I hope that the Press notes that we have a biased  chairman  who has decided that he is prepared to listen to only one side of the story. I suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> that you might be one of those people holding shares in uranium mining companies. That is how I feel about the matter. </para>

          <para>Sentor PRIMMER (Victoria) (9.18)- I rise because of a question which I put during the hearings of Estimates Committee D. It concerns this subject. The Minister for Science and the Environment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> at that hearing referred me to the Department of Trade and Resources for an answer to my question. I want somehow to try to find out from the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> tonight the facts about the issue 1 raised on that Estimates Committee. An item dealt with by Estimates Committee D referred to reimbursement to the Northern Territory Government for the provision of environmental regulatory services. The amount totalled some $3,260,000. I made the comment: </para>

I then went on to point out that in total the Commonwealth was spending taxpayers' money to the tune of $4,713,000 for the current 1 2 months to carry out environmental regulatory services. I pointed out that that is a lot of money in anybody's language. </para>
          <para>I then came to the crunch point. I asked what return the Australian taxpayer would receive on the outlay of $4,713,000 for those 12 months. When can the Australian taxpayers expect to see a return on their investment? What royalty per tonne will come to the Government as a result of any sales? How long will it take the Australian taxpayer to get a reasonable return on the capital?

            <para>-  I am forced to speak again because of the statement by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> who is Minister in charge of this debate. He said that the debate on the Appropriation Bills should not be taken as another Question Time. What on earth are these Appropriation Bills for? Why do we have Senate Estimates committee hearings? Why do we meet in the chamber as the Committee for the Whole? It is only to seek information. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> sought again tonight information which he did not get before. Yet we find the Attorney-General just sitting there in his seat and refusing to answer. What sort of contempt is this for the Parliament of this country? He says that this is not another Question Time. We cannot even get answers to questions at the legitimate Question Time. Ministers waffle on and beat about the bush. We get no answers. Now the Attorney says tonight that we, as members of the Parliament, are not entitled to answers to questions that we put during the Estimates debate on the expenditure of millions of dollars of the Australian taxpayers money. What sort of situation are we in with the Government that runs this country? I think that we ought to complain bitterly about this. We should not offer to co-operate in any way, shape or form with the people who sit opposite because of the way they carry on and treat the Senate with absolute contempt. </para>

            <para>- I warn the advisers of the Attorney General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack),</inline> as I think they will appreciate, that I will be applying a litmus test to the annual report of the Industrial Relations Bureau. I have no doubt that some answers to my questions will be forthcoming. I turn to paragraphs 6.8 to 6. 14 which deal with ethnic liaison. I have a particular reason for doing this. I know that the Director of the Bureau, who is sitting alongside the Minister, will know of a case that illustrates to me a real test as to whether the points in this report mean anything. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I will illustrate my concern this way. About seven months ago an industry in Sydney which came under the award of the Federal Rubber and Allied Workers' Union of Australia had a work force which necessitated, if a dispute arose, interpreters to handle the question at stake in the Arabic, Spanish, Serbo-Croatian and Greek languages. I know the Director will appreciate that there has been considerable racial resentment among the different groups when negotiations were submitted to them in the form of a package deal. A simple yes or no answer was not sufficient. If the union membership spoke one language, perhaps a motion and three amendments could have been moved and then there would have been a decision. The Union secretary finished work on the morning shift. A work force of 900 was working three eight-hour shifts, and there was complete chaos. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Linehan</inline> saw me at 10 a.m. I want to pay a tribute to him. I had sought the assistance of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to provide translators. </para>
          <para>This is a point at which the Government should grab. The Government talks about secret ballots. It was decided that the 900 members at the plant should have a secret ballot on three proposals. We wanted a synopsis of the proposal in the four languages. The Department of Immigration had the mistaken idea that if it prepared anything it would be taking sides on what it thought was a trade union ballot. It was not a ballot; it was a dispute involving a multiplicity of ethnic components in the work force. To the credit of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Linehan,</inline> I told him of the lack of cooperation I was getting from the Immigration </para>
          <para class="block">Department in Sydney. I warned the Director of Immigration in Sydney that I was taking the matter to the employment and relations people. On that occasion, with the aid of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Linehan,</inline> we were able to get the translations effected and a settlement was reached the next day. </para>
          <para>It is important for people who are supposed to know something about industrial relations to note- I am talking to Governments Senators, not to the officers of the Bureau- that a settlement was reached by these votes. There were no recriminations. But if the voting had been mangled by one element not having the proper story, there would have been a festering sore and ethnic tensions for the next two years. This settlement was achieved under a formula and with the co-operation that I received. When I read paragraphs 6.8 to 6.14 of this report tonight, it appeared that the agreement I reached with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Linehan</inline> and the Immigration Department had not become a reality and that these matters were still being looked at. In a situation like the one I have cited, a union with an average or below average membership may not have the resources to provide the facilities. It may well be that unions with the membership of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shiprights Union or the Australian Workers Union can do it. Other unions cannot. I would like a clear cut answer on whether we have got beyond the drawing board stage in meeting situations of this nature. </para>
          <para>I move on to another matter. I would like to know how many bilingual inspectors are employed. The report of the Office of Women's Affairs and other reports outline the position in unorganised industries. I do not envy the position the Miscellaneous Workers Union in the competitive area of office contract cleaning. As a matter of fact, at the Commonwealth Centre in Sydney I have handled one or two disputes by my own methods. On one occasion an overseer tried to get sexual favours on the cheap. I cannot put it any better than that. I notice the reaction from honourable senators opposite. I want to know when women are subjected to some of these indignities. We cannot run away from this situation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> will agree with me that certain things have to be said about it. If the Bureau is to be a Texas Rangers type of outfit, I would like to know how effectively it is grappling with these problems. I would expect that another woman who was obviously bilingual should be able to look into such allegations. I would not expect a male officer to do it. We know that, in the present tight economic situation, it is easier in some ethnic communities for a wife to get, say, a domestic cleaning job than it is for a husband to get a job. She is the main breadwinner. Thus it is not hard to visualise that sexual blackmail could play a part. I would like to know, despite the welter of statistics that we have before us- I realise that it is very hard to put such matters in writing- how we are grappling with this new industrial cancer that has manifested itself. </para>
          <para>I suppose that my concern regarding another matter has been prompted by all of the talk that we have heard about the Northern Territory, and the conflict that exists between State and Federal awards. I would like to know whether effective co-operation is received from the Northern Territory. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> is not here, we know that the gauleiter of Australia- he is rapidly overhauling the Premier of Queensland in that respect- is the chief Minister of the Northern Territory. We know how he hates the National Parks and Wildlife Service and could imagine that with his hang-ups, he would detest people from the Industrial Relations Bureau. Therefore, I would like to know more about the state of relationships with the Northern Territory in that field. </para>
          <para>The other matter in which I am interested concerns my own State and the deployment of Commonwealth arbitration inspectors. Are they deployed on the basis of examining complaints from the eastern suburbs of Sydney, as against those from the western suburbs, or are matters dealt with on a suburb-by-suburb basis? I ask that for the simple reason that you would be wasting your time sending an inspector to Commonwealth Engineering, where there is a highly organised trade union force. Also, I would say that at the paint factories, or Crane's at East Concord, for example, most problems would be covered by the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia. I have a lurking suspicion that there is overlapping: that the inspectors go into a shop or factory that is reasonably organised rather than into these small establishments, even family places, which sometimes make amazing mistakes when they are compiling someone's annual leave entitlements. </para>

            <para>- I refer to the Department of Industrial Relations summary, and the item Australian Trade Union Training Authority. Over a period of several months I had occasion to raise a matter which concerned trade union training in Tasmania. Letters were circulated which said that I had misrepresented the situation and had attacked a Tasmanian senator. I would like this matter to be tidied up by the Department.

He said: </para>

            <para>Discussions between you and officers of my Department indicate that trade union training courses in this State ceased in early 197S, nearly four years ago. Although you have produced general proposals for future training, these are far from being anything but at the development stage in terms of specific courses. </para>

            <para>- The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> will recall a marathon case which dealt with a man who had a franchise to provide kiosk and canteen facilities at some of our major airports.  I  am aware that finally we got most of the money back but a lot of the people involved had moved on. Even when restitution is made by employers for award breaches, I wonder how much of the money is paid back on an annual basis into government revenue as a result of somebody having changed his name and not being traced, or something of that nature? </para>

              <para>- With respect to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> and to allow debate to continue I will withdraw. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> said was that the Tasmanian Auditor-General has stated that some $7,000 was paid, without vouchers, by the Australian Trade Training Authority to the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council. That is not in accordance with the fact. Honourable senators can take that however they like. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> 'Byrne's statement is not in accordance with the facts. The facts simply are that the Trade Union Training Authority was not even in existence during the relevant period. The Trade Union Training Authority did not pay one red cent to the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council. The Commonwealth Government, through the former Department of Labour and Immigration, reimbursed the trade union training account to the extent of claims made which totalled some $33,000. Overall there was a considerable expenditure of money on trade union training from the trade union training account. The program was of such quality as to attract support from the Commonwealth. All of this money was audited. The Auditor-General's report makes it perfectly clear that the money was expended for the purpose for which the grants were made. </para>

          </continue><para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline>'Byrne has continued his vilification of the moderate officials of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council by his untrue insinuations tonight. If he continues to do so, he deserves to be castigated by all right thinking people, not only in Tasmania, but also throughout the Commonwealth. I am proud to declare that I was one of the originators of trade union training in Tasmainia and that I assisted in developing the program to a standard which was the envy of quite a number of States. The trade union training program was instituted to provide for unionists at all levels- at the shop floor level, at the job delegate level, at the organiser level and at the State official and branch official level- a program which gave to them the opportunity to obtain the expertise which would give them the ability to match employers who had these sorts of facilities available to them. I believe that this is one of the reasons why Tasmania has enjoyed an industrial record which is the envy of all States. </para><para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline>'Byrne has continued with his attemp to denigrate the trade union movement. The statements that he has made in this chamber, including the statement earlier this year that I cashed in on the old Trades Hall, which is virtually an accusation that I cashed in on $450,000, are something for which he stands condemned. What he has said is all part and parcel of the attempt to denigrate the moderate officials of the trade union movement. 1 have challenged him to go outside this Parliament and repeat what he has said so that he can be taken to the appropriate place and be dealt with for making such an untrue statement. I am not the only person involved. I am a member of a committee of trustees who have not received a red cent for any of the work that we have done over the last 1 8 years or whatever it is. By implication, he is saying that the solicitor who held the money was crooked. That solicitor is now a judge of the Supreme Court of Tasmania. He is a former senator of this place. Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O</inline> 'Byrne saying that that judge is crooked? Is he saying that this former Labor senator of this place is crooked? I hope that before he continues in the way he has, he will pause or his leader will pull him into gear. </para><para>I wish to deal now with the Industrial Relations Bureau. I support what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> said. I think he made an excellent suggestion in respect of people with linguistic qualities. They would be able to understand sympathetically the situations that he has posed. I want to draw attention to the money that is made available to the Industrial Relations Bureau for legal expenses. It is not a great amount, but I would like to know how the money is spent and for what purpose. Section 144 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides for entitlement to membership of organisations. It states: </para><quote>
            <para>A person employed in connexion with an industry or engaged in an industrial pursuit is, unless he is of general bad character, entitled, subject to payment of any amount properly payable in respect of membership, to be admitted as a member of an organization . . . </para>

            <para>Where a question or dispute arises . . . the organization or the Bureau may apply to the Court for a declaration as to the entitlement of that first-mentioned person under this section. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">During the period under consideration proceedings were taken by the Industrial Relations Bureau against the Federated Clerks Union of Australia on behalf of one Terence Keogh. He is no relation of the head of the Industrial Relations Department. That Terence Keogh happens to be the gentleman upon whose evidence the  President  and Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council were expelled from the Australian Labor Party. The IRB instituted proceedings against the Federated Clerks Union in respect of section 1 44 of the Act. The Federal Court of Australia, constituted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney, found that Terence Keogh at all relevant times was of general bad character. I am just wondering whether, in view of this experience, the Industrial Relations Bureau will take a good look at cases upon which it intends to spend the taxpayers' money. I do not expect the Minister, unless he has the information at his fingertips, to say what cases were taken up. I certainly would guarantee that the Industrial Relations Bureau was quite ill-advised to take on that case, as evidenced by the Federal Court in finding the person concerned to be of general bad character at all relevant times. </para></speech>

I did not mention any of the matters that he raised. I asked a simple question. I pointed out that in a letter from the Minister the amount of $43,326 was to be returned to the State Government as requested. It was held in the Tasmanian Trade Union Training accounts No. 1 and No. 2. If I could obtain that information I would be very grateful. </para>

              <para>- That is the whole point at issue. The document is not complete. I will provide the complete document to honourable senators. From it they will see that the Auditor-General in Tasmania states quite categorically that all the expenditure from the fund was for the purpose for which the grants were made and at no stage did he say that the amount of $7,000 was paid by the Trade Union Training Authority to the Tasmanian Trade Union Training account, unvouched for. What he did say was that inadequate documentation was received in regard to $7,000-odd of the money paid over by the State Government. If that document is complete it will show that; if it is not it will not show that. I will provide the complete document to honourable senators. It will show that the </para>

              <para>- I agree with that, but I do not agree with the argument that this is completely connected with the Estimates. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> complained that among the information he had it was shown that some $7,949- in accordance with the Auditor-General's report which he tabled- was paid without vouchers and could not be verified. He asked that the Industrial Relations Bureau be asked to check on that. I would think that is in accordance with its authority- that is its job. I would expect a ready reply from the Attorney-General saying that the IRB would check into it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> supported the allegations by a letter which made further allegations that the whole set-up was somewhat phoney and worked in favour of a particular organisation. The supporting letter was from the Minister and it asked ibr the return of, I believe, $74,000. That matter does not concern these Estimates except to show that there is something suspicious in the organisation referred to. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> opposes an inquiry by the IRB into the organisation because he never mentioned the return of the money to the State Government. He did mention that a complete report was not tabled and therefore there were some qualifications to it. But I think, to bring the arguments of the two parties together- they are both convinced that what they have said is right- who would oppose the IRB inquiry into the use of this $7,900 of Commonwealth funds to see whether the organisation legitimately expended it and to see whether there was justification for doing so. That is the question. Will the IRB inquire into the situation? If we could attract the Minister's attention for a while, surely he can answer whether it will or will not. </para>

If there is, then in deference to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> of course there is only one option for me to take. But I certainly cannot see in the Standing Orders where this is required of any senator. If this is to be the case, debate in this chamber will be severely restricted.

              <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> said that he is not reflecting upon members of the trade union movement in my State and you are asking me to affirm that that is not the case, then certainly I will withdraw. I am glad to see that at last <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> is taking a position where he does not intend to do this in the future. But- 1 take the point that at the present moment what we have is a request by the Labor Party for the Industrial Relations Bureau to investigate moneys which were forwarded not by the IRB but by the Department of Industrial Relations in respect of trade union training. I certainly object to the IRB undertaking that investigation, because the IRB is not competent to undertake that investigation on two counts. Firstly, there is no provision within the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which clothes the IRB with such a power; and secondly, the IRB is not the appropriate body to make such an investigation. If a body is to make such an investigation, that body ought to be the Department of Industrial Relations, which is the successor to the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations which was the original department which provided the reimbursements for trade union training in my State. Neither I nor any of the people who were associated with trade union training in that State would object to that taking place; that is, the Department undertaking this particular act. In fact we would welcome it. Whilst the Department is doing that I ask the Minister through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> whether he would provide information as to whether the amount of money reimbursed to the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council from the department is in fact money which ought rightly to belong to the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council or is it money which the State Government now seeks to have returned to it? That is a question which I think is a most important question for that department to apply its mind to. Finally, I make the point, as I did before, that so far as the Industrial Relations Bureau is concerned, I believe that the Bureau ought to be very well advised before it takes cases, as it did in the Keogh case. I remind the Senate that it was this very man Keogh about whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> said something in the </para>

              <para>- I am saying that the charges of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> were not an attack on any trade union official. I say he has some suspicion of some operators of the Trade Union Training Authority. He then asked whether the amount of $7,949 mentioned in the extract tabled by the Auditor-General was vouchered for. He asked for an inquiry into that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> says that but he adds that if one reads the whole of the report what the Attorney-General meant by saying that it was unvouchered for- and what he stressed laterwas that it was not properly documented. So, they both agree that there is some question about the amount of $7,949. Unfortunately, I said that the question was whether the Minister for Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> would get the Industrial Relations Bureau to inquire into the matter. I realise that was a mistake because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> claimed that the Australian Trade Union Training Authority, under division 376, was under the Minister's direction and asked whether it would inquire into the matter. The accusation of misappropriation has been made. </para>

              <para>- Let me rephrase that. I agree that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> read out a letter from the Minister which referred to the return of some $43,000. There is another $7,000 which is not adequately vouchered for. Therefore, as it is Commonwealth money he wants the Minister, who is responsible for the Australian Trade Union Training Authority, to make an investigation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> is not much opposed to that investigation. Therefore all we are waiting for is an answer from the Minister but we do not seem to be able to get one. Will the Minister make that inquiry to see whether there is some reason to take further action? There has been a long running sore about whether there has been something crooked in the Trade Union Training Authority in Tasmania. I would like to see the matter cleared up and, as Commonwealth money is involved, I believe it is the responsibility of the Minister to do that. </para>

              <para>- I thank the honourable senator. At last we are at one on that particular matter. There is nothing crooked about trade union training in Tasmania, and there never has been. I would be happy to see the Minister look at the expenditure which was certified by the Auditor-General in Tasmania as being expended for the purposes of the grant. I say this very deliberately; I believe that the Minister ought also to ask his Department whether the amount of $33,000- which was reimbursed by the Commonwealth, for trade union training in Tasmania, and which is part of the $43,000 that the State Government had asked back- is in fact State Government money or whether it belongs to the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council? </para>

            <para>- I wish to obtain further information on the Government's manpower policy. I refer honourable senators to a statement issued by the  Hon.  Ian Viner, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, at the third annual conference of the National Training and Youth Establishment. He spoke about development in Western Australia and suggested that 1,100 tradesmen were needed. He then went on to say that one-sixth would be Australian apprentices. Assuming that the officers of the Department who are present have this information, can the other fivesixths be broken up? Where does the Department expect the overseas tradesmen to come from and where will the other resident Australian tradesmen come from? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The next matter I raise may relate to the Department of Industrial Relations or to the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. I think it relates to the latter. I refer to a conference with the New Guinea Government, dealing with expatriate workers, which I mentioned last night. Any manpower policy that we pursue relates to the use of skilled workers at Bougainville and other island mining ventures. To summarise, I would like a break up of the 1,100 tradesmen that the Department claims it will need on the North- West Shelf, to which the  Hon.  Ian Viner referred in his speech. </para>
          <para>In the same speech the Minister referred to an agreement- I assume it was with the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union- which dealt with what I would be inclined to call the dilution of the status of sheet metal workers. Upgrading was mentioned. As the Minister and his advisers would know, in war-time Australia there were what were called added tradesmen. Take the example of boilermakers in the railways industry. People who were boilermakers' helpers became boilermakers in a railway workshop, but they did not retain that status when they gravitated to outside industry. They retained their tradesmen's status if they remained where they were. I am wondering about the new system that is supposed to apply to sheet metal workers in Victoria. Could the Minister clarify whether people doing semiskilled work are to be given compressed training so they can be regarded as, for example, sheet metal workers? Will this mean that that status will apply only in the plant in which they work or will they carry trade credentials if they go elsewhere to work as sheet metal workers. </para>

            <para>- I have looked through the estimates of expenditure for the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs and I cannot see precisely where the Department is provided with sufficient money to carry out a very important task which I believe it ought to have; that is, to review and to analyse the labour market to see who in the labour market have better reasons to be out of it. Division 288.2.10 refers to occupational information, but I assume that the amount provided there is not applicable to the type of survey that would be required for that sort of operation. We are dealing with the estimates for the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs one day after the publication of the Commonwealth Employment Service unemployment figures for the month of October 1979. Many people, if they have not already switched off their radios, will probably do so at the further mention of unemployment, because many people have jobs. But there are others who are unemployed, who are parents of unemployed or who are parents of a child who is about to leave school with the prospect of unemployment. As well there are many others in the community who have a growing awareness that the danger lights are flashing. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>At the end of October 1979, according to the CES figures, there were 383,878 people seeking full time work. My State of Tasmania has 7 per cent unemployment, the highest figure of any State. Today there has been the usual spate of statements that full employment will return when the economy comes good again. Depending on who made the statement, it is all the fault of the Government or it is all the fault of the unions. That may be partly true, but the whole truth is not being stated. Simply stated, the problem is that there are more people in or seeking paid employment than there are jobs. At the same time new job creation continues to be slashed by technological change. Unless we realise that the problem has social as well as economic aspects, Australia will have over one million unemployed seeking full time employment by the mid- 1 980s. Some people refer to the unemployed as dole bludgers. This is an unfair statement. Certainly some people would not work in an iron lung, but honourable senators should talk to any parent with a school leaver daughter who is looking for a job. With the labour market over-supplied and new jobs being taken by automation, teenage girls will be the hardest to place in jobs. </para>
          <para>Of all the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, Australia, next to Italy, has the highest unemployment rate amongst people under 24 years of age. George Polites, Director of the National Employers Consultative Committee and Joint Director of the Confederation of Australian Industry said last year that if this situation is allowed to continue for any extended .period the economic cost will pale into insignificance compared with the price we will eventually pay in terms of social, economic and political disruption and dislocation. Faced with this gloomy outlook, should we allow jobs to be destroyed by the wholesale application of automation and technological change? In respect of the particular item of expenditure with which we are dealing tonight, should we force to stay in the paid work force those people who have better reasons to be out of the very jobs which could be taken by the unemployed? That is precisely what is happening, but because I will not be permitted to deal with the automation question under this head. I will not do so. There are many thousands in the paid work force who have better reasons to be out of it and who desire to be out of it. </para>
          <para>When statements are made about the number of unemployed, the Government tends to come back with the seemingly contrary statement that more people than ever are in the paid work force. That confuses a lot of people but, of course, there are two different sets of statistics. The one shows that the other is a problem. While there are more people in or seeking employment than there are jobs, unemployment will remain high. There is a simple and obvious answer. Besides the creation of work, which is the primary and important factor, there is a need to reduce the number of people seeking work. Let me give just two examples. I refer to the category of people reaching retiring age. Has the Department done any surveys to show the number of people between, say, 55 and 65 years of age who desire to retire but who cannot do so because of economic factors? Have any surveys been undertaken by the Department in respect of those people? If not, why not? If it has not done so previously, why is there no estimate of expenditure for such a survey? </para>
          <para>Amongst the many contacts that I have throughout factories, shops and offices in Tasmania there would be thousands of people who would like to be in a situation to phase themselves into retirement and who would appreciate the opportunity of doing so without a dramatic fall in their income. It would seen to me that it is not beyond the ability of the fiscal brains in the Government and particularly in the general community to come up with a scheme by which these people would be allowed voluntarily to phase themselves into retirement rather than, as happens in so many cases, to clock off on their sixtyfifth birthday and fall dead within six to eight months because they are not used to the different life-style that retirement presents. </para>
          <para>There are many other examples. Another example is the married women in the work force. Over 43 per cent of all married women are in the paid work force. Many surveys have shown that most of those women with dependent children have been forced into the work force by economic pressures. Why not give them the option of leaving the paid work force if they wish to do so? No person should be compelled to leave the paid work force, neither should any family be forced by economic or other pressures to have both partners working in the paid work force to the detriment of the family. Again, when we consider the estimates for the Department of Social Security, I will make the point that there is a need to lift the family allowance and even to consider the payment of a home-makers allowance to relieve the economic pressure. But why not in some way such as that give an opportunity to thousands of married women who desire to come out of the paid work force to do so? Of course, theoretically and in most cases practically, their jobs could be taken by the youth who are unemployed. I ask honourable senators to bear in mind that, according to Department of Social Security estimates, expenditure on the unemployment benefit for the forthcoming year will total almost $1 billion. </para>
          <para>I recognise that this is not only a Commonwealth Government problem. I believe that, because in our State there is 7 per cent unemployment, there are problems of initiative on the part of the State Government. There are at least two instances- I am aware of two- of the State Government failing to take the initiative. I could mention those instances now, but because of standing orders I cannot do so. Can the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> advise the Committee where in these estimates money is provided for the type of in-depth survey which would indicate the structure of the work force and provide the opinions of a proper sampling of the work force in the categories I have mentioned, upon which information certain fiscal policies could be based which would overcome a significant part of the present unemployment  problem and which also would provide necessary relief from economic pressures on families in this day and age? </para>

            <para class="block">Answer to Question1 </para>
            <para>The Audit Act 1901 requires the Auditor-General to prepare and sign a report each year on the financial statements prepared by the Minister for Finance; it empowers him to prepare a report or reports supplementary thereto, and it requires him to transmit a signed copy of each report and supplement to both Houses of the Parliament. The Auditor- </para>
            <para>General may, at his discretion, include in these reports- information relating to, explanations of and comments on the financial statements of the Minister for Finance information in relation to audits, examinations and inspections carried out in respect of certain operations of Departments of State determined by the Minister for Finance under section 4 1 D of the Audit Act information in relation to audits, examinations and inspections carried out in pursuance of other Acts. </para>
            <para>Reports prepared by the Auditor-General on the results of efficiency audits are required to be tabled in the Parliament, except as provided in sub-sections 48f( 7) and 48f(9). </para>
            <para>The Minister for Finance may require the Auditor-General to inspect, examine and audit the accounts and records of any accounting officer. In this event, the Auditor-General is required to report to the Minister all irregularities discovered by him which, in his opinion, are of sufficient importance to be so reported. </para>
            <para>In relation to audits conducted in accordance with the provisions of legislation other than the Audit Act, as authorised by section 63p of the Audit Act, it is generally the case that the Auditor-General is required to report to the responsible Minister each year on the financial statements of the entity concerned, and the Minister, in turn, is required to table the annual report of that entity, together with a copy of the report of the Auditor-General. There are exceptions to these requirements as set out in Attachments A and B. </para>
            <para>There are two categories of report by the Auditor-General not required by law to be tabled in the Parliament. The first is reports on the financial statements prepared in accordance with State and Territory Companies legislation. Where, however, reports including financial statements and audit certificates in respect of these companies are tabled in the Parliament, the Auditor-General normally makes reference to those companies in his reports to the Parliament. The second is reports on the results of audits of the accounts and records of statutory and other bodies. In respect of the latter, the enabling legislation or audit arrangements require only, as a general rule, that the Auditor-General report to the responsible Minister, with no requirement for tabling by the Minister in the Parliament. </para>
            <para>As mentioned in the Introduction to the Supplementary Report of the Auditor-General for the year ended 30 June 1979, and tabled in the Parliament on 13 November 1979, recent legal advice suggests there is no authority for the Auditor-General to include the results of audits carried out under an Ordinance in a report to the Parliament. He has nevertheless decided to follow past practice in this regard in the interests of informing the Parliament on those activities, and has written to the Minister for Finance suggesting that in the consideration of this legal advice, the reporting responsibilities be examined with a view to amendment of the Audit Act if this should be necessary. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- Initially I wish to speak briefly on the estimates for the Department of Social Security in general. One of the difficulties which was alluded to earlier in the night by other honourable senators speaking to other estimates was the very real problem that exists in this country with our social security system. It leaves so many gaps and so many people untouched and therefore so many people in poverty. One group which was mentioned earlier tonight comprises those families in the community who, because they rely on social security benefits or are in the low income bracket, remain well below the poverty line. This fact was I believe demonstrated satisfactorily by a table that was incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard in</inline> the debate on the Social Services Amendment Bill. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not think that I need to go into detail. The simple facts of the matter are that in this country large families relying on unemployment or other social security benefits or receiving low incomes remain below the poverty level. They remain in difficulty without much hope of assistance. The only means we have in this country of redistributing income to those families under the current legislation is through the family allowance scheme. This scheme was introduced in 1976 to replace the previous tax rebates for families and the previous child endowment scheme which had become so eroded by inflation as to be almost meaningless. </para>
          <para>An alternative method of assisting these families could be through the taxation system, but we have a taxation system which is so complex and so difficult to amend that in the short term I believe that reform in this area to achieve significant benefits for poor people, particularly low income families, would be impossible. </para>

              <para>-I am aware of that but I believe it is the practical situation. I assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> 's interjection refers to the proposal for income splitting. I must say that I share the implied views of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hamer</inline> in his question the other day. Any proposal for income splitting- this is obvious to anyone who looks at it- will benefit most those on high incomes and least those single parent families who have no one to split their income with. It will benefit the low income families very little because their income is so low that they are paying very little tax now and will pay very little less tax with such an income splitting proposal. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It is not the sort of proposal that I believe is practical, just or fair in our community. We have the family allowance scheme which I believe we can reform quickly and reasonably to redirect funds to low income families. I have spoken on this matter in the past and have been criticised by various people on the Government side for speaking in this way, mainly I believe, because they have deliberately misinterpreted what I have said. In 1976 family allowances were introduced. The allowances have remained at the same rate despite an inflation rate of some 36 per cent since then. Their value has been considerably eroded. But even if they had been indexed under the present system across the board through all income levels, the increase in family allowances to the high income families would be meaningless because of their incomes and the increase in income to the low income families would have been inadequate to raise their income sufficiently to get them anywhere near the poverty line. This remains a fact. </para>
          <para>I am not one of those people who believe that poverty can be measured just by income. I believe access to health and to other services must be considered. We can use this measure fairly accurately to measure how we can get people up to a reasonable level so that they are no longer in poverty. If we are to use the family allowances scheme we must look, I believe, at methods of redirecting some of the increased payments under that scheme to the low income families. This does not mean taking away money from people who at present receive family allowances. This does not mean introducing administrative procedures. It means deciding that the amount of money in this country which is spent on family allowances can be increased. I believe it can be increased beyond the level of indexation, beyond the $300m which would have been the cost if allowances had been indexed since they were introduced in 1 976. </para>
          <para>I believe that the bulk of that money should be directed to low income families whether or not they are on benefits. I believe that this money should be directed as much as possible to those people as has been done in Canada and other countries through a family income supplement or whatever it is called. We have to take a serious look at the system we have. We have a complex social security system and a complex income support system. If we are serious about redirecting income in this community to those in need we must look seriously at using the present amount of money we pay on family allowances. We cannot do it by simple across the board indexation to all families with children in the community whether or not they are in need. We must develop some means of assessing those in need and getting income to them whether or not they come under the present ambit of the social security system. </para>
          <para>The low income family of a person working for a wage in the community is completely left out of our present system. They do not come into our social security or income support system in any way except through the family allowances scheme. This scheme is well accepted and efficient, and the take-up rate is probably higher than most social security payment systems we have. It can easily be adapted to pay a higher family income supplement to those who are in real need. I must seriously question, as I have in the past, whether across the board indexation or increases as advocated by so many is a just way of using public funds. We must look seriously at reforming the system we have which works well. I ask the Minister for Social Secutiry <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> whether the Government is in fact considering this matter. </para>
          <para>The Minister introduced the family allowance scheme in 1 976 with a great fanfare. It was continually praised as being the greatest advance in social security in this country for many years. The Opposition agreed that the scheme certainly was a great improvement on the old tax rebate and child endowment scheme and a considerable improvement on the old tax deduction scheme for children which the Labor Party changed to a tax rebate scheme with considerable opposition from some members of the present Government. I ask the Minister how she can justify introducing a scheme like that in 1976 with such a fanfare and with such claims of assistance to low income families in the community and then leave payments at the same level they had been at since 1 976 and allow them to be eroded by 36 per cent or 40 per cent inflation without any justification. </para>
          <para>I have sympathy for those who say that the simplest and easiest thing to do would be to introduce indexation. My concern about automatic indexation in this area is that it will not necessarily assist those who need most assistance. If a family income support scheme cannot be introduced which directs funds to low income families, certainly we should at least introduce indexation. If we were willing to spend $ 1 billion on family allowances in 1976 we should be willing to spend at least $ 1 ,300m on family allowances in 1979 with the level of indexation we have had since then. I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on this matter. </para>

The Handicapped Persons Program received an appropriation of $52m last year and $39. 3m for 1979-80.

            <para>The most alarming factor in the Budget is the reduction in the appropriation to the Handicapped Persons Program (H.P.P.). The 1978-79 Appropriation was $52m. The actual expenditure was $47.6m. The appropriation for 1 979-80 is $39.3m. There is a decease of $12.7m. The 1978-79 appropriation was under spent by $4.4m. Responsibility for the underspending lies with the Department and those organisations which applied for and accepted grants without the facility to use their allocation. This is absurd. </para>

            <para>ACROD urges the Minister for Social Security to establish a working group consisting of departmental officers and representatives of ACROD to examine this and other problems occurring in the administration of the H.P.P. Tens of millions of dollars of applications dating back to 1975 remain unapproved. Other organisations do not make application as they know of the enormous back-log. The $39.3m will cover on-going expenses and little more. lt is a sad reflection on the Government, it is a sad reflection on the Parliament and it is a sad reflection on Australia as a nation that this sort of situation exists in 1 979 when last year there was under expenditure of $4.4m in the appropriation. Whatever the reason there has been a cutback in expenditure from $52m to $39.3m. I raise my voice in protest at the way in which these people are being denied economic and social justice apparantly based on comparable standards on a year to year basis. I hope that the Minister will take cognisance of the suggestion put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Braun</inline> that she establish a working group consisting of departmental officers and representatives of the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of the Disabled to examine the problems occurring in the administration of the handicapped persons' program. Since we are discussing the estimates for the Department of Social Security, I invite the Minister, even at this late hour, to comment on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Braun</inline> 's suggestion. I emphasise to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> and to the Minister, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Braun</inline> has dedicated the whole of his working life to assisting underprivileged and handicapped people, in New South Wales in particular. I have great admiration for the efforts that he has made on behalf of these people. </para>

              <para>- I appreciate the opportunity to continue my remarks. Having made the point in respect of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act, I now raise another matter that I take up with the Minister from time to time. It concerns appeals to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. I refer to the figures that the Minister gave in answer to question No. 18 10, which I placed upon notice on 23 August and which she was kind enough to answer on 1 1 September. I refer to the obvious disparity in the way in which her Department- I assume that it is the Director-General of Social Security- regards the recommendations of the New South Wales Tribunal in comparison with those of the Tribunals of the various other States. I asked the Minister the following questions: How many appeals to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal have been received in each State and recommended by the Appeals Tribunal to the Department for acceptance? How many favourable recommendations of the Appeals Tribunal have been accepted? How many have not been accepted by the Department? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>When I received the figures I was appalled at the alarming differentiation between the figures of some of the States and those of my own State of New South Wales. For instance, in New South Wales the number of appeals received by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal amounted to 1,760. The number recommended for acceptance by the Tribunal was 541. The number of Tribunal recommendations not accepted by the Department was 134, or more than a quarter. In Queensland of 2,904 appeals received only 378 were recommended for acceptance and the number of Tribunal recommendations not accepted by the Department was nil. </para><para>Frankly, as a senator representing New South Wales, it is quite incomprehensible to me that 378 should be recommended for acceptance by the Queensland Tribunal and all be accepted by the Department. In New South Wales 54 1 were recommended for acceptance by the Tribunal but 134 were not accepted. In South Australia 251 were recommended for acceptance by the Tribunal and 33. were not accepted. In Western </para><para class="block">Australia, the number of appeals recommended was 145 and the number of tribunal recommendations not accepted was 11. In Victoria, the number recommended for acceptance was 312 and the number of tribunal recommendations not accepted by the Department was 27. One hundred and thirty four appeals out of 541 in New South Wales were not accepted by the Department; only 27 appeals out of 3 12 in Victoria were not accepted by the Department. Frankly, I want to know why there is discrimination or why, prima facie, there appears to be discrimination by the Department of Social Security against the residents of New South Wales who have appealed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, and have had there appeals considered by that Tribunal. </para><para>The Appeals Tribunal has made a favourable recommendation to the Department that these appeals be accepted and yet over 25 per cent of them are refused by the Department. I would not mind if the same sort of justice was being meted out to residents of other States. But when there is such an imbalance- a gross imbalance- against the people of New South Wales, I, as a senator, must raise my voice in protest either at the way in which the Department is treating its appeals or, on the other hand, at the way in which the Department is regarding the Appeals Tribunal in New South Wales. When I raised the matter with the Minister, the Minister suggested that she was going to have a look at it and that the overall purview of appeals be referred to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. But, pending that happening, I say that the figures that I have cited to date are not good enough. There is a gross distortion and a gross imbalance against the people of New South Wales. I ask the Minister or her advisers who are now present for an answer to the problem that obviously exists on the figures that I have cited. </para><para>Consideration of Group C interrupted. </para></speech>

            <para>- I have received a copy of a letter signed by the Acting Assistant Auditor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon,</inline> relating to the questions that I asked yesterday. The questions related to whether reports other than those which had been specifically excluded by previous discussion in the Committee but including special reports arising from investigations conducted by the Auditor-General are normally tabled in Parliament and whether, if the Auditor-General has submitted a report to a Minister, the Minister is obliged to table that report in Parliament and, if the Minister fails to table such a report, whether the Auditor-General can report directly to Parliament. Today I added an additional question as to whether there was any precedent for special reports by the Auditor-General, having been submitted to a Minister, not being tabled in the Parliament. I recognise that that question was only asked earlier today and has probably not come to the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon,</inline> who signed this letter. I will return to that later. Although the questions, I thought, were fairly simple questions, the letter, which runs to over two pages, provides anything but a simple answer. In fact, as one looks through it one could interpret the intention of the letter as being to complexify the situation as much as to clarify it. In the fourth paragraph on page two it is stated: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>In relation to audits conducted in accordance with the provisions of legislation other than the Audit Act, as authorised by section 63p of the Audit Act - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">On the face of it, it seems to be somewhat contradictory to talk of investigations, under legislation other than the Audit Act, as authorised by section 63P of the Audit Act. I am not sure how one reconciles the statement that investigations authorised by the Audit Act can be carried out outside the Audit Act. The letter continues: it is generally the case that the Auditor-General is required to report to the responsible Minister each year on the financial statements of the entity concerned, and the Minister, in turn, is required to table the annual report of that entity . . . </para>
          <para class="block">I think that refers to the reports of statutory authorities. As far as I know, the annual reports of statutory authorities are always tabled in the Parliament together with, as the letter says, a copy of the report of the Attorney-General. Apart from the initial seemingly contradictory reference to the provisions of legislation other than the Audit Act, as authorised by section 63P of the Audit Act- a possible explanation for that superficial contradiction is that in, for example, the Act establishing the Australian Dairy Corporation it is stated that the accounts of the Corporation will be audited annually by the Auditor-General and tabled in the Parliament; perhaps that is what it means- it appears that the Minister is obliged to table in Parliament a copy of the annual report of such statutory authorities together with a copy of the report of the Auditor-General. If my interpretation is correct, it does not surprise me. That is what I had previously expected. However, the question I asked referred to special investigations having been conducted by the Auditor-General. In the fifth paragraph on page two of the letter there is a reference to reports on the results of audits of the accounts and records of statutory and other bodies. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In respect of the latter, the enabling legislation or audit arrangements require only, as a general rule, that the Auditor-General report to the responsible Minister, with no requirement Tor tabling by the Minister in the Parliament. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I assume that what is being stated there is that special investigations by the Auditor-General into statutory authorities or comparable bodies, other than the Auditor-General 's comment or report on the annual reports of those bodies, must be submitted to the Minister but not necessarily submitted to the Parliament. I seek clarification from the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster),</inline> whether my interpretation of that paragraph is accurate. The final paragraph of the letter states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Having regard to section 51a of the Audit Act, the Auditor-General normally includes in his reports, transmitted to the Parliament information in relation to audits, examinations and inspections carried out in pursuance of the Audit Act and any other Act. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Section 5 1a states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Auditor-General shall include in any report made by him . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In fact that is a quotation from section 5 1a which appears to leave to the discretion of the Auditor-General how much additional information which he has collected during the year he includes in annual reports of statutory corporations and perhaps other bodies. Now the fourth question- I suppose I was remiss in not putting it more explicitly last night- is whether there are any precedents for not tabling the report of a special investigation conducted by the Auditor-General into the accounts or the expenditure of a statutory corporation. More specifically, the question to which I am seeking an answer is whether there is any precedent for not tabling a report such as the two reports into Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd, a subsidiary of the Australian Dairy Corporation, which have been completed by the Auditor-General and submitted to the Minister. Is there any precedent for not tabling in the Parliament reports of that nature? The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> who has been twice questioned on this matter in the House in the last six weeks has not said that he will not table the report, because he just has not answered the questions. He has ignored questions when he was supposed to be responding to them. </para>
          <para>Firstly, I request the Minister to clarify whether my interpretation of the fourth and fifth paragraphs and a half paragraph at the beginning of page 2 of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon's</inline> letter, is correct; secondly, whether there are any precedents for the Minister not tabling reports such as those on Asia Dairy Industries which have been received by the Minister for Primary Industry in the last couple of months. </para>

            <para>- I want to make a few observations. Firstly, I want to place on record that the so-called House of review, which the people who sit across the aisle from us insist that this place is, has just deliberately by-passed an opportunity to have produced from the Government a responsible answer as to why reports prepared by the Auditor-General have not been presented in the House of Representatives or in the Senate. It begs the question as to why the $10m which is being appropriated for the office of Auditor-General is being expended by the taxpayer if the reports into statutory authorities prepared by the Auditor-General are to remain secret documents known only to the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon).</inline> It begs a further question: What does the Government have to hide? Why will the Minister for Primary Industry not table these reports? I would suggest that what has just happened in this so-called House of review is almost as scandalous as the interment of the doctrine on ministerial responsibility which has been determined in the last two days. </para>

              <para>- Not only has this Senate abdicated what is supposed to be its right to review; it has abdicated its right to establish what are facts, even before they can be reviewed. I think that is a pretty reprehensible situation. Why have these two reports of the Auditor-General into a subsidiary of a statutory corporation not been disclosed to the Senate? We are considering here a vote from the Parliament, an appropriation of $ 10m to maintain the office of the Auditor-General when the reports, having been prepared by that office, remain secret documents known only to the Minister for Primary Industry. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>Having said that, I want to draw attention to the fact that I have today submitted a Notice of Motion to move tomorrow: that the Senate require those reports be tabled. So there will be a second opportunity for members of the Liberal Party, for members of the Country Party and for members of the Australian Democrats, who voted with the Government in the vote which has just taken place and abdicated not only all responsibility to review actions of the Government but also abdicated the right to know the facts upon which they could base such a review of actions of the Government. An opportunity will recur tomorrow for all members of the Liberal Party, all members of the Country Party and all members of the Australian Democrats to decide whether this so-called House of review will assert its right to know what are the facts in order that it may, should it choose to do so, review them. </para>

              <para>- Just a moment. I wonder about the sanity of some honourable senators when I find us sitting here at 1 1.35 p.m., having made very little progress, having heard matters raised almost ad nauseam in an extremely repetitious way, and when someone who has not interjected wishes to respond and is not able to be heard. I shall be very brief. I wish to make the following points. I too am concerned. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> in his concern about what on earth is happening about Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd. Since he has made reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, I can say that that Committee has had an interest in this matter and some time ago made some inquiries in relation to it. I do not take the point further as to what else the Committee may do. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> in being concerned about the matter, but I do not agree with his use of the sorts of descriptions which he used tonight about the people who voted on the motion which he moved. If I may say so that motion was something which was spun off the top of his head and ill-drafted. In that motion he sought to ascertain whether the Minister can give any precedent about the failure to table an Auditor-General's report. Is that a matter to do with the probity and integrity of the operation of either the Auditor-General's Office or Asia Dairy Industries? </para>

            <para>- I must respond very briefly to what has been said. This action would not have been taken in the Senate tonight had the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> done what I believe is certainly his moral duty, and possibly even his legal duty. We have not been able to get an opinion from the Government about the legalities. I asked for an opinion yesterday and was not able to get one. Possibly it is his legal duty to table in the Parliament reports that he has received from the Auditor-General resulting from an investigation into a subsidiary of a statutory authority. If the Minister for Primary Industry had done the right thing, if he had not been trying to cover up- as he evidently is trying to do- for reasons which are not entirely clear at this stage, then the Opposition would not have taken this action. We have been forced into it. </para>

          <para>Having said that, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> on one matter. I think it is absurd that we should be sitting here at 1 1.41 p.m. on a Wednesday night, having sat until 12 o'clock on Monday and Tuesday nights. The Senate ought to be sitting next week. The Government has decided to close down the Parliament earlier than it has been closed down in a non-election year by any other government within the last decade. The reason why the Government is closing down the Parliament is that it wants to escape the scrutiny of Parliament, and for very good reason. It does not want its actions scrutinised by the Parliament and exposed to the public. </para>

            <para>- I wish to deal with the estimated expenditure for widows pensions, referred to on page 9 1 of the explanatory notes of the Department of Social Security. Detailed there is the estimate for widows pensions, $572m. For the first time in history, less than half of that $572m will actually go to women whose husbands have died. As I understand it- perhaps the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> can correct me if I am wrong- most of it will be spent on financial support for deserted wives or divorcees. The number of divorcees in Australia appears to have settled at about 40,000 a year, following a high of 63,000 in 1976 which was the first full year after the 1975 Murphy family law amendments. More than 74,000 children are added to the divorce toll each year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In addition, on page 94 of the explanatory notes it is stated that there will be an additional $258m spent this year on sole supporting parents benefits, which is an increase of 1 3.82 per cent on last year. Of the sole supporting parents receiving benefits, 57,067 are women and 1,970 are men. The interesting point about that is that the total number of supporting parents has more than doubled since 1974. Almost half the women are unmarried, and 65 per cent of those women have no other income. </para>
          <para>There are other areas of social security expenditure. The Government will spend a considerable amount of money for the care of aged people and for the care of children whose parents, both parents, are in the paid workforce. The Committee has had before it, in the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department, expenditure for marriage counselling and premarital courses. </para>
          <para>Let me say very clearly that I do not begrudge the payment of any of the benefits mentioned. To receive those benefits people must have satisfied the criteria of eligibility laid down in the Social Services Act. Indeed, many other people and I are extremely happy that unmarried mothers have rejected abortion as a solution to the situation in which they have found themselves. On the other hand, I note with concern the dramatic decrease in the proportion of babies being offered for adoption by unmarried mothers while the list of married couples eagerly waiting to provide a balanced home life grows longer and longer. </para>
          <para>The message more directly conveyed by the figures I have just quoted is that the disintegration of the family unit in Australian society is now making significant inroads into the pattern of Government expenditure. As the family unit comes under increasing economic and social stress, problems previously taken care of within the family are being passed on to governments. The simple, fact, which I believe governments everywhere are failing to recognise, is that some caring functions are achieved more economically within the family unit than outside it. Very often governments could save themselves much expenditure of effort and funds if they adopted a positive approach to protecting the family unit. </para>
          <para>I support what other speakers have said in respect of the Social Security estimates on the question of family allowances. Let me take the example of the emergence of the dual income family as an acceptable or desirable situation. As I see it, there is no stated Government policy, in these documents or elsewhere, which says that that is the aim, but the deliberate pressure, both in the past and at present, on married women to enter the paid work force has helped to promote the trend. I believe that some families, particularly one-income families, are beginning to wake up to the fact that they are receiving very little incentive or encouragement from governments. Those families have noted the disappearance of the maternity allowance, the 35 per cent erosion in the real value of family allowance payments, and the way in which they are regularly catapulted into higher taxation brackets. It is little wonder that last year there were 52,000 fewer live births than in 1971. I hope that the Government will put its money where its Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Minister's mouth is. The tragedy is, and I ask the Minister to comment on this, that if governments only woke up they would realise that a small amount of justice and equity today would remove the necessity in future years for massive expenditures in dealing with the end results of the disintegration of the family unit. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Grimes</inline>and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> have made reference to the family allowances and to the need for a review of the level of family allowances and of payments that are made under social security systems. I have noted their views. The Government has not been able to increase family allowances since their introduction. As has been stated, over $ 1 ,000m has been paid by way of family allowances for children in Australia. It is a matter that can be reviewed constantly and I have noted with interest what has been said by both honourable senators. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline>McClelland raised matters regarding handicapped persons' assistance and read some material that had been sent to him by someone who was concerned at the level of funding that has been provided this year. The appropriation of $39.3m this year will enable grants to be made to complete the outstanding projects which resulted from the three-year program that was introduced in 1976. It will enable claims to be met for upgrading existing facilities, for replacement of equipment, for maintenance of buildings, for all the salary subsidies and for rental of premises- in other words, all the recurrent support that we give. It will also allow some new approvals to be given during this year; and some have already been announced. The Government is already announcing projects that will be funded in 1980-81. In addition, we have had expenditure through the Office of Child Care, which has a great deal of assistance to many of the handicapped persons' organisations. </para>
          <para>There has been some comment with regard to underspending last year. It needs to be noted that this is occurring through organisations which have had grants approved not being able to keep to their proposed building schedules. Of course, the money goes into the subsequent year's funding and is not lost, as some public statements have suggested. This again is a program which, I believe, has shown the way in which the Government is able to work with voluntary organisations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland paid tribute to the Sunnyfield Association and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Braun,</inline> who wrote to him. I assure him of my support for the work that is done with regard to handicapped persons' assistance through the voluntary sector. </para>
          <para>The suggestion with regard to discussions between the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of the Disabled and officers of my Department to deal with a number of matters has already been brought to my attention. I had a lunch appointment with ACROD office bearers a week or so ago and I have already asked that a meeting occur so that we can exchange views on some of the matters that were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland and on some other matters which may arise. </para>
          <para>The other matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland was with regard to the New South Wales Social Security Appeals Tribunals. As he said, I answered a letter from him and gave him the statistics that had been received. I can only note, with him, that a higher proportion of recommendations from New South Wales is not upheld by the Department. If he would like me to arrange for the New South Wales Director of Social Services to speak with him about this matter, I would be happy to do so. To my memory, New South Wales has always shown different statistics in the number of appeals handled and in the way in which recommendations are able to be upheld. I would be very happy to arrange a meeting if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland would like to have a discussion with someone from my Department as to how it handles appeals recommendations when they come from the Appeals Tribunals. </para>
          <para>The matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> is one to which I would need to give consideration. It is not usual to give information publicly about the benefits received by any person under the Social Services Act. I provide information to an honourable senator if he or she claims to be the representative of the person concerned, but I would need to give serious consideration as to whether a question such as that raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> could be answered by me at this time. </para>

            <para>- I will briefly comment on the reply made by the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> particularly in regard to the family allowance. It seems to me that unless a serious look is taken at the manner in which we are supporting low income families in the community generally and avoid the sort of bland reply that we got from the Minister we will get nowhere. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In 1976, the family allowance scheme was introduced and we were willing to spend some $ 1,000m on it. It was introduced to replace a system of tax rebates for children which, under any system of tax indexation- be it full indexation or part indexation- would have meant that those rebates also would have been indexed. At the time we of the Opposition suspected what has happened would happen. We aired our concern that the introduction of family allowance may well have provided for the Government a let-out to avoid the revenue problems which may have arisen by the indexation of the children's rebate when the Government had a policy of full tax indexation. What has happened is what we predicted would happen, that is the family allowance has remained the same and its value has been eroded by 35 per cent or 36 per cent because of inflation since then. The people on low incomes, the people on benefits and the people on pensions who have children have been asked to carry far too much of the burden of inflation and the burden of the Government's economic policy. Something will have to be done as the income support system has been greatly eroded. </para>
          <para>Suggestions are coming from all directions. There has been the suggestion of income splitting, I understand, by a Government back bench committee. This would cost, depending on how one did the exercise, some $ 1 ,000m or $ 1 ,700m a year which would be a loss to the revenue or would have to be passed on to another group of taxpayers. There is a suggestion to increase greatly the spouse's allowance under the taxation system. That does not recognise the fact that it is parenthood more than marriage that causes economic difficulties. We have always paid the spouse's allowance in recognition that sometimes marriage creates economic difficulties, but in fact it is parenthood rather than marriage that causes the problems. </para>
          <para>What I am suggesting is that we take a serious look at the family allowance scheme- a well understood scheme, an efficient scheme, a scheme which above all in almost all cases in the community pays money to mothers- so that we can redistribute some of the funds to those who need the assistance. I know that redistribution of income is a dirty word to some people on the other side of the chamber but the only system that we have in existence at the moment which is administratively effective and administratively simple to redistribute money- and God knows everybody accepts that we need to redistribute money to some of these people- is in fact the family allowance scheme. If we cannot graft onto the family allowances schemes a family income supplement by using this efficient, accessible system, we should at least index the allowance, as ineffective as that would be. We should index the allowances at least to recognise that the value of the allowance is being eroded by inflation. </para>
          <para>I urge the Government to look at the problem seriously because low income families, particularly those with a working parent, are in fact becoming those who are left out of our social security and our general system of income support in this country. I merely ask the Government seriously to consider doing something about this group in the community and looking seriously at all the suggestions that are made, even though I have expressed by disagreement with proposals such as income splitting. I ask the Government to look at the system we have and ascertain whether we can rapidly introduce a means of supporting this group in the community. </para>

            <para>- I do not intend to delay the Committee at length but I take up what the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> has said to me about the Director of the New South Wales branch of the Department of Social Security having a discussion with me about the way in which her Department is treating appeals to determinations by recommendations of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. I say at the outset that I will be very pleased indeed to have discussions with the Director of Social Services in New South Wales, but I do not know that that will overcome the problem. My complaint relates to the imbalance which appears in the figures which the Minister for Social Security has provided me in relation to the way in which her Department treats appeals from New South Wales compared with the way in which her Department treats appeals from Victoria and, in particular, Queensland. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I mention again that in New South Wales 54 1 appeals were recommended for acceptance by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and 1 34 of the Tribunal's recommendations were not accepted by the Department. In Queensland, 378 appeals were recommended for acceptance by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and no recommendations of the Tribunal were not accepted by the Department; in other words, in Queensland every recommendation of the Tribunal was accepted by the Department. What I am saying is that if the Queensland Director of Social Services accepts all recommendations from the Appeals Tribunal and in New South Wales over one quarter of the recommendations are rejected, frankly, I would like to see the Queensland Director of Social Services transferred to New South Wales so that the people of New South Wales could get a bit of justice along the same lines as that received by people in Queensland. There is a great imbalance. I want to see that the people of New South Wales are given the same sort of treatment as the people of the other States. On these figures, it appears to me that that is not so. </para>

            <para>- I have only a brief question. I understand that when Estimates Committee C was dealing with the estimates for the Department of Health it was indicated that the animal quarantine establishment at Abbotsford in New South Wales was being phased out gradually. Can the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> be a little more specific and indicate to me when she expects that the establishment will have left the place completely? I am asking that question on the assumption that after it has left that place the appropriate ministry will determine the future of that piece of Commonwealth land. </para>

            <para>- The annual report was tabled yesterday. I have here a statement that I would like to read. It states: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>All health insurance funds have faced considerable problems since October 1976 when the Medibank 1 arrangements were replaced by private health insurance or a health levy. </para>
            <para>The problems for the Health Insurance Commission have been considerably greater. The Government was aware that in adopting the recommendations of the Medibank Review Committee in October 1976 it was placing considerable administrative strain on the Commission. The changes introduced in October 1976 were significant-particularly the requirement to introduce what has become a major private health fund in such a short time. The complex relationships between Medibank Standard and Medibank Private introduced administrative problems which perhaps could have been avoided had more time been available. However, the Government had firm, clear policies in the health insurance area and even if the full extent of administrative problems had been recognised at the time the broad policy goals would still have been obtained. The Government would not have been willing to forgo the savings involved even knowing that problems may arise. While problems have arisen the Commission has met the Government's public policy goals. It has established Medibank Private as a strong fund in the health insurance industry. </para>
            <para>I might add that in retrospect, the computer arrangements for the changed Medibank program were probably not satisfactory. Problems in the development of computer systems appropriate to the commercial demands of Medibank Private were an important factor in this regard and this was despite a high priority being given to the area from the computer resources of the Department of Health. </para>
            <para>The Senate will be aware that the Commission is heavily dependent on computer based information for the finalisation of its accounts. </para>
            <para>In addition, the health insurance arrangements to apply from 1 November 1978 and announced in the 1978-79 Budget caused the Commission considerable administrative upheaval resulting in transfer of resources-to ensure that Medibank Private was competitive with other funds on 1 November 1978- away from the task of finalising the 1977-78 accounts, which is a significant exercise in itself since it is the only fund which operates in all States. </para>
            <para>As indicated, on S September 1979, the Auditor-General reported to the Minister for Health on the Health Insurance Commission's accounts for 1977-78. The Commission's annual 1977-78 report was tabled on 20 November 1979. </para>

I find that the responses from the Department to the questions asked by the  Chairman  of the committee are quite inadequate. I do not propose to canvass the situation tonight. I have a notice of motion on the Notice Paper stating that payment should not be made to those organisations in the family planning area which regard abortion as a legitimate means of fertility control. I say no more, but when that motion comes before the chamber I expect a far more detailed and appropriate view to be expressed by the Department. </para>

I have already given the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> who is at the table, duplicate copies of the correspondence. I refer firstly to question on notice No. 1794. It was asked by my very diligent South Australian colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elstob,</inline> and referred to a list of grants given to ethnic organisations as part of the review of post-arrival programs and services for migrants in Australia. I notice that item 22 concerning the Yugoslav Australian Association shows a date of approval of 2 7.4. 1 979. The other items show the amount of money that was provided. Item 22 has alongside it the word 'nil'. There may have been some jettisoning of the original plan. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the first page of question on notice No. 1794 and page 2 of the list to which I have referred. </para>

I refer to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lee</inline> Jin. He is a member of the Australasian Society of Engineers in New South Wales. As a matter of fact he is working in the dockyards. On 10 August the Minister approved of his permanent residence. It was strongly supported by the ASE and the dockyard officials. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lee</inline> is a specialist in diesel engines. He will be transferring shortly to the Marine Engineers Association. He is a bit unfortunate. He is a Korean. There has been some turbulence in Korea. I understand a lot of his industrial know-how was acquired working in Iran for some American company. I simply seek leave to have incorporated a letter containing the initial approval of resident status from the Minister of 10 August and the subsequent letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lee</inline> Jin to me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lee</inline> refers to his character clearance.

            <para>I am writing to confirm the details of our recent conversation regarding the present difficulties I am encountering with having a very simple prescription filled because of Dept. of Repatriation regulations. </para>
            <para>Some 1 5 years ago the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr H.</inline> Barnett prescribed 'Dexsal ' after meals as a means of relieving heartburn. This was due to my angina condition, and the Dexsal saves me from taking the more expensive Anginine tablets. </para>

Any assistance you can give in this regard would be greatly appreciated. </para><para>Yours sincerely Stanley L. Johnson </para>

            <para>- I raise the matter of the operation of the Repatriation Review Tribunal as it affects my own State of Tasmania. The problem has arisen through many applications which have been drawn to my attention on several occasions. The hearings of the Tribunal in Tasmania are extremely limited. I wrote to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann)</inline> about this problem in August. I received a reply from him on 1 8 October. Essentially, on 24 August 96 applications were still to be reviewed. My reason for raising the matter tonight is that I wrote again to the Minister on 26 October asking him to consider the establishment of a tribunal in the State so that matters can be dealt with more expeditiously. This is not a new suggestion as the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> will well know. There is, undoubtedly, a serious backlog. People are being told that they must wait for up to 12 months before their cases can be heard. I had a recent case where, unfortunately, the applicant passed away; he had been waiting for some months. Naturally this caused distress to the family. I ask the Minister for Social Security to draw the attention of her colleague to my letter of 26 October and ask him to expedite a reply so that I can get some matters dealt with. </para>

I refer to the new fears that exist in regard to the ozone layer being destroyed.

My fears are fortified by another clipping from the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun.</inline> I ask that they be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> also ask the Minister to indicate specifically whether we will have an on-going committee monitoring the properties of the ozone layer in the southern hemisphere because obviously there may be more skin cancers.

            <para>The National Academy of Sciences will issue a report this month saying that the ozone layer is breaking down at twice the rate scientists expected. </para>
            <para>The report will say new calculations on fluorocarbon chemicals being discharged into the upper atmosphere suggest they are enough to break apart a little more than 14 per cent of the ozone layer in the next 50 to 100 years. </para>
            <para>This is twice what the academy said in 1976 would be stripped from the ozone layer, which lies 28 miles above the earth and blocks most of the ultraviolet light. </para>
            <para>Scientists are concerned that fluorocarbon gases used as propellants in spray cans accumulate in the upper atmosphere, where they are broken down by ultraviolet light and release chlorine that destroys the ozone. If people continue to use spray cans containing fluorocarbon propellants as they did in 1975, this would allow 14 per cent of the ultraviolet light from the sun to penetrate the atmosphere, reach the earth's surface and cause a worldwide increase in skin cancer. </para>

              <para>- The other matter concerns the targets that have been set for kangaroo exports. I understand that the United States of America will not make a decision until January in regard to kangaroo products that are listed as prohibited imports. Can we get an assurance from the Minister on whether targets have  been fixed or agreed to in collaboration with the States? If this is so, does it mean that if the United States lifted the present bans we could have a situation in which the targets for all the States would be boosted in anticipation of a bigger American market or would we wait until the end of the financial year to increase exports? I ask that question because of the number of people, myself included, who feel that if the tempo of culling is increased with organised shooting we may find that in addition to the three species which are in abundance in some areas we will rope in some of the less prolific species. That is the reason 1 ask that question. </para>

            <para>- I note the various points that have been raised. I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> for saying that he will put the various questions on the Notice Paper. The one of interest concerns the destruction of the ozone layer. I will provide a letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> who will be very interested in what the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has to say on this matter. In regard to kangaroo quotas, I can give the honourable senator an assurance that whatever the variation in the American situation, there will be no boost of the State targets purely to accommodate that American market. My understanding of the quotas that are put forward by the States is that they are set on a scientific basis and assessed by biologists. Over the years quotas have been set and, as far as I know, never been filled in any State. If there is an attraction to sell skins, the States may start to meet the quotas. I can give the honourable senator an asurance that there will be no boost in quotas unless a basis is put forward whereby the States claim that great difficulties and hazards are created by the numbers of kangaroos at the moment. </para>

Since that date I have had further representations from dairy farmers and dairy farmer organisations in Victoria expressing deep concern about what is happening in this regard. Doubtless the Minister for Primary Industry knows the situation. Asia Dairy Industry Industries Ltd has been a long time child product of the Australian dairy industry. Millions of dollars have been fed back to the Australian dairy industry because of that enterprise which was established many years ago. Because of the silence of this government, dairy farmers right across Australia are deeply concerned about the future of this organisation. Has it gone broke? Is it going broke? What is going to happen to it? Has its money gone down the drain or can it expect some continuation of the return it has received in the past? Has the Minister any information at this stage that he can pass on to the dairy industry? </para>

            <para>- A further matter that has given some concern relates to reports in the Victorian Press in the last day or two concerning a guarantee given by the Federal Government and the Victorian Government in relation to Co-operative Farmers and Graziers Direct Meat Supply Ltd in Melbourne. We all recall that some time ago in this place the Government made an announcement and passed legislation to guarantee a loan of $4.5m to that organisation in Melbourne on the consideration that the Victorian State Government did likewise. The legislation was passed and we heard no more about it until some few months ago when it was apparent that the Government was applying pressure on that organisation to pay its debts or else. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It does appear that as a result of that pressure the Co-operative Farmers and Graziers Meat Supply was given a period in which there would be no claim on its funds from either the State Government or the Federal Government. The interesting development was at the Liberal Party Conference in Melbourne last week, when the Victorian State Minister for Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith,</inline> announced that the decision by the Victorian Government to guarantee $4.5m to that organisation was made on a political basis- the political basis being that because there was a forthcoming election, it was deemed wise for the Victorian State Government to give that guarantee. </para>

              <para>- I happened to have been active in a farming organisation in Victoria at the time that this co-operative was formed. In common with many farmers' co-operatives in Victoria, it was founded on the backs of the small producers. The graziers were not the sort of people to fund that kind of organistion. The Cooperative Farmers and Graziers Direct Meat Supply company of Victoria was founded by the battling farmers, the family farmers, not the Malcolm Frasers or the squattocracy. That is fairly typical of farmers' organisations in the State of Victoria. The interesting thing is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline></para>

It is also of interest that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer,</inline> his leader, denied that that was so. At the moment there is a fair amount of confusion in Victoria as to who is right. Apparently what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis</inline> is saying is that his State member, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Smith, the honourable member for Warrnambool and Minister of Agriculture in Victoria, is telling lies.

              <para>- I believe that what I said was that in my opinion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> was telling the truth. Just as an aside, let me add that the big battle that is going on in Victoria is caused by the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> is pushing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer</inline> for the leadership of the Victorian Liberal Party. I have had an assurance from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> in answer to a question which I asked within the last two or three days, that he did not make his decision in Cabinet at the Federal level on a political basis at all; that it was a straight-out monetary decision. I just hope that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> who comes from Warrnambool and the Wannon area, also made his decision on purely monetary considerations; that he was not concerned with State politics in Victoria. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>Another matter that has been of some concern to me- it falls within the portfolio of the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)-</inline> relates to the large degree of access to our fishing grounds that foreign nations have been able to extract from Australia as a result of various agreements drawn up by the Government. The most recently signed has been the Australia-Japan Fishing Agreement. Some time ago the nations of the world got together and talked about the law of the sea. As a result, enabling legislation has been brought down in various countries saying that nations should be able to mine and exploit the seabed for up to 200 miles from their shore line. The activities of the fishing fleets of such major countries as Japan and the Soviet Union, which previously exploited the ocean wherever and whenever they wanted to, virtually around the globe, have now been restricted. As a result of the legislation, they now have to apply to any country before they can get access to that 200-mile fishing zone. </para><para>One of the great problems, as I have seen this matter develop over the last 12 months under this Government, has been the denudation of Australian fishing resources by foreign powers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lewis</inline> knows well that in Bass Strait last year a number of Japanese trawlers were squid fishing. He possibly knows, if he has his ear to the ground, that along the coast of Victoria, Victorian fishermen are very upset about this matter. I think they would all agree that they have not had the wherewithal - financially and physically- to go out and catch squid. They have been very distressed by the number of vessels that have come in to take the catch. Again I received a great many representations from fishermen along the coast of Victoria once they became aware of this new agreement which this Government has signed relevant to tuna longline fishing. But the fact that up to 350 Japanese vessels are to be allowed onto the coast of Australia is seen by traditional fishermen as a dire threat to the future of the fishing industry in this country and to its long term viability. I rise simply to protest in a small way on their behalf. </para><para>As I interjected to my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> in the last week or two when he was speaking on this matter, I think 350 vessels off the coast of Australia is equivalent to an armada. It is interesting to note that a recent Press report from New Zealand purported to show that, after the first year of squid fishing there, the second years' catch was down astronomically. Two theories arise from that finding. Either the last year that was reported on was a bad year for squid fishing or as a result of the first year's massive catch the availability of squid was down in the second year. I do not know; and I do not know whether anybody does. But it is a matter to which the Government should give some consideration. The most interesting aspect is that originally there was a great deal of publicity about joint feasibility fishing studies. That is what was talked about; that is what was discussed; that is what the agreements were termed. I ask the Minister whether this latest development- the Australia-Japanese Fishing Agreement- is still considered to be a feasibility study or whether it is purely an exploitative move. </para></speech>

              <para>- I will tell the honourable senator what I supported when the legislation went through the Parliament. I am pleased he asked that question because I am coming to that matter. When the Co-operative Farmers and Graziers Meat Supply Bill was railroaded through this Parliament in April of last year, honourable senators on the Government side said that it was a very loosely knit piece of legislation. At that time I spoke to the Bill. For the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Archer,</inline> I shall remind him of what I said on that occasion, as well as what another Opposition senator said. I said: </para>

            <para>I think on the three occasions when he has risen to speak he has said that the reason for hurrying this legislation through the Parliament is to protect the shareholders of the company. What I am concerned about is the protection of the shareholders of the nation. They are going to become shareholders in this company to the tune of $4. 5m from the time this Bill receives royal assent. If we take in the Victorian contribution there will be another $4.5 m. </para>
            <para>So in total the taxpayers of Australia are going to be shareholders in the company to the tune of $9m. They are just as much involved as the 10,000 shareholders of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> spoke. The taxpayers are the people for whom I am expressing concern. Now that we have on the record from various speakers that this Bill is not as tight as we would like it to be, if the company is not a success in the years to come we can come back to this place, turn up the record and remind the Government of the problems that were associated with the Bill and that those problems probably could have been avoided if the Government had not been in such a hurry to rush the Bill through the Parliament. </para>

              <para>- That is the very thing that I am doing. I am referring to primary industry and the legislation that went through this Parliament to help primary producers. The legislation was so loose that the primary producers, the shareholders of this company in Victoria, now find themselves sucked in. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> has admitted, the legislation was a gimmick and an exercise to woo the votes of the small farmers in Victoria. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> is on record as saying this.

            <para>- I do not think that the matters that have been raised require much in the way of response. I think that the two honourable senators who spoke about the Co-Operative Farmers and Graziers Direct Meat Supply Ltd recognise that so far as the estimates in the Federal area are concerned there is no argument whatsoever, and that the $4,500,000 that was guaranteed was guaranteed on a proper basis. I was attracted to the comments made by the honourable senators, as they both have a farming background. Often in this chamber we have heard them suggesting that it is only the wealthy farmers who are supported by the Government. I was delighted to hear the contribution that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> that Farmers and Graziers was composed of battling farmers and that it was the Liberal-Country Party Government federally that had gone in to support those battling farmers. That sort of comment should be carried abroad so that the farmers know of the attitude of the Federal Government towards support for them. I think the honourable senator from South Australia may have had the most- </para>

              <para>- I was wanting to give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> due credit at this hour of night for indicating that the small farmers and small taxpayers somehow or other have found themselves sucked in. I think that was the comment he made. In Victoria, in the area bordering on South Australia, a number of farmers who really got sucked in during the period 1972-73 changed their minds very quickly. We know that the words <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> used today about their getting sucked in are not particularly appropriate. We do know that Federal Government has acted very properly in this matter. Coming to the direct question of foreign fisheries one must look at the Japan-Australia agreement relating to fishing. I think that one aspect of the matter that passes many people when they consider this matter is that we are living in a new era. Perhaps some of us who are reaching more advanced years recognise that over many years there has been basically a 3-mile territorial limit of responsibility for the adjacent State. </para>

              <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> glanced at it every now and again it would probably do him a lot of good. We then moved to a situation where the adjacent State gained control over the 12-mile territorial limit and the local fishermen had some say through their government about the living resources up to 12 miles out to sea. Complaints have come in now because this Government has negotiated to receive $ 1.25m for a year's operation by a number of fishing vessels. Prior to this agreement coming in nobody knew what was happening in the 200-mile limit. I think we ought to acknowledge that in this instance, when someone says that the agreements made by this government with overseas governments are not correct, he needs to take into account the very basis of what has been brought about by these agreements. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> has heard the Minister who represents the Minister for Primary Industry in this place say- I have heard other Ministers say this-that there is a feasibility arrangement. It will relate to the catch that will be taken by the foreign vessels when they are in our 200-mile limit zone. That is occurring off Tasmania and south-east Australia. My understanding is that it is occurring off the southern area of Australia. </para>

          <para>I think I answered a question the other day that indicated that negotiations were going on with other countries for agreements in regard to other areas of our 200-mile limit where Australia does not have the capacity to exploit nor, at the present time, is it able to understand the resources or the renewable resources of those areas. I think we can be fairly satisfied that the Government has negotiated a sound agreement for this country in the arrangements that have been brought about. On 7 November 1979 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> asked me the following question: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I am not aware of any such Press reports which in any event would be quite inaccurate. The Government is not opposed in principle to the Fund 'revolving', but wool-growers have not yet presented detailed proposals for a revolving arrangement. The Government does not propose to take action on the matter without considering firm and detailed proposals which I understand are presently being prepared by wool-growers. </para>
            <para>Under the several Wool Tax Acts, and with the agreement of wool-growers, a levy of S per cent on wool sales is collected and paid into the Market Support Fund. The levy is an integral element of the wool reserve price arrangements. Decisions on the levy are taken in the context of decisions on the reserve price arrangements, and after consultations with wool-growers. </para>
            <para>The Wool Industry Act provides that in the event of the reserve price scheme being terminated, moneys standing to the credit of the Market Support Fund shall be applied for such purposes in relation to the wool industry as is determined by the Minister for Primary Industry with the approval in writing of the Australian Wool Industry Conference. </para>

            <para>- There is just one matter I want to clear up. I think that the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> might have misheard me. I did not say, or did not intend to say, that the small farmers in Victoria were sucked in by either the Federal or the State governments. What I intended to say was that they were sucked in by a person by the name of Smart. He is the same person who sucked in the Federal Government when it set up the turtle farming scheme. The Government should have been warned that, having once had the experience of this type of person, before this legislation was agreed to it should have had a thorough investigation of the whole set-up and brought in very tight legislation. I was not the only person who said that. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> said the same thing. It is regrettable that the company is in trouble. It is regrettable that not only the shareholders but also the taxpayers will suffer because of this arrangement. It is further regrettable- that is the point I was making- that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> has publicly stated that the Victorian Government entered into the agreement so hurriedly because of a pending Victorian election and the State Government had to use the matter as an election ploy. </para>

              <para>- I would have thought, seeing the way the McDonald Cup has been going recently, that Tasmania certainly should have at least one member on the council. It is just not good enough to have something like that being done by a Commonealth government. I do not care about the Territories. They are too small for me. As well as that, when a National Australia Day Committee was named on 1 1 September 1 979 the same kind of thing happened. Once again there was not a Tasmanian on it. </para>

            <para>- The Department of the Capital Territory includes the National Capital Development Commission. I want to make some comments about questions which I asked in the original Estimates Committee hearings and for which answers were promised. The answers do not appear to be entirely adequate. The original contract price for the High Court building was $18m. This has now risen above $41m. Part of that variation of $23m is due, of course, to general cost increases incurred from the time the contract was let to the present time, and as I understand it the $4 1 m is the estimate of cost as at 3 1 March 1 979. Given that building costs will continue to rise, the final completion cost will be something greater -than that. As at the end of March the discrepancy between the original contract price and the estimated cost to that stage was $23m. A good deal of that has been due to general cost increases, but so far as I could determine during the original Estimates Committee hearing, something like Slim qf that cost increase, was due to variations in the design. </para>

              <para>- By the client department, or by the client department's unofficial master, who appears to have been the Chief Justice. The alterations amount to something like $llm. I received yesterday a letter from the NCDC. I cannot imagine why it has taken so long to reach me. The letter lists five specific items or modifications to what one might call the design, which total just over $4m. That does not account for more than about 37 per cent of the total increase in the cost which can be attributed to changes in the design. Where the other $7m has gone to, so far as I am able to tell there is no clue. I quote part of the last paragraph of this letter: </para>

            <para>When this contract was let it was recognised from the outset that during construction there would be a progressive development of design detail, particularly in relation to the internal layout of the building and internal finishes. Design documentation has accordingly required close collaboration between the architects, the builder, the NCDC, which is the construction authority, and the user, represented in the main  by the Chief Justice, and the Attorney-General's Department. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The point to which I wish to draw particular attention is why the Chief Justice- designated or regarded as the chief user- I think that is the term- especially since one would not expect that the present Chief Justice would be around for much longer than the High Court; one would certainly hope not, anyway. But why is this man given some special authority to make design changes to the building? If a new school is being built, is the headmaster consulted as to what design changes he would like to have made? If a new hospital is being built, is the doctor or the chief administrative officer given carte blanche to commit millions of dollars of additional expenditure to modify that building according to his whim, his self-indulgence, or to appease his delusions of grandeur? It is scarcely conceivable that a chief justice who has been exposed to criticism from such a variety of sources as has the present Chief Justice should still occupy this position. </para>

              <para>- As I understand it, the procedures in this House are governed by the Standing Orders. The Standing Orders confer no protection on any justice, let alone one like this Chief Justice. No judge has ever been exposed to so much criticism from such a variety of sources for so many reasons as has Garfield Barwick. His extravagance, his delusions of grandeur, the quality of his judgments - </para>

              <para>- My explanation is that I do not believe I have breached the Standing Orders in making comments about the Chief Justice which I am perfectly entitled to make under the Standing Orders. I know there has been a precedent in this place for a very long time that members of the judiciary are not criticised. However, so far as I have been able to determine, or so far as anybody has been able to point out tonight, that precedent is hot reinforced by any authority of the Standing Orders. Therefore, I claim that I am perfectly entitled to have made the comments about the Chief Justice that I have made. </para>

          <para>This matter has been partly tested in the Senate before, I think towards the end of the last sitting. At that time I requested that the matter receive the attention of the Standing Orders Committee so as to clarify whether there was any constraint, special protection or restriction on the comments that may be made about members of the judiciary, including the Chief Justice. That has not been done, although there has been almost a full session in which to do it. So I submit that there is nothing in the Standing Orders of the Senate which provides any special privilege or protection for the Chief Justice or which says that he or any other justice should be treated in any way different from any other citizen. </para>

            <para>-Honourable senators, the practices of this place, together with the Standing Orders, are the means by which we can have a parliament which operates. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> are suggesting that all the procedures of the centuries and the procedures of this place since Federal Parliament was established should be pushed aside. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> I refer you to the recent words of Lord Hailsham, who said that no constitution could work unless there be a determined and desirous attitude in the background to make it work. By the same token, no Parliament can work unless there be an acknowledgement of past practice, together with an observation of the Standing Orders, which have been set out for no other purpose than to ensure the freedom of honourable senators to express themselves in parliamentary language and to enable democracy to operate in our parliamentary system. On a previous occasion you have defied me because I could not refer to a specific Standing Order. I will most certainly direct things from this chair, with a full appreciation of what has been established over many years to give us our system of democratic government, which is based on the Westminster system. It has always been the practice that members of the judiciary are not criticised and reflections not made upon them during general debate. That is all I have to say to you. </para>

              <para>- I see that you have many helpers in the chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> but I have no doubt you are capable of answering my question. Or is it because he is allegedly in breach of a Standing Order? If it is because he is in breach of a Standing Order, that is understandable. If he has been named because of remarks he made about the judiciary, I ask you to think seriously before any action is taken. I also say that everybody in this country knows that what is happening in the construction of a certain building here in Canberra is a national scandal. Millions of dollars of taxpayers' money is being poured into that building. I am not reflecting on any individual; I am simply saying that it is a national scandal and everybody knows it- everybody who takes any interest in it, everybody who has listened to the debates that have taken place in this chamber and heard the matters that have been raised about the construction of this monstrosity on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin. Some $40m of taxpayers' money is being poured into the building for the satisfaction of some individual or individuals, whom I am not naming. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> is to be thrown out of this chamber because he made that point, it will be a sad day for the Senate. If he is put out because you rule that he is in contravention of a Standing Order, that is a different matter and I personally would accept it. I ask you to indicate on what grounds <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> has been named. </para>

            <para>- I wish to say something about the High Court building that is being constructed across the road and which we find objectionable. I very much doubt whether it comes within the estimates for the Department of the Capital Territory. Possibly it comes within the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department. Of course, it was for making remarks in relation to that building that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> was evicted from this chamber. If, in the first place, he had no right to discuss that matter, obviously he was wrongly evicted because when he raised the matter he should have been stopped from debating it. In that event, he was evicted from the chamber not so much because of what he said but because he was allowed to go on speaking about the matter when he was out of order. That shows the importance of solid, sound rulings being given in this place. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I agree that to call the Chief Justice a dirty crook, even if it is an expression of the opinion of the honourable senator making that statement, is unparliamentary and justifies some action being taken against the honourable senator concerned. But I put it to honourable senators, especially to Go~ernment honourable senators, that the scene we have just witnessed is not desirable. We should do everything possible to avoid a recurrence. I am inclined to think- the Government must recognise this-that there must be upsets at this hour in the proceedings of this chamber. Therefore, I ask the Government to consider the suggestion that we should keep reasonable hours so that tempers will not be frayed, emotions will not be aroused and we can have reasonable debate. It was planned that the session would run for four weeks in November; it has been shortened by a week. Whilst various reasons for its being shortened were given, I ask now whether any difficulty would have been created by our sitting for another week? Had we decided to do so, it might have avoided repetitions of what has occurred tonight, which we will see from time to time now. </para>
          <para>If anyone will benefit from what happened tonight, it will be <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> who will not have to sit up until all hours of the morning from now on. Unfortunately, it is too late for me to get a week's expulsion now. Even if I got a day's expulsion, I would still have to come back on Friday, unless I could get expelled tomorrow and again on Friday. But honourable senators can see how ridiculous the whole thing is. We are trying to legislate by exhaustion. Tempers are becoming frayed and we are not doing justice to the job we have been appointed to do. </para>

        <para class="block">Again, ASIO has been remiss. One would have thought that if ASIO were all that concerned about the safety of the Chief Justice or whoever may reside in that edifice, it would have been in on the ground floor when the plans were drawn up and would have made the appropriate recommendations or whatever then. But no, ASIO waits until hundreds of thousands of tons of concrete have been poured in the edifice and then moves in and says it is not good enough. So the Australian taxpayer cops another bill for $150,000. </para>
        <para>I have only one question to ask the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> and I hope I can get an answer. I am informed that after the toilet bowls were placed in the edifice, at the instruction of the Chief Justice, they were removed because they were not good enough, big enough or whatever; I do not know. I am serious about this. I am reliably informed that the toilet bowls throughout that place, having been installed, instructions were received from someone on high, whom I believe to be the Chief Justice, to remove them because they were not the right design or the right quality. I ask what additional cost that has been to the Australian taxpayers. </para>

            <para>- I take the opportunity in the consideration of the estimates for the Department of the Capital Territory to refer to a statement made yesterday by the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott).</inline> The statement was responded to in the House of Representatives by the  Deputy Chairman  of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry,</inline> and the shadow Minister for the Capital Territory, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Innes.</inline> It relates to the Committee's report on planning procedures in the Territory. I point out that I am referring to this statement after having consulted with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt),</inline> the Opposition Whip and my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan.</inline> The Minister reported to Parliament approximately one month ago, which was at the end of the six month period which has now been set down for ministerial replies to such reports, that he had not at the time been able to conclude consideration of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory but indicated that he hoped to provide his response by the conclusion of this parliamentary sitting period. He has now done so. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I want to make a number of points about the Government's response. Of the 25 recommendations referred to in the Minister's statement 20 have been accepted by the Government and five have not. I will refer first of all to those that have not been adopted. The Committee recommended that betterment charges in relation to redevelopment should amount to 100 per cent of the increment. The Government has indicated, in the Minister's statement, that it has not accepted that recommendation and will retain the 50 per cent charge which now exists. The Minister points out that the Joint Committee's recommendation did not take into account the high risk to investors in most redevelopment proposals. It was felt that this would create disincentives at a time when Canberra is in need of development incentives. </para>
          <para>The Committee also recommended amendment to section 9a of the City Area Leases Ordinance. The Government has also not supported that proposal. The main reason was that the Committee had in fact suggested substantial fines as a penalty for offences under section 9a. The Minister has pointed out in his statement that in fact the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances dealt with this matter previously. He points out that acceptance of the recommendation of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory would again bring this issue under criminal jurisdiction and lead to possible further consideration by the </para>
          <para class="block">Senate Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. The Minister makes a point also that the legislation, as it now stands, is, in the Government's view, working effectively and that unless problems arise in the future no change will be proposed to section 9a. </para>
          <para>Two other related recommendations are not accepted. The first is that the Minister for the Capital Territory should be the final arbiter in the preparation of planning in the Territory and that this should be set out in legislation. The second recommendation was that that same legislation should provide that the Minister be responsible for securing consistency and continuity in the framing and execution of a comprehensive policy with respect to the use and development of all land in the Territory in accordance with the structure and development plans which had been proposed by the Committee. Those are probably the two most substantive recommendations of the Joint Committee that have not been adopted by the Government. </para>
          <para>I emphasise that I am making these comments very much in a preliminary way. The statement was made available only yesterday. I am not speaking formally as  Chairman  of the Joint Committee. The Committee has not had a chance to meet and discuss these decisions. I am speaking in my capacity as a private member. I make the point that these are the two major substantive recommendations made by the Committee that the Government has not accepted. I have to express some disappointment that they have not been accepted but I shall refer to that in a moment in the context of the recommendations that have been accepted. </para>
          <para>The fifth recommendation that was not accepted related to the establishment of community councils in the Territory as a focal point for discussion of planning and other decisions within the Territory. Whilst the Government accepted the recommendation that such community councils should be established, it did not support the recommendation that the Minister for the Capital Territory should propose geographic areas, the population that ought to be covered by such councils and the functions to be administered by them. In one sense one can express satisfaction that the concept has been accepted but there is little uncertainty as to what the decision means with respect to the establishment of the councils. That is something on which the Committee might wish to have some clarification. It was suggested in the statement by the Minister that perhaps the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly should have some direct role or that otherwise it should be done on the initiative of the community without the Government's becoming involved. </para>
          <para>I have referred particularly to the five recommendations which the Government has not supported and which it has indicated it does not intend to implement. Twenty of the recommendations were supported. I referred a moment ago to the fact that two of the recommendations relating to ministerial authority with respect to final planning decisions were rejected and that they were the two most substantive recommendations by the Committee which have not been supported by the Government. In the context of many of the recommendations that have been accepted, that those five have not been supported by the Government, while disappointing to the Committee, is not, perhaps, as much a problem as it might at first appear. Amongst the recommendations that have been accepted by the Government are recommendations providing for much more extensive public participation in the planning process in a more orderly fashion than has occurred in the past. I think that this, in itself, will lead to greater accountability to the community, particularly on the part of the National Capital Development Commission. Another recommendation that has been accepted by the Government in principle is the recommendation that there should be a land use tribunal for appeals against a range of planning decisions made in the Territory. My understanding is that the Government is considering whether the land use tribunal will be set up in its own right as the Committee recommended or established as an adjunct to or part of the system of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, I understand that the tribunal will certainly be set up. Again, this will give the community and the individual citizen a greater capacity to question planning judgments and will thereby ensure that planning authorities are more responsive and accountable to the community. In addition, the community council concept, if proceeded with and if there is sufficient interest in the community or through the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, could well lead to a more effective community participation in the decision-making process. </para>
          <para>The Government has also accepted recommendations thai regional planning be more effectively examined and brought into operation. I am sure that the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory will welcome those decisions. In general, I am pleased that the Minister has been able to get these matters settled during this parliamentary sitting period although it is very late in the sitting. It is pleasing that 20 of the 25 major recommendations of the Committee, or 80 per cent, have been adopted. Of the five that have not been supported by the Government, two in particular can be considered substantive. The other recommendations have not been supported for reasons that have been clearly stated and on which anyone would have to acknowledge that there is some substance. Overall, while I have no doubt there will be differing opinions amongst members of the Committee, I think there will be general satisfaction that a large number of the recommendations has been accepted. I have no doubt that they will have a very important impact on the future of planning procedures and the right of citizens in this Territory to participate in those planning activities in the process of preparing structure and development plans for the Territory. </para>
          <para>One final point I wish to make is that, as I understand is customary, the Government has made its decision on this Committee report. I expect it may be that the Committee will want to meet formally to have a look at these proposals by the Government. It may well be that as a committee we will want to discuss these matters with the Minister, particularly those two matters I have referred to as the more substantive recommendations that have not been supported by the Government. We may want to raise them again and ask that they be reconsidered. I understand that other members of the Committee in the House of Representatives tonight have expressed some greater disappointment than I have felt that some of these matters have not been accepted. I assume that the Government would have no objection to the Committee's putting some of these matters back to the Government for further consideration if it were felt by the Committee that that was warranted. </para>

            <para>-I am rather intrigued by the fact that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> asked a series of questions he appeared to receive no answers. During the debate on the Group A of departments today I asked fairly serious questions to which I did not receive any reply. I understand that the Minister at the table at that time stayed in his chair and I am informed by my colleagues that he spent most of the afternoon reading <inline font-style="italic">The Bulletin.</inline> In the old days when the Committee of the Whole discussed the Appropriation Bills Ministers and their advisers went to a great deal of trouble to find information on questions that were raised by honourable senators on both sides of the Chamber. Ultimately information was made available and frequently the various sections of the appropriations were held up until that information became available. We are going to be in a serious situation if we try to ram these Bills through the Senate some time between now and 7 a.m. because there will be questions asked dealing with millions of dollars which Ministers are incapable of answering or incapable of getting information on. Alternatively, they have brought along the wrong advisers who do not know what is happening in their departments. I cast no reflection on the public servants. The Parliament is being treated with contempt if this sort of situation continues. Questions were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> in relation to the changing of toilet seats in the new High Court buildings. For prices like that they could be mink covered seats. I am also told that in the private bathroom of the Chief Justice most of the plumbing was pulled out because he wanted gold plated taps put over his private wash hand basin. We want to know whether these things are true. If this amount of money has been set out in a document obviously there has been an extensive amount of wasted taxpayers' money in building a palatial establishment that is totally unnecessary. This has been done at the behest of one man. If the Minister responsible is not able to stand up to that person and ensure that these millions of dollars are not wasted, there ought to be an explanation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">An honourable senator was thrown out of this chamber tonight because he dared to issue a challenge. Quite frankly, I think he was right in issuing that challenge. I seriously ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> for your ruling as to whether we are going to be told, before these appropriations are passed, of the wastage of taxpayers' money which runs now to tens of millions of dollars and probably hundreds of millions of dollars not only on this section of the appropriations but also on other sections on which we have asked questions. The question I directed to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> this afternoon concerned charges that have been made- I have listed them in a question I have on the Notice Paper but I have failed to receive an answer- about a member of the legal profession. It is unjust to leave these matters hanging in the air. Ministers ought to be responsible for them. </para>
          <para>We have seen a lot of ministerial irresponsibility in this chamber over the last two or three weeks. Explanations have been given by Ministers and the next day they have had to change their minds because they found out they had been wrongly advised or, alternatively, had failed to absorb what they had been told. This has been going on right through this Government's term in office. Yet we are here again at 2 o'clock in the morning trying to stumble through legislation shrouded in secrecy. We cannot get replies to questions that we ask. We cannot get any replies to criticisms. This will look like a corrupt government putting through millions of dollars and it does not know where the money is going. What is going to happen about it? </para>

            <para>- I rise at this hour to make some comments on the estimates for the Department of the Capital Territory. At the outset I express regret that what has happened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> has in fact happened. I suggest it has happened because of the lateness of the hour at which this Committee of the Whole is sitting because the Government in its foolishness or because of its incompetence or through its own mismanagment has decided to keep the Senate estimates debate until the second last day of the session. At this stage it expects members of the Opposition to bow to every request it makes so that it can get its legislation through and close the Parliament at a time that suits it. It is incomprehensible to me that the Government should expect co-operation from members of the Opposition when very little justice is given to our colleagues- especially my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> who has now been removed from the chamber, not for one day but for one week- and when the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> sits mute after reasonable requests have been made for information. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The bitterness and division which have existed in this place since November 1975 have once again been firming up very strongly since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> became the Leader of the Government in the Senate. It is firming up because of the very late hours that he, as the Leader of the Government, has insisted on keeping the Parliament sitting. The hours that we have been keeping here in the last two or three weeks have not been put in in this place for a long time. This situation did not occur under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers;</inline> it did not occur under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> when the Australian Labor Party was in Government; it did not occur under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson; and it did not occur under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton.</inline> We have to go back to the early 1 960s to find an example of this sort of business going on. The Government ought to look at its programming if it expects any cooperation from the Opposition especially when members of the Opposition rise to make reasonable requests for information on matters about which not only they are concerned but also many of their constituents are expressing concern. I would have thought that the Minister, bearing in mind some of the comments that appear in the report of Senate Estimates Committee D, would be considering some of the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh, Senator Primmer</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keefe,</inline> and rather than throwing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> out of the chamber, I would have thought that it would have been much more prudent and sensible for the Government to have decided to give him some information concerning the matters he raised. </para>
          <para>Having made those comments I draw the attention of the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> and the Committee to the report of the Senate Estimates Committee D as it relates to the National Capital Development Commission. At page 3 some very important comments are made for the attention of the Committee of the whole. The report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Committee was told . . . that the NCDC is taking over some works projects formerly done by the Department of Housing and Construction and there seem to be no criteria which determine whether particular projects will be provided for in the NCDC program or in the Departments program. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I wish to emphasise the next paragraph: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This should be a matter of concern to the Senate, particularly as NCDC projects, unlike the Department's projects, are not subject to scrutiny by the Public Works Committee. The Committee recommends that the questions of whether the Commonwealth should continue to maintain two separate construction authorities and if so, whether there ought to be a better delineation of the responsibilities of those authorities, and better procedures for ensuring Parliamentary control of their activities, should be the subject of close consideration by the Government. The Government should consider these matters while preparing its response to the Report of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory on planning in the Territory. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Committee is saying that works that were previously the subject of control by the Department of Housing and Construction, and therefore the subject of scrutiny by the parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, are now likely to be handed over to the National Capital Development Commission. Under that proposal, those works would then not become the subject of scrutiny by the Public Works Committee. That is a pretty serious matter. While the Minister sits in the House and does not answer, remains mute in response to the questions that have been posed by my colleagues, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop, Senator Primmer, Senator Walsh</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe,</inline> and while there is a report of that nature drawn to the attention of the Committee of the Whole by the Senate Estimates Committee, it is my responsibility to rise at this early hour of the morningafter the Parliament has been sitting for well over 12 hours and after we have all been here for a period of 17 hours- and raise my voice in protest against the way in which the Government is conducting the affairs of this nation, and to seek sensible responses from the Minister to our questions. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline></para>

              <para>- In relation to the only comments that have been made in relation to the Department of the Capital Territory and any division in relation to construction work, I point out that there are two construction authorities. There is a division of responsibility in the Australian Capital Territory between the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of Housing and Construction. For building work outside the Australian Capital Territory, the Department of Housing and Construction is the Commonwealth's authority.

            <para>- The answer is obviously yes. When the honourable senator asked the question I think he would know that I would not be carrying with me nor would officers have with them information as to the costs in relation to those alterations, if what he suggests has occurred. That information would take a little time to gather. With the honourable senator's agreement, I certainly will seek that information for him and forward it to him I hope in the next few days. </para>

		    <para>WILDERNESS: A NEED FOR AIRSPACE CONTROLS</para>
			<para>From Mr Tim Lamble, Turramurra, N.S.W</para>
			<para>I have been a prolific user of the Kosciusko National Park for about 1 3 years, both as a committee member of Illawong Lodge and more particularly as a wilderness walker and ski tourer. I have visited the Park up to 14 times in one year and my involvement is probably best indicated by my production of the Mt Jagungal map. </para>
			<para>Some years ago, when the draft plan of Management was outlined to an annual meeting of the Kosciusko Huts Association, a question was asked about the control of aircraft flying over wilderness areas. The National Parks and Wildlife Service's representative replied that to his knowledge, the subject had not been thought of. The short discussion was generally in favour of the idea, though the Plan did not end up with an appropriate clause. </para>
			<para>A wilderness area must surely exist for some finite distance above the area which is defined on the ground. </para>
			<para>The purpose of this letter is to express my increasing concern about the use of aircraft over wilderness areas. To me a primary concept of wilderness is 'unmechanised man and nature . The use of machines within a wilderness, particularly motor driven transport, is a basic contradiction upon which I should not need to elaborate. One of the reasons why 4 wheel-drive and over-snow vehicles are prohibited from wilderness is the obvious interference they cause to people who have entered the area on foot, hopefully to avoid such things. It is hard to express the feelings of a walker or skitourer who has been out for a week, to have his recreation shattered by the unexpected arrival of the internal combustion engine. To be interfered with on more than one occasion in a week is not uncommon. </para>
			<para>I have, for instance, spend eight days skiing from Kiandra towards Kosciusko. We have experienced extremes of weather, we are at peace with the world and almost as one with nature as we plod up the Snowy River. The summit is to be ours today, for a short while as the sun sets. But wait: there is a drone in the distance, which is growing fast into a shriek. Suddenly its there, only 30 metres above our heads: Fills ground hugging on 'adar. These war machines weren't content with one trip, but they returned again and again. Do I need to go on? </para>
			<para>This invasion of the wilderness by aircraft is unfortunately not an isolated case and the problem is an increasing one. </para>
			<para>Surely the landing of troops by military helicopters on Watsons Crags for skiing lessons must be the most repulsive intrusion and danger to the concept of the wilderness since it was declared. </para>
			<para>There are four catagories of aircraft which I have experienced. </para>
			<list type="decimal-dotted">
          <item label="1.">
            <para>Light planes providing low-altitude joy rides, mostly over the Main Range between Mt Kosciusko and Mt Tate, though I have seen (and heard) flights around Mt Jagungal. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Major civilian</inline>jet services which fly high over the northern end of the Park. </para>

          <item label="3.">
            <para>Flights of military craft, both jets and helicopters. </para>

          <item label="4.">
            <para>Helicopters belonging to the National Parks Service. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
			<para>All categories provide a disturbance to a greater or lesser degree. By far the most objectionable of the four, is the third. Not only are the military the most noisy by both nature and numbers, the very connotations of their activities are completely alien to my conceptions of wilderness. I suspect that many (most?) wilderness users would agree. Severe controls should exist on their operations within the Park and most specifically in wilderness areas. I ask you, would you be happy for the army to hold a summer ground manoeuvre complete with trucks and maybe a few tanks in, say, the Mt Jagungal area? Their argument could easily be that alpine experience is needed for defence purposes! If your response is no, then surely this 'no ' should also extend to winter and to the low flying of aircraft. </para>
			<para>Following military use of wilderness airspace, low altitude joy flights are second on the list. Luckily, this operation impinges less on the environment when they are there, but they are there more often. They also tend to circle ski parties and this 'buzzing' only makes things worse. Their presence is alien to wilderness and arguments of commercial necessity for the operators surely don't hold water. I find them the least justifiable of the lot. If joy riders in 4 wheel-drives are excluded, then so should those in planes. </para>
			<para>As a principle, the Service's use of helicopters is also alien to wilderness. However I don't intend to debate here the question of necessity for the existence or preservation of wilderness. I can only express the hope that very close (closer than at present) supervision is kept in this quarter. </para>
			<para>Finally the operation of commercial jets currently offers only a minor intrusion to wilderness. The high altitude flown usually results merely in a vapour trail. This visual reminder I would prefer to be without but, while their frequency and flight paths remain as at present, only a small objection could be raised. A watch would be needed on any significant changes. </para>
			<para>Any legislation to control flying, would ideally ban all aircraft from sight and earshot of wilderness areas. However ideals are frequently not achieved. From the above discussion, it is clear that low altitude flying is the main factor in the breaking down of wilderness experience by aircraft. There is no scope for such activity on any but the most essential and minor scale for wilderness maintenance. The tolerance of wilderness users to high altitude flights would, no doubt, vary with the individual's acceptance of the numbers of both flights and flight paths. Present usage in this area would probably be acceptable to most. </para>
			<para>I urge conservation groups to consider working towards the establishment of airspace limitations over wilderness areas. </para>

              <para>- If honourable senators look at that list they will see that the Department has three F28 aircraft which fly a total of 1865 hours. That is not enough to warrant having three of those aircraft. During the Estimates committee hearing we were told that they were going to fly some 3,000 hours in the coming year. Even that would not warrant having the three aircraft. Like the VIP fleet, it is time that some examination of all of the aircraft owned by the Department was looked at. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Once again I would like to mention the air navigation charges. I received a letter dated 16 November which states that in the year 1972-73 the costs of the Department were some $1 16m and revenue was only $58m. During the last year costs had risen to $243. 6m and revenue was just under $ 1 50m. This shows that in those years the revenue has gone up by 260 per cent while costs have almost doubled. So the Government is making some headway in its cost recovery plan for people who use the aircraft. I am still worried because we have to pick up another $20m in the next two years. </para>

              <para>-I do not know that we will ever catch up. It seems as if this is something that consecutive governments have tried to do. I am not sure that it is something that we should really try to do. In my opinion we should not aim for a 100 per cent recovery. The more we put up internal air fares the more people are going to opt to go overseas rather than visit beautiful places of Australia like Tasmania that are often left off the map. We must keep air fares in this country at a reasonable level. It is getting to the stage where people in Perth are complaining about the cost of coming to the eastern States. It is getting to the stage where people from Tasmania cannot really afford to go to Perth. With the cheaper air fares, and with a bit of planning, they can afford to go to a place like Singapore, which is a place where a lot of people would like to go. I am sure that those people would enjoy Perth much more if they went there. When they do travel abroad they fill their pockets with money. Instead of spending it in Australia they spend it overseas. It is time that these air navigation charges were looked at in an attempt to include some percentage of the costs that can be put down to national development. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Each year we spend millions of dollars on the railroads and on the roads. In those instances the users are not required to pay. I wonder why the airline industry has been singled out. The whole matter of air navigation charges needs sensible re-examination. Heavy costs have been imposed in a simplistic way and it shows an appalling lack of thought. The airline transport industry in Australia is perhaps our most efficient form of transport and it plays a vital part in overcoming the problems of distance in this vast continent. People in all areas of the country benefit from those who travel. To insist on full recovery only from those people who pay the air fare is not a sensible thing to aim for. </para>
          <para>Since I have been a member of this place I have been trying to get an overall examination of air navigation charges. I am still pressing for that course to be followed. Such action would be sensible and practical on the part of the Government. If we bring the headquarters of the Department of Transport to Canberra it will be something that will add to the costs of running the Department. Since it has been decided that that should be done a lot of expertise has been lost to the Department. Some very diligent people who have worked for a long time within the Department of Civil Aviation have decided not to leave their cities to come to the unreal city of Canberra. </para>
          <para>I think that in Canberra one tends to get out of touch the longer one stays here. I am not referring just to members of Parliament. The longer one stays here the more unreal one's attitude becomes. It is no good officers of a department making short trips to examine an area. I suggest that that is not enough to enable them to learn all that they would learn if they lived in the reality of places like Melbourne and Sydney. I do not agree with the trend of bringing departments to Canberra. I think that the matter of aviation in this country is still important enough for the Government to consider having a department of civil aviation quite separate from the Department of Transport. </para>
          <para>I have a couple of specific questions relating to the estimates. I would still like to know why it is not possible for the Department of Transport to be able to work out the actual revenue that is being received on sectors such as Melbourne to Sydney. It should have a fair idea of the return it receives from sectors around the country. With regard to the expenditure for pilot training referred to on pages 3 1 and 32 of the supplementary notes we were given, the sending of officers overseas to be trained does not seem sensible to me. The figures supplied to us show that it is in fact cheaper. I believe that is because the cost of hiring aircraft in Australia involves the cost of fuel which carries a pretty hefty Government tax. If that Government tax were waived when the aircraft was used in the training of departmental people I think costs in this country would be much more comparable with those in America. I was told that the airlines here cannot supply aircraft for training because they are using them all the time for training their pilots. I do not know how recently inquiries have been made on that matter but I have heard that at least one of the airlines could have aircraft available. I do not have any other matters to raise with regard to this section of the estimates. I can find a few if honourable senators would like. I actually could. But I am cutting my speech short. I have another speech to make in a few moments. </para>

            <para>- I have two matters to raise. One concerns the Stuart Highway and the other the requirement put forward by Trans Australia Airlines about the Airbus aircraft. Before I raise those matters I want to support what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland said. It seems to me that what is happening tonight is extraordinary in regard to the history of this Senate. I cannot remember a time when we have been required to deal with matters such as these in the early hours of the morning and in the way in which we are dealing with them. I think it is improper. I can remember the days when under various leaders of the government we dealt with these matters over a number of days in daylight hours. That was more satisfactory. We had more occasion to examine and test the appropriations and expenditure of the government. In my opinion it is time for the Opposition to examine whether it now supports the Estimates committees. Over the years I have been a supporter of the program of Estimates committees despite the fact that many of my colleagues strongly oppose it. </para>

              <para>- Yes; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has been one of those people in the Labor Party opposition who has opposed the propositions that have been advanced. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> other people and I have said that the Estimates committees have provided an avenue by which members can more satisfactorily examine the expenditure of the Government and the efficiency of the departments. But after tonight I have reached the opinion that the Opposition ought to re-examine its attitude towards the Estimates committees. I know that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> tonight is also most disturbed with the position we are reaching. It is most unsatisfactory for us to try to examine important matters in circumstances such as these which occasion the sorts of things which have happened tonight.

          <para>As honourable senators on the other side know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline> the Minister for Transport, recently visited Coober Pedy and reported on a new position regarding the Stuart Highway. Honourable senators recall that in this place we have debated whether there should be a special funding to make sure that the Stuart Highway is completed within a reasonable time. That proposition was supported by all parties in the Parliament. It was supported by a transport organisation in South Australia, the previous South Australian Government and also by the local authorities in Alice Springs. We could not at any stage get agreement for special funding. Honourable senators will recall that in this place I moved a motion proposing that there be special funding. Since then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline> with the present State Government, has now decided on a target to complete the sealing of the Stuart Highway within seven years. I suppose that is a good accomplishment. Senators Jessop and Kilgariff and I attended a meeting at Coober Pedy at which that accomplishment was reported to the people. I suppose that is an important reform. </para>
          <para>In my opinion it was not made clear in the Minister's speech whether he would at any stage provide special funds. There has been no statement in the Parliament but there has been a statement issued publicly by the Minister and a statement made in our presence at Coober Pedy but there has been no report to the Parliament by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> as to what the agreement was between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wilson,</inline> the Minister of Transport in South Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon.</inline> I think that a report ought to be made. Before the Parliament rises I hope that a statement will be made in the Parliament by the Minister as to the substance of the agreement between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wilson.</inline> I interpreted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon's</inline> statement at the meeting at Coober Pedy to indicate that at some stage it may be possible to get special funding. We all now know that the estimate for roadworks was $66m, but it was stated during many of the inquiries we made that the job would cost $80m. Important statements have been made by the previous State Government, the present State Government and the Minister.

The second thing to which I want to refer, which comes into this area and also into the area of productivity, is the intention by Trans-Australia Airlines, which I understand has been approved by the Minister, to place some options on the purchase of the Airbus, as a result of which the Boeing people have come to Australia and in my opinion have threatened that they will withdraw a number of co-partnerships which are presently being performed by the various Government factories and the Hawker-Siddeley factories in Australia, projects which are currently worth between $10m and $20m. I understand those to be statements which represent a threat towards TAA, that if it purchases the Airbus, Boeing will withdraw the present projects, the Australian industry participation projects at the Government factory and another private factory associated with transport and defence. </para>

              <para>- There have been some qualifications and they have said that they would review it. But my point tonight is that it is time for the Government to indicate to what extent Boeing has told the Government about these things and whether or not there is a threat. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> knows, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is anxious to see that there should be a continuing work support for the defence factories and for the private factories which do that work. It would be sad to think that an outside company now decided to withdraw some of that work and reduce the work load, and I hope that the Government is able to make some announcements about those matters. I hope that the Minister might possibly elucidate tonight some of the questions I have raised. </para>

            <para>- I should like to spend a moment or two referring to the Stuart Highway and another matter in respect to rail standardisation. I would also like to remind the Senate that the Estimates committee were formed to enable questions to be asked in that particular forum. What we are dealing with here tonight is an assessment of the various departments, and thus give senators an opportunity to make a short statement or a short speech on matters of special interest. Since we had our Estimates Committee meeting, the announcement to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> referred was made at Coober Pedy in the presence of myself, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> the member for Grey, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wallis,</inline> and the member for the Northern Territory, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Calder.</inline> I was pleased to see that a way had been found under the existing national highway policy for the State and Federal governments to come to some arrangement to enable this highway to be constructed by at least 1987. 1 think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> will recall that the Minister said that he was hoping, through persuasive eloquence, to convince the Treasury that perhaps more money should be made available for national highways in future, and if that should be the case the road may well be sealed before that time. I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> said that a statement should be made to clear up this matter in the Senate. I hope that the Minister will have some information on that. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The other matter to which I should like to refer very briefly is the urgency of continuing the standardised railway line from Adelaide to Crystal Brook in order to provide a standardised freight and passenger service from Alice Springs to Adelaide. The Minister will know that the Government has provided additional funds to enable the Tarcoola-Alice Springs line to be completed by October or November next year. It is very urgent for the Australian National Railways to be assured of funding next year to enable this very important link to Adelaide to be completed within the next four years. I understand that the ANR has presented a submission on this particular matter to the Government, and that the Government has had the submission for some time. Prior to that, a presentation of the submission was made by Government members of the Transport Committee and I understand that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> have been giving that consideration. I would just like to know what progress has been made with respect to the Crystal Brook-Adelaide standardised railway line program, and when a firm decision and a favourable announcement can be made. </para>

            <para>- I wish to address myself to the estimates for the Department of Transport, but before I do so I wish to join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> in objecting to the late hours to which this Parliament has been forced to sit. As I said, I think, last night, even if the Government decides to keep senators here, it has no right to keep public servants here, nor has it the right to keep the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> writers here. I understand that because of the sitting of the other place last night until 3 a.m., some of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporters were working until 3.40 this morning. We have some of them here in this chamber tonight, and it is now 2.35 a.m. That is the callousness which is shown by the Government for the people who have to maintain the functions of this Parliament. The Government stands condemned for it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>When the program was set down for the sittings of the Parliament this year we were given the understanding that the Parliament was to rise on 29 November. For some reasons which we have not had explained to us the Government is trying to force through the legislation this week. Of course, we can all guess why that is. Various public matters are blowing up for which the Government does not want to be answerable in the public forum. That is why it is keeping the Senate sitting tonight. </para>
          <para>I wish to confine my remarks now to the Stuart Highway, in support of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> has said. In the consideration of this very appropriation in this chamber last year he moved an amendment that a special fund be set up to allow the sealing of the Stuart Highway to go ahead. But of course we could not get the support of honourable senators opposite. One of the Government senators who have now spoken even made mention of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> has said that he hopes that he will get special funds from the Treasury. When we moved an amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) in this chamber last year, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> and his colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff-</inline> who will no doubt follow me in this debate- walked out of the chamber and would not vote. That is on the public record. On 25 October this year I put a question to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> as the Minister representing the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon).</inline> I said that he would be:  . . aware that the previous South Australian Labor Government had made repeated requests to the Federal Government for extra funds to upgrade the Stuart Highway in South Australia and that during the debate on the estimates for the Department of Transport in this chamber last year an amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> calling for extra funds . . . was defeated by Government senators. </para>

          <para class="block">That is the question I put. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> said that he would endeavour to get an answer from the Minister. I received that answer, I think,  today. It is dated 20 November. Today is 21 November. The Minister wrote: </para>

            <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline></para>
            <para>I refer to your recent Question Without Notice to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> concerning the Stuart Highway (National 87) in South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> has referred the Question to me for reply direct to you. </para>
            <para>The Commonwealth has for many years recognised the importance of National 87 as a major transport link between South Australia and the Northern Territory and had urged the previous South Australian Government to give a higher priority to complete its construction. However, the previous Government claimed that, because of financial constraints, together with construction difficulties peculiar to remote and arid areas, sealing of National 87 could not be completed in less than about ten years. </para>
            <para>It is not the policy of the Federal Government to make special road allocations outside the provisions of the States Grants (Roads) Act. The strategy adopted by the Commonwealth has been to apportion priorities to achieve a balanced development of a National Highways System taking into account both Commonwealth and State objectives. </para>
            <para>During discussions which I had recently with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wilson,</inline> South Australian Minister of Transport, we reached agreement on a program which will accelerate work on the Highway with the aim of completing the sealing by 1987. An announcement to this effect was made in a joint news release on 1 1 November, copy of which is attached. </para>
            <para>Up to 1978-79 minimal amounts of Commonwealth road grants had been allocated to National 87 by the previous South Australian Government, therefore, I was extremely pleased to approve in the 1979-80 National Highways program more than S4.3m for construction, as well as $ l.Sm for maintenance of this Highway. This construction rate will be maintained next financial year and with an increased emphasis on engineering survey and design work in the next two years, construction is expected to proceed more quickly in future years. </para>
            <para>I welcome the more realistic attitude taken by the new South Australian Government in recognising the importance of the Highway, the sealing of which is in both the South Australian and National interest. </para>

          <para class="block">What did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> want the previous Labor Government to do under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Virgo?</inline> Did he want him to cancel all of the works that I have cited, to spend all the money on the Stuart Highway and to leave the south-eastern freeway uncompleted? When we had a meeting last year in House of Representatives Committee Room No. 2 I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> if he was suggesting that, and I reminded him that under the Act he had the power to direct a State Minister to spend money in particular areas. Of course, he was not prepared to do that because he would then have had to carry the odium of having money spent on some roads but not on others. So let us not have this double talk that we get from honourable senators opposite and from the Minister, who says that he welcomes the more realistic attitude taken by the new South Australian Minister. He talked about the extra $4.3m that has been allocated this year for the Stuart Highway. I want to quote from an editorial that appeared in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> on Wednesday, 30 May, while the Labor Party was still in Government in South Australia. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The State Government plans to devote $4.3 m of its $ 16m share of Federal national highways construction grants in 1978-79 to work on the Stuart Highway, but it claims, with some justice, that more help is needed from Canberra to enable the job to be completed within a reasonable period. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That decision that 25 per cent of the Federal grant to the South Australian Government was to be spent on the Stuart Highway was taken back in May. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> wrote to me under yesterday's date enclosing a Press statement dated the 1 1th of this month.  His  letter referred to the magnificent gesture of making $4.3m available. This is just another exercise in trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the people who want the highway constructed. If it had not been for the efforts over the years of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wallis,</inline> the member for Grey, I am sure the highway would still not be even at the planning stage. I pay due credit to Laurie Wallis for his untiring efforts in trying to get that road sealed in his electorate. I know that on many occasions he has not been paid the courtesy by this Federal Government of being advised of or invited to take part in some of the inspections and meetings that have taken place in his area. He has been completely ignored, yet certain South Australian senators have rushed to the Press and made statements about what they are going to do. </para>
          <para>The proof of the pudding is in the eating. It is on record that the South Australian State Labor Government was prepared to spend the money on the highway, but of course it had to allot the proper priorities. I venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> should be the last person to say that all the projects <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Johinke</inline> mentioned should have been put aside and the money spent on the Stuart Highway. When we were in government we allocated the money in proper priority. A promise has been made that the road will cost $66m and will be completed by 1987. We will be watching with great interest to see what progress takes place on the road during the term of office of the Tonkin Government. The four South Australian Labor senators will watch with very great interest the progress that is made. Promises have been made in the past and they have been dishonoured. Promises were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair.</inline> They were made again at the meeting at Coober Pedy, when the Minister said that special funds would be set aside. Tonight <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> will seek extra funds from Treasury under the States Grants (Roads) Act. We will wait to see the outcome of all these promises. As happened with another piece of legislation that went through this Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop, Senator Cavanagh, Senator Elstob</inline> and I will be able to say that we will be back next year to remind the Government of those promises if the promised rate of progress on the Stuart Highway in South Australia has not eventuated. </para>

            <para>- Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman.</inline> I think it is reasonable that the debate should go from one side of the chamber to the other. Very briefly, I congratulate the Federal Government and the Australian National Railways for the work they are doing on the standard gauge line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. The line is well under way and will be in Alice Springs by next October, a year earlier than planned. The accelerated funding from the Federal Government will make it possible to bring about the completion of the project. I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Don</inline> Jessop in his bid to get the standard gauge line from Crystal Brook to Adelaide because this will be the completion of the overall project which, without a change of gauge from Alice Springs to Adelaide, will bring about the movement of stock and freight without a break; and I think that is a very good thing. As far as the road from Port Augusta to Alice Springs and now to the Northern Territory border is concerned, I congratulate the Federal Government and the South Australian Government for having made a very firm commitment to the completion of this project; and there is no doubt that we will see the completion of it over the next few years. In the next few weeks we will see the result of a survey being done by the Federal Government and the Northern Territory Government of the extension of the standard gauge line from Alice Springs to Darwin. I hope that the feasibility study will recommend that the corridor be protected and that a survey take place so that in the next few years, under this Federal Government, we will see the line completed from Port Augusta to Darwin. </para>

            <para>- I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> has taken charge of the Bill because the two Ministers previously in charge of it showed little interest in what was going on and were unable to answer any questions. One of them spent most of his period in the chamber reading the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> and the other spent most of the time asleep. At the moment he is still in that comatose state. Tonight we have not had the answers we ought to have had. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> I have never been a supporter of Senate Estimates committees because one way in which to conduct corrupt government is to have little committees sitting in cubby holes in the bowels of this House and to change the rooms at the last minute so that neither the Press nor the observers are able to find out where the committees are sitting. If they find the committees, frequently there is not sufficient seating accommodation for people to be able to observe the proceedings of the committees confortably </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Tonight in the Committee of the Whole we are doing something similar. One of the best ways to carry out corrupt government is to sit until these idiotic hours. It is now almost 3 a.m. People are totally tired and unable to carry on properly. They are unable to be proper legislators. The advisers have reached the stage of being totally tired and Ministers are lying down to go to sleep. It is totally unfair to consider legislation under these circumstances. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> was objecting a few moments ago to staff and officers being kept here until this idiotic hour, an honourable senator on the other side of the chamber interjected: 'You are causing it'. Of course we are causing it because the Government is making us sit at this hour in the morning in the hope that the Opposition will not continue to probe. This is one way it can carry out its corrupt type of government. I am saying now that the Government is totally dishonest. Earlier tonight <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> was suspended from the service of the Senate because he passed certain remarks about the Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick, that old, old man of Australian law. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> and I asked questions in this regard the Government could not find answers to them. I would like to know why it is not going to tell anybody. I would like to know why it is spending millions of dollars of taxpayers' money and suppressing and hiding the answers. That is what it amounts to. </para>
          <para>I want now to refer to the estimates for the Department of Transport. We are now pushing through the votes in Group E, which involve the expenditure of almost $ 1,000m, as though we are talking about a kid's pocket money. That illustrates how much importance this Government attaches to the expenditure of vast amounts of taxpayers' money. I asked a question in this place today regarding one of the charter companies operating on coastal surveillance which in another city in another House at approximately this time yesterday came under suspicion as being involved in drug running. The Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)-</inline> that famous Minister who does his ballet dance in this place every Thursday morning; and he will probably do it much more willingly later today- was unable to tell me. He said: 'It has nothing to do with the Department of Defence; the Department of Transport handles that'. That is how much importance this Government attaches to this aspect of coastal surveillance or security in this country. </para>
          <para>When the Opposition complained in recent years about the lack of surveillance, about spoilage of the Great Barrier Reef by Taiwanese removing clam meat, about all sorts of fish being taken on long-lines and the destruction of marine life, the Government came up with the bright idea of spending about $ 1,500m over three years but it decided not to use Royal Australian Air Force personnel or RAAF planes. The Government decided to let the work out to its friends as long as they could use something that would stay in the air long enough to do the job. I am saying that there is not proper supervision. Recently I was at the top end of Cape York and I met a gentleman. We got into a brief conversation. I asked him what he was doing there. He said: 'I am an observer on one of the surveillance planes'. I said: 'That is interesting. I saw the Nomad out at Jackey Jackey and I wondered what it was doing there. Who is your pilot and co-pilot?' He said: 'I have only been with them a few weeks. I have not got round to finding out what their surnames are. I know the christian name of one. I am not sure what the other one is'. There is a man who had been flying for weeks with two people but he did not even know the names of his fellow workers. When I asked him what his experience was, if he knew anything about aeroplanes, he said: 'No, I haven't got the faintest idea about aeroplanes; I wouldn't know what they looked like. I couldn't identify them anyway'. But he did have some experience in boats. Apparently he once worked on a tug in one of the major harbours in Australia. </para>
          <para>I am saying- and I am saying this very deliberately- that the people carrying out surveillance in the majority of cases, have had no training. They have not come under any sort of scrutiny. In fact, I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> who raised in this place some weeks ago the fact that the Government was hiring a firm of Hong Kong people to do one part of the coastal surveillance. If there is no supervision, we will not know what is going on. If this company that has been named in another place in another State is in fact engaged in drug running, it serves the Government right, but the Government owes more than that to the Australian people. </para>
          <para>The far north of our nation has been described as the drug tunnel of Australia; and that is dead right. There are corrupt police, corrupt politicians and corrupt business people. They are all indulging in these activities. I hope that the Williams royal commission, if it ever gets to sit in Queensland, will drag out some of the corruption that is going on. This Government, directly or indirectly, is encouraging that sort of corruption. Its Ministers are encouraging it by not being prepared to answer questions in this place when we ask them. </para>
          <para>The patrol boats have not been able to do the job of keeping foreign shipping out of our waters. It was bad enough before with the limited coastal area. It is even worse now with a 200-mile limit. It is a well known fact that the Taiwanese in particular will send their oldest and broken down ship in to catch the first clam, but sitting on the other side of the reef are a dozen fast-moving ships. By the time the signal gets in and the one patrol boat in the area reaches the vessel the ships are ready to move in. This is another area in which I believe corruption is going on. Instead of using Navy patrol boatsbecause the Government has not enough of them or they cannot move fast enough- the Government is now hiring vessels that belong to its capitalist friends, at very high rates of hire, and some of those cannot move fast enough either. Usually what happens is that one of the escort vessels goes out, catches the old broken down Taiwanese ship and takes two or three days to get it into port. Nothing is gained from salvage. If the prosecution is successful and the boats are confiscated the vessels sell for about $10 each. The become junk to be sold. Others come in and despoil the reefs. I and my colleagues have asked questions about this, but the Government does not know the answer. </para>
          <para>It is similar to the situation with fishing. Under-the-counter deals are being made. I suppose this is covered by the Department of Transport too because the inability of Ministers in this chamber to understand what their portfolios cover is absolutely colossal. Apart from the questions I had recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> this morning, other questions have been asked of Ministers which they fob off saying that the subjects of the questions do not fall within their areas of responsibility. There was a time when Ministers were responsible. If the subject of a question did not fall within a Minister's area of responsibility and if the question was written out, the Minister would refer it to the appropriate Minister. A couple of Ministers in this Government still adhere to that old-fashioned idea of displaying some sort of honesty, but the rest of them are totally dishonest. What they try to do is to avoid their responsibilities. </para>

            <para>- I will take just a moment. It is quite clear from what we have seen that the cost recoveryuser pays doctrine of the Department of Transport aviation section is running into major problems. The hearings of Senate Estimates committees have shown that the Department of Transport is having problems in implementing that doctrine. The problem is to attribute sections of the costs to the various users, let alone make a fair and equitable distribution of those costs. On the industry side or user side to which the costs are applied, there is an increasing wave of dissatisfaction, because it is seen to be less than fair and equitable. It is seen also to provide no restraint on some of the activities of the Department because it does tend to impose systems on users which the users do not really need. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I said on Monday night and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> said tonight, society receives a benefit from having an efficient airline and air transport system in this country. Part of the cost of running the services should be met by the community at large. I suggest that a figure of 60 per cent of the cost might be recovered from the users and 40 per cent might be derived from the community. I raise a point about the $172,048 that is being spent this year by the Department of Transport on training eight examiners of airmen for Boeing 727 and DC9 aircraft. I think that that is a waste of taxpayers' money. I think it is an unnecessary service. Those eight examiners of airmen are flown to America twice a year to undertake crew training so that they can maintain flight currency on those two classes of aircraft. They, in turn, act as check captains on the check captains of the airlines which operate the Boeing 727 and DC9 aircraft in this country. It is time that we recognised the professionalism of the airlines. The days are long gone when people flying regular passenger transport aircraft were cowboys or amateurs learning as they went along. </para>

              <para>-Yes, if it ever were the case. I do not think that it ever was at that standard because I think that Australia led the world in its airline development. Whatever one might think about airline schedules or airline costs, that is one matter; but there can be no question at all about the sheer professionalism of the Australian airlines in an operational sense. Their crew training, their crew efficiency and their maintenance standards are absolutely without parallel. There is no reason at all for us to impose a governmental check on the check captains that they already operate so efficiently, on their services. We are past that. We certainly do not need to spend $172,000 a year maintaining this superfluous service. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Chairman,</inline>I will deal firstly with the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt.</inline> The answers I have been given on those four questions are as follows. The first question is not a matter which comes within the jurisdiction of the Department of Transport. I am advised that it is part of the Bureau of Meteorology and I therefore do not have a specific answer on that request. I will seek a response on that point from the appropriate Minister. The same applies to the second question. With regard to the third question, the Maatsuyker light station is not automatic and is still manned. With respect to Tasman Island, since automation in March 1977 there have been 33 trips to Tasman Island, including scheduled and non-scheduled trips. The approximate cost for each trip is $500. With respect to the fourth question, the total cost of automation of the light station was $80,000. </para>

          <para>A number of honourable senators on the Opposition side have made general remarks in the course of the discussion of the estimates for the Department of Transport relating to the value or otherwise of Estimates committees. I would simply say in response that I find the comment somewhat surprising. I would think that the Estimates committees have achieved both for the Senate and the Parliament the delivery by the Executive Government to the Parliament of a great mass of detailed information which in the past was not available. I have in front of me the material which has been made available for the consideration of the Committee with respect to four of the departments. I lift with a sense of wonder- not only that I can still lift it but also because of its size- the information provided by the Department of Administrative Services. The whole point is that quite frankly I do not think that the Executive Government is deeply concerned if the Senate takes it on itself to say that the procedure of the Estimates committees is not of value. It seems to me that this was a reform that was brought about by the Senate, by the Parliament itself and it has resulted in a much greater opportunity to give public scrutiny to the affairs of the Executive Government. I would have thought that the value or otherwise was something that could be very simply determined by the Senate and if the Senate determined to do away with the procedure, that would be a matter for it and not for the Government. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline>made a number of points which challenged some of the recently considered and confirmed policies of government. I do not think I can do any more with respect to the question of cost recovery which was raised by both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacGibbon</inline> than to say that I have heard what they had to say. The matter has had consideration by governments over a period; as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> himself said, by governments of different complexions. The Government recently affirmed that it is seeking cost recovery on a basis which has been announced. I note the honourable senator's comments. They will be drawn to the attention of the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon ).</inline></para>
          <para>With respect to such matters as the location of the Department and the restoration of a separate Department of Civil Aviation, once again these are matters which have been canvassed by government and I can do no more than draw them to the attention of the Minister. The cost of individual routes which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> is a matter which he has canvassed in the Estimates committees and on other occasions in this chamber. Some of the difficulties have been explained; for example, the need to make allocations of the expenses of say, Melbourne, given the various groups that make use of it and so on. The matters that he has raised here again this morning have received a fair amount of consideration. We have not yet got to the stage where the cost details that the honourable senator has sought are available. Quite obviously any such breakdown of route costs will involve judgments and to some extent any allocation of costs will have to be arbitrary. So, one could achieve probably different results according to the proportion of the costs one chooses to attribute to particular routes. </para>
          <para>The flying training matter was raised by a whole series of senators starting with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> who referred to the information already provided by the Government in the explanatory material made available following the Estimates Committee hearing. I think that the simple point which is made in that information is that training in Australia will be significantly more expensive than in the United States. The facts are set out in the material. At a time when there is considerable concern about the overall costs, it is understandable that the United States option is adopted. There is a significant difference in costs. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop, Senator Jessop</inline>and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> raised the question of the Stuart Highway. We have heard those honourable senators speak on that topic before. I think that what was illustrated by the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> in particular is that he does not embarrass easily. We have had a series of complaints about the Stuart Highway. The present position is that there is an expanded program of works on that highway. The period within which the work is to be completed has been reduced. I think it is quite clear that the Commonwealth Government has been able to tackle this matter with the new Government of South Australia in a way which appears to be a lot more satisfactory. The question which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> and to which I want to respond was, I think misunderstood by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren.</inline> I think that he misunderstood what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop. Senator Bishop</inline> really put an inquiry to me. He said that statements had been made in a Press release and at a meeting that he attended but he wanted a statement to be made in this Parliament. I understand that he was seeking confirmation of the fact that there would be no payments outside the payments which are made to the States under the States Grants (Roads) Act. </para>

              <para>-That is right. I had seen public reports rather than departmental reports indicating that the Australian manufacturing program was proceeding. My departmental advice now is that there is no upset to the programs which have been in planning to this point. The Government has no indication that the concern which the honourable senator expressed is based on fact. That is the most I can say at this stage. </para>

          <para>I have already dealt with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> 's comments on the Stuart Highway, I hope to his satisfaction. He also raised the question of rail standardisation. There is no proposal at the moment that the line he mentioned should be delat with. It is not a matter which is currently before us for decision. It has been put aside for the time being. I will refer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> 's views on the matter to the Minister for Transport. I pick up in that context the comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> which touched the more northerly section of the line. I confirm that a Commonwealth and Northern Territory Government study is under way. I think it is hoped that that study will be completed by Christmas but both governments are of the view that completing the right study is more important than the exact timing. Once the study is completed the two governments will have to consult about the question of further standardisation north. </para>
          <para>I have dealt in part with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren's</inline> comments. I will pick up at this point- a number of honourable senators raised it- the problem of programming and the complaints about it. It appears to me that at the end of each period of sittings since 1 have been here for the last 5 '/a years there has been a problem towards the last week or fortnight of the period of sittings. I believe that both the previous Government and this Government have tried to obviate that problem. The pressure at the end of the session puts all of us in some difficulty. I am not trying to score any points. I am simply saying that it seems to be a common problem at the close of a parliamentary session that we come under greater pressure than any of us would wish. I can say only that we try to avoid that in our programming. For the last three or four years there has been a very concerted attempt in this chamber to provide the Opposition with a regular preview of what the following week will hold. There has been a high degree of co-operation at the level of the Whips and the leaders with respect to programming. If at times it does not match our convenience, the inconvenience is shared by Government senators along with Opposition senators. </para>
          <para>I have mentioned the matters which were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff.</inline> I thank him for the positive remarks he made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> raised the matter of the Estimates committees which I have dealt with.  His  comment about suppressing and hiding expenditure I believe was an exaggerated point of view. I refer again to the extensive documentation which is received prior to the meeting of the Estimates committees and following questions which are raised during their hearings. I am advised by my departmental advisers that there is a training program for observers which is the responsibility of the Department of Transport. The matter of drugs which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> raised has been referred to a royal commission by the Queensland Government. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on these estimates. </para>

Firstly, I am reminded by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, who has been a member of this chamber for a great number of years, that the Estimates have never been debated on the second last day of the Government's program of sitting and certainly not at 3.20 a.m. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland also reminded me that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson was Leader of the Government in the Senate he gave a solemn undertaking when the Estimates committees were set up that there would be no curtailment of debate in the Committee of the Whole. That point should be recognised. The other point that should be recognised is that when the Senate Estimates committees meet in very small committee rooms there is hardly any coverage by the Press of the proceedings. At least there is a public forum in this chamber. The only Committee that receives any Press coverage is the Committee of the Whole that meets in this Chamber. </para>

              <para>- That was explained earlier today when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> made another snide remark that I was overseas. There was also a Government senator over there with me. I am not going to cast any aspersions on him or say that he was neglecting his parliamentary duties because he was not here. He was attending the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> apparently is not aware of the fact that it is possible to attend the meeting of only one Estimates committee at a time. If he has a look at the record he will see that on every occasion, I have been prepared to come into this chamber and ask questions on departments when I have not been able to attend the relevant Estimates committee meeting. I make no excuse for the fact that I seek answers to the questions that I have put. I would say that this is the first time in the 8 Vi years I have been here that I and many other honourable senators have not been able to get answers. We had not been given too many answers until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> rose at about 10 past three this morning. I would like to congratulate him on the depth of the answers he gave to honourable senators.  His  performance this morning far outshines that of any of his colleagues. He was able to give those answers in a cheerful manner. I have told him before that if he was the Leader of the Government in this place it would run more smoothly. He has the happy knack of taking the heat out of many debates. I make no apologies for saying that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> knows that because I have told him so before. I think that this should be put on the record. </para>

              <para>- Some people will read my remarks. The point is that the matters I have raised tonight have proved conclusively that the people opposite, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline> have been misleading the people of Australia over the Stuart Highway. The Government talks about extra money for the Stuart Highway. What I want to say to Government senators now is that the reason the new Minister in South Australia is able to find extra money for the Stuart Highway is that he does not have to expend further money on the south-east freeway between Glen Osmond and the River Murray. This highway was completed under a Labor Government. The money previously expended on that highway over a period of years is now available out of the State grants loan fund and will be made available for the construction of other roads in South Australia. That is the answer to that question. It is no good honourable senators saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline></para>

He said that when the ribbon is cut for the opening of the Stuart Highway he hopes to see me there. Even if the Government were to adhere to the program laid down it would be 1986 before it is completed and I will not be a member of the Parliament. It is very unlikely that, as an ex-senator, I will get an invitation to the opening of the Stuart Highway when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh, Senator Elstob</inline> and I were not paid the courtesy of being given invitations to attend the recent ceremony to celebrate the crossing of the border by the railway line. We were completely ignored. Ever since I came into this Parliament I have continually pressed for a north-south railway line. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff,</inline> who gave evidence before a joint parliamentary committee looking into constitutional reform for the Northern Territory, well knows that I repeatedly asked people in the Northern Territory whether they wanted a north-south line as was promised to them under the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1910. It is that far back. Of course, successive Liberal tory governments have never honoured the promise. </para>
          <para>Now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> pleads for a survey to be carried out. If he reads the transcript of evidence given to the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory in its inquiry into constitutional development he will find that I repeatedly spoke about a survey. When he talks about a survey and the need for the railway line to be extended from Alice Springs to Darwin after completion of the section from Tarcoola to Alice Springs, he needs to be reminded that it was his Government that closed down the only railway line in the Northern Territory- from Larrimah to Darwin- about six months after it came to office. Who closed it down? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> closed it down and did away with all the rolling stock. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> now makes a great plea about the need for a railway line in the Northern Territory. These are matters on record. I am sure the people of the Northern Territory will not forget them. </para>

            <para>- I do not want the question on the honourable senator's motion to be put immediately if that would prevent discussion of the estimates of the Department of Administrative Services. I wish to discuss three matters. The first concerns the subject of Estimates committees generally. Those who know the history of the formation of the Estimates committees will know that members of the Australian Labor Party never supported their establishment. It was as a result of a decision of the Liberal Party, supported by the Democratic Labor Party, that they were formed. Despite that, the Australian Labor Party with the exception of myself, went along with it. I think that members of the Labor Party have diligently served on them. However, I always thought that they were a failure. I wish to support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Killen</inline> 's statement to the Press Club; we cannot merge the American committee system with the Westminster system. One of them must go. I believe that the Estimates committees have been a failure. They were supported in the belief that they would save the time of the Parliament. This year's experience has proved that the time of the chamber has not been saved. I do not think that this is due to a different approach having been taken. I think these debates are taking so long because of a deterioration in those who hold ministerial responsibility. One of the Minister's who is supposed to be listening to us and answering our queries is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster.</inline> Honourable senators can see the sort of thing that we have to put up with in trying to get answers from him. </para>

              <para>-He has woken up, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman.</inline> Will you find out what he is mumbling? During that time we have had three shifts in the parliamentary officers in Adelaide. We have moved from one building in the city centre of Adelaide to another building. We are now on the 1 5th floor of the AMP building on the corner of King William Street and North Terrace; it is a prominent site. I was approached a fortnight ago by an officer of the Department of Administrative Services. He showed me the proposed plan for the alteration of the building. He told me that because I was third in seniority I would be able to have my choice of office. I said to him: 'Look, I have been shifted three times now. I have 18 months to go. For God's sake, leave me in peace for that time.' He told me that I could not stay there because the Minister wanted another ministerial office in Adelaide and also a Cabinet room. I said: 'I think I must submit'. I submit because obviously one can only imply from that statement that in the anticipated Cabinet reshuffle the Minister to replace <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> will be a South Australian. I said to the officer: 'If there is going to be a Cabinet room, it must mean that the Prime Minister is going to be a South Australian'. Because John McLeay is a South Australian and because there will be two Ministers from South Australia, I am prepared to shift. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I then came to Canberra. I approached <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McLeay</inline> at a function in the President's suite one night last week. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McLeay</inline> about this matter. He informed me that he was not anticipating that that would be the arrangement. I want to know now what will be the cost to the Department of Administrative Services of shifting me from the fifteenth floor to the seventh floor. I will be inconvenienced. How much will it cost to alter that office space so that two ministerial offices can be provided. As only one Minister is from South Australia and there is only a possibility that a second Minister will come from South Australia, I must ask: What is the purpose of including a Cabinet room in this building when, if the Cabinet ever did meet there, it would meet there only once in the life of the Parliament? The Government can book suitable rooms for Cabinet meetings, such as board rooms. </para>
          <para>What has happened to the austerity program that was introduced with respect to Government expenditure? A second ministerial office is to be provided in the building. All of the offices of members of Parliament are to be relocated. As yet no second minister from South Australia has been appointed. We are to be kicked out of our offices because a Cabinet room is to be provided. </para>
          <para class="block">As I have said, rooms suitable for Cabinet meetings are available in other areas in the city. As yet, Cabinet has not met in Adelaide. </para>
          <para>I ask the Minister to tell me what sense there is in this proposal. Specifically, I wish to know where I will find the appropriation for this proposed expenditure. How can I find out the costs involved with respect to the inconvenience of members of Parliament who have their offices in Adelaide? I will withdraw all of my objections if what I anticipate is the only reason for this action comes to pass. That is that the next Prime Minister of Australia is to be a South Australian and a second Minister from South Australia is to be appointed. I would make the sacrifice involved in moving from my room if that is to be the case. </para>
          <para>The other question that I raise concerns the efficiency of members of the Commonwealth Police Force, as it was known, who advise the Minister in relation to prosecutions. I refer to what is known as the alleged social security frauds case. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chris</inline> Nakis was charged with defrauding the Commonwealth somewhere between 1 July 1972 and 31 March 1978. He was granted an indemnity against prosecution by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> and he was granted a pardon against prosecution by the Governor-General. The indemnity was only for the period of any offence that may have been committed against the Department of Social Security between 1 August 1975 and 1 January 1977. </para>
          <para>From the answers that I have received to questions, I am given to understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nakis</inline> will not face prosecution. Therefore he was granted an indemnity against prosecution for a period which the prosecutor could possibly have proved a case against him. He was granted an indemnity for the period from 1 August 1975 to 1 January 1977, which was three years after the period for which he was summonsed for an offence and some 12 or 14 months earlier than was stated in his summons. Obviously, if he had committed an offence and if he was in breach of the law, in view of the indemnity it occurred between 1 August 1975 and 1 January 1977. I would like to know of the incompetency of the policeman who advised the prosection, who carried out the investigation of this matter and who extended the period when the offence may have occurred to three years before and 14 months after it could be proved that an offence did occur. That shows not only incompetency on the part of the Commonwealth Police in this matter but also the impossibility of an adequate defence. If a defendant has to trace back his defence against a claim of a breach of law, for a period of six years when the only thing that the police can prove is for a period of two years he has an unfair burden placed upon him. I think that the police should be more capable in their investigations and in their laying of complaints against defendants. </para>

            <para>- I wish to speak very briefly on this matter, I do not like doing it at this time of the morning, but it is very important that I do. We are still here because we are sucking up for the Parliament itself. As to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> 's motion, Estimates Committee E reinforces and strongly supports the original proposition put forward by the Presiding Officers that the relocation of the staff who are currently occupying the Hotel Canberra should be to the West Block itself. The officers of that Department claim that it is an unsafe building. I have it on good authority that Section A of West Block is perfectly satisfactory and requires no refurbishing. It has adequate fire facilities and could accommodate well over 100 people. I suspect very strongly that the building is being set aside for occupation by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. If that is the case I find that very hard to reconcile. At the present time, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is occupying a modern and adequate building; the Edmund Barton building. </para>

              <para>-If that is the attitude of honourable senators opposite I will not read it out because I sympathise with those people who are tired. Since that time in 1977 when accommodation became available, the Tribunal recognised the need for additional staff. The work load on back benchers has considerably increased. I believe also that the work load on the committees of the Parliament has significantly increased. We require an allocation of additional officers to those committees. It is important that the Government recognises the need to accommodate those people who are serving our needs, in particular the officers of the Parliament. It is necessary to relocate the committee secretariat closer to this building. Research officers who are desperately needed could also be accommodated. It will not take three years to refurbish West Block. We could occupy Section A possibly within a month or two.

            <para>- A number of points have been raised on the estimates on which I can touch upon. Firstly, in respect to matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> I am not in a position to give him the cost of the changes which are envisaged. Indeed. I have no information as to what point they are at precisely. I am surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> 's surprise that there should be a second South Australian Minister or indeed a South Australian Prime Minister in due course. I would have though that with the talent on the Government side from South Australia that sort of thing would have struck him as a matter of course. I will make some inquiries for him. I must say that I am sympathetic to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> 's spending his last days undisturbed. As he spoke I had visions of a man in a cottage with a super highway threatening his position, with the thought that the road might be put around him. I am sympathetic that, after a long career in this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> should not waste some months of that time remaining to him in reorganising himself in a new office. I will certainly raise the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> McLeay and endeavour to ensure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has a quiet time. As far as the matters raised about the secretariat by, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> or was it <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> - </para>

            <para>- May I just say that I do not particularly want sympathy in my old age because a highway is going through my residence. I did not ask a question about that. I am more concerned with the use of taxpayers' money and at the expense which will be caused because of a grand idea of a Minister. He wants a second ministerial office for a Minister who may not be appointed and he wants a Cabinet room for a Cabinet that does not meet in Adelaide. He just wants to spend money on the surrounds of his luxurious office. It is certainly snobbery gone mad. That is what it is. A lot of inconvenience will occur. This matter is important because office space, for the Commonwealth Crown Law Office, will be crunched up. Apparently the Australian Mutual Provident Life Assurance Society, under some agreement with the Commonwealth which paid for the cost of that 16 storey building, rents nine floors of that building to the Commonwealth. The Crown Law Office has to vacate an area of its office so that we can put in the politicians, and make room for the new ministerial office and the Cabinet room. Apparently it is important that that area be converted in eight weeks. I do not know when Malcolm intends to reshuffle his Cabinet but it is important that, in eight weeks, the conversion be carried out. If a Minister gets an idea like this it does not have to go to Cabinet. The alteration of buildings is provided for under ministerial arrangements. There is no need or necessity for this proposal. The Minister want to build up his own image by altering the accommodation around his office. The taxpayers will pay for this and it does not matter what inconvenience may be caused. The taxpayers simply will pay. I would also appreciate the Minister's giving some idea of why such a long period of six years was stated in the action taken by the Commonwealth Police in the prosecution of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chris</inline> Nakis when actually he was exonerated from all charges by being given an indemnity or a pardon for only two years of that period. </para>

            <para>- I rise to speak to division 138, the Australian Federal Police, principally because of the remarks that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> made during the estimates for, I think it was the Department of Transport. He alluded to the great depth of information that is made available to members of the Senate through the Senate Estimates committees and through the Committee of the Whole, in which we are sitting at present. He drew particular attention to the great volume of detail contained in the explanatory notes of the Department of Administrative Services. I trust that notwithstanding the wealth of material that is contained in that voluminous document, the Department of Administrative Services or the Australian Federal Police through the Department of Administrative Services will be able to provide some of the details that have been requested of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> and the Minister for Administrative Services, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> McLeay, by the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> and by other members of the Opposition in respect of a matter that is commonly referred to as the social security fraud case. On 3 May 1 978 Sentor Guilfoyle, the Minister for Social Security, made a statement to the Senate on the alleged social security frauds. At page 1 343 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> she said: </para>

          <para class="block">In response to that second matter a reply subsequently came to the Parliament that whilst the word 'Greek* did not appear on any sign that was being held by any person who was being investigated and who was the subject of photography at that time, nonetheless, the word Greece' did appear on the placard that the accused person was made to hold. I would like an explanation as to why that subsequent explanation in relation to the word 'Greece' did not appear in the original brief that was given to the Minister for Social Security and which the Minister reported to this Parliament. On the second aspect, we all know and we have all read that Detective Chief Inspector Thomas of the Commonwealth Police has sworn on oath that telephone tapping did, in fact, take place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> said: </para>

I would like to know- as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> sought the information last week and earlier this week- why there is a variance between what the Minister told the Parliament on 3 May 1978 and what appears to be the situation today? I raise the matter only because the Minister made bold the claim that this Parliament is given voluminous information by the Executive. If that be the case I would think that the Minister should now be in a position to respond to the simple requests for information that we have made on this matter. </para>

It is probably all right if the member has his office in a city complex. If one senator has to close his office, probably a constituent can go to another member. But in my own case, with an office in the country- and I am the only senator in South Australia with an office in the country- if I want to bring my electorate secretary to Canberra, which I am entitled to do under the Tribunal's recommendation, I have to close my office while he is over here in Canberra working for me.

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Chairman,</inline>the Bills that remain are very important. We still have to deal with the estimates for the Department of Defence, the Department of National Development, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Postal and Telecommunications Department. Consideration of the Defence estimates is a very urgent matter, as we have been told by Government members time and time again. They accused the Opposition when it was in government of not making enough money available for Defence. I suggest in all fairness that if the Government does not want to be fair to members of parliament, at least it should be fair to the departmental officers, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff and the attendants who are here at this early hour of the morning. Some of them have been here since 8 o'clock yesterday morning. I ask that you give due consideration to reporting progress and seeking leave for the Committee to sit again in a few hours' time when we return. </para>

            <para>- I have some further questions to bowl up to the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> and the officers of the Department of Defence. There have been prolonged negotiations, going back to the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard</inline> was the Minister for Defence, about vacating the Moore Park engineers depot in Sydney and moving that depot inland. As honourable senators would be aware, when this area is vacated there will be sufficient hectares available for amalgamation with the Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 and the sports ground so as to provide a tip-top football stadium, something Sydney now lacks. I do not think we need go into the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. It is said frequently that the engineers depot will be vacated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I marry this matter with that of a defence, publication relating to the gradual phasing out of Fort Denison and other areas on the Sydney Harbour foreshore for the creation of a national park. I must say that if some of those areas had not been occupied for defence purpose, Hooker and company would have had sky high developments on all the land surrounding Sydney harbour. I give full credit to the Department of Defence in that regard although if Neils Neilsen, the Minister for Lands in 1912, had had his way, he would have had all the Harbour foreshores in their virgin state to a depth of one mile. To sum up, I would like to hear something specific about the deadline for the Army vacating the Moore Park engineers depot, being mindful of the sports stadium that could be created in Sydney. I know that even if the Federal Government did follow this policy of retreat, it would rest with the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust, or the new authority, as to what will be the final decision. The other matter is the question of the ultimate realisation of the Sydney Harbour foreshore national park. </para>

Some progress has been made in respect of expenditure but what is the present position in respect of the Defence Department's attempts to improve the standard of housing and to meet the needs of servicemen.

            <para>-I have several matters to raise on the purpose of providing further clarification of the accounting process when providing information to Senate Estimates committees. I think it is important when the Estimates committees are provided with figures that we be provided also with a reconciliation between those figures which are subject to evaluation by a particular committee and the total appropriation for the department concerned. For example, a Senate Estimates committee looks only at part of the total of the Defence expenditure, and when I requested a reconciliation between the amount examined by Estimates Committee F and the total of the Budget appropriation, the reconciliation ran into something like one and three-quarter pages. I think it is important, when people have an interest in defence matters, that they be provided with a reconciliation at the front of the estimates so that they can go fairly quickly to the other departments such as Construction, Productivity, Attorney-General 's, National Development, Administrative Services and so on to get the complete picture. I request that this type of presentation become a regular feature not only of the Defence Department documents but also of the documents presented by other departments, reconciling the figures for the department under investigation with the total of the Budget appropriation. I seek leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the information outlined on pages 80 and 8 1 of the written replies to questions asked during the meetings of Senate Estimates Committee F. </para>

            <para>- First I ought to make the point which I think a number of senators would wish to make. It seems utterly absurd and ridiculous that we should be considering the important matter of $2, 500m worth of defence expenditure at this hour of the morning. It is completely unnecessary, and I agree with the Australian Labor Party that extended sittings of the Senate would have been the answer. I think the Government is taking a singularly obdurate and not very intelligent line on this matter. The defence matter I want to raise is one I have raised a number of times in the Senate by way of questions to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen).</inline> I do not regard myself as having had any really satisfactory reply from him on the basic point I have raised, that is, the question of the major part of our naval expenditure- some $100m worth- being devoted to 1 5 Fremantle class patrol boats. They are large, fast boats, ideal for missile capabilityused for missile capability by all other nations in the world with that type of vessel- which alone in the world we perversely propose to arm with one light gun. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I suggest that in this regard we find the same obduracy. For some reason or other- although we are not a large naval power; we do not have any plans that I have heard of for any large program of naval building- we have committed ourselves to the construction over a period of 1 5 craft which could have a considerable sting, which would inspire respect from our neighbours and which we have deliberately an perversely decided we will not equip in that way. I only ask the Government, when building these craft, not to create a situation whereby in future years this country will have to incur enormous charges for their adaptation to missile capability. I believe that will eventually have to happen. I think events will be forced upon us so that we will have to do this. We will not have time to build more craft of this type. Let us be at the stage now of at least laying some of the wiring, the wiring channels or whatever is necessary in at least some of these craft so that they can be useful men-of-war when they are needed. </para>

            <para>- In the spirit of the subject matter that we are debating, the by-word of defence being awake and ever watchful', I enter this debate very briefly by asking where in the estimates for the Department of Defence is the provision for the payments of the contracts for the three overseas firms which are currently working on designs for a new aircraft carrier. I have not been able to locate specifically provision for that. I wonder whether it is possible for the Minister for Education either now, if he has the information, or at some subsequent time to indicate to the chamber whether any of those designs is specifically for a vertical short take-off and landing aircraft. </para>

I point out to him that by Friday we will have completed far more sitting time than if we had sat right through next week. A little mathematics will point out that lengthy sittings on Mondays and Fridays and the extra hours we have sat amount to more than the scheduled sittings. It is a matter for honourable senators to decide their priorities. A great deal of time has been taken up on other matters. </para>

I am advised that that will be found in division 234.01. 1 am not clear as to what the progress of thinking is in terms of any sort of design for vertical take off and landing aircraft at all. I imagine that in any modern surface vessels using aircraft the VTOL principle would be under consideration. Again I will seek that information out. </para>

As I indicated earlier, I would not have raised it had it not been for the answer that I received through <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> today from the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen).</inline> The matter arose from a question that was originally asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> earlier this year in which he sought some information concerning the incidence of alcoholism and drug addiction in the Defence Force. On 8 June, the Minister replied: </para>
          </talk.start>

            <item label=".">

          </list>
          <para class="block">I subsequently sought clarification of this. </para>
          <para>When I asked a question a few days ago, I think, I pointed out that in 1977 Air Vice Marshal Jordan had given evidence before the Williams Royal Commission in which he did give information concerning the use of drugs in the armed forces. The Minister, in his reply to the first question, said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No, the Minister is not aware that the Royal Commission was provided with statistics about drug addiction. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>To the second question, the Minister replied: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No, Air Vice-Marshal Jordan did not provide the Royal Commission with statistics about drug addiction. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Minister then went on to make a smart-aleck comment at the end of the answer. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No, this is not an example of any of the unlikely propositions advanced by the senator. It is an example, however, of the senator shooting from the hip without doing his homework on freely available unclassified documentation. </para>

          <para class="block">If the Minister were not so stupid as to put that sort of a statement on record I do not suppose I would have concerned myself so much about it, but I did my homework for a second time and I found that it is the Minister who is shooting from the hip and it is the Minister who has not done his homework. </para>
          <para>I went to the Parliamentary Library and got a copy of the transcript of the evidence. I found, firstly, that the Minister is wrong inasmuch as he said that the evidence is freely available from the Library. Part of it is; part of it is not.

            <para>First of all, if I could describe the document. Perhaps we could say it is statistical data and comments on the illegal use and misuse of drugs in the Defence Force and just to describe it more fully for you- that could be entitled as an exhibit. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The transcript shows that the exhibit was tabled or displayed in whatever way that is done in the courts. The point I want to make is that the Minister might have been a little more forthcoming. What he is doing is playing with words. Simply because I used the word 'addiction' he is saying: </para>
          <para class="block">No evidence at all was given about drug addiction at the Royal Commission '. In fact, what the Royal Commission did receive was statistical data on the illegal use and misuse of drugs. I suppose it is anyone's guess what constitutes a difference between addiction and the illegal use or misuse of drugs. I would have thought that the illegal use or misuse of drugs must be, if not addiction, something very close to it. </para>
          <para>The least the Minister might have done was to provide the information to me by saying- if he wanted to be so pedantic about the use of words- 'No, there was no reference to addiction, but there was reference to the illegal use and the misuse of drugs'. Had he done that, I think he would have fulfilled his proper role as a Minister in answering a question on that subject. I just want to put on record that those smart alec answers which this Minister has given- I suppose that is not out of character for the person concerned- are reprehensible. In this case, as is shown by the transcript of evidence and the fact that the Parliamentary Library could not provide the information, the Minister was the person who was not doing his homework and was most irresponsible in not doing it. </para>

            <para>- I think it is rather fitting at this time of the morning that I should make a plea in regard to an overdue memorial plaque in memory of the 120 men who suffered fatal industrial accidents when engaged in construction work on the Snowy Mountains project. After all, they worked shifts throughout the 24 hours of a day. It seems to me that this morning we are making history in a similar way. However, I raise the matter of a memorial plaque in a serious vein. I think honourable senators would know that for well over 18 months, on behalf of a number of major ethnic clubs, newspapers, the Sydney and Melbourne trades hall councils and major trade unions we have been endeavouring to get this matter finalised. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One Sunday well over two years ago, or thereabouts, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> made a speech about governing for all the people. On that theme, many of the ex-Snowy Mountains project employees who are now working in other fields are now rather restive and believe that a niggardly attitude seems to be being adopted towards such a memorial. As a matter of fact, back in the time when David </para>
          <para class="block">Fairbairn was Minister for National Development, a promise was made to provide such a memorial, but it has never been fulfilled. With the increasing agitation, I thought that we were on the verge of success. Then, about five weeks ago, through the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack,</inline> I received an answer on the subject from the Minister for National Development, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kevin</inline> Newman. The substance of that answer was that the Government had costed a plaque and a horrible thing had happened: The cost was $60,000 and the Government was trying to compress that amount down to $40,000. </para>
          <para>I think that anybody who has read the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority annual report would know of the millions of dollars which the efforts of those men have contributed in water resources and electrical power. That is not assessed in thousands of dollars but in millions of dollars. It is beyond my comprehension that there has been so much pussy footing around. I want to be fair to the Minister for National development, Kevin Newman, at least to this extent: I understand that Treasury directives more or less inhibited his ultimate decision. He also told me that he was having another review of the matter. But I think this is an opportune time to maintain the agitation. </para>
          <para>The other impression I got was that irrespective of whether the cost of the plaque will be $40,000 or $60,000, the Department has some quaint idea that the plaque will be tucked away in front of the Snowy Mountains Authority headquarters in Cooma. I am quite happy about Cooma being the location of the plaque. But I visualise a situation of the overseas relatives of the men who lost their lives working on the Snowy Mountains scheme coming to Australia to see that plaque. Mark you, we are talking about a multinational culture and people of many lands who participated in that major project. Most of the people who died while working on the project were from overseas. I am speaking now for many of the ethnic clubs when I say that the plaque, whether it cost $40,000 or $60,000, should be implanted, as it were, in the location in Cooma where the various flags of the countries of many of the members of that Snowy Mountains scheme work force are flying at this moment. It would be easy for people from overseas to see the plaque if it were situated in the centre of a town or of a city where there is some festivity, as there would be in the case of those flags fluttering. But the Snowy Mountains Authority headquarters in Cooma is off the beaten track. </para>
          <para>As it is 4.37 a.m. I think I had better return to the attack. It is not only I, as a New South Wales senator, speaking on this matter; the petitions that were submitted to this Senate represent a large segment of the major ethnic communities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lajovic</inline> would well know that this matter was spear-headed by a lot of the Slovenian clubs. They might have had their differences in certain things, but they are united on this matter because a number of their people were early casualties of the Snowy Mountains project. I know that they were aided by a number of other major groups, particularly the Italian and Irish groups. They are just as vigorous in their support. I hope that this appeal at this hour of the morning will see that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman,</inline> within the next fortnight, making some positive statement in this regard. I know that a rather caustic motion was adopted by the 118 trade unions of the Labor Council of New South Wales. There was a letter from one of the trade union veterans, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Charlie</inline> Oliver, who was involved right through on an Australian Workers Union level. I know that some time later this morning when I go out to Chapman, my host, Roman Bizjak, will want to know where I have been all night. I will be able to say that I was working on this cause. I hope my words have not fallen on deaf ears. </para>

Let us be clear about what I am doing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Toohey</inline> happens to be rightly concerned about a lack of consultation between Telecom and other people involved with mains, such as the Metropolitan Water, Sewage and Drainage Board in Sydney and the Australian Gas Light Co.

It may be that the agitation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Toohey</inline> and other people from the trade union movement quite apart from passing pedestrians will be the catalyst. I am mindful of the time. I hope that this matter will be taken on board too. </para>

            <para>- In speaking to the Estimates for the Postal and Telecommunications Department I raise the matter of the inability of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to televise to outlying areas of Australia national sporting events. Before I do so I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> in case he was not in the chamber earlier when I made some caustic remarks about the way in which the Parliament has been asked to consider the Estimates as a whole and because I do not like saying things behind anyone's back, that this has been the worst administration of a sessional period of Parliament that I have seen in the 1 7 years that I have been a member. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Today we have dealt with thousands of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money in the most exhausting and shocking way. The chamber appears more like a battleground than a sitting of the Committee. I do not know whether those on the other side of the chamber are incompetent or arrogant, but I assure them that this sitting is doing the Government and the Parliament no good. Honourable senators opposite laugh. If they think that members of the Opposition will be silenced merely because of the lateness of the hour or because of the exhaustive process that we have been going through, I say frankly that they have another think coming. Members of the Opposition like honourable senators opposite are elected to the Parliament. We are elected to the Parliament to put a point of view on behalf of a very large section of the Australian community. </para>
          <para> I tell the Leader of the Government now that whilst I personally have been co-operative- all members of the Opposition have been reasonably co-operative- in seeing the Government's legislative program dealt with in a reasonable manner and with a spirit of co-operation and reasonableness, if this sort of conduct is to be continued by the Government, co-operation and reasonableness will have to be regarded on a two-way basis. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> as the Leader of the Government in the Senate that, frankly, he has opened up old wounds that existed four years ago that have taken a very long time to heal. It is regrettable that he has decided to administer the affairs of this nation in the way in which they have been administered in the last week, particularly in the last IS or 16 hours. </para>
          <para>Having made those comments, I now get back to the matter I wish to refer to, that is the inability of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to televise national sporting events. It is a matter of concern to a very large section of the Australian community. Today the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney),</inline> who represents in this chamber the Minister for Post and Telecommunications gave an answer to a question that was asked by me on 8 November wherein I sought advice on the possible use of section 64 of the Broadcasting and Television Act to enable the ABC to televise sporting events declared to be in the national interest. The Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley,</inline> through <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> in this chamber said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I must make the point again that it is not just a matter of funds but, as I said in answering a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> last week, the solution requires co-operation between the organisations which grant the rights, the commercial network which secures the rights and the ABC. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline>is committed to the view that the co-operative approach offers the only real solution. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I raised the matter of co-operation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline> through <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> in this chamber as long ago as 7 June in the last sessional period. I then asked: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Because of the great concern being expressed about the matter in country areas, especially those of New South Wales, will the Minister ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications to consider calling during the forthcoming parliamentary recess a conference of executives of the Channel 9 network, the Federation of Commercial Television Stations, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and the ABC in an endeavour to sort out the problem and to ensure adequate telecast of the test cricket matches next summer? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In short <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> said that the answer was yes, that he would put the suggestion before the Minister and that he would see that the matter was replied to at an early date. That was in June. We heard nothing more about it until today. The Minister is still saying that the solution requires co-operation between the organisations- virtually the organisations that I had suggested last June should be called in conference by him to try to overcome the problem. I again ask the Minister who is in charge of these estimates whether he will see that the Department responsible for this matter convenes a conference at an early date to overcome the problem. </para>
          <para>Earlier I raised the question of the possible use of section 64 of the Broadcasting and Television Act being used as a declaration in the national interest to televise sporting events. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> in his reply suggested that I was stretching the point a little. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> and, through him, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications that in the annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Commission which was tabled .this week is a reference to this very matter. On page 8 of the annual report the Commission says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission has previously expressed the view, and it does so again, that the television rights to national and international sporting events in Australia should not be sold on an exclusive basis. Rather, the practice should be adopted (as in the UK) where certain major sporting events are declared events of national importance and only nonexclusive rights are sold. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In short, the Australian Broadcasting Commission is advocating the use of section 64 of the Broadcasting and Television Act to enable the ABC to televise sporting events declared to be in the national interest. Whilst the Minister might think I am stressing the point a little, I strongly believe that he would not suggest, for one moment, that the commissioners of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, all of whom have been appointed by the Government, are stretching the suggestion. </para>

            <para>- I would like to raise a couple of points. I support what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland on the declaration of national events so that we in the outback can see events like the cricket tests, the Melbourne Cup and so on. I do not want to debate the matters that I am going to raise because we have canvassed them before. I just want to raise them with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney).</inline> I am talking about the time-table of the Cox Peninsula situation. Could we have some indication when the Radio Australia beam to the north will be completed? Could we have some indication of when the medium wave, which is to serve the Northern Territory, will be finished? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One other point I would raise, again not to debate it because I have raised it here before, is that there appears to be no allocation for access radio or community radio. I am referring particularly to the Aboriginal situation. I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> can perhaps answer this point. If there is no allocation, can we ask that the Government look at this matter so that we can see situations like that at Milingimbi being introduced to give the Aboriginals access radio? </para>

            <para>- I recall that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> raised the matter he has spoken about tonight with me on a prior occasion. We discussed it both in this chamber and also in the corridor. I regret that he is not satisfied with the answer he has received on a point that is obviously important to public safety. I will take the matter up again. With respect to the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, I would have to say that, having listened very carefully to him, I think he has tried to stretch the point a little on section 64 and he has stretched the point a little on the Australian Broadcasting Commission report as well. The ABC may well be embracing the concept which operates in the United Kingdom. I think that would require a separate statutory provision to the existing provision under section 64. Again, it is not my business to give legal opinions on the matter. I suspect that the point he has made would involve the Government adopting a policy which would involve new legislation to recreate the circumstances that he has advocated. </para>

              <para>-Rather than give inadequate or incomplete information now I will take the point on board and try to respond to it. Regarding the matter of Aboriginal access to community radio, that is already occurring in a number of parts of Western Australia and Tasmania. Aboriginals are using existing licences to put on programs which are run by and produced for Aboriginals. Because those centres were the first, a training program has been undertaken there. The whole matter is one which is under active consideration. I think I indicated to the Estimates Committee that I have had substantial reports from my Department which are still under consideration. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> that it is an area which the Government sees as being of considerable potential. I do not feel that I have any information yet which has enabled me to take a definite stand other than to say that I can see its very real value for many of the communities that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> represents in this place. </para>

              <para>- I withdraw those comments. But we were forced to sit until 3.5 in the morning. As I said earlier- I think today- we were given a program by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> for the Budget session. The program was that the Senate would sit until 29 November. Now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> shortens the program by one week. In so doing he gives the excuse that we are sitting longer hours than we would have done had we sat the normal hours through to Thursday or Friday of next week. I do not accept that as an excuse because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> has been able to build those hours up only by keeping senators in this place for many nights until midnight, and for quite a few nights until after midnight, and tonight- or this morning- until three minutes to five. I have been a senator for  8V4  years and this is the longest session - </para>

              <para>- In my  8!£  years I have been in this place, this is the latest the chamber has sat. I have heard it told that it did sit through sometimes until 7 a.m. when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was here and when the debate was on the Government's decision to send our boys to Vietnam. But that is by the way. In the last  8!6  years the Senate has never sat until this hour of the morning to get legislation through. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mason</inline> pointed out some hours ago that we have been dealing here with some thousands of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money and we have not been able to give proper scrutiny to this expenditure. </para>

          <para>When we look at the record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> we will see very few of the Government members who said they wanted to be in government and that they would be a responsible government have contributed anything at all to the debate on these Appropriation Bills, which is now coming to a conclusion at two minutes to five in the morning. There have been very few comments from the Government members. They are afraid to rise in their place. I have repeatedly seen it happen that when they have wanted to rise to make some comment the Whip has gone over to them and sat them down. So Government members are under oppression. They should not come in here again and tell people that they are free agents and that they can vote according to their consciences, because it has been proven over and over again that they cannot. They are under the domination of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline> The Whip is under his domination and Government Senators are not allowed to speak their piece. I say again that appropriations for thousands of millions of dollars are being passed through this Parliament by people who claim to be responsible members of the Government. They have not allowed proper consideration of these Bills. The Government stands condemned for that. I hope that at the first opportunity the electors will put them back in their right place, on this side of the chamber. </para>

            <para>- I endorse the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren.</inline> I think last night and this morning have been the most disgraceful episodes I have seen here for 10 years. We will come back later in the morning and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> will do his usual Thursday morning ballet dance. He will wave his arms around screaming about the Whitlam regime and everything else. I want to place this on record because I believe that the action of the Government has been totally idiotic. The last set of estimates I spoke on, totalled almost $ 1,000m; yet they were forced through here in a matter of minutes. I think that Government supporters are being totally irresponsible. If they support what their leader has done in the last 24 hours they are more idiotic than I thought. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> I do not know what you are going to do about the rest of the program. Because of your great fear of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> or his fear of about what will happen if the Senate continues to sit, it is perfectly obvious that the Government will do the same thing again tonight and we will stay here until the early hours of Friday morning or Saturday morning. We could quite easily have come back here next week. I know that two or three Ministers will be going off on their overseas junkets. They need to get away. One wonders, in fact, what is wrong with the Prime Minister. It is obvious that he is the man who has been pointing the gun at the heads of Government supporters and persuading them to sit here until this hour of the day. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We will be leaving here within the next half an hour. No one will have a reasonable chance to recuperate before coming back here at 10 a.m. this day. One satisfaction is that the average age on the Government side is greater than it is on this side, so Government supporters are more likely to have the first coronaries than we are if they pursue this idiotic process and are not prepared to be democratic. There is no reason why the Senate cannot sit for the next fornight <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> is trying to object. He is already under suspicion for drug running. He has his own problem. He has to clear himself in front of a royal commission. If he wants to get away in a hurry so as to clear himself, let him do it. There is no reason why he should aid other Government supporters in keeping us here through fear of their masters. I suggest that we not do this again tonight. If we have to sit here on Saturday and Sunday because people cannot come back on Monday and Tuesday we should do so. We should do our job properly and not waste taxpayers' money. </para>
          <para>People outside will not be impressed by what the Government has done tonight. They will be quite upset about it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> was right when he said a while ago that the people on the Government side who said that they would be responsible managers have not done their job properly. They have been just as corrupt - </para>

Bearing in mind that we were in the Committee of the Whole and not sitting in the Senate, the procedure of having the matter made an order of" the day for the next day of sitting was not a proposition.

          <para>- I have a question relating to the proposed expenditure of the Department of Primary Industry. I would like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> who is the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon),</inline> to give some explanation to me. The question relates to page 2 1 of the Bill and is under subdivision 07 Rural Adjustment under an Act providing for financial assistance to the States and the Northern Territory. We find that the appropriation in 1978-79 was $48,700,000 and the expnditure was $46,976,457. This year the appropriation amounts to $19,200,000 which is a reduction of nearly $30m. I ask the Minister to give me some explanation as to why a government which always claims it has the interests of primary producers at heart has more than halved the appropriation this year. There is a reduction of $30m for rural adjustment. </para>

          <para>- That is not good enough. We have been asked to pass a Bill here this morning. I want to know, on behalf of primary producers, why there has been a reduction of $30m. Surely the Government, which has kept us here until 10 minutes past five in the morning, can come up with an answer. Surely the Minister is not going to admit again that he does not know the answer, as he has been doing for the last 16 hours in the Parliament. Are we to be told again by the Minister that he does not know and that he will provide us with an answer tomorrow? That is just not good enough. The Minister ought to know the answer. The Government has had the Bills before it for God knows how long. Why is the Minister unable to come up with the answers? Am I to telephone the primary producers who have asked me to make some inquiries about this matter and tell them that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> who claims that he has the interests of primary producers at heart, was unable to give me any reason as to why there has been a reduction of $30m? Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> does not want me to be spreading that around the country electorates. Surely he must have an answer. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator McLaren</inline>frightens me by saying that we may be doing a serious injustice to primary producers by agreeing to this appropriation simply because the Minister for Science and the Environment does not have the explanation. We are entitled to an explanation. I do not know where the Minister's advisers are, but someone should be able to give us the reason why there has been a reduction of $30m. Primary producers are the less prosperous section of our community and we should have some explanation before we pass the Bill. </para>

            <para>-Just a minute. I kept quiet while you were talking. I do not doubt that those members of the Opposition who found time to attend the meetings of the Estimates Committee put forward questions on this subject on behalf of the primary producers of Australia and obtained the required information. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> has a great appreciation of the primary industries of Australia. I know that before he went overseas he would have asked one of the Opposition members who were to attend meetings of that Committee to gain that information for him.

It is possible that the information is in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> All we are asking is for the Minister for Science and the Environment, who has been asleep all night, to repeat the information to us now so that we know that there is no injustice to the primary producers. I think that it is pertinent to point out, now that we are off the air, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> was overseas at the time, and not overseas at the taxpayers' expense, as was alleged when we were on the air. </para>

          <para>- There is one other point that I wish to make. It deals with a matter that is very dear to my heart. I am sure that the Minister for Science and the Environment, knowing that I have a very deep affinity with the poultry industry, will have an answer for me. Last year an amount of $9,500 was expended on the eradication of exotic poultry diseases, but this year no money is being appropriated. Perhaps the Government Minister could tell me whether that is because we have eradicated all the exotic poultry diseases. Does not the Minister think that, despite the Government's austerity program, the poultry industry warrants that amount of money? </para>

It was a general measure not confined to any particular group of industries. So far as over-capacity in the road transport industry is concerned, it should be recognised that this industry has been subject to a number of influences other than the investment allowance-including, for example, the structure of the industry (with some large but many small operators), the difficulty which small operators would have in making judgments, often in isolation, about the return they could expect on their investments, and the subdued state of the market for their services. The separate effects of any such influence cannot be isolated and assessed from available statistics. </para>

              <para>The question of the extent of parallel scheduling over the Australian domestic network was extensively examined during the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review (DATPR). The Committee undertaking the Review concluded that the level of parallel scheduling was higher than desirable but agreed with the conclusion of one of its consultants that deparalleling of schedules must not be pursued as an end in itself but would have to be weighed very carefully against the effects which it might have on airline efficiency and against the cost of data collection and analysis machinery. The Committee considered a number of methods of reducing the incidence of parallel scheduling and concluded that Government directed self regulation by the Airlines, through extended rationalisation held the greatest prospects for improving the situation. Following the release of the Report the matter was raised with Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and Trans-Australian Airlines. I have since been advised that a joint working group has been established by the Airlines to devise schedules which reduce the incidence of parallel flights. Recent moves taken in regard to separated schedules on the Sydney-Canberra-Melbourne routes are considered only as a first step in this regard. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) In 1976, the Victorian Government changed the arrangements for the payment of the employers' contributions to the Victorian State Superannuation Fund in respect of staff in constituent colleges of the State College of Victoria system. Prior to the change, the employers' contributions made by the colleges from their recurrent grants were paid into the Fund at the same time as the employees' contributions, i.e. on a concurrent with service basis. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Under the arrangements which have applied since 1 January 1977, colleges are required to pay the employers' contributions into the Fund at the time that the employees' benefits become payable. This change was applied retrospectively to the inception of the SCV in July 1 973. </para>
          <para>As part of the revised arrangements, the contributions made to the Fund by the colleges from July 1973 to December 1976 are being used by the Victorian Treasury to meet the employers' share of pensions. Current projections indicate that the funds contributed from 1973 to 1976 will be exhausted by 1982-83. </para>
          <para>The Tertiary Education Commission is currently reviewing the various superannuation schemes operating in tertiary institutions in terms of their impact on institutions' recurrent budgets. The particular problems confronting the SCV colleges are being examined in the context of the Commission's review and will be given careful attention when the question of funding for the 1982-84 triennium is being considered. </para>

            <para>The RAAF has been actively pursuing plans for the fitment to its FI 1 1C aircraft of a range of precision guided munitions to more effectively arm Australia's long range Strike Force. </para>
            <para>This planning has been undertaken in concert with the United States Air Force, whose earlier models FI 1 1A and FI 1 IE aircraft were also to be fitted with advanced technology weapons. </para>
            <para>Because the USAF recently terminated its plans for advanced weapons fitment to its FI 1 1A and FI 1 IE models, the RAAF is presently re-examining the options available to fit specific weapons systems to the F 1 1 1 C. </para>
            <para>It is as yet too early to predict with any confidence what the outcome of this re-examination will be, nor at what time it will be practicable to announce a future course of action. </para>
            <para>There are, of course, the already announced modifications, e.g., reconnaissance pack and radar warning system which of themselves contribute substantially to the effectiveness of the F 1 1 1 strike force. </para>

              <para>1 indicated in my answer to Senate Question No. 1 953 <inline font-style="italic">(Hansard,</inline> 16 October 1979, page 1376) that the Australian National Line is unable to provide the information sought by the honourable senator. From the moment the cancellation of voyages was made known large numbers of passengers made alternative arrangements including transfer to other voyages, travel by air, deferment or cancellation. Each of these transactions resulted in the original booking being cancelled through the computer and this information is irrecoverable. </para>

              <para>Assistance, as indicated in my previous reply, was offered to all passengers. No special arrangements were made for any specific category of passenger. Pensioners opting to travel by air were faced with additional cost principally because domestic airlines do not offer pensioner concessions. The Line is always prepared to treat sympathetically any individual case of particular hardship and has assisted in this way on several occasions in the past but no such incident was brought to its attention on this occasion. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources aware that extraction costs of uranium in Australia are lower than those of most of our known resources? For example, it is said that at $30 per lb we have 23 per cent of the world's reserves, but that at $30 per lb our share drops to 8 per cent and at $100 per lb our share is almost negligible because uranium can be extracted from the sea for less. As the price of the fuel plays an important part in whether nations turn to the use of dangerous plutonium, will the Minister agree that this nation has a responsibility to supply the world with uranium at a reasonable price to ensure that the use of breeder reactors is kept to a minimum? </para>
